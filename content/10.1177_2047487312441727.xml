<sec id="sec1-2047487312441727" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction and background</title>
<p>Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to decrease the adverse pathological and psychological consequences of acute cardiac events and to prevent recurrences. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines multidisciplinary CR (MDCR) as ‘the sum of activities required to influence favourably the underlying cause of the disease, as well as to ensure the patients best possible physical, mental and social conditions so that they may, by their own efforts, preserve, or resume when lost, as normal a place as possible in the life of the community’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487312441727">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The European Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation recently defined the services provided as a part of CR as patient assessment, physical activity counselling, exercise training, diet/nutritional counselling, weight control management, lipid management, blood pressure monitoring, smoking cessation, and psychosocial management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2047487312441727">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Belgian health authorities further stipulate the disciplines that have to take part to the multidisciplinary treatment (even though each session does not need to be multidisciplinary).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2047487312441727">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2047487312441727">4</xref></sup> In Belgium (10,839,905 inhabitants, 1 January 2010), 36 centres are officially authorized for providing MDCR reimbursed by the National Health Insurance system. Patients are eligible for MDCR if they have been hospitalized for one of the following conditions: acute myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), heart (lung) transplant, and heart failure.</p>
<p>An additional eligibility criterion is a multidisciplinary evaluation within the first 15 days of the hospitalization, under the supervision of a physician specialized in CR. Moreover eligible patients should have had at least one session during hospitalization in order to have the outpatient MDCR sessions reimbursed. MDCR sessions in hospital are provided individually to the patients with a reimbursement of up to 30 sessions. At the time this research was performed (2010) the honorary fee per inpatient MDCR session was €43.09 of which €10.89 was the out-of-pocket expense for a patient entitled to increased reimbursement and €12.6 for a patient with regular reimbursement. Outpatient MDCR sessions are group sessions: they have a minimal duration of 60 minutes with a reimbursement of up to 45 sessions. The honorary fee for an outpatient session was €31.04. Out-of-pocket expenses were €7.7 and €8.98 for patients entitled to increased reimbursement and regular reimbursement respectively. Patients who are not eligible, or do not opt for MDCR after a cardiac event, have a usual medical follow-up combined or not with monodisciplinary CR (under supervision of a physiotherapist or of a specialist in rehabilitation medicine). This research has been triggered by concerns regarding the service provision and accessibility of MDCR in Belgium. A report from the Ministry of Public Health’s Working Group on Rehabilitation in 2004 estimated that only 15‐30% of patients for whom MDCR may be beneficial benefit from this treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2047487312441727">5</xref></sup> In the same way, two surveys carried out in European countries (in the late 1990s and in 2009) concluded that fewer than half of the eligible patients participate in MDCR programmes in most countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2047487312441727">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2047487312441727">7</xref></sup> For Belgium, the 2009 study (from the CR section of the European Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation) estimated the proportion of patients participating in the early post-discharge programme (phase II) and in the long-term maintenance programme (phase III) to be 15-20% and 5%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2047487312441727">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>This research, as part of a larger project, was commissioned by the Belgian health authorities in order to provide evidence-based indications for CR and different forms of care and to inform the authorities on the actual situation of accessibility of CR, possible explanations for inequalities, and possible solutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2047487312441727">8</xref></sup> The purpose of this part of the investigation was to measure the uptake of outpatient MDCR in Belgium and to identify patient-related factors influencing this utilization.</p>

<sec id="sec2-2047487312441727" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-2047487312441727"><title>Data source</title>
<p>The data source for this analysis was the database provided by the Common Sickness Funds Agency (IMA/AMI), hereafter called the IMA database. This administrative-claims database contains detailed information on all reimbursed pharmaceutical products, medical acts, diagnostic tests, treatments, and consultations on a patient level, both in hospital and in ambulatory settings, and related costs from both the public healthcare payer’s perspective (RIZIV/INAMI) and patient perspective. Socio-demographic data, such as date of birth, gender, place of residence, date of death if applicable, eligibility for increased reimbursement (disadvantaged population groups), and employment status are also recorded. All data were available from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2008.</p>
<p>The area of residence was further used as a proxy to assess the approximate income and education level of the patient. The variable (called statistical sector) is based on the results of the 2001 National Socio-Economic Survey (education level) and on the 2005 national fiscal data (income). Quintiles 1 and 5 of the statistical income and education sectors represent, respectively, the lowest and highest quintiles in terms of income and education levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-2047487312441727"><title>Population</title>
<p>The target population consisted of patients who had had either heart surgery (valve repair or replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or a combination of both) or a PCI during the year 2007. The following categories of patients were excluded: (1) patients who died during the calendar month of the cardiac procedure or during the consecutive month; (2) other patient groups eligible for reimbursed MDCR in Belgium but who did not undergo any invasive procedure (e.g. acute myocardial infarction, heart failure) since these were not readily identifiable in the IMA database, which contains no diagnosis; and (3) MDCR after heart-lung transplantation or surgery for congenital malformations, since these were considered too specific to be compared to MDCR following other types of surgery or after PCI.</p>
<p>For each patient, claims data over a 1-year period following their hospital admission was available. Patients were classified into three mutually exclusive groups:
<list id="list1-2047487312441727" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>outpatient MDCR group, if they had at least one session of MDCR after hospital discharge;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>outpatient physiotherapy with or without medical supervision group, if they did not belong to the outpatient MDCR group and had at least one outpatient session of physiotherapy within a timeframe of 30 days after the cardiac intervention; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>no outpatient MDCR nor physiotherapy group, if they did not have any rehabilitation session.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-2047487312441727"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics of patient demographics and their utilization of MDCR were presented for PCI and for surgery patients. For the analysis of rehabilitation-related costs, only direct medical costs were considered from the public healthcare payer’s perspective (RIZIV/INAMI) and from the patient’s perspective. Only the cost of rehabilitation episode following the cardiac intervention was taken into consideration. If the time interval between two consecutive rehabilitation sessions exceeded 30 days, the rehabilitation episode was considered as finalized at the date of the first session of this &gt;30 days interval.</p>
<p>For each group, a multivariate logistic regression model was built to identify factors associated with the utilization of outpatient MDCR during the observation period. The dependent variable was ‘having had at least one outpatient session of MDCR’ and the independent variables were: gender, age (30–54, 55–64, 65–74, ≥75), employment status (disabled, pensioners or pre-retired, self-employed, workers, unemployed), co-payment category (being entitled to increased reimbursement or not), presence of an officially authorized CR centre in the <italic>arrondissement</italic> of patient’s residence, education quintile, and income quintile. All variables were included in the models, so that results could be compared between the two groups of patients. Odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals (CI), and <italic>p</italic>-values of these independent variables are presented.</p>
<p>All analyses were performed with SAS Enterprise Guide version 4.1.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-2047487312441727" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Based on the target population inclusion/exclusion criteria, 29,021 patients were selected from the database. Of these, 34.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 9911) underwent cardiac surgery and 65.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 19,110) were hospitalized for PCI in the calendar year 2007.</p>
<sec id="sec7-2047487312441727" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient demographics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2047487312441727">Table 1</xref> gives an overview of the characteristics of the patient population for both groups. Most patients were male (71.3% for PCI, 69.2% for surgery). More than half were over 65 years old, with around 30% of them older than 75 years at the time of the cardiac procedure. The majority of patients were (pre-)retired (pre-retired is an early retirement due to economic, personal, or medical reasons) (66.8% for PCI, 75.7% for surgery). Less than 30% of patients were entitled to increased reimbursement and 26% of patients lived in an <italic>arrondissement</italic> without an authorized centre. More than 40% of patients lived in a low-education or low-income neighbourhood (quintiles 1 and 2). Patients were evenly spread with respect to education level of the neighbourhood they lived in with the exception of the highest education level, which was less represented (13.8% PCI, 15.3% surgery). The same pattern occurs for the income level: patients were evenly spread over the quintiles, except for the highest quintile (12.3% PCI, 12.8% surgery)

<p>During the index hospital stay (stay during which the revascularization or valve surgery was performed), 44% of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 12,731) had at least one MDCR session. One-third of patients (32%, <italic>n</italic> = 9369) did not receive any rehabilitation session of any kind after revascularization or valve surgery, neither inpatient nor outpatient.</p>
<p>The analysis on the duration of rehabilitation (inpatient and outpatient) was performed irrespective of the type of rehabilitation (either MDCR or physiotherapy). Only patients having at least one session of MDCR or physiotherapy were considered for this analysis (19,662 patients out of the total of 29,021 patients). The duration of the rehabilitation episode (inpatient and outpatient) was on average 2 months. This duration was much shorter for patients who underwent a PCI (median 14 days) than for patients who underwent surgery (median 48 days). MDCR represented 39% of all sessions of cardiac rehabilitation, physiotherapy with medical supervision of a specialist in rehabilitation medicine represented 9%, and physiotherapy without medical supervision 52%. Patients having MDCR received on average 14.3 sessions of this type and half of them received up to eight sessions. Approximately 10% of patients only received one session of MDCR.</p>

<p>Following PCI, female patients were less likely to attend outpatient MDCR compared to male patients (9.3 vs. 15.9%, OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.87; reduction in participation of 22%). This difference between sexes was even more pronounced in surgery patients (12.8 vs. 21.7%, OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.81; reduced participation rate of 29%).</p>
<p>Increasing age was also a factor reducing the inclusion rate of outpatient MDCR. After PCI or surgery, patients aged ≥75 were &gt;80% less likely to attend outpatient MDCR than patients aged between 35 and 54.</p>
<p>The employment and global health status of the patient were also influencing factors. After PCI, disabled, unemployed, and self-employed patients had respectively 27, 46 and 33% lower participation rates for outpatient MDCR than workers. After surgery, the uptake was also lower (33 and 49% for disabled, and unemployed, respectively) compared to workers. Patients entitled to increased reimbursement (proxy for a lower socioeconomic status) had a 34% reduction in participation in outpatient MDCR after PCI compared to patients not entitled to increased reimbursement (7.9 vs. 16.3%). After surgery, it was 40% (10.5 vs. 22.0%) lower.</p>
<p>The absence of an authorized MDCR in the neighbourhood of the patient’s residence reduced the inclusion rate of outpatient MDCR by more than half for both patient groups compared to patients residing a neighbourhood with an authorized MDCR centre. In regions without rehabilitation centres, the proportion of patients having outpatient MDCR was less than 5%.</p>
<p>Education level also had an effect. Patients living in statistical sectors with more highly educated persons (quintile 5) had a higher participation rate of outpatient MDCR compared to patients residing in areas with less highly educated persons. This appeared to be the case after PCI (30% increase) and after surgery (68% increase).</p>
<p>Finally, the level of income also influenced the uptake of outpatient MDCR. The higher the average income level of the statistical sector where the patient lived (used as a proxy for patient’s income), the higher was the uptake of outpatient MDCR.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-2047487312441727" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>These findings show that about one-third of patients do not receive any rehabilitation session during the year following revascularization or valve surgery. This proportion increases to more than half of the patients (55%) when only outpatient care is considered. This suggests a problem of transmural continuity of care from inpatient to outpatient rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The strength of this study is the analysis of a large population with a homogeneous cardiac profile, based on accurate administrative data. The dataset used in this analysis is the basis of the Belgian reimbursement system and can be considered as quasi complete.</p>
<p>Moreover, it gives an insight into a crucial point of the rehabilitation treatment, i.e. when the patient returns home. This period is of particular significance because it determines the long-term compliance of the patient. On the other hand, the outpatient rehabilitation pattern is strongly influenced by factors of healthcare organization and accessibility of the services. The reasons for this low compliance have been analysed and will be published in another paper.</p>
<p>The lack of accurate socioeconomic data in the dataset required the use of area level averages for education and income variables and is a limitation of this study.</p>
<p>The data source used for the analysis includes nomenclature codes (used for invoicing). MDCR has specific nomenclature codes, for inpatient and outpatient, and provides reliable data for this type of rehabilitation. Regarding other types of rehabilitation on the basis of nomenclature codes, no distinction can be made whether ‘only exercise’ therapy is part of ‘physiotherapy’; moreover, ‘physiotherapy’ can be related to another pathology occurring in parallel with the cardiac event; therefore, it is recognized as a limitation of this analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec13-2047487312441727"><title>Influence of gender</title>
<p>In this study, women are less likely than men to receive multidisciplinary CR after either PCI or surgery. Differences in attendance were also observed in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2047487312441727">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2047487312441727">10</xref></sup> Grace et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2047487312441727">10</xref></sup> identified barriers that are more common among women than among men, e.g. transportation, family responsibilities, lack of CR awareness, experiencing exercise as tiring or painful, and comorbidities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-2047487312441727"><title>Influence of age</title>
<p>The multivariate analysis showed that older patients have a lower participation rate. Other studies also support this finding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2047487312441727">9</xref>,</sup><sup>11</sup><sup>–</sup><sup>13</sup> Tolmie et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2047487312441727">14</xref></sup> analysed the illness representation and CR perception of a small group of elderly patients.

</sec>
<sec id="sec15-2047487312441727"><title>Influence of employment, education, and income status</title>
<p>Our study points out that patients who are disabled or unemployed have a lower chance of receiving MDCR compared to workers. This confirms a literature review by Witt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2047487312441727">15</xref></sup> that unemployment, together with less education and lower socioeconomic status, are associated with a reduction in participating in CR programmes.</p>
<p>The association between income level, education, and uptake of MDCR found in this study also confirms the results of the literature, i.e. that higher income<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2047487312441727">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2047487312441727">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2047487312441727">17</xref></sup> and higher education<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2047487312441727">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2047487312441727">18</xref></sup> have a positive impact on the probability of receiving MDCR. In the same way, patients entitled to increased reimbursement (i.e. a marker of socioeconomic difficulties) had a lower chance of participating in CR programmes. This research revealed high out-of-pocket expenses even for patients entitled to increased reimbursement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-2047487312441727"><title>Influence of the distance to a rehabilitation centre</title>
<p>This analysis highlights the importance of accessibility in the uptake of MDCR: patients have a higher chance of attending outpatient MDCR if they live in an <italic>arrondissement</italic> that harbours an officially authorized MDCR centre. Higgins et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2047487312441727">19</xref></sup> compared the characteristics of patients attending CR after CABG with those not attending CR. They found that the travel time to the CR (in minutes) was significantly lower for patients who attended a CR programme than for the patients who did not attend. Other studies mention the distance and the travel time as obstacles for attending CR programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2047487312441727">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2047487312441727">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2047487312441727">17</xref></sup> This is especially an issue for patients living in rural areas: easy access to transport and lack of parking facilities at CR centres and to a lesser extent family support and work flexibility were the main determinants of the attendance at CR programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2047487312441727">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2047487312441727">21</xref></sup> Driving restriction for cardiac patients may also reduce the non‐participation rate. Grace et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2047487312441727">18</xref></sup> concluded that apart from the distance, greater strength of physician endorsement, being married, and fewer perceived CR barriers are factors affecting CR enrolment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-2047487312441727"><title>Limits in the comparison between this study and the data from the literature</title>
<p>A few additional points have to be mentioned when comparing the results of the literature with the results of our research. The studies on accessibility of CR usually do not specify its components, whilst the regression analyses of this study specifically focused on MDCR. Moreover, only outpatient MDCR was taken into consideration when determining influencing factors in the logistic regression. This may also lead to differences with the findings in the literature that frequently encompasses inpatient CR. Finally, the patient population in the literature is heterogeneous (e.g. inclusion of patients having coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction) whereas only patients with revascularization (PCI or CABG) or valve surgery were included in our analysis.</p>
<p>The literature mentions other factors that could not be analysed in this study on administrative data. The administrative rules and healthcare organization have an impact on the patient’s compliance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2047487312441727">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2047487312441727">23</xref></sup> Some authors also concluded that the positive perception of the physician regarding the effectiveness of the CR has a crucial effect on the referral.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2047487312441727">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2047487312441727">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2047487312441727">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2047487312441727">25</xref></sup> Last but not least, an essential factor is the patient’s perception of his/her illness and of the rehabilitation programme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2047487312441727">16</xref></sup> Redfern et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2047487312441727">26</xref></sup> concluded that the patients not enrolling in a CR programme had a more adverse risk-factor profile and a poorer knowledge of risk factors. French et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2047487312441727">27</xref></sup> found out that MI patients who are symptomatic and consider their condition severe and controllable are more likely to attend the rehabilitation programme.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-2047487312441727"><title>Implications for clinical practice</title>
<p>These findings have different implications at patients, clinician, and healthcare system levels. First, they point out the importance of raising patients’ consciousness on the consequences of their illness and the benefits of CR on health outcomes and quality of life. The study shows that some patient groups should be targeted as priority, i.e. women, elderly, disabled, and unemployed patients as well as patients with a low socioeconomic status. Recently, in Belgium, the high out-of-pocket expenses for patients have been reduced, from €12.6 (inpatient session) and €8.98 (outpatient session) to €4.38 and €3.16 for patients with regular reimbursement and from €10.89 (inpatient) and €7.79 (outpatient) to €2.19 and €1.58 for patients entitled to increased reimbursement. Second, the motivation of the patient requires a strong collaboration between the specialist and the general practitioner who will follow the patient when he returns home. It is important to raise GPs’ awareness on the importance of exercise adapted to the individual cardiac patient. Physicians should systematically investigate the reasons for non-compliance or refusal and try to convince the patient to overcome the obstacles identified. Finally, at the healthcare system level, finding innovative solutions is a challenge to solve the problem of accessibility in order to enable all eligible patients to benefit from MDCR, either at home or in specialized centres.</p>
