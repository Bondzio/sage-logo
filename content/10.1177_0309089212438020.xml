<abstract>
<p>This article offers a dialogical examination of 1 Kgs 17–19 that deconstructs traditionally accepted characterizations of Jezebel, Elijah, and the Widow of Zarephath. This study proposes that shifting emphasis from Elijah and Jezebel as polar opposites to a literary <italic>ménage à trois</italic> that involves all three characters makes it possible for the holy man to become a stranger and the strange women to become holy. The narrative tensions thus revealed question the validity of Israel's definitive identity markers. When reading the stories of Jezebel, Elijah, and the Widow of Zarephath in the Deuteronomistic History, clear-cut distinctions between ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ continually collapse.</p>

<p>The contest of wills between Elijah and Jezebel is the driving force behind the plot of 1 Kings 17–19. Jezebel and Elijah are antagonists who embody the polarities that undergird much of the Hebrew Bible and most particularly the Deuteronomistic History (DH):<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089212438020">1</xref></sup> foreigner/legitimate resident, clean/unclean, faithful/idolatrous, God/gods, holy/profane, male/ female. The biblical narrative binds these two figures together, even as it seeks to cast them as opposites. Phyllis Trible calls this pairing an ‘odd couple’, for as often as they stand on two different sides of a cultural and religious divide, both parties ‘manipulate, scheme, and murder’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089212438020">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following feminist interpreters who have sought to reveal the complexities underlying the depiction of biblical women, the present study seeks to explore further the Elijah/Jezebel relationship with the addition of a third party, the Widow of Zarephath (1 Kgs 17.8–34). By creating a literary <italic>ménage à trois</italic> I will show how the portrayal of each of these characters enhances and at times subverts the characterization of the others. This exploration will use a dialogic methodology and a feminist hermeneutic to undermine the oppositions that traditionally define all three characters. Even as the biblical writers seek to establish their own notions of Israel's national and religious identity, the texts they produce expose revised and contradictory understandings. In this way, the narrative presentation of Jezebel, Elijah, and the Widow of Zarephath exemplifies Israel's struggle to define its own identity and the identity of those who it might perceive as threats to its wellbeing.</p>
<sec id="section1-0309089212438020">
<title>Narrative Background</title>
<p>In the portion of the DH found in 1 Kgs 16.29 to 2 Kings 9 readers encounter Ahab, king of Israel, ruling in the capital of Samaria; Jezebel, the foreign princess who marries Ahab; and Elijah, the prophet of Y<sc>hwh</sc> to the nation Israel. The text's depiction of these characters is archetypal. Ahab is the bumbling and melancholy king who cannot seem to accomplish his royal will. His disobedience to Y<sc>hwh</sc> continues the pattern of his forbears, though his insolence surpasses them all. Jezebel is the interloper from neighboring Sidon who fills the power vacuum left by Ahab's impotence. She promotes worship of her national deities, calling into question Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s status as the one true god of Israel. As a non-Israelite woman she threatens the purity of Israel by her very presence.</p>
<p>Though Ahab is king, the tension that drives the plot develops between Jezebel and Elijah. The native Israelite male prophet and the foreign-born female ruler clash over their culturally distinct religious fidelities. This conflict manifests itself in concrete environmental terms. When Elijah makes his entrance, he pronounces Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s intention to inflict a drought on Israel. At stake, then, are the productivity of the land and the well-being of its people. Framing the rivalry between Elijah and Jezebel is the question: Who controls the fruitfulness of the soil? Is it Y<sc>hwh</sc> of Israel or Baal and Asherah of Sidon? Which deity(ies) represent(s) life for Israel? Which deity(ies) will lead Israel to its downfall?</p>
<p>The story unfolds according to a winner-takes-all ideology. Elijah handily defeats the foreign prophets, Ahab dies in battle, and leaders of a coup throw Jezebel from her palace window. Dogs partake of her royal remains as Elijah predicted (1 Kgs 21.24). The judgment of this narrative voice appears at first glace absolute. Elijah is in the right; Jezebel is in the wrong. Elijah is the lone remaining witness to Y<sc>hwh</sc>. He is the true Israelite, willing to defy the monarchy to prove that Y<sc>hwh</sc> solely has the capacity to provide for Israel. Jezebel represents the lure of other divine powers. Her refusal to recognize Y<sc>hwh</sc> alone as god is cast as an act of infidelity, often depicted in the biblical narrative in the language of sexual impropriety. Shortly before her death she is accused of harlotry and witchcraft (2 Kgs 9.22). Her foreign origin, her practices of foreign worship, her gender, and her exercise of power intertwine to form a matrix of negative connotations. Jezebel is the ‘other’ who penetrates Israel's nucleus of governance, threatening to usurp its identity by proposing that her way might be the better way.</p>
<p>However, closer examination of the Elijah/Jezebel cycle divulges a perplexing number of conflicting impulses in this narrative. A detailed reading of the language and symbolic inferences throughout these chapters in Kings suggests that the text bears witness to an ancient struggle regarding Israelite identity. Below the surface these stories raise questions regarding the ‘insider’ and ‘outsider’ status of characters and how they function in Israel's self-understanding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089212438020">3</xref></sup> Regina Schwartz articulates this dynamic as follows: ‘The answers to these questions are not located in the realm of doctrine; instead, they are the work of narratives that are so messy and contradictory that the categories themselves, “foreigner” and “Israelite” continually dissolve’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089212438020">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>By bringing together these two women of Sidon and the prophet of Israel I hope to provide an alternative lens for viewing the important confrontation between Jezebel and Elijah. The Widow of Zarephath, a minor character who appears in only one chapter, provides a different angle from which to view the larger narrative. As Uriel Simon describes it, minor characters ‘have a definite expressive role—the indirect characterization of the protagonist and the implied evaluation of his or her deeds’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089212438020">5</xref></sup> He contends that this assessment of the protagonist occurs through a process of ‘comparison and contrast’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089212438020">6</xref></sup> The introduction of the Widow of Zarephath provides an opportunity to re-evaluate Elijah and Jezebel, as well as the Widow's presumed function in the story. Through a reframed process of comparison and contrast, the text's presentation of foreign women becomes more complex, pro- Y<sc>hwh</sc> and anti- Y<sc>hwh</sc> stances are muddled, and Elijah's own status as an Israelite ‘insider’ comes under scrutiny. What is normally holy becomes strange and what is strange becomes holy.</p>
<p>By rereading what interpreters have historically simplified, the resulting portrait allows these characters to switch roles within the narrative. The possibility that the prophet himself hails from dubious origins and may be an immigrant to Israel from another nation becomes possible. The appearance of an unusual Hebrew word sheds doubt on the assertion that the Widow of Zarephath is really a ‘good’ foreign woman. Reading the foreign women as holy challenges the notion that outsiders cannot be conduits for the divine will. By examining these foreigners' interactions with Elijah, I will show that these women are significant in Elijah's formation as a prophet and in his ability to fulfill his mission. The Widow of Zarephath and Jezebel question and prompt; they provide for and invigorate Elijah's ministry. These foreign women are catalysts for sacred encounters with the divine. In sum, estranging Elijah and sacralizing Jezebel and the Widow of Zarephath shifts readers' expectations and recasts an age-old story.</p>

<title>Issues of Methodology</title>
<p>In <italic>Wise, Strange, and Holy: The Strange Woman and the Making of the Hebrew Bible</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089212438020">7</xref></sup> Claudia Camp contends that the two figures of the Strange Woman and Woman Wisdom described in Proverbs 1–9 do not necessarily need to be viewed as polarized figures, as is typically the case. Commentators have traditionally stressed the oppositions between these two personas. Woman Wisdom leads to spiritual and material wellbeing (Prov. 8); the Strange Woman bids spiritual and material ruin (Prov. 5). Woman Wisdom represents life (Prov. 3.18; 8.33); the Strange Woman harbors only death (Prov. 2.18; 9.18). Woman Wisdom is a faithful sexual companion (Prov. 5.13); the Strange Woman insatiably seeks multiple partners (Prov. 7). However, upon closer inspection, the Strange Woman and Woman Wisdom seem to share some common qualities: both wander the streets seeking those who will give their attention (Prov. 1.20–21; 7.12), both offer tempting food to their invited guests (Prov. 9), and both are potential objects of sexual desire (Prov. 7.4, 18).</p>
<p>Camp argues that the seeming duality between the Strange Woman and Woman Wisdom set forth in Proverbs 1–9 actually hints at a much more complex moral universe. The wisdom writers seek to make sense of their day-to-day encounters with good and evil through this paradigm. Without some explication of chaos, order has no real meaning. Life includes both dimensions. The personas of Woman Wisdom and the Strange Woman are not diametrically opposed, as would seem to be the case at first glance, but rather represent complementary aspects of human experience. One necessitates the other. They are not two separate entities, but rather two sides of the same coin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089212438020">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>For my effort, I will apply Camp's vision of the subverted binary found in Woman Wisdom/Strange Woman to Jezebel and the Widow of Zarephath. In this way, I propose a reading strategy that looks at the two personas not as polar opposites of one another, the bad and the good foreign woman, but as Janus-faced, one woman gazing in two directions. By re-uniting figures interpreters usually divide, I seek to highlight the struggle for Israelite identity in 1 Kings 17–19. Explicitly, Israelite identity is usually constituted through a process of defining ‘us’ and ‘them’. Elijah believes in Y<sc>hwh</sc>; Jezebel serves Baal and Asherah. The Widow of Zarephath is acceptable because she shelters Elijah and recognizes the validity of his god. Implicitly, just below the surface of the text, is the possibility that Israelite identity in this particular cycle of stories cannot be so easily parsed.</p>

<sec id="section3-0309089212438020">
<title>Methodology: A Dialogical Reading</title>
<p>The Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin developed the strategy termed dialogical reading to describe a kind of textual ethos he first recognized in the works of Dostoevsky.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089212438020">9</xref></sup> Later literary theorists and biblical scholars employ Bakhtin's work as a means of identifying certain structural patterns in texts and orienting themselves as readers. Bakhtin's methodology involves identifying the dialogical nature of certain writing, which involves at least two distinct textual voices existing side by side within a text where one does not seek to subsume the other. These voices are dynamic. They exist in relationship to one another and cannot be understood apart from each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089212438020">10</xref></sup> Carol Newsom describes dialogism as the ‘paradigm of conversation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089212438020">11</xref></sup> A dialogical work is one that contains multiple strands of discourse and meaning in an on-going conversation. Whereas a monologic text or approach would seek unity and conformity, a dialogic text or approach desires plurality and heterodoxy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089212438020">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a dialogical work, characters reflect the dynamic personality of the text they inhabit. Characters are polyphonic, they take on a life of their own in consultation with the author. Of course, the personality of the author will be present in the characters, but the author's vision for a character need not be absolutely determinative. Polyphonic characters maintain their own integrity; they are not only products of the ideas they espouse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089212438020">13</xref></sup> The interactive nature of polyphonic characterization is possible, in part, because such literature requires that authors empathize with their characters, relating simultaneously as involved insiders and estranged outsiders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089212438020">14</xref></sup> Polyphonic compositions also necessitate involvement on the part of the reader. In order for the system to operate fully, ‘polyphonic writing requires polyphonic reading’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089212438020">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Biblical authors excitedly yet cautiously incorporate dialogism into their work. Newsom emphasizes that the Bible certainly is not a polyphonic text in the same way that Bakhtin understands Dostoevsky's work to be.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089212438020">16</xref></sup> No individual author composed the Bible with a dialogical intent. However, the Bible does lend itself to a dialogical methodology precisely because its plethora of voices and perspectives clash, startle, and create cognitive dissonance for readers. Scholars such as Robert Polzin have successfully utilized a dialogical methodology to analyze conflicting impulses within the biblical text.</p>
<p>In interpreting the Moses traditions, Polzin remarks that this sort of reading strategy ‘may reveal a hidden dialogue between competing voices within the various utterances of God both in themselves and as interpreted by the Deuteronomic narrator’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089212438020">17</xref></sup> Biblical dialogical reading analyzes character speech, divine speech, and the dialogue of the narrator in order to understand better potential ‘hidden dialogues’ and their significance for biblical hermeneutics. Similarly, the present study stands on the shoulders of Bakhtin and the biblical scholars who have engaged his work, proposing a dialogical reading of 1 Kings 17–19 and a polyphonic approach to the characters of Jezebel, Elijah, and the Widow of Zarephath. This kind of reading strategy enables varied hermeneutical possibilities for these characters and accentuates Israel's own conflictual relationship with its identity.</p>

<title>Jezebel: Foreign Women Signal Downfall</title>
<p>Of the three central characters discussed in the present study—Elijah, Jezebel, and the Widow of Zarephath—Jezebel appears first on the scene. Her introduction follows that of her husband, Ahab. Ahab comes in a long line of kings who did evil in Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s sight, although the narrator gives Ahab the distinction of being even more evil than his predecessors (1 Kgs 16.30). Jezebel's entry carries this thought forward, ‘As if it were a trifling thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, he took as a wife Jezebel daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and bowed down to him’ (1 Kgs 16.31). The narrative goes on to describe the house of worship that Ahab built for Baal and also the Asherah that he made, explaining, 'Ahab did more to rouse the anger of Y<sc>hwh</sc>, the God of Israel than all the kings of Israel who were before him' (2 Kgs 16.33).</p>
<p>In a brief number of statements the narrative establishes that Ahab not only strayed from Y<sc>hwh</sc>, but that he further aggravated the situation by marrying a woman from outside of Israel. Furthermore, the narrative establishes that Ahab's marriage is inextricably linked to his recognition of foreign gods, gods that were, in fact, not foreign to his consort. From the very moment we first encounter Jezebel her foreignness becomes suspect. Her presence confirms, if not assures, Ahab's religious devotion to foreign deities.</p>
<p>What may have been an astute political move politically speaking becomes a theological nightmare for the Deuteronomists. The writers/editors who shaped the undergirding theology that drives the DH understood foreign women to represent all that was wrong with Israelite kings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089212438020">18</xref></sup> According to this view, foreign interlopers, and particularly foreign wives of Israelite husbands, polluted Israelite faith and served as a catalyst for Israel's ultimate collapse. Thus, Jezebel's entrance is not simply a maligning mark on Ahab's record. Her appearance is reminiscent of a number of other places in the biblical narrative in which foreign women lead Israelite men away from their god.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089212438020">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Num. 25.1–3 Israelite men begin to worship the gods of Moab after becoming involved with Moabite women. Shortly afterwards, a zealous Israelite slaughters one particular man along with his Midianite wife for the crime of bringing this perceived foreigner into his family (Num. 25.6–8).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089212438020">20</xref></sup> In 1 Kings 11 Solomon's numerous foreign wives turn his heart away from Y<sc>hwh</sc> towards other gods. Solomon begins to build places of worship for all the gods of his wives, angering Y<sc>hwh</sc> (1 Kgs 11.7–9). In Ezra 9–10, the impassioned prayer of this post-exilic leader prompts those Jewish men who have married foreign women during the exilic period to renounce their spouses and children and send them away from Jerusalem. In his public prayer Ezra reminds the people of the commandments against intermarrying with foreigners who worship other gods (9.12–14). Prophetic literature continues this strain of thought. For example, Ezekiel 16 portrays Jerusalem as the child of foreigners, who is loved by Y<sc>hwh</sc> only to ‘play the whore’ by pursuing other partners. Israel's infidelity in matters of faith is personified in the figure of a foreign-born female who, like her mother, gives herself freely to any and all (Ezek. 16.43–44).</p>
<p>In the Bible's symbolic universe, then, a man's involvement with a foreign woman leads him towards idolatry. Sexual relations between Israelite men and foreign women become a metaphorical formula to describe Israel's acceptance of foreign deities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089212438020">21</xref></sup> As expressed in Ezekiel, the fear of the biblical writers seems to be that Israel will so enmesh itself in foreign worship that it will itself become foreign. The issue raised by these examples is a concern for Israel's identity. Thus, when Ahab marries Jezebel he does not merely form a political alliance or ingratiate himself to a neighboring country; for the Deuteronomist, by bringing a foreign woman into the seat of power in Israel, Ahab threatens the very essence of Israelite identity. Israel is afraid of losing its distinctiveness in relationship to its neighbors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089212438020">22</xref></sup> Ironically, the narrative seems to undermine its own efforts to demarcate clearly these differences. According to Schwarz, ‘Apparently, being intent on rejecting the foreigner does not simplify the task of defining him. And not being able to define him makes him difficult to reject … purity is an impossible project.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089212438020">23</xref></sup> As 1 Kings 11–19 unfolds, distinctions between Israelite and foreigner, faithful and unfaithful, hero(ine) and villain, may not be as clearly defined as the Deuteronomist wants them to be.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0309089212438020">
<title>Estranging Elijah</title>
<p>Whereas Jezebel makes a grand entrance onto the stage of the biblical narrative, Elijah's appearance is abrupt (1 Kgs 17.1). Jezebel's introduction includes her royal parentage, her nationality, her relationship to Israel, and her religious affiliation. The narrator seems to focus more on Elijah's function—to deliver Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s message—than his origin and identity. Yet, the narrative's quick introduction may have more to do with an uneasiness about Elijah's identity than a concern to move the plot along.</p>
<p>Elijah is first identified as רעלג יבשתמ יבשתח. The narrator specifies neither Elijah's call to serve Y<sc>hwh</sc> nor his parentage, two elements that often contribute to prophetic introductions. The first word indicates that Elijah is ‘the Tishbite’ (יבשתה), which is not a very revelatory piece of information since the prophet is the only Tishbite in the Bible. The next descriptor, רעלג יבשתמ (‘from among the temporary residents of Gilead’), only adds to the confusion because Elijah is the only biblical character so identified. Scholars have long preferred the <sc>lxx</sc>'s version, Hλıoν ó πρoϕήτης ὁ Θεσβíτης ἑκ θεσβων τῆς Γαλααδ (‘Elijah the prophet, the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead’), which smoothes out the reading so that Elijah is from Tishbe in Gilead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089212438020">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the <sc>lxx</sc>'s rendering may make more logical sense on the surface, it is not without its problems. In the past scholars, preferring the translation of the <sc>lxx</sc>, have found legitimization by identifying Tishbe with a town of a similar sounding name in Tobit, Thisbe, a fictional location in upper Galilee (Tob. 1.1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089212438020">25</xref></sup> This conjecture remains problematic because Gilead and Galilee are two very different geographical locations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089212438020">26</xref></sup> Scholars have wanted to see a connection between these two towns because, in fact, Tishbe is an otherwise unknown location.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089212438020">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reading בשזת as the nominal form of יבשת and rendering this construction ‘from among the temporary residents’, though grammatically correct, does not clarify the issue of Elijah's identity. בשזת appears rarely in the biblical context without being accompanied by the term, רג.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089212438020">28</xref></sup> These two words most often function as a hendiadys, a coupling of terms that results in the expression a single composite idea. The fact that רג is missing in the description of Elijah creates a problem. Furthermore, whether appearing with or without רג, בשזת is not an easily defined term.</p>
<p>As Christiana van Houton points out in her study, רג carries different connotations in the various redactional strains of the Hebrew Bible. In the earlier periods of Israelite history a רג was a non-Israelite who came to reside in Israel as a foreign resident. In these instances בשזת carries a similar meaning, so that the two terms, רג and בשזת, are basically indistinguishable. Later in Israel's history, רג seems to take on a more specified meaning, designating someone who accepts the faith practices of Israel and fulfills legal obligations incumbent on any other member of Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089212438020">29</xref></sup> בשזת retains the meaning consistent with Israel's earlier understanding of both terms רג and בשזת.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0309089212438020">30</xref></sup> A בשזת is someone who has left his or her home of origin and must now depend on the citizens of another nation/group to provide for his or her living.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0309089212438020">31</xref></sup> Reviewing the instances where the legal materials distinguish between רג and בשזת, Diether Kellermann concludes that בשזת denotes someone of foreign status who is not a practitioner of Israelite faith.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0309089212438020">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scholars who have preferred to read בשזת as the nominal form of יבשתמ conjecture that Elijah was a ‘settler’ in Gilead, living away from his family of origin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0309089212438020">33</xref></sup> Scholars seem to be more reticent about examining the possibility that Elijah was, in fact, a foreigner who came to reside in Gilead and then took up Yahwistic faith. They make the case that Israelites are sometimes described as ‘sojourning’, ‘residing as foreign residents’, when they take up residence with a tribe other than that of their birth. In a few instances Israelites are described as dependents of tribes other than their own (Judg. 17.7–9; 19.16; 2 Sam. 4.3; 2 Chron. 15.9). The Hebrew word used in this instance is רזג, which is the verbal counterpart of רג. Scholars making the claim that Elijah is an Israelite residing outside the tribe of his birth rely on the relationship between רג and בשזת. As indicated previously, רג carries a broader range of possible meanings than does בשזת, which may or may not connote a member of Israel who sojourns with another tribe. Furthermore, בשזת is grouped with רג precisely at those moments when foreign residents are the subject. In the one instance where בשזת does appear on its own, it refers to a foreign worker (Lev. 22.10), whom the law forbids from partaking of the sacred offerings.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable, then, that the Hebrew text requires us to at least entertain the possibility that Elijah could function narratively as a foreign settler in Israel. He may have been a foreigner who settled in Gilead and later took up Yahwistic faith or he may have simply been an Israelite who settled with a group of foreign workers in Gilead. I do not seek to establish a historical proposal concerning Elijah's identity, which is dubious regardless of which proposal one chooses, but rather would like to use this textual problem as a literary device that examines Elijah's character as a paradox: the foreigner who zealously condemns other foreigners who do not share his passion for his adopted faith. It seems that this very conjecture has not always been conceivable for scholarship.</p>
<p>The real issue regarding the most accurate translation of יבשמ in biblical scholarship has not been an issue of translation, grammar, or textual meaning so much as it is an issue of theology. Earlier commentators seem to be troubled with the prospect of the Israelite prophet Elijah being born outside of Israel. Thus, commentators chose a translation and an interpretation of 1 Kgs 17.1 that avoided dealing with this possibility.</p>
<p>C.F. Keil's commentaries best encapsulate this theological dilemma. In his earlier work, he argues quite passionately and thoroughly that Elijah was a foreigner and that the phrase רעלג יבשתמ was necessary to account for his origins. In fact, he criticizes Josephus as well as his own contemporaries for their theological short-sightedness in espousing otherwise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0309089212438020">34</xref></sup> In this work, Keil reasons that God uses Elijah's foreignness to shame Israel into repentance. If a foreigner could recognize the God of Israel, should Israel not wholeheartedly accept its God?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0309089212438020">35</xref></sup> Conversely, his later work withdraws his former assertion, ironically on theological grounds. Here he states that it would ‘show a complete misapprehension of the significance of Israel in relation to sacred history and the history of the world’ to claim that the God of Israel would call a non-Israelite as a prophet to Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0309089212438020">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>This shift from his initial interpretation corresponds to the collective theological assumption that was present among his contemporaries. For these scholars, the need for Israel's primacy among the nations outweighed their desire to look at possible ambiguities within the text. These ambiguities posed a potential threat not only to their idea of Israel's identity but also their own image of what Israel should be.</p>

<title>Estrangement in Gilead</title>
<p>Elijah's potential status as a foreigner is not the only aspect of his identity that calls his origin into question. In addition to identifying him as ‘among the temporary residents’ (יבשתםיבשתח), his introduction locates his current place of residence in Gilead (דעלג), which is in the Trans-Jordan, a biblical locale with its own complex narrative history. David Jobling argues that the biblical narratives discussing this region reveal some underlying tension concerning its residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0309089212438020">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Numbers 32 and Josh. 1.12–18; 4.12–13, 22 the narrative recounts how the tribes of Reuben and Gad, as well as part of Manasseh, request permission to build homes and fortified cities in the area of the Trans-Jordan, across the Jordan from where the rest of the tribes will settle in the land that God has promised them. At first Moses accuses these groups of sowing dissention among the tribes and keeping Israel from its God-given promise. Moses reminds the people of other instances when God reacted angrily to such troublemaking, such as the initial foray into Canaan by the Israelite spies (Num. 32.8–15). Rueben and Gad promise Moses that they will not claim their inheritance in the Trans-Jordan until they have helped Israel defeat the peoples of the land and claim their inheritance across the river (Cis-Jordan, Num. 32.25–27). Rueben and Gad state that they will accompany Israel as soon as they make provisions for their families (Num. 32.17). Thus Moses grants three tribes (Gad and Reuben are now accompanied by part of Manasseh) land holdings in the Trans-Jordan after the agreement is formalized (Num. 32.28–42).</p>
<p>The opening chapter of Joshua restates the contract between the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh to aid the Israelites in conquering Canaan. Joshua 4.12–13 confirms that the tribes of the Trans-Jordan keep their promise to the larger body of Israel. Joshua 22.1–9 narrates Joshua's commendation of Rueben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh for fulfilling their duty. Joshua blesses them for their service and sends them back home across the Jordan River.</p>
<p>As the Trans-Jordanian tribes return home they erect an altar on the Cis-Jordan side, much to the chagrin of the other tribes (Josh. 22.10). The Cis-Jordanian tribes respond by preparing for war and sending out emissaries to ascertain exactly what has taken place (Josh. 22.12–13). The Cis-Jordanian tribes view the altar as a sign of rebellion against Y<sc>hwh</sc> (Josh. 22.16–20). The Cis-Jordanian tribes invite the Trans-Jordanian tribes to leave their land holdings and join them across the river if the Trans-Jordan is unclean. As the Trans-Jordanian tribes explain themselves, the narrative reveals that the altar in question is a replica of the altar in the tabernacle and that the Cis-Jordanian tribes are accusing the Trans-Jordanian tribes of inappropriate worship practices (Josh. 22.28–29). The Trans-Jordanian tribes explain that they meant no offense, but only sought to build an altar to serve as a reminder to their children that they are also part of Israel and that there is no enmity between the tribes (is there a note of irony in Josh. 22.26–27?). This answer satisfies the Cis-Jordanian emissaries and they declare the altar of the Trans-Jordanian tribes legitimate (Josh. 22.31–34).</p>
<p>In his assessment of these passages, Jobling demonstrates the narrative dissonance occurring in the stories surrounding the Trans-Jordanian tribes. Moses' angry outburst in Numbers 32 against Rueben and Gad plants a seed in the mind of the reader that the act of settling across the Jordan, though permitted, is certainly not in accordance with Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s design.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0309089212438020">38</xref></sup> Moreover, the suggestion of the Cis-Jordanian emissaries that the Trans-Jordanian tribes may feel that their land is unclean provides a further clue that at least one strand of the narrative remains uncomfortable with Israelites residing across the river.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0309089212438020">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>The very fact the Trans-Jordanian tribes feel that they must cross the Jordan in order to recognize their commitment to Y<sc>hwh</sc> is problematic. If the Trans-Jordanian tribes remain fully Israelite in their ethnic identity and religious fidelity, why would they need to cross the Jordan to affirm that connection? Why would not a monument on their side of the river suffice?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0309089212438020">40</xref></sup> The promise that the Trans-Jordanian tribes will bring their children to see the altar implies an intentional repetition with each new generation of Trans-Jordanian residents, ‘each new generation is born in irregularity, and must renew its connection with Yahweh's land’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0309089212438020">41</xref></sup> The Trans-Jordanian tribes must continually cross the Jordan to legitimate their relationship with Y<sc>hwh</sc>, insinuating that the Trans-Jordanian tribes may not be fully part of Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0309089212438020">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus we meet Elijah from Trans-Jordanian Gilead. He is a prophet with no specific parentage, with no call narrative to legitimate his mission from Y<sc>hwh</sc>, originating from a town that has no record of existence outside of its mention in relationship to him, living in a portion of Israel that is narratively questionable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0309089212438020">43</xref></sup> He may even be a foreign immigrant to Israel, but even this claim remains unclear. The narrative's ambiguous description of him opens the possibility that Elijah may not be an ideal Israelite. Narratively speaking, Elijah is an estranged character, isolated from the legitimacy tradition has accorded him.</p>

<sec id="section7-0309089212438020">
<title>Elijah the Sojourner</title>
<p>This introductory information is not the only evidence that estranges Elijah in the narrative. In 1 Kgs 17.20, when Elijah prays to God about the death of the Widow's son, he describes his stay with his hostess as a ררוגתמ (‘sojourning’), this time employing the verb רוג. This choice of term connects Elijah to those in Israel who find themselves displaced. Elijah is living with a foreign woman in a foreign land. In order to survive he must rely on the hospitality of Jezebel's homeland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0309089212438020">44</xref></sup> He must trust Y<sc>hwh</sc> to provide through the hands of his enemy. He has moved from one locale where his identity is uncertain to an even more precarious situation. Elijah is in strange territory.</p>
<p>Elijah's displaced status establishes a stronger relationship between him and the other characters in the story, the Widow of Zarephath and her fatherless son. The book of Deuteronomy, the legal collection that guides the writing of the DH, often groups the widow (הנלא), orphan/fatherless (םותי),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0309089212438020">45</xref></sup> and foreign resident (רג) together (Deut. 10.18–19; 14.29; 24.17–21; 26.12–13; 27.19) in its legal provisions. This group also appears twice in Psalms (Pss 22.3; 94.6), as well as in the prophetic texts (Jer. 7.6; 22.3; Ezek. 22.7; Mal. 3.5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0309089212438020">46</xref></sup> One who lives as a widow, fatherless, or foreign resident shares the status of ‘living apart from his or her own kin group’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0309089212438020">47</xref></sup> Furthermore, they share a common plight; they are all dependents that survive by virtue of the care of others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0309089212438020">48</xref></sup> Elijah (the alien, the Widow of Zarephath (husbandless, הנלא), and her son (fatherless, םותי), must depend on one another for survival in this story.</p>

<sec id="section8-0309089212438020">
<title>Widow of Zarephath: Mistress of the House</title>
<p>Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s command to Elijah to move to Sidon introduces the final member of the literary <italic>ménage à trois</italic>, the Widow of Zarephath. With this shift in locale Elijah leaves Israel and enters the nation of Jezebel's birth. The narrative at first places the Widow of Zarephath in contradistinction to Jezebel—two Sidonian women: one well fed, the other on the brink of starvation. Sidonian Jezebel who has plenty feeds the prophets of Baal rather than the citizens of Israel. The Sidonian Widow, with no reason to trust and next to nothing of substance, offers the food belonging to herself and her son to the prophet of Y<sc>hwh</sc>. In this construal the women's common nationality creates a parallel and their actions distinguish them. Jezebel, the foreign queen, takes care of her own people at the expense of Israel. The Widow of Zarephath provides hospitality to the foreigner Elijah at potential risk to herself and her son. The narrative constructs Jezebel as bad and the widow as good—clear and simple … at least at first.</p>
<p>One phrase in the narrative alerts readers of a lingering dangerous connection between the two Sidonian women. 1 Kings 17.17 identifies the Widow of Zarephath as the תיכה תלצכ (‘the mistress of the house’). This identifier notably differs from her earlier description as a widow (הנמלא).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0309089212438020">49</xref></sup> The term ‘mistress’, תלצכ, is the feminine construct form of הלצכ, which is the feminine counterpart of the Hebrew word, לצכ meaning ‘master’ or ‘lord’, but is also, conspicuously, the name of the Canaanite deity, Baal, whose prophets Elijah will face in ch. 18. The use of תלצכ as a descriptor for the Widow interjects a reminder that she is a non-Israelite and someone whose ultimate loyalties most likely still reside with her own gods.</p>
<p>The word הלצכ appears in two different types of contexts in the Hebrew Bible. It appears as a place-name for various locales.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0309089212438020">50</xref></sup> It also relates the identity of a woman who has leadership over something or authority in a particular area. This latter meaning leads translators to render it as ‘mistress’, serving as the feminine counterpart of master. הלצכ occurs with this meaning only three times. In addition to its appearance in 1 Kgs 17.17, 2 Sam. 28.7 uses הלצכ to describe the medium of Endor as someone who has the power to converse with the dead. The following verse (v. 9) indicates that such practices are not viewed favorably in Israel. Moreover, in Nah. 3.4 הלצכ occurs in an oracle against Nineveh alongside other terms that associate foreignness with prostitution (םינונז) and sorcery (םיפשכ). Interestingly, Jehu employs both of these latter terms, םינונז and ךשכ in 2 Kgs 9.22 to describe Jezebel's sins to her son, Joram, just prior to murdering both son and mother (2 Kgs 9.21–37). Though the narrative never directly depicts Jezebel as engaging in promiscuous behavior, in this instance the narrative labels Jezebel's allegiance to foreign gods in terms of prostitution and sorcery.</p>
<p>Language in the Hebrew Bible designating foreignness, prostitution, sorcery, and worship of non-Israelite deities form a complex web of identity-markers, where one idea subsumes the other, so much so that the concepts are indistinguishable, one from another. Worshiping foreign deities is semantically linked with prostitution and illegal conjuring. These associations occur so often in the biblical text that when a foreign woman enters the narrative stage, she automatically brings with her these ideas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0309089212438020">51</xref></sup> While the introduction of הלצכ into the Widow of Zarephath story does not automatically imply these other ideas, its association with these charged terms in other biblical contexts raises the question of whether the Deuteronomist intentionally inserted it in this case. While one impulse in the text may suggest that the Widow of Zarephath is an ideal foreign woman who offers hospitality to Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s prophet and is open to his message, a competing voice seems to assert that any strange woman could potentially be every strange woman.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0309089212438020">52</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-0309089212438020">
<title>Complementary Oppositions in Characterizations</title>
<p>While in one way the text divides Jezebel and the Widow, the common thread of estrangement found in both their stories unites them. Examining Jezebel and the Widow alongside each other illumines significant characterizations. They are unified in their foreignness, yet separated by the fact that one acts as Elijah's enemy and the other befriends the prophet. Elijah brings death to both their households.</p>
<p>Following her act of hospitality in the midst of a threat to herself and her son, another threat to the Widow's well-being occurs—the widow's son dies unexpectedly. She poses a caustic question to Elijah in v. 18, ‘What is between you and me, man of God, have you come to me to remind me of my sins and kill my son?’ She raises what is a fundamental problem underlying the entire DH: What is the relationship between sin and punishment? What happens when obedience does not bring about life, but rather ushers in death?</p>
<p>Elijah seems equally troubled by this question and so turns it back on God in v. 20. Elijah petitions, 'Y<sc>hwh</sc>, my God, why have you brought evil upon this widow with whom I am sojourning, killing her son?' Elijah does not speak of some unnamed sin the woman may have committed, but instead charges God with responsibility for the death. He reminds God of the Widow's hospitality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0309089212438020">53</xref></sup> This moment of prayer for resurrection is a pivotal moment for the prophet. The Widow challenges Elijah's powers and his calling with her question. She asks whether he really is who he says he is. The fact that Elijah succeeds in reviving her son is a confirmation of both Elijah's mission and the power of Y<sc>hwh</sc>. Yet, her question still lingers, for it is never completely answered. Y<sc>hwh</sc> raises the widow's son, proving divine power over death, but the cause of death remains a mystery. In the Widow's mouth we find the theological dilemma troubling the whole DH. Her question—‘What is there between you and me’—might as well be Israel's question to God. The precarious balance between God's mercy and God's judgment haunts the Deuteronomistic author.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0309089212438020">54</xref></sup> Will God be gracious and continue to forgive? Or can Israel go so far as to exceed the limits of God's protection?</p>
<p>Jezebel also raises questions central to Elijah's calling. Jezebel is not present for Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s defeat of Baal on Mount Carmel and Elijah's subsequent murder of Baal's prophets (1 Kgs 18.17–46). Ahab informs her of what happens after the fact (1 Kgs 19.1). In response, she swears an oath and sends its contents to Elijah, which in Hebrew reads, ‘So may the gods do to me and even more if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like the life of one of them’ (1 Kgs 19.2). This oath is not so different from the one that Elijah makes at the beginning of his tenure as prophet to Ahab, 'By the living Y<sc>hwh</sc>, God of Israel, before whom I stand, there will come no dew or rain these years except by the word of my mouth' (1 Kgs 17.1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0309089212438020">55</xref></sup> Elijah initiates his prophetic work with an oath and Jezebel promises the end of that work with a similar oath to her deities. Elijah invokes the living God and Jezebel marks the life of Elijah. Elijah speaks by the authority of Y<sc>hwh</sc> and Jezebel swears by the more generic term םיהלא (‘gods’), invoking the Baalistic oath formula.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0309089212438020">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elijah's cowardly response to this threat is to run. Even though he has just assisted in the remarkable triumph of Y<sc>hwh</sc> over Baal (1 Kgs 18.36–38), even though the people returned their devotion to Y<sc>hwh</sc> as a result (1 Kgs 18.39), and even though he took revenge on his enemies by divine sanction (1 Kgs 18.40), still Elijah fears Jezebel will be able to overcome any protection Y<sc>hwh</sc> might offer. He flees to the wilderness and asks Y<sc>hwh</sc> to take his life (1 Kgs 19.4). Stuart Lasine comments on this portion of the text, saying:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Elijah's fear seems to indicate a growing awareness and vulnerability, in spite of the aura of invincibility surrounding his masterful behavior over the king, the people, and the Baal prophets in the preceding chapter. Only Jezebel refuses to submit. Apparently this one dissenting voice issuing hollow threats is enough to prevent Elijah's grandiose self image from being reflected in the world, transforming his success into an experience of total failure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0309089212438020">57</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Though despairing and sullen, Elijah continues to experience Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s care. Just as Y<sc>hwh</sc> brought food to the prophet earlier with the help of the ravens and the Widow of Zarephath (1 Kgs 17), a messenger brings food and water to sustain him. Y<sc>hwh</sc> instructs Elijah to eat when he seems to have given up all effort to live. When Elijah is finally willing to leave his broom tree in the wilderness, he journeys forty days and nights to Mount Horeb. But in this move Elijah reveals that his earlier state of despair continues. When he arrives as his chosen destination, Y<sc>hwh</sc> questions the prophet, ‘Why are you here, Elijah?’, implying that this location is not what Y<sc>hwh</sc> had in mind. Symbolically, Elijah comes to the cave at Horeb in an attempt to retrace the steps of Moses,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0309089212438020">58</xref></sup> hoping that in staking himself out on holy ground Y<sc>hwh</sc> will give him special protection and perhaps renewed vision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0309089212438020">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elijah explains himself to Y<sc>hwh</sc>, however, with the same demeanor he displayed in the wilderness. Elijah proclaims his faithfulness to Y<sc>hwh</sc> and his feelings of alienation regarding his present situation. Curiously, Elijah's statement contradicts earlier narrative depictions. Elijah decries the Israelites for destroying Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s laws, worship space, and prophets, yet Elijah's victory on Mount Carmel reportedly brought the people back to Y<sc>hwh</sc> (1 Kgs 18.39). Elijah also claims to be the only prophet left in Israel, yet 1 Kgs 18.4 describes how the palace administrator, Obadiah, hid one hundred prophets of Israel in caves and provided them with food and water. Elijah's statements underscore his own preoccupation with self. He fails to recognize Israelite repentance, preferring to herald his own religious devotion. Elijah tries to preserve his own life by running away to a cave and depending on Y<sc>hwh</sc> for sustenance. Obadiah risks his life seeking out caves in which to hide Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s prophets and provides bread and water for them from his own means.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0309089212438020">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>In response, Y<sc>hwh</sc> appears to give Elijah what he wants, a reply of Moses' experiences with the divine. Y<sc>hwh</sc> sends all the expected natural phenomena of the Exodus story—fire, wind, and even an earthquake—but Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s presence does not arrive with any of these noisy efforts. Rather, Y<sc>hwh</sc> sends something altogether different, הקר הממך לוק (‘a sound of sheer silence’, 1 Kgs 19.12). Elijah moves to the entrance of the cave, perhaps covering his face as a precaution against seeing Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s face, though Y<sc>hwh</sc> does not instruct him to make such a move.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0309089212438020">61</xref></sup> Instead of further revealing the divine self to Elijah, Y<sc>hwh</sc> repeats the earlier query, ‘Why are you here, Elijah?’, only to be met by a repeat of Elijah's earlier self-focused lament (1 Kgs 19.13). Y<sc>hwh</sc> gives Elijah a series of commissions: anoint Hazael as king of Aram, anoint Jehu as king of Israel, and anoint Elisha as prophet in his (i.e. Elijah's) place.</p>
<p>These commissions may be Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s way of decommissioning Elijah. His refusal to continue on his own mission rather than seeking out another leader's divine encounter may have cost Elijah his calling. Robinson summarizes this view by saying, 'in his maudlin self-pity and his desire for death, Elijah has betrayed Y<sc>hwh</sc>, the God of life, and has sided with the forces of death'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0309089212438020">62</xref></sup> The fact that Elijah does not fulfill Y<sc>hwh</sc>'s command and that he continues to play a role in the narrative may be due to disjointed redaction on the part of the writer, or it may be a narrative attempt to suggest that Elijah finally decided to resume his prophetic ministry and do the work Y<sc>hwh</sc> needed him to do.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0309089212438020">63</xref></sup> Elijah does, after all, ultimately ascend to heaven in a fiery chariot before Elisha officially takes up his mantle (2 Kgs 2).</p>
<p>Jezebel's threat is a pivotal point in Elijah's ministry; it gives him pause. It pushes him towards a meeting with Y<sc>hwh</sc>, a meeting in which Y<sc>hwh</sc> reveals the divine self in a unique way. Viewing the narrative as a whole, this scene is transitional rather than terminal for Elijah. He forms a relationship with his successor, Elisha. He goes on to call the royal family to account for murdering Naboth and illegally seizing his land. He continues to proclaim the Yahwistic faith in his dealings with Ahab's son Ahaziah. While the Deuteronomistic author reviles Jezebel in one sense, in another it needs her. The connection between the two figures becomes all the more evident when reading the LXX version of 1 Kgs 19.2. According to this tradition Jezebel begins her oath against Elijah with the words, ‘If you are Elijah then I am Jezebel’. The two are inextricably linked here. The two personas meet in this phrase even as the gods they serve co-mingle. Jezebel's name heralds Baal (‘Where is the Prince?’), and Elijah's proclaims his divine allegiance (‘Y<sc>hwh</sc> is my God’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0309089212438020">64</xref></sup> Even as the two entities clash, they help to define the other. Without both parties the narrative loses steam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0309089212438020">65</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>My efforts here have sought to rearrange relationships and upend usual correlations in the Elijah cycle of 1 Kings 17–21. Rather than setting Elijah and Jezebel in opposition to one another, I have brought a third party into their relationship in order to see what a <italic>mánage à trois</italic> might reveal. While many commentators view the Widow of Zarephath as the ideal foreign woman, the usage of the term הלצכ to describe her suggests that the Deuteronomistic author still has some underlying angst about her presence in the text. By looking at Elijah as a potential foreigner, or at least a person of questionable extraction, I have attempted to show that like the strange women he interacts with, Elijah's identity within the text may be uncertain. The dependency of the Widow, her son, and Elijah, as well as Obadiah's courageous actions subvert the notion that Elijah is the self-sufficient lone actor who takes on Jezebel and Baal single-handedly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0309089212438020">66</xref></sup> He needs the support of others in the narrative in order to represent Y<sc>hwh</sc>. The <italic>ménage à trois</italic> relationship between Elijah, Jezebel, and the Widow demonstrates that whether intentional or unintentional on the part of the Deuteronomistic author, Israel's struggles with its identity are part of the interwoven fabric of its narrative efforts (and our interpretive attempts) to come to terms with its history.</p>
<p>Another goal in this work has been to view Jezebel and the Widow of Zarephath as complementary characters, a Janus-faced figure, that is, the same woman gazing in two directions. Both mediate the divine to Elijah. Rather than equating the strange woman with all that is idolatrous, forbidden, and dangerous in regards to faith, both Jezebel and the Widow can be viewed as guardians of a dual-gateway to faith, much like the Italian god of war, Janus. The Widow of Zarephath voices one of the central concerns of the DH: What is the correlation between one's sin and the penalty for that sin? What is the balance between God's grace and God's mercy? Jezebel also raises an important theological quandary for Elijah. Her threat against his life sends him running, but it also provides a space for reflection on his calling. In his time on Mount Horeb he experiences a theophany, a new vision of God and new commission from God. Jezebel's invocation of her gods makes clearer Elijah's way of return to his God.</p>
<p>In Uriel Simon's book, <italic>Reading Prophetic Narratives</italic>, he asserts, ‘The basic intention of biblical storytelling is not to glorify important persons and institutions or even to reinforce adherence to abstract beliefs and concepts, but to depict flesh-and-blood characters whose rises and falls serve us as models and as warnings’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0309089212438020">67</xref></sup> By estranging Elijah and inviting the strange women into a sacred role, I am attempting to expand the vision of models and warnings in the Elijah cycle. Finding complexity and ambiguity in the actors as well as in the theological thread of the text itself allows for a broader picture of humanity and the holy. What the reader so often tries to avoid—identification with the other—becomes unavoidable.</p>
<p>This approach also eschews the pitfalls of a model of monotheistic scarcity, whereby the categories of ‘us’ and ‘them’ are strictly defined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0309089212438020">68</xref></sup> If Elijah is strange and the strange women are holy, then our previous understanding of holy and strange must change. This type of reading opens the way for new sources of authority and alternative power arrangements, where we listen to the voice of the others in our midst and possibly find among them our greatest allies.</p>

Whereas the widow of 17.8–16 did not have the means to feed herself and her son without a miraculous intervention, the woman introduced in v. 17 is the ‘mistress of the house’, implying that she is a homeowner. Furthermore, in this section of the story she has means enough to provide Elijah with a room in her home (v. 19). The woman described in 1 Kgs 17.17–24 seems to mirror the wealthy Shunammite woman with whom Elisha stays in 2 Kgs 4.8–37. Because the redactor decided to connect the stories of the Widow of Zarephath and the Mistress of the House, I will treat them as part of a coherent narrative.
