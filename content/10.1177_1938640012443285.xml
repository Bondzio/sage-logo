<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Symptomatic osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, known as hallux rigidus, is the most common arthritic condition of the foot, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 40 for individuals older than 50 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012443285">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012443285"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012443285"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012443285">4</xref></sup> The etiology of hallux rigidus is multifactorial and not completely understood. Proposed causes include trauma, a tight Achilles tendon, an elevated first ray, and poor shoe wear. A history of trauma is common with isolated unilateral disease. The majority of individuals who present with idiopathic unilateral hallux rigidus may eventually progress to bilateral hallux rigidus over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012443285">5</xref></sup> This correlates with a positive family history in most individuals, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the development of bilateral hallux rigidus.</p>
<p>The clinical presentation of hallux rigidus includes pain and swelling localized to the first MTP joint. Patients will often compensate with an antalgic gait, activity modification, and avoidance of certain types of shoes. The first MTP joint is enlarged, and the range of motion is limited, especially in dorsiflexion. Radiographic findings include osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis, and joint space narrowing. A classification system proposed by Coughlin and Shurnas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012443285">6</xref></sup> combines both range of motion and radiographic findings to quantify the severity of hallux rigidus. This can be used as a guide when considering the different surgical treatments of hallux rigidus, including cheilectomy, microfracture, osteotomies, arthroplasty, and fusion.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to report the 5-year follow-up of our interpositional arthroplasty technique using a regenerative tissue matrix (RTM). This study complements our previously published surgical technique and initial 1-year follow-up of the first 9 patients treated at our institution with Coughlin grade 3 hallux rigidus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012443285">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012443285">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>This case series is part of an original cohort that included the first 9 consecutive patients who underwent a RTM interpositional arthroplasty of the first MTP joint at our institution. A retrospective chart review was performed to obtain the preoperative American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle scores (AOFAS). Patients were contacted by telephone, and the same AOFAS questionnaire was used to assess their current condition. The AOFAS was specifically modified to select for pain and function, with a total score of 68 points. In addition to the AOFAS, patients were asked about their overall satisfaction with the procedure and if they had any additional procedures performed on the MTP joint, specifically asking about subsequent fusion.</p>
<p>The inclusion criteria for the study were active patients with Coughlin grade 3 hallux rigidus, failed conservative management, and a desire to delay fusion of the first MTP joint. All patients were first offered a fusion procedure as the standard treatment for advanced hallux rigidus. Those who understood the risks and benefits of fusion and elected to proceed were excluded from the study.</p>
<p>Of the original case series cohort, 6 patients were available for follow-up; 5 patients were female, and 1 patient was male. Of these cases, 4 involved the left first MTP joint, and 2 cases involved the right first MTP joint. The average age of the patients at the date of surgery was 54.3 (35-70) years.</p>

<sec id="section3-1938640012443285">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The patient is positioned supine on the operating table. A regional popliteal block with monitored anesthesia care is preferred. After application of a well-padded thigh tourniquet, the extremity is prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion. The extremity is exsanguinated, and the tourniquet is inflated prior to incision.</p>
<p>A dorsal approach to the first MTP joint is used with a linear incision just medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon. Care is taken to protect the dorsal cutaneous sensory nerves. A full thickness arthrotomy is performed to expose the joint. Blunt soft-tissue retractors are used to reflect the extensor hallucis longus and capsule laterally. Full exposure of the joint is obtained by releasing the medial and lateral collateral ligaments. A large dorsal osteophyte with dorsal chondromalacia of the metatarsal head is typically encountered. This is addressed by performing an aggressive cheilectomy using a power sagittal saw. A rongeur is then used to remove any additional osteophytes around the metatarsal head and base of the proximal phalanx.</p>
<p>The metatarsal-sesamoid articulation is then inspected. Fibrotic adhesions, if present, are released with a McGlamry elevator. The flexor hallucis longus and brevis tendons are identified and protected. Any remaining osteophytes on the plantar aspect of the metatarsal head are resected. If additional decompression of the joint is required, a modified Keller osteotomy can be performed, taking care to preserve the plantar intrinsics.</p>
<p>The RTM is then prepared for insertion. A 5 × 5 cm<sup>2</sup> GRAFTJACKET matrix (Wright Medical Technology, Inc, Arlington, TN) was used in this study. The graft is placed in sterile saline for at least 5 minutes to rehydrate. Once it becomes pliable, it is cut to accommodate the metatarsal head. It is then grasped proximally and distally with 0-vicryl suture stitches.</p>
<p>Two bone tunnels are drilled dorsal to plantar in the metatarsal neck using a 3/32 Steinmann pin. The exit point of the tunnels is just proximal to the sesamoid articulation. A Hewson suture passer is used to transport the 0-vicryl suture through the tunnels, keeping the shiny side of the RTM against the metatarsal head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012443285">Figure 1</xref>). The plantar aspect of the graft is secured by tying the sutures dorsally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012443285">Figure 2</xref>). The graft is then brought around the metatarsal head and sutured into the existing stitch with a free needle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640012443285">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The joint is brought through a full range of motion to verify adequate decompression of the joint and fixation of the graft. The joint and surgical wounds are then copiously irrigated. The capsule is repaired with a 0-vicryl suture followed by a 2-0 suture in the subcutaneous tissue. The skin is closed with a running nylon stitch. A toe spica soft dressing is applied, followed by a fracture shoe. Patients are discharged with partial weight-bearing restrictions.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 9 patients in the original cohort, 6 were available for follow-up. The average preoperative modified AOFAS was 38 (range, 34-43; standard deviation [SD] = 3.3). The most recent AOFAS was 65.8 (range, 58-68; SD = 4.0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640012443285">Figure 4</xref>). The average follow-up was 5.4 years (range, 58-67 months). Every patient was satisfied with the surgical results and reported that they would have the procedure done again. There were no subsequent procedures or fusions performed on the MTP joint.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Interpositional arthroplasty techniques for the treatment of advanced hallux rigidus have been previously described in the literature with varying degrees of success. Regardless of the technique, long-term follow-up is lacking, leading to potential speculation as to the durability of the grafts and the need for eventual fusion. Using the above-mentioned surgical technique with a RTM graft results in continued pain relief and preserved function at a follow-up of more than 5 years. These results complement our initial findings in this cohort of patients: There were no wound healing problems, infections, inflammatory reactions, instabilities, malalignments, or loss of push-off strength at 12.7 months of average follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012443285">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Limitations of this study include a small cohort of patients, lack of a control group, and a potential follow-up bias with 6 of the 9 original patients reporting their outcomes. The focus of this study was to report subjective patient outcomes along with the objective criteria of additional surgery or fusion; consequently, there were no range of motion measurements made and no radiographs taken.</p>
<p>This is the only study, to our knowledge, that reports data from a follow-up of more than 5 years with a RTM interpositional graft for the treatment of hallux rigidus. The results of this study are encouraging in regard to the longer-term durability of the RTM graft along with the surgical technique. For active patients with grade 3 hallux rigidus who have failed conservative management and refuse a fusion procedure, we offer interpositional arthroplasty as an alternative procedure, with the understanding that fusion may be necessary in the future. We continue to recommend this procedure to our active patients with advanced hallux rigidus who do not want a fusion. Larger prospective randomized trials are needed to better define the indications and outcomes of this technique.</p>
