<abstract>
<p>This study investigated which anatomic landmarks were most useful for correct and safe incision placement in carpal tunnel surgery. Kirschner wires were attached to the hands to mark previously defined landmarks. The bony attachments of the transverse carpal ligament, which were identified previously, were drawn on an anteroposterior digital x-ray of the hand, with the thumb in full abduction. The relationship between anatomic landmarks and these bony attachments were examined. In all hands, either the line along the third web space or the crease between the thenar and the hypothenar regions, or both, were on the ulnar half of the transverse carpal ligament. During incision placement, we recommend selecting the most ulnar choice between the line drawn along the third web space and the crease between the thenar and hypothenar regions in order to be at safe distance from the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are many surgical techniques for performing carpal tunnel release. Minimal incision is currently one of the most popular techniques. Bromley was the first author to report that the transverse carpal ligament can be released directly and safely with a small incision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412475124">Bromley, 1994</xref>). The minimal incision technique places the incision at the radial border of the fourth finger (third web space) recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412475124">Atik et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412475124">Klein et al., 2003</xref>). Open carpal tunnel surgery uses thenar crease as a reference point for the incision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412475124">Mackinnon and Novak, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412475124">Bugbee and Botte (1993)</xref> have suggested that the relationship between the topographic anatomy of the hand and its bony structures can be used to establish optimal placement of the surgical incision. During carpal tunnel surgery, we observed that the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve was encountered in the surgical area when using an incision placed in the line of the radial border of the fourth finger (third web space) in some hands. The aim of this study was to determine which anatomic landmarks were most suitable for optimal incision location, especially to be in a safe distance from the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve. We evaluated the relationship between landmarks of the topographic anatomy of the hand that had been described previously and the bony attachments of the transverse carpal ligament defined in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412475124">Cobb et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412475124">Won et al. 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Material and methods</title>
<p>Forty volunteers (20 women, 20 men) participated in this study. The mean age was 32 years SD 6.5 (range 20–45). There were no deformities or lesions on the hands of the volunteers.</p>
<p>Kirschner wires were attached to the middle of the third (Line I) and fourth (Line II) fingers, the radial side of the fourth finger (third web space, Line III), the distal palmar crease (Line IV), the crease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412475124">Figure 1</xref>) between thenar and hypothenar region (Line V), the ulnar edge of the thumb (Kaplan’s cardinal line) (Line VI) and the distal wrist crease (Line VII) on the palmar side of the right hands. An anteroposterior computed radiographic image of the hand, with the thumb in full abduction, was taken while the forearm was in supination. The digital images were printed with magnification of ×1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412475124">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The pisiform, hook of the hamate, tuberosity of the scaphoid, and ridge of the trapezium were marked on the film to identify the bony attachments of the transverse carpal ligament. The proximal margin of the transverse carpal ligament was marked with a line running from the proximal edge of the pisiform to the tuberosity of the scaphoid. The distal margin of the transverse carpal ligament was marked with a line running from the distal end of the hook of the hamate to ridge of the trapezium. The most radial point of the ulnar edge of the transverse carpal ligament was the hook of the hamate. The most ulnar point of the radial edge of the transverse carpal ligament was the tuberosity of the scaphoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412475124">Figure 3</xref>). If lines are drawn between the bony attachments of the transverse carpal ligament, a rhomboid-like quadrilateral appears. The traversing longitudinal incision for this shape must be placed between the innermost corners of the quadrilateral. Therefore, we measured the distance between the hook of the hamate and ulnar side of the tubercle of the scaphoid for the measurement of the width of the carpal tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412475124">Figure 3</xref>). We appointed the hook of the hamate as the most ulnar point of the ligamentous area that could be released by a longitudinal incision traversing the transverse carpal ligament.</p>

<p>The lines were drawn in line with the axes of the attached wires. We then measured the distances between lines that were drawn according to topographic anatomy of the hand and the bony structures that were marked on the radiographic prints to determine boundaries of the transverse carpal ligament (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412475124">Table 1</xref>). Values are reported as mean standard deviation. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess differences between groups. Values of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. SPSS 16.0 was used for data analysis.</p>

<p>The narrowest width of the carpal tunnel, which was between the hook of the hamate and the tuberosity of the scaphoid, was 17.6 SD 1.29 mm (16–21 mm). The width was shorter in women (17 SD 0.85 mm, minimum–maximum 16–18 mm) than in men (18.25 SD 1.37 mm, minimum–maximum 16–21 mm) and this difference was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003).</p>
<p>The distance between the line III (third web space) and hook of the hamate was 8.95 SD 2.92 mm (3–14 mm). The distance between the line V (the crease) and hook of the hamate was 8.53 SD 3.16 mm (2–15 mm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412475124">Figure 4</xref>). As the narrowest width of the carpal tunnel was 17.6 SD 1.29 mm, lines that had a distance of more than 10 mm (half of the width of the carpal tunnel) from the hook of the hamate were considered to be on the radial half of the transverse carpal ligament. The distance from the line V (the crease) to the hook of the hamate was more than 10 mm in 16 hands. In other words, the crease between the thenar and hypothenar regions was on the radial half of the transverse carpal ligament in these hands. The distance from the line III (third web space) to the hook of the hamate was more than 10 mm in 15 hands. In other words, the line drawn along the third web space was on the radial half of the transverse carpal ligament in these hands. Both lines (the crease and the third web space) had less than 10 mm distance to the hook of the hamate in nine hands. In all hands, either the line along the third web space or the crease between the thenar and hypothenar regions, or both, were on the ulnar half of the transverse carpal ligament</p>

<p>The distance between the line I (middle of the third finger) and the ulnar side of the tuberosity of the scaphoid was 4.0 SD 2.52 mm (1–11 mm). The line extends ulnar to the ulnar side of the tuberosity of the scaphoid in nine hands and radial to the ulnar side of the tuberosity of the scaphoid in 31 hands (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412475124">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The distance between the line II (middle of the fourth finger) and the hook of the hamate was 3.43 SD 2.39 mm (1–11 mm).

<p>The distance between the line VII (distal wrist crease) and the proximal margin of the transverse carpal ligament was 1.25 SD 1.12 mm (0–4 mm). The line was just on the proximal margin of transverse carpal ligament in 11 hands. The line was proximal to the proximal margin in 15 hands and distal to the proximal margin in 14 hands (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412475124">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The distance between the line VI (ulnar edge of the thumb, Kaplan’s cardinal line) and the hook of the hamate was 9.55 SD 6.09 mm (1–24 mm).

<p>The distance between the line IV (distal palmar crease) and the distal margin of transverse carpal ligament was 45.52 SD 3.46 mm (39–52 mm). This distance was significantly shorter in women than in men (<italic>p</italic> = 0.026).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The incision used for the carpal tunnel surgery should be in a proper position to reach the transverse carpal ligament easily. At the same time, vigilance is required and abnormal anatomy should always be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412475124">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). The incision should be at a safe distance from the recurrent motor branch of median nerve, major sensory branches of the median and ulnar nerves (palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, palmar cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve), superficial palmar arch, ulnar artery and ulnar nerve, which are the structures most likely to be damaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412475124">Ahcan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412475124">Atik et al., 2001</xref>). In other words, determination of the incision location is of critical importance in the carpal tunnel surgery.</p>
<p>Although we know that the transverse carpal ligament lies from the pisiform bone, proximally to the hook of hamate distally on the ulnar side, and that it reaches from the tuberosity of scaphoid proximally to the ridge of trapezium distally on the radial side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412475124">Cobb et al., 1993</xref>), we were unable to find any article about the transverse carpal ligament that examined anatomic landmarks associated with its boundaries. In the present study, we found determined that the axis of the fourth finger approximately corresponded to the ulnar edge of the transverse carpal ligament and that the axis of the third finger approximately corresponded to the radial edge of the transverse carpal ligament. We also observed that the distal wrist crease corresponded to the proximal margin of transverse carpal ligament.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412475124">Chern et al. (2009)</xref> reported that the distance between the hook of the hamate and the median nerve that is the origin of the recurrent motor branch was just 5 SD 0.4 mm. However <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412475124">Eskandari et al. (2005)</xref> reported that the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve was located a mean of 12.6 SD 4.1 mm (4.0–19.7 mm) ulnar to the radial side of the third finger. That means the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve could be seen in any part of the area between second and third web space, as seen in the figure in which they show the distribution of the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve. They concluded that, during carpal tunnel surgery, the surgeon must pay more attention to the localization of the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve because it was found to be 12.6 mm more ulnar than the location described previously in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412475124">Hollevoet et al. (2010)</xref> reported that wide muscle fibres on transverse carpal ligament, which can be associated with an abnormal course of the recurrent motor branch, were present in 11 % of the hands and the fibres put the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve at risk during division of the transverse carpal ligament. Therefore, placing the incision on the ulnar half of the transverse carpal ligament could be recommended to provide a safe distance from the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve.</p>
<p>The width of the carpal tunnel was 17.6 SD 1.29 mm in our study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412475124">Cobb et al. (1993)</xref> have found a mean width of the carpal tunnel at the hook of hamate of 20 mm. Lines that had a distance of more than 10 mm (half of the width of the carpal tunnel) from the hook of the hamate (ulnar edge of the narrowest part of the transverse carpal ligament) were accepted as being on the radial half of the transverse carpal ligament.</p>
<p>The line drawn along the third web space (Line III) was found to be more than 10 mm away from hook of hamate in 15 of 40 hands (37.5%). In other words, the third web space (Line III) was on the radial half of the transverse carpal ligament in these hands. That means the incision would be dangerously close to the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve if it was on the third web space line (Line III) in these hands.</p>
<p>The distance between the crease (Line V) and the hook of the hamate was more than 10 mm in 16 hands (40%). In other words, the crease (Line V) was on the radial half of the transverse carpal ligament in these hands. That means the incision would be dangerously close to the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve if it was on crease (Line V) in these hands.</p>
<p>Neither the line drawn along the third web space nor the crease between the thenar and hypothenar regions was 10 mm away from the hook of hamate in nine hands. In other words, both lines (Line III and Line V) were on the ulnar half of the transverse carpal ligament in nine hands. That means both lines (the third web space and the crease) were at a safe distance from the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve in these hands. In all hands, either the line along the third web space or the crease between the thenar and hypothenar regions, or both were on the ulnar half of the transverse carpal ligament. We concluded that the more ulnar choice between the line along the third web space and the crease between the thenar and hypothenar region should be preferred for incision in order to be at a safe distance from the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve.</p>
<p>Although no precise anatomic study has yet been performed to determine the proximity of neurovascular structures to the crease between the thenar and hypothenar regions and to the line on the third web space, we recommend using the one that is nearest to the ulnar side when choosing between the line drawn along the third web space (on the radial side of the fourth finger) and the crease between the thenar and hypothenar regions. In this way, more space will remain between the surgical area and the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve, while still keeping the incision at a safe distance from the ulnar tunnel contents.</p>
