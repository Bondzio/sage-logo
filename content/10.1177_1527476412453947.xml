<abstract>
<p>This article explores the contribution of comedy to the mediation of politics in a number of genres outside the core forms of journalism. Using material collected during an extensive study of diverse media treatments of British politics, it raises questions about the functions that comedy performs within civic culture and civic subjectivity, giving emphasis to broadcasting. Selected accounts from respondent groups are used to investigate further the ways in which comedy contributes to the placing of politics within the everyday and to the naturalization, or questioning, of the power relations at work. The article concludes by suggesting that further work on comic treatments, alongside studies of other sources of political information and commentary, will be a valuable aspect of research on political culture.</p>

<p>In this article we explore aspects of the relationship between forms of mediated comic performance and civic culture, moving from an analysis of selected comic texts within UK media to discussion of respondents’ comments, drawing on our recent audience research in this area.</p>
<p>Questions about how the comic fits into the media’s treatment of politics and into people’s perceptions of the political form only one part of a larger study we have undertaken into the ways in which diverse generic modes of broadcasting, print, and Web-based mediation, particularly those working outside the parameters of journalism, articulate aspects of the political scene. We undertook, in 2010, to sample non-news media texts from all platforms (radio, television, print, and online), conducting audits at different points in a political year that had a general election in the Spring as well as the political party conferences in the Autumn. We also included in the research a reception analysis component to complement our emphasis on media forms, constructing a series of focus groups that maximized the range of respondents across variables of gender, employment status, and age. These participants were shown different mixes of our source material, to draw out lines of interpretation, appreciation, and criticism. Other research papers and more details about our methodological approach are available on a project Web site, and the fullest account of the research will be published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476412453947">Richardson, Parry, and Corner (2012)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527476412453947">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although this larger project goes beyond the terms of the comic, questions about comedy, about humor and amusement, are frequently raised, as they have been in recent studies of media-political relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412453947">Gray, Jones, and Thompson 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412453947">Jones 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412453947">Shifman, Coleman, and Ward 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412453947">Wagg 2002</xref>). We begin our account with a brief examination of some key terms and concepts.</p>
<sec id="section1-1527476412453947">
<title>Comedy and the Spaces of the Civic</title>
<p>The material we have selected for examination largely concerns itself with providing comic treatments of politics and leading political figures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527476412453947">2</xref></sup> Set off against the specialized sphere of “the political,” the “civic” connects and overlaps with two other designations that have a strong and contentious presence in the international literature of media research—the “public” and the “popular.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527476412453947">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Comedy has a long history as an approach to articulating political deficits, with classical and contemporary forms of “satire” accorded a privileged role as a mode of critique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476412453947">Billig 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476412453947">Hariman 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412453947">Holbert et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476412453947">Simpson 2003</xref>). Of course, only with the phased arrival of nominally democratic systems does it make sense to talk of the comic in relation to civic culture, the shift from the subject of sovereign rule to citizen changing the formal relationship with power, even though, as we show in the following, a sense of the continuingly undemocratic nature of many aspects of formal democracy provides a key stimulus for current comic portrayal. “Satire” suggests comedy with serious political intent, but within many modern societies there is, alongside this, a much broader comic realm in which raillery, mocking and spoofing of the “official,” continues as a routine accompaniment to national life.</p>
<p>However articulated, comic mediations of politics are marked as strongly affective, working from and upon emotional patterns concerning politics and politicians. Amusement and laughter, whatever their cognitive or critical component, are thereby positioned as moments of expressive release within the broader context of individual civic consciousness. In part, and particularly in relation to that that which is less focused on specific policy issues, the enjoyment of comic portrayals can be viewed as a way of getting back symbolically at elite management (including its attempts at managing the terms of its media representation), temporarily rebalancing the feeling of power relations through considered disrespect. The terms of such portrayal frequently exceed the “sobriety” of the established citizen model (discussed critically by many commentators, see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412453947">Schudson 1999</xref>). However, the interplay of comic perceptions with other sources of political knowledge and value, including the varieties of “news,” as part of personal investment or dis-investment in the political and as part of deliberative processing, is something to which we attend when looking at respondent accounts. Projected as “play” by their frequent recourse to forms of self-conscious exaggeration and the fancifully imaginative, comedic treatments can make connections with more serious, critical thinking about civic space, or they can work essentially as regular inputs of “fun” against the background of what is primarily a distant, acquiescent, or even resigned perception of the dominant order, a point to which we return in our conclusions. Here, factors of generic variety and of variable audience demography are relevant, as is the recognition that individual civic consciousness is neither stable nor consistent but subject both to shifts and to internal contradictions in thought and mood.</p>
<p>One way of categorizing the material we examine, if only in the broadest terms, is to see it as being primarily <italic>imitative, descriptive</italic>, or <italic>argumentative</italic> in design.</p>
<p><italic>Imitative</italic> performances include the comic portrayal of politicians and political activity in drama but also extend to the variety of short comic sketches. Politicians’ gestures and speech here form part of a repertoire of mediation that often involves a strong element of ridicule (partly playing on the idea of politicians as <italic>self-evidently</italic> comic, which we discuss in the following). There is then a broad spectrum of work, including stand-up routines, talk shows, quiz shows, and parts of special interest politics shows, which proceeds primarily by comic <italic>description.</italic> As our examples that follow will show, this uses descriptive method to portray situations in calculatedly distorted ways that undercut their seriousness and exploit their farcical, silly, or amusing dimensions. In doing this they may resort to short acts of partial imitation. Spoken descriptions by professional comic performers may work at an understated “realist” level (producing a “dry” humor about their subject), but they may also develop elaborate metaphorical accounts, transforming their subject matter into the realm of fantasy (again, some elements of this are present in our examples). <italic>Argumentative</italic> comedy is perhaps a questionable category and less clear-cut than the other two, but what we mean by this is comedy that is primarily driven by the desire to support a political argument about the specific inadequacy of a particular politician or political act or circumstance. As we indicated earlier, this is different from that broader “mocking” of the political elite, the “farce” of politics, and the “silliness” of conventional political claims-making. It necessarily presupposes a certain level of knowledge and of <italic>civic commitment</italic> on the part of the audience. It works not only with the comedy of person and of action but with the comedy of <italic>ideas</italic>, including but going beyond the realm of the self-evident (e.g., the contradictory statement, the U-turn, the gaffe). Argumentative forms of comedy do not necessarily reveal their indignation in the style of performance but, arguably, in their most sophisticated form they invite the audience to “fill in the gaps” left open in a more allusive mode of delivery. For example, in his television shows, based on stand-up routines delivered in front of a small “club” gathering, comedian Stewart Lee requires a knowing and complicit audience for his often disconcerting style of political humor to work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1527476412453947">4</xref></sup> In sustained form, television occurrences of this more seriously satiric mode of performance during our period of audit tended to be away from the more popular parts of the schedule and away from the popular channels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1527476412453947">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Performing the Comedy of Politics</title>
<p>In this section, we want to look at examples of the comic material that we collected, a selection of which we showed to respondents, eliciting comments that we shall discuss later. Both for reasons of space and the value we place on giving close attention to specific formal structures, we shall give primary place to two items from the extensive range in our project, a drama and a radio quiz show, ending with a much shorter discussion of a TV chat show.</p>
<sec id="section3-1527476412453947">
<title>Miliband of Brothers</title>
<p><italic>Miliband of Brothers</italic> was a generically innovative program that might best be described as a comedy docudrama. It was first broadcast on the channel More 4 on September 24, 2010, and it concerned the rivalry between the two brothers, David and Ed Miliband, for leadership of the Labour Party; a rivalry culminating in the unexpected election of Ed at the Labour Party Annual Conference on September 25 (the day after the broadcast). More 4 is a channel “extension” of the more mainstream Channel 4, building on the parent channel’s branding in relation to “niche” and youth audiences. The pre-title sequence (approximately two minutes) was shown to some of the respondent groups we talked to in the second phase of our study. This is an outline of what is seen and heard:</p>
<p>Scene: Actor playing David Miliband enters foyer of television company with an assistant, talking into a mobile phone:<disp-quote>
<p>The figures speak for themselves. I thought it was good news. Yeah yeah.</p>
<p>Well, if they want to go with the one-horse race, we’ll run with it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>(within the larger scene, another suited figure is seen sitting in the background)</p>
<speech><speaker>David:</speaker> <p>What the hell are you doing here?</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Ed:</speaker> <p>I’m doing the lunchtime news interview. What about you?</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>David:</speaker> <p>Great! Sits down in exasperation and turns to assistant to say—nice one, seriously, I mean that.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Studio manager with clipboard enters foyer:</speaker> <p>Mr. Miliband?</p></speech>
<p>Both suited figures stand up.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Interview sequence 1. (Neil Kinnock, ex leader of the Labour Party, in a well-appointed committee room) David’s response to Ed running has, to my astonishment, been deeply resentful.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The two brothers with their assistants and broadcasting staff walk down corridor toward the studio.</p>
<speech><speaker>David to Advisor:</speaker> <p>Why didn’t I know he was doing it as well. Pretty important information. Kind of crucial, actually. And yet … no.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Ed to studio manager, walking alongside him:</speaker> <p>I’m the warm Miliband</p></speech>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Interview sequence 2 (Andrew Rawnsley, political commentator, in book-lined study). Among Tony Blair’s people Ed Miliband was known as the emissary from Planet Fuck because he was the only member of the Brown acolytes who didn’t tell them to fuck off.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<speech><speaker>Scene:</speaker> <p>The make-up desk in the studio dressing room, the two brothers seated alongside each other.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>David to Ed:</speaker> <p>Don’t want any of your nonsense about Iraq—that spiel about how you were always against the war.</p></speech>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Interview Sequence 3 (Oona King, ex Labour MP and former schoolfriend, in sparsely furnished room/studio). They cannot be the same after this. Politics will tear you apart and I’ve seen it happen and I can feel it happening between them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Scene: The television studio, with cameras and the two seated Milibands, greeted by a female interviewer.</p>
<speech><speaker>Interviewer:</speaker> <p>Right if we can just have a few words for level pitch.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Ed:</speaker> <p>I’ll start, testing, testing, one …</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>David:</speaker> <p>This is a time of real change and we face some challenges but I think under my leadership the party really can begin to …</p></speech>
<p>Ed swivels on chair and kicks David on shin …</p>
<speech><speaker>David:</speaker> <p>Ow! Did you just kick … ? To interviewer—Did you just see that?</p></speech>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Cut to color-faded shot of two young boys kicking each other on swivel chairs (off-shot voice, <italic>Boys, Please</italic>!)</p>
<p>Main Title and then subtitle, <italic>Like father, like sons.</italic></p>
<p>Post-titles opening scene: a dinner party at the home of the father, Ralph Miliband, with political argument in full swing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There are two principal reasons why the approach of this program is interesting for our analysis. First of all, while many single-program dramatizations have a comic dimension, few display the level of overt comic distortion of politicians and political activity that this shows throughout and that is apparent in the narrative, visualization (including bodily gesture), and speech of the pre-title sequence. This distortion portrays events within the generic terms of the comedy “sketch” rather than those of the “reconstructive” dramatic realism used widely by other political drama in which real politicians are portrayed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1527476412453947">6</xref></sup> It does not so much ask its audience to believe that events might have happened “like this” (the “reconstructive” offer) but to play around with the comic fantasy presented in the light of what <italic>is</italic> known about the brothers and their running against each other for office. In this fantasy, the sibling rivalry is constructed within caricatured terms of political publicity (e.g., the tactical search for media advantage; Ed trying to set up a frame for his own evaluation by declaring himself as the “warm” one), political cant (David’s interrupted test speech), and reductive biography (the brother’s political identity shown to have childhood, family roots).</p>
<p>The second point of interest is the relatively unusual mixing of dramatic with documentary elements. The three short interview segments indicated previously (Kinnock, Rawnsley, King) all put “strong” testimony into the mix, but they all, if only briefly, raise the question of their seriousness, given their interweaving with a comic narrative. This is especially true of the contribution from Rawnsley, the nature and language of his anecdote carrying the possibility of “spoof” (especially, perhaps, given its strong links with the typical situations and speech of the popular political sitcom <italic>The Thick of It</italic> (BBC4, 2005-).</p>
<p>Both the <italic>form</italic> of the comedy, as a largely farcical/derisory account of a contest for office, and then its combination with documentary elements created a degree of initial uncertainty in viewers, as we shall later show. Generic uncertainty was also a factor in the critical assessments made by some reviewers. In terms of our typology of comedic politics, the impersonations fit within the “imitative” category, with the exaggeration of the imitations providing the essential humor. The framing of these imitations is not overtly “argumentative” in the sense that it offers an explicit critique of the brothers’ rivalry as an unnecessary, unwelcome, and demeaning complication of serious politics, but it is open to interpretation in these terms as we shall show when we come on to discuss audience responses to this material.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1527476412453947">
<title>The News Quiz</title>
<p>Our second example is taken from radio, and it shows a very different way of providing political topics with comic treatment through comic performance. <italic>The News Quiz</italic> is a long-running comedy panel show on BBC Radio Four, a national radio channel distinctive as a provider of speech-based entertainment. It is associated with an older and loyal audience with expectations about what a public service broadcaster should be providing. During a series run of <italic>The News Quiz</italic>, each episode goes out weekly (Fridays at 6:30 pm; repeated Saturdays at 12:30 pm). Comedian Sandi Toksvig is the current host; the rest of the cast is not fixed from week to week, though there are some regulars. Series 72, from which our extract is taken, was on air during the autumn of 2010, just a few months into the tenure of the Coalition government, which took office in the May of that year.</p>
<p>The basic generic format involves getting the four panelists to answer a series of cryptically worded questions on topical events, starting with the most newsworthy ones, which are frequently political. The contestants are expected to produce witty performances as they elaborate their replies; this is managed interactively, giving the talk a conversational joke-making tenor and drawing the studio audience into its sociability: the broadcast audience is invited to appreciate, and imaginatively inhabit, the good-humored ambience. Just before the episode we discuss here, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne (a Conservative MP), had produced an anxiously anticipated “comprehensive spending review,” indicating in broad terms the kind of budget savings the Coalition government had determined necessary for the recovery of the national economy.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Toksvig’s opening question to Jeremy Hardy plays with the portentous mood (quotes slightly edited for fluency and focus; audible audience laughter omitted):</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<speech><speaker>Toksvig:</speaker> <p>Jeremy, where can we say “The Axe Man Cometh”?</p></speech>
<p>…</p>
<speech><speaker>Hardy:</speaker> <p>… I don’t like to think badly of people just because I disagree with them, and I think there probably was a time when some Conservatives were motivated by some sort of decency … in war time, for example, there was a coalition, we were all under Churchill … we literally were all in it together. But in those days at least the Conservatives knew not to cheer when it was announced that Coventry had been bombed. We don’t live like that. I mean I am, literally, in debt to a building society for two hundred thousand pounds. Eventually they’ll get it back, I don’t know when. They don’t really care because I’m paying the interest anyway. But eventually they’ll get it back. But I don’t suddenly, arbitrarily decide: “Well, that’s it. That’s it, I’m in debt. It’s two hundred thousand pounds, that’s it. No more lavatory paper for me! I shall just rub my arse on the wall from now on.”</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Toksvig:</speaker> <p>That’s an image which is going to stay with me for some time!</p></speech>
<p>Hardy, well known for his left wing sympathies, uses the floor to do several things: to promote, by comic exaggeration, an idea of the Conservatives as a party that <italic>enjoys</italic> making cuts, thereby inflicting pain on substantial numbers of citizens; to mock the metaphorical appropriation of the national economy within the frame of household budgeting; and (not quoted here) to offer a funny as well as pointed description of the Conservative front bench congratulating their chancellor at the end of his speech.</p>
<p>Hardy’s commentary uses the show’s format and his own performative talent to derive humor from political policy and political ideologies, satirizing the substantive basis of political action. Underlying his humor here, on the second point at least, are the makings of a genuine debate about the extent to which both national and personal debt can be “lived with,” without resort to drastic measures. In other generic contexts, an earnest debate on the viability of the analogy is perfectly conceivable, but the comedy/quiz format of this show rules out the possibility of further argumentative development. Other members of the panel (as well as Hardy himself at other points) are satisfied with the rather easier targeting of the foibles of individual politicians:</p>
<speech><speaker>Will Smith:</speaker> <p>I kept thinking, there’s something so sinister about George Osborne—I mean, he does have evil hair, doesn’t he? I’m just convinced that, under his shirt, he’s written the words “Sex Chancellor” in lipstick across his chest. He’s just enjoying it too much.</p></speech>
<p>This contribution follows on directly from that of Hardy; it works up a verbal caricature of George Osborne. Smith is able to develop his comment so that it supports the preceding critique of the Conservatives, although it could also have been incorporated into a less cynical/critical approach to the topic under discussion. The third participant to join in this round of comment is Rory Bremner:</p>
<speech><speaker>Bremner:</speaker> <p>The person I feel sorry for is Vince Cable. Do you remember <italic>Porridge</italic>? Do you remember the prison officer, Barraclough? That’s Vince Cable: [Northern accent] “Well, I, I, I, I’d really rather you didn’t cut child benefit, actually, but if you absolutely have …, I suppose it’ll be all right.” [The disfluency here is part of the vocal effect.]</p></speech>
<p>Bremner is a satirist and impressionist and his response here makes use of the latter ability in channeling another political celebrity, Vince Cable, a senior Liberal Democrat holding the Cabinet post of Business Secretary in the Coalition. Bremner achieves his depiction of Cable by mediating him as “Barraclough,” a character from a 1970s TV sitcom who was an inept but likeable prison officer trying, unsatisfactorily, to maintain authority and discipline over manipulative and clever inmates. This is a rather “dated” cultural reference, but not too much so for the program’s main audience. Bremner hears Cable as someone equally ineffectual in influencing his Coalition partners to mitigate the extremity of their plans.</p>
<p>The program as a whole is not exclusively political in its choice of targets for humor, nor can its mode of humor be exclusively assigned to either the imitative, the descriptive, or the argumentative category in our typology, since the repertoires of individual performers allow for elements of all three.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1527476412453947">
<title>Television Chat Show</title>
<p>The significance of our final example derives from what it can show us about attempts by politicians themselves to operate in a humorous register. Such efforts are at one level attempts to increase their popularity by showing that pleasure as well as civic seriousness is accessible to them. But their attempts are generally awkward, not least because of their own weaknesses as comic performers. When Piers Morgan interviewed Prime Minister Gordon Brown in his celebrity chat show Piers Morgan’s Life Stories (ITV1, 2009-), some exchanges were designed as moments of humor. But the strenuous collusion between host, interviewee, and studio audience required to produce this humor risked being too obvious to the viewer.</p>
<speech><speaker>Morgan:</speaker> <p>A woman in this audience, when asked one word to describe you, Gordon, said “delectable.”</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Brown:</speaker> <p>(with a big smile, chuckling) Well, that’s very nice of her, and very… . Um, can you introduce me to her?</p></speech>
<p>(Smiles and laughter from Morgan and Brown, louder laughter from the studio audience).</p>
<p>Morgan offers “delectable” to see what Brown will do with this inherently absurd conceit of himself as an object of female desire. He satisfies a minimum requirement to take it with good grace, but then risks playing into it, and the production ensures that we hear and see everyone in the studio demonstrating a dutiful appreciation of this “joke.” This can be compared with our previous examples on a number of axes. It is certainly performative rather than descriptive or argumentative, it disrupts a convention that real political humor is at the expense of politicians while reinforcing a convention that powerful people must be humored even when behaving in ridiculous ways.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-1527476412453947">
<title>Comedy within Civic Space: A Selection of Responses</title>
<p>The divergent styles of comic performance on offer across the broadcast media held varying amounts of appeal for our respondents. As we noted previously, the generically innovative <italic>Miliband of Brothers</italic> caused initial confusion for a number of them, making them uncertain about the extent of its “spoof” elements, especially those, like Olivia here, who professed to have limited knowledge of politics:</p>
<speech><speaker>Olivia:</speaker> <p>You see, I thought they were spoof interviews as well. [Did you?] I didn’t think it was them necessarily being that serious about it [why was that?]</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Olivia:</speaker> <p>… because I don’t know a lot of politics, I didn’t know they were real people who were actually supposed to be important or not [laughter] but I just thought they were sort of taking the mick. When that first guy came on, he was like, I just thought that was part of the joke.</p></speech>
<p>Olivia’s inability to distinguish “real” contributors from actors across the segments, and her characterization of Kinnock, Rawnsley, and King as “people who were actually supposed to be important,” is indicative of her own perceived distance from the political and media elites portrayed. This confusion is augmented by the unusual format of the program, with its arch stylizing of the interview segments. Olivia goes on to apologize for “lowering the tone of our group,” a semi-serious reflection on what her admissions possibly reveal about herself, and the rest of her group, in their roles as citizen-viewers.</p>
<p>In another group, consisting of women aged 40 and upwards, the unusual formal and aesthetic qualities of the comedy docudrama again provoked initial uncertainty:</p>
<speech><speaker>Alice:</speaker> <p>the way you introduced it I thought it was going to be serious [what started to get in the way of that view?] It seemed to be, well, I’m not too sure what was going on, it seemed to be too light-hearted to be serious but, as I say, I’m not sure what was going on actually.</p></speech>
<p>In this group, subsequent discussion led to commentary on specific visual aspects of the presentation, read as too incongruous to support a “serious” interpretation:</p>
<speech><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <p>I think it was funny right at the beginning because they were sitting in very small chairs and very small places. It gave the impression of being political comedy, it didn’t look, to me, it didn’t look right, I was ready to laugh at it, I thought it was very good.</p></speech>
<p>Emma’s interpretation of the presentation as comic is given a further twist by Mabel, who saw this as itself thematically motivated:</p>
<speech><speaker>Mabel:</speaker> <p>well, I think, it’s highlighting the rivalry between two brothers. It’s not edifying anyway, these two brothers are trying to become head of a political party and head of a country. Then that is even worse, you want reason, don’t you, you don’t want fighting siblings, Tweedledum and Tweedledee sort of thing.</p></speech>
<p>In portraying the brothers’ rivalry with comic distortion, the program, for Mabel, depicts high-level politics as a sacrifice of “reason” to the pettiness of “fighting siblings.” This note of disapproval, possibly for the Milibands’ decision to compete for the leadership, as well as for the subsequent media portrayal, was a reaction found in other groups as well:</p>
<speech><speaker>Sally:</speaker> <p>yeah, I mean it’s … I don’t know, I got quite wound up by even the news coverage of all the Milibands, it did become so much about the, well, “this rivalry might be this, might be happening behind closed doors” and “said to be feeling this that and the other.” There was too much of that and there was actually nothing about any real politics and I think the danger of programs like that is that it just feeds off that and then you become, it’s almost like reality television instead of thinking about …</p></speech>
<p>Sally’s comment presupposes normative judgments about what constitutes “real politics” and the related civic role of the media. For her, <italic>Miliband of Brothers</italic>, in its playful focus on the personal dimension of political events, can be seen as part of a worrying “reality television” trend in mediated politics.</p>
<p>These responses to <italic>Miliband</italic> hint at the negative or limited role for imitative comic treatments of politics: mockery and ridicule of political persons alienates those who cannot “get the joke” due to prior gaps in political knowledge and discourages further serious engagement with politics. By contrast, responses to the <italic>News Quiz</italic> were generally positive in their appraisals of the <italic>civic usefulness</italic> of this more traditional and generically straightforward form of satirical performance. In three out of the four groups that heard the <italic>News Quiz</italic> clip discussed previously, there was a general consensus that it was one of the most engaging media extracts in the session. This included not only regular listeners but also respondents previously unfamiliar with it:</p>
<speech><speaker>Fiona:</speaker> <p>I just love that program. Absolutely love it.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Alice:</speaker> <p>It sort of makes—you’re all sort of there, got your own feelings about the cuts, one way or the other, and it sort of exaggerates them and your own inner feelings of them, and you know it’s exaggerating whatever but it’s quite good that they’re thinking the same way as you are, perhaps.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <p>I think humor’s a very good way to get the message across and Jeremy Hardy does it very well, and it annoyed me when comparisons were being made about the coalition government in the war and now, and I think he got to it so well, and he had us all listening. If a politician had been going on like that, I’d have switched off in about ten seconds, but I listened to the whole of what he was saying because the humor was there but he was also making a strong political point.</p></speech>
<p>The gratification of these <italic>News Quiz</italic> fans is not just a matter of its comic yield, but has a specifically political character, albeit through reinforcing their existing attitudes to coalition policy and politicians’ modes of delivery rather than introducing new ones. In another group, <italic>News Quiz</italic> newbie Olivia seems to get <italic>more</italic> out of the politics of the extract than she does from its humor, and she ends by endorsing Hardy’s metaphor and political argument:</p>
<speech><speaker>Olivia:</speaker> <p>Em, I laughed a bit. But it wouldn’t be something I’d ever choose to listen to, but the bit where he was on about his house, well I presume it’s a house that he owns, that, for a couple of seconds made me think, well, it’s true that everyone’s in debt but you don’t suddenly stop, you know, living, so, but it wouldn’t probably … I think it did, it was a well made point made as a joke, which makes you think, it is a bit ridiculous, the cuts, when, you know, every person is in debt who’s got a house.</p></speech>
<p>Another kind of response involved naturalizing the comic response to politics as a strategy of a powerless and frustrated citizenry:</p>
<speech><speaker>Ben:</speaker> <p>… it’s like, yeah the country’s gone to pot, what can we do?, let’s joke about it… . Yes, we’ve actually got terrible politicians but at least we can have jokes about them. It sort of, it does make you feel a little bit better in a twisted way.</p></speech>
<p>Ben identifies this resigned outlook as a British trait, with comedy performing a civic function, sweetening the bitter pill of collective impotence with laughter. While this example characterizes our political leaders as “terrible” in generalized terms, the distortive descriptions of the <italic>News Quiz</italic> radio extract also prompted discussion of politics as routinely funny or ridiculous in its own right:</p>
<speech><speaker>Marie:</speaker> <p>Yeah, I mean there was a point there which was like, mocking backbenchers [members of parliament who are neither government ministers nor opposition “shadow” ministers]. Well, if you look at the Labour backbenchers, they’re just as bad. Backbenchers are, they’re rowdy, they just go for it, you can’t—but obviously, it’s just comedy, it wasn’t—you just laugh at it … [and do you think there’s a political point to it, he’s not only funny but he’s also right?]</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Marie:</speaker> <p>Yeah. Well, politicians are mad. I think they are. You watch Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday and you just, ah, it’s just unreal how like children, almost, they’re up and they’re screaming at each other …</p></speech>
<p>Initially, Marie is reflecting critically on how Hardy confines his mockery to Conservative and Liberal Democrat backbenchers when Labour MPs are “just as bad.” This criticism does not prevent her from finding the clip funny, progressing from this to a comment on the inherent ridiculousness of politicians’ behavior during Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) (broadcast on BBC Parliament and BBC2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1527476412453947">7</xref></sup> Another respondent then interjects: “I’ve seen that <italic>show</italic>.” This adds to an impression of respondents’ experiencing PMQs as “showtime” politics: its dramaturgical elements have induced a sense of <italic>civic irony</italic>, to adapt a theatrical notion, by which the supreme civic space for representing the people’s interests instead becomes a televised pantomime or “comedy of errors,” provoking hilarity not at the politicians’ own jokes, but at the ludicrousness of the parliamentary performance in its entirety.</p>
<p>In these final reactions, although the respondents are offering ostensibly positive feelings and thoughts about the role of comedy in civic life, they hint at a problematic paradox of critique through ridicule. <italic>Personal investment</italic> in the political appears to be delimited and even discouraged by portrayals of politics in which its particular and generalized deficits are brought to the fore. The pleasures of political comedy are often negotiated with a sense of (ironic) distance from civic space, manifested most clearly in responses to political persons and in the explicit appreciation of the distancing and distorting devices of media form.</p>

<sec id="section7-1527476412453947" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Using only illustrative examples, we have attempted to explore issues concerning the generic profile of the comic in mediated civic space and the kinds of response comic forms generate. In doing so, we have drawn upon British instances, well aware that national specificity in political system and in media profile will be a factor in just how comedy plays into civic subjectivity and action. We noted earlier that forms of comedy are widely seen as a component of democratic vitality, providing a degree of disrespectful distance from the power system and the power elite, augmenting the grounds for critical engagement and renewal. Many comic forms construct a community of complicity among those who enjoy them that can strengthen a sense (if only temporary and partial) of “us” against “them.” However, in certain political settings, modes of disrespectful distance can also work as components of political accommodation, in which modes of the ironic, whatever antagonistic engagement they may appear to signal, act finally to reconcile strands of critique with strands of acceptance.</p>
<p>Certainly, to view matters from the top down, official British politics appears to have accommodated itself to a wide array of comic media presentations, including derision, with little fear of a risk to its principal supporting structures and processes. An acceptance of being occasionally the target of comic portrayal, including derision, is seen as yet another part of performing the contemporary political persona within circumstances of intensified media visibility.</p>
<p>These nonthreatening versions of the politics-comedy relationship may occur more readily when the broad sense of the farcical aspect of politics and of power elites informs civic consciousness more pervasively than any focused, urgent, and perhaps angry perception of specific deficits and alternatives. Clearly, research on the comic within civic culture needs always to be mindful of the wider, changing dynamics that determine the inflections and impact that humor can carry.</p>
<p>We should offer here a brief comment on how the Web, dealt with in more detail elsewhere in this issue, might figure in the profile we have presented. The complex, multifaceted character of cyberspace makes defining its opportunities for political comedy difficult to summarize, due to its “magpie” tendencies to embrace and adapt material from across a broad range of traditional media platforms. Similar to the <italic>imitative</italic> comic portrayals mentioned earlier, mash-up or remixing of “found footage” concentrates its humor on the particular gestures or speech of politicians, using repetition and deliberate temporal disjuncture for comic emphasis: the remediation of material <italic>imitates</italic> the original mediated performance, despite the politician playing himself or herself. Additionally, the Web enables audience connectivity and shared responses to “real-time” broadcasting and other content through social media sites such as Twitter, official and unofficial forums, and comment threads. The late-night U.S. comedy program, <italic>The Colbert Report</italic>, encourages co-creation of content for the TV program, while fans have produced their own online spin-off Wikipedia parody site, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Wikiality.com">Wikiality.com</ext-link>; “the truthiness encyclopaedia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412453947">Jones 2009</xref>, 227). The question remains whether new comic opportunities are transformative for the civic project and whether a comedy of ideas, or an argumentative style of comedy requiring a committed investment from its audience, can emerge in “native” Web form (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476412453947">Marx 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412453947">Shifman et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of national variations, our analysis has worked with a sense that comedy is a pervasive element of much contemporary political mediation and civic consciousness. It has highlighted some of the formal, aesthetic, and thematic variety of comic performance as it works upon diverse materials and tried to indicate the complexity of how that material is interpreted and judged. Inquiries with similar kinds of agenda to ours, ones that might take further such issues as the demographic profile of political comedy and the interconnections between comic discourses and the changing forms of “news,” are sure to provide an illuminating strand of research on media-civic relations in the future.</p>

<p>It was in the non-broadcast output that we sampled, notably newspaper political sketch-writing and political cartoons, that satirical treatment was seen at its strongest, sometimes raising problems of comprehension for the respondents to whom we showed it as a result of its vocabulary, range of political references, or (in cartoons) its requirement for rapid visual recognition.</p>

<p>Prime Minister’s Questions is a thirty-minute slot on Wednesdays in the House of Commons when the Prime Minister responds directly to questions from other Members, including the Leader of the Opposition. A larger than normal attendance is typical on these occasions, and combative, partisan exchanges are expected.
