<p>In many ways Cleveland is an archetypical American city. For a time, it sat on the edge of the American frontier, carved from the original northwest territory wilderness of the United States. Its early political and cultural influences borrowed heavily from the Yankee cities of the Northeast, particularly those of Connecticut, whose population migrated to the Firelands of the Western Reserve after the War of Independence. Later, like many of its sister cities clustered around the Great Lakes, Cleveland served as an important transportation hub for goods and services.</p>
<p>Within three of decades of its founding, Cleveland became an important locus for manufacturing of all types. Its growth advanced due to an economically favorable location on the Ohio Canal and then railroad rights of way, its entrepreneurial class of business owners, and its abundant natural resources. Cleveland’s stride toward increased geographic size, wealth, and population and its importance as an innovator for the nation’s businesses and industries led to an ever-greater significance nationally as a manufacturing center in the decades following the Civil War. The positive momentum of those trends slowed, but continued through World War II.</p>
<p>Despite the leaping growth of the Cleveland economy, population, physical space, and infrastructure over its first 150 years, the negative by-products of poverty and homelessness were also present and growing. At the city’s Centennial celebration in 1896, prominent women affiliated with the Western Reserve Historical Society sent a time capsule message to their sisters to be opened at the time of Cleveland Bicentennial in 1996. It read in part,
<disp-quote>
<p>“We bequeath to you a city … prosperous and beautiful, and yet far from our ideal. Many of the people are poor, and some are vainly seeking work at living wages. Often they who have employment are forced to filch hours for work from the hours that should be given to rest, recreation and study… Children (are) robbed of their childhood, vice parading the streets and less-than-perfect government.” [“Cleveland Catches Glimpse of 1896 in Time Capsule.” <italic>L.A. Times</italic>. January 07, 1996].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The phenomenon of homelessness in a growing, affluent society and the policies and actions which public officials, civic, and business leaders took in Cleveland to address it, provides the starting point for Daniel Kerr’s well-researched book, <italic>Derelect Paradise: Homelessness and Urban Development in Cleveland, Ohio</italic>. As Kerr explains the origins, nature, and institutional forms of homelessness in Cleveland, his narrative informs our understanding of the large scale economic, political, and social transformations that have vexed and challenged American cities since the early decades of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>There is much to appreciate about this book. Kerr contributes to our understanding of what many public and private civic leaders consider intractable urban residential poverty: failed and discriminatory public housing policy, the strengths and weaknesses of community organizing to solve social and economic problems, contributions of the Communist Party in the 1920s, the uses and pitfalls of urban renewal public planning, the costs to affordable housing of postwar interstate highway development, and the clumsily thoughtless and parochial treatment of the races and ethnicities by local policymakers. Kerr uses his own experiences as an advocate and organizer of homeless and hourly working wage earners in the late 1990s and early 2000s to inform his characterizations of the various local players, the tone of the narrative, and in his analysis and conclusions.</p>
<p>As an historian, Kerr has put his finger on an important, seminal event in Cleveland history. The reaction of Cleveland’s private and business leaders to the Railroad Strike of 1877 marked a point in time when leaders began a pattern of paternalistic control that shaped much of the development and growth as a leading city of the early twentieth century, to visit both for leisure and to conduct business. In such a place, the public sector worked with business to minimize disruptions to the labor force and perceived unnecessary costs to businesses.</p>
<p>In tracing homelessness and the public/private collaborations that arose to address it, we learn that Cleveland leaders followed heavy-handed and non-subtle methods of care for the city’s most financially vulnerable and impoverished residents. For example, the primary institution for the homeless was the privately run and publicly supported Wayfarers Lodge, a dormitory-like building for men with moralistic entry requirements. Little or no provision was made for single women and women with children until the development of working-class public housing developments in the 1930s.</p>
<p>In considering the example of Cleveland in the past as a city worthy of our scrutiny, <italic>Derelict Paradise</italic> has provided an important starting point to inform our thinking today. And as we consider looking to the next fifty years, we owe a debt of gratitude to Kerr, who in writing this book, performs an extremely valuable service by sifting through the primary research sources and complex threads of Cleveland history. His work tells us that a twenty-first-century city with a shrinking population, aged housing stock, creeping suburban poverty, and uncontrolled expansion can undo the dysfunction of the past if leaders understand the themes and sources of negative policies and practices.</p>
<p>Using a twenty-first-century lens, Kerr leaves us with the sense that local civic and business leaders should have offered greater vision in addressing a changing world that had passed by Cleveland’s “old” residential places and industry. From Kerr, we also learn that the downside of Cleveland leaders’ enthusiastic embrace of postwar federal urban redevelopment programs held severe consequences and a basic injustice that burdens the city to this day.</p>
