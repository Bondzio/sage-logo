<abstract>
<p>This article argues that a holistic approach is important when studying the European Union’s (EU) role as an international security actor, but at the same time it identifies problems in adopting such a comprehensive research agenda. The holistic approach entails that the research must include ‘new’ security problems, such as climate change, but also relevant policies and instruments outside the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). However, owing to conceptual, legal and political obstacles, this has been difficult to achieve; as a consequence, existing research on the EU as an international security actor tends to narrow down the focus to just one framework: the CSDP and its operations. This may lead to a distorted image, because the EU’s role in international security surpasses any single policy framework. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, it sets the framework for the comprehensive research agenda concerning the EU as an international security actor. Second, it identifies key obstacles that are making this holistic approach methodologically and conceptually difficult. In this context, the Lisbon Treaty, formally abandoning the pillar structure of the EU, provides an opportunity to mitigate at least some of these roadblocks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><disp-quote><p>‘The relative decline of questions of “high politics”, the rise of economic diplomacy and a wider definition of pre-requisites for security all enhance the international significance of the Union’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0010836711433126">Whitman, 1998</xref>: 234)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Two recent instances of the European Union’s (EU) international security policy indicate the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach when assessing the EU as an international security actor. On the one hand, an explicit conceptualization of climate change as a security challenge reinforces the ‘human security’ approach often present in EU’s official documents and narratives. It provides a compelling case for scholars to include ‘new’ security problems when analysing EU security policy. On the other hand, the EU’s response to maritime piracy off the coast of Somalia serves as a confirmation that security instruments in the policy apparatus of the EU are located within the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), but also outside this policy framework; they include, for example, a range of financial instruments that enable security problems to be addressed over the medium and long term, such as the Instrument for Stability and European Development Fund.</p>
<p>There is a growing body of scholarship that incorporates this broadened approach to studying EU security policy, moving beyond traditional security problems and the CSDP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010836711433126">1</xref></sup> For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010836711433126">Cottey (2007</xref>: 192–216), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0010836711433126">Keukeleire and MacNaughtan (2008</xref>: 249–52) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010836711433126">Hintermeier (2008</xref>: 666–667) include more traditional security threats within their empirical analysis, but also examine the EU’s role in addressing ‘new’ security challenges, such as climate change and HIV/AIDS, more in line with contemporary Security Studies literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010836711433126">Buzan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010836711433126">Collins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0010836711433126">Williams, 2008</xref>). There is also a significant body of scholarship on European civilian crisis management, which approaches security in a holistic manner (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010836711433126">Boin and Ekengren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010836711433126">Boin et al., 2008</xref>). This article builds on this scholarship by addressing some of the challenges identified in this literature (notably, the lack of coherence in EU action). It also broadens the geographical scope of this literature, in order to demonstrate the EU’s security role beyond its neighbourhood and particularly the Balkans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0010836711433126">Møller, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, scholars increasingly take into account non-CSDP, security-focused instruments and policies of the EU. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0010836711433126">Kirchner (2006</xref>: 962–963) argues that states have lost monopoly on providing security and have emerged as one type of participant in a cooperative system. In this cooperative system, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0010836711433126">Marsh and Mackenstein (2005</xref>: 15), the European Community emerged as an international security actor, by contributing to the Western European zone of peace and by establishing a dense network of economic and humanitarian agreements with the rest of the world. Ekengren (2011), through referring to the concept of societal security<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010836711433126">2</xref></sup> in the EU and linking security with disaster response,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010836711433126">3</xref></sup> argues that CSDP missions in Congo and Guinea-Bissau have emphasized the need in the EU to rethink the demarcation lines between policy areas such as trade, aid, diplomacy and civilian and military crisis management capabilities. However, the author also identifies some challenges to this integrated approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010836711433126">Ekengren, 2010</xref>: 108–110; please see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836711433126">Britz, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0010836711433126">Regelsberger (2007)</xref> further points to the process of ‘fusion’ of the EU’s intergovernmental security cooperation, including through the processes of ‘socialization’ or ‘Brusselization’.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, there is more to the EU’s international security profile than the relatively recent CSDP framework and capacities. Indeed, the EU’s security policy is multidimensional, seemingly well equipped to tackle contemporary security challenges in a comprehensive manner. However, if the EU is actively broadening its view of security and utilizing a wide range of measures in responding to contemporary security problems, why is it so difficult to take a systematic account of all these measures? The scholarship adopting such an all-encompassing stance is still in the minority, with the prevailing approach reflecting the post-Maastricht division into economic and international security policies, until recently embedded in the first and second pillars of the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0010836711433126">Knodt and Princen, 2003</xref>: 2–3).</p>
<p>This article argues that there are significant stumbling blocks preventing a more systematic, comprehensive analysis. The two case studies examined in this article exemplify these problems. First, the case of the EU and climate security points to the conceptual difficulties in delimiting security from non-security policies, as well as to the real differences in threat perceptions across the EU. Second, the case of the EU and Somali piracy raises the question about an overarching strategic vision behind the range of the EU’s short and long-term security measures; it also points out an interrelated problem of utilizing all those measures in a consistent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010836711433126">Bretherton and Vogler, 2006</xref>: 211–212). The Lisbon Treaty addresses some of these challenges, but will its reforms lead to a more holistic approach to studying the role of the EU as an international security actor?</p>

<title>The challenge of vertical coherence: ‘New’ security problems</title>
<p>The European Security Strategy (ESS) – a document drafted by former High Representative Javier Solana and approved by the European Council in 2003 – provides for a broad understanding of security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836711433126">Council, 2003</xref>). It identifies more traditional security threats, such as weapons of mass destruction (WMD), but also points to global warming and poverty as the possible causes of conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836711433126">Biscop, 2008</xref>: 8–13). These non-traditional or ‘new’ security issues have been further elevated in the Report on the Implementation of the ESS in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010836711433126">Council, 2008f</xref>.). In this document, energy security and climate change are identified as global challenges and key threats, alongside the proliferation of WMDs, organized crime and terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010836711433126">Council, 2008f</xref>.: 3–6).</p>
<p>The EU’s broad approach to international security reflects the widening (new security threats) and deepening (new referent objects of security) of the international security agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0010836711433126">Williams, 2008</xref>: 7–9). Problems previously overshadowed by a nuclear rivalry between major powers and labelled as ‘low politics’ have become recognized for their impact on the security of millions beyond the Western world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010836711433126">Annan, 2005</xref>). This process has been facilitated by the shift away from an exclusive focus on ‘present’ existential threats towards a more probabilistic approach, focusing on diffuse risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0010836711433126">McInnes, 2008</xref>: 276). Thus, Security Studies experts are not dismissing more traditional security threats, but they also incorporate the analysis of the nexus between security and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010836711433126">Elbe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0010836711433126">McInnes, 2008</xref>), poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0010836711433126">Thomas, 2008</xref>) and climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010836711433126">Barnett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010836711433126">Dalby, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010836711433126">De Wilde, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010836711433126">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In its official narrative, the EU often subscribes to the concept of human security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010836711433126">European Commission, 2010</xref>: 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010836711433126">Council, 2008f</xref>.: 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010836711433126">European Council, 2006</xref>), institutionalized in the United Nation’s (UN) Human Development Report from 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0010836711433126">United Nations Development Program (UNDP), 1994</xref>: 22–46). Human Security entails moving beyond territorial defence and national interests to include universal concerns such as unemployment, drugs, crime, pollution and human rights violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0010836711433126">UNDP, 1994</xref>: 22).</p>
<p>Yet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0010836711433126">McDonald (2002)</xref> argues that international actors do not rationally ‘choose’ any given approach to international security. Instead, ‘issues such as history, culture and identity shape what is rational, appropriate and possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0010836711433126">McDonald, 2002</xref>: 286). Consequently, ‘human security’ frames the positions of actors for which it is relevant, instead of actors purposefully adhering to ‘human security’ as the ‘right’ security narrative for them. If the EU’s international identity is pacific, principled, consensus-based, networked-based, open and contra-Westphalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0010836711433126">Manners and Whitman, 2003</xref>: 398–399), then ‘human security’ appears to fit well.</p>
<p>In particular, human security underpins the EU’s commitment to link security objectives with development policy. The security-development nexus is an overarching theme of the ESS, but also of the European Consensus on Development – the key statement on guidelines for the EU’s development policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010836711433126">European Council, 2006</xref>). The Consensus notes that ‘Insecurity and violent conflict are amongst the biggest obstacles to achieving the MDGs [Millennium Development Goals]’ and, as a consequence, ‘Security and development are important and complementary aspects of EU relations with third countries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010836711433126">European Council, 2006</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a rather contested manner, security objectives were included within the 2005 Amended Cotonou Partnership Agreement, updating the original treaty between the European Community and 77 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. Although the original goal of poverty reduction was retained, the 2005 document commits ACP states to a set of security objectives, including: (a) the prevention of mercenary activities, (b) the subscription by all parties to the International Criminal Court; (c) the combat of terrorism and (d) the countering of the proliferation of WMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010836711433126">Hadfield, 2007</xref>: 57–63). The 2010 revision of the Cotonou Agreement adds the pursuit of ‘human security’ as one of the key objectives, including a much stronger focus on combating HIV/AIDS and addressing climate change as the main threat to MDGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010836711433126">European Commission, 2010</xref>: 16–18).</p>
<p>Regardless of the extent to which it is the EU which rationally chooses its approach to international security, or it is ‘chosen’ based on the EU’s particular history, identity and culture, the broad, human-focused approach to security has important consequences for research. On the one hand, it is important to incorporate this broader security agenda when studying the EU as an international security actor. On the other hand, at least two problems arise with the EU’s ‘human security’ approach; these include: (a) delimiting security from non-security problems, and (b) the challenge of vertical consistency (between Member States and the EU). The following section demonstrates these problems on the example of the case study concerning the EU’s policy on climate security.</p>
<sec id="section3-0010836711433126">
<title>The EU and climate security</title>
<p>The correlation between the environment and security was already recognized to some extent in the 1970s and 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010836711433126">Brown, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010836711433126">Buzan, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010836711433126">Falk, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0010836711433126">Ullman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0010836711433126">Westing, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0010836711433126">World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), 1987</xref>), but this and other non-traditional security problems were of marginal interest in the Cold War context. Environmental security gained more prominence in the 1990s, when the discussion mainly evolved around the impact of environmental change on conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010836711433126">Homer-Dixon, 1999</xref>). In recent years, following the publication of a number of influential scientific reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010836711433126">German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU), 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010836711433126">Haldén, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010836711433126">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0010836711433126">Stern, 2007</xref>), the discussion on environmental security has increasingly become focused on the security impacts of climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0010836711433126">Trombetta, 2009</xref>: 138).</p>
<p>As a consequence, climate security was integrated into the security agenda of major international organizations. In 2007, the topic was discussed by the UN Security Council at the initiative of the UK; the discussion enjoyed strong support of Pacific island states and the EU, but some major powers (the US, China, Pakistan) were sceptical whether this was an appropriate forum for this talk. In the same year, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), on a Spanish initiative, adopted the Madrid Declaration on Environmental Security. NATO has been redefining its approach to security already throughout the 1990s. In 2008, the NATO Security Science Forum on Environmental Security organized a major conference followed by the inclusion of climate change in the 2010 NATO Strategic Concept.</p>
<p>In this context, the EU has emerged as the world’s leading ‘norm entrepreneur’, promoting the idea of linking climate change with security, and thus adopting appropriate policies at the EU and global levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0010836711433126">Zwolski and Kaunert, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010836711433126">5</xref></sup> The dominating approach in the EU to climate security is that of climate change as a ‘threat multiplier’, putting a particular strain on states and regions that are already fragile and vulnerable to conflict. The EU adopts a broad view of climate change posing humanitarian (human security) risks, but also bearing political and security consequences directly affecting the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010836711433126">High Representative and Commission, 2008</xref>: 2). This EU position on climate security was defined in the high-profile Joint Report of the European Commission and the High Representative on ‘Climate Change and International Security’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010836711433126">High Representative and Commission, 2008</xref>) requested by Member States in 2007.</p>
<p>In this document, approved by the European Council in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010836711433126">Council, 2008a</xref>: 14), the EU explores the consequences of climate change for international security and stability, identifying threats such as conflicts over resources, economic damage and risk to coastal cities, loss of territory and border disputes and environmentally induced migration. The report also recommends that the EU becomes an international leader in addressing climate security by developing appropriate capacities internally and promoting climate security agenda in its bilateral and multilateral relations. Findings of this report were incorporated into the Report on the Implementation of the ESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010836711433126">Council, 2008f</xref>.: 5–6).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the approval of the Joint Report by the EU prompted the Commission and Council Secretariat to establish an informal Steering Group on Climate Change and International Security with the purpose of further developing climate security agenda at the EU and global levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0010836711433126">Zwolski and Kaunert, 2011</xref>: 32–37). All the Member States were invited to participate in this informal setting, but only a few decided to join the group, including Germany, the UK, Denmark, Sweden and Slovenia.</p>
<p>At the end of 2009, the following achievements of the Steering Group were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010836711433126">Council, 2009</xref>: 4–8): (a) Promoting the climate security agenda at the UN, including the EU’s involvement in preparing a UN Secretary General’s report on climate security, at the request of the UN General Assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0010836711433126">United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), 2009</xref>: 2); (b) initiating and promoting dialogue with third parties, including raising the issue of climate security with more than 40 countries; (c) anchoring the climate security agenda in the EU, including the identification of climate change as one of the global challenges and key threats in the Report on the Implementation of the ESS; and (d) initiating capacity building within the EU and externally, including climate security training for EU staff and improving EU early warning capacities.</p>
<p>On top of promoting the climate security agenda, the EU remains the most ambitious actor in multilateral negotiations on climate change within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0010836711433126">Kilian and Elgström, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0010836711433126">Parker and Karlsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0010836711433126">Wurzel and Connelly, 2010</xref>). Although the EU did not succeed in convincing parties to adopt Kyoto-like, legally binding obligations at the 2009 UNFCCC summit in Copenhagen, it set for itself some ambitious goals, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020. Furthermore, it pledged around one-third of the sum committed by parties for adaptation to climate change in developing countries between 2010 and 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0010836711433126">World Resources Institute, 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0010836711433126">
<title>Incorporating ‘new’ security problems in the research agenda</title>
<p>This analysis indicates the importance of including ‘new’ security problems, such as climate change, when evaluating the EU as an international security actor. However, at least two problems arise immediately: one rather obvious, the other slightly more concealed. An obvious challenge concerns the boundaries of ‘security’ in the EU’s international policy. One of Solana’s former advisors rightly points out that: ‘It is in the DNA of our organisation to define security problems broadly.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010836711433126">6</xref></sup> Yet, this presents the challenge of delimiting security from non-security policies of the Union. If climate change, AIDS and poverty are included within the EU’s security agenda, which specific policy actions can be assessed in the context of the EU’s role as a security actor, and which fall merely under environmental, health and development policies?</p>
<p>This seemingly trivial choice bears considerable consequences for the analysis, because the extent to which the EU can be considered a security actor depends largely on the definition of security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0010836711433126">Kirchner, 2006</xref>: 952; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0010836711433126">Rieker, 2009</xref>: 704). Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836711433126">Biscop (2008</xref>: 12) argues that the ESS should have been named a foreign policy strategy and that the label ‘security’ must be reserved for issues posing an effective threat of violence. This critique echoes the more general dilemma concerning human security: ‘How to delimit the concept, and how to judge which insecurities to honour when conflicting concerns are at stake’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010836711433126">Buzan and Hansen, 2009</xref>: 204).</p>
<p>The European Consensus on Development exemplifies this dilemma, emphasizing the correlation between development and security and the necessity for the EU to pursue both values in its external policy. At the same time, the document fails to specify which objectives will be given priority when values conflict with each other. For example, the EU wants to give priority to local ownership (a popular Euro catch-phrase), but at the same time to press authoritarian regimes for democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0010836711433126">Youngs, 2008</xref>: 421).</p>
<p>This dilemma also points to another subtle distinction in the EU’s approach to security, between the strand relating to instability, conflict and insecurity in developing countries (which are the most vulnerable to ‘new’ security problems) and the EU’s own security concerns. While both understandings of security are amply addressed in the ESS and other strategic documents, the second strand remains contested and raises questions about the EU’s real intentions in Africa and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0010836711433126">Youngs, 2008</xref>: 422).</p>
<p>The less obvious challenge to incorporating ‘new’ security problems within the research agenda concerns vertical consistency (between national and EU policies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0010836711433126">Nuttall, 2005</xref>: 106). A high level of vertical consistency entails that Member States comply with the policies agreed upon at the EU level. The case of climate security has demonstrated that all Member States have, in principle, approved the move towards developing the security dimension of climate change in EU policy. Elsewhere, the author elaborates on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0010836711433126">Zwolski and Kaunert, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, this principled acceptance of the climate security narrative by all Member States at the EU level does not preclude significant differences at national levels. If the international identity of the EU is pacific, principled, consensus-based, networked-based, open and contra-Westphalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0010836711433126">Manners and Whitman, 2003</xref>: 398–399), the identities of Member States vary considerably. These identities, forming particular security cultures, are shaped by the factors such as: (a) internal cultural cohesion; (b) interactions with neighbours; (c) defeat and occupation; (d) threat perception; (e) past martial or imperial ambitions and traditions; (f) impermeability and durability of national borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010836711433126">Howorth, 2007</xref>: 178).</p>
<p>Consequently, countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) attribute relatively less importance to ‘new’ security challenges due to their distinctive historical experiences and their ongoing insecurities concerning Russia’s foreign policy intentions. In the case of Poland, this traditional view is reinforced by the dominance of right-wing political parties and the influence of nationalistic media outlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0010836711433126">Zwolski, 2009a</xref>). As a result, for the most part, CEE countries do not play an active role in the Steering Group on Climate Change and International Security. This is how one CEE state representative explains this absence: ‘The EU, under “climate security” label, does not do anything new. Thus, it does not really matter whether my country is part of the Steering Group, because we basically do the same things.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010836711433126">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is not only CEE countries that often differ in their perceptions of ‘new’ security problems from older EU Member States. Following the approval of the Joint Report on Climate Change and International Security by the European Council in March 2008, the Council Secretariat drafted the follow-up report with some more specific recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010836711433126">Council, 2008b</xref>). It was thus expected in the Council Secretariat that it would be the December 2008 European Council discussing these recommendations. Instead, the French Presidency did not find room for this agenda item, submitting it instead to the December 2008 Agriculture and Fisheries Council, which merely acknowledged the document (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010836711433126">Council, 2008e</xref>: 49).</p>
<p>These two roadblocks to incorporating ‘new’ security problems within the research on the EU as an international security actor must be acknowledged, but cannot prevent a more holistic research agenda. The challenge to vertical consistency in EU security policy, together with the conceptual problems associated with the post-Cold War understanding and delimiting security, will not disappear in the foreseeable future. At the same time, narrowing down the analysis to the security policies undertaken by the EU exclusively within the CSDP framework runs the risk of distorting the complex image of the EU as an international security provider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0010836711433126">Sebesta, 2009</xref>: 590).</p>

<title>The problem of institutional/horizontal coherence: Moving beyond the CSDP</title>
<p>International security policy of the EU has traditionally been associated almost exclusively with the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), rebranded into the CSDP in the Lisbon Treaty. The establishment of the ESDP and the deployment of first EU missions attracted scholarly attention, contributing to the fact that the analysis of various aspects of the ESDP constitutes the bulk of scholarly work on the EU’s international security policy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010836711433126">Deighton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010836711433126">Duke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010836711433126">Howorth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0010836711433126">Menon, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010836711433126">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a good reason for this; the speed at which the ESDP has acquired its shape and the number of operations deployed up to date are remarkable and can be surprising even if missions are relatively modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0010836711433126">Toje, 2011</xref>: 51). When evaluating the first five years of the ESDP, Solana pointed to the paradox that while it remains difficult for Member States to cooperate on security and defence, the cooperation in these areas advanced rapidly since 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0010836711433126">Solana, 2004</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>This article suggests that the CSDP does not represent the entire image of the EU’s international security role; non-CSDP instruments and policies have to be included into the analysis. In this context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010836711433126">Hintermeier (2008)</xref> notes that the EU’s approach to security is based on two liberal institutionalist principles, that is (a) political integration, economic interdependence and multilateral cooperation, which weaken the anarchical system of states, and (b) the principle of democratic peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010836711433126">Hintermeier, 2008</xref>: 667). More specifically, the EU pursues its security objectives through integration and enlargement, promotion of liberal values, promotion of sustainable development, effective multilateralism and strengthening international law. These objectives are pursued by the EU through a variety of economic, political and recently also civilian and military CSDP means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010836711433126">Hintermeier, 2008</xref>: 670–673). Among measures that are both economic and political in nature, one of the most important is the range of financial and technical assistance instruments that have traditionally been at the disposal of the European Commission, and recently were partially incorporated within the European External Action Service (EEAS).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010836711433126">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most prominent of these financial instruments is the Instrument for Stability (IfS), which former member of the European Parliament (MEP) Angelica Beer (also EP’s rapporteur on the IfS) defined as an attempt to ‘define the Grey Zone between the Council’s CFSP, ESDP and the Commission’s development policy’, with the potential to ‘encourage active conflict prevention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010836711433126">Beer, 2006</xref>: 34). This instrument, building on the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM), allows the EU to respond rapidly to crisis situations, but also to develop longer-term, capacity-building projects. The regulation for the IfS allocated it the budget of €2.062 for the years 2007–2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010836711433126">European Parliament and the Council, 2006</xref>: 10) and the Commission proposed an increased budget of €2.5 billion for the IfS in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014–2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010836711433126">European Commission, 2011</xref>: 46).</p>
<p>The first component of the IfS, defined in article 3 of the regulation, concerns the provisions for assistance in response to situations of crisis or emerging crisis, which fulfils the primary aim of the IfS. The second component, regulated by article 4, concerns the provisions for providing assistance in the context of stable conditions for cooperation. Only about 23% of the overall IfS budget was allocated for ‘article 4’ types of projects, which may be developed in three security areas: (a) threats to law and order, to the security and safety of individuals, to critical infrastructure and to public health; (b) risk mitigation and preparedness relating to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials or agents; and (c) pre- and post-crisis capacity building.</p>
<p>Of these areas, non-proliferation was given priority; this enabled the European Commission to continue developing capacity-building non-proliferation programmes, primarily in Russia, further building on its already extensive experience in this area. The European Community started providing Russia with non-proliferation assistance as early as the beginning of the 1990s, first through the programme known as the Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States (TACIS), and since 2007 through the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation (INSC) and the IfS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010836711433126">Anthony, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010836711433126">Höhl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0010836711433126">Müller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0010836711433126">Zwolski, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0010836711433126">2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, non-CSDP instruments and policies have to be taken into account when investigating the EU’s response to maritime piracy off the coast of Somalia. This response consists mainly of the CSDP’s first naval operation EUNAVFOR ‘Atalanta’, but other (medium to long-term) efforts are also important. They are examined in greater detail in the following section, indicating the importance of adopting a holistic approach when assessing the EU as an international security actor.</p>
<p>However, the case of non-proliferation policy, counter-piracy measures and other security policies of the EU also indicate some obstacles hampering a more comprehensive research agenda, such as the problem of institutional and horizontal consistency between different EU institutions and policies. Following the brief empirical examination of the EU’s anti-piracy policy, the subsequent section addresses these obstacles and the efforts that have been undertaken to overcome them.</p>
<sec id="section6-0010836711433126">
<title>The EU and Somali piracy</title>
<p>Piracy off the coast of Somalia emerged as a security problem at the beginning of the 1990s, following the collapse of the central government in Mogadishu. While there have been a number of high-profile piratical attacks since then (including the attack on the US-operated cruise liner <italic>Seabourn Spirit</italic> in 2005), in 2008 the problem expanded and became an ever more urgent security threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010836711433126">Lehr and Lehmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0010836711433126">Lennox, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0010836711433126">Murphy, 2009</xref>: 101–111). Piracy continued to thrive throughout 2009 and 2010, with organized gangs moving further away from the coast of the Horn of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010836711433126">International Chamber of Commerce – Commercial Crime Services (ICC-CCS), 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>At the core of the African piracy problem is Somalia, which remains a thoroughly failed state torn by violence on a daily basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010836711433126">Bruton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010836711433126">Hesse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0010836711433126">Marchal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0010836711433126">Menkhaus, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0010836711433126">2009</xref>). It has no central government with control over the territory of the country, or even Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu. This condition of permanent insecurity contributes to Somalia’s disastrous economic and humanitarian situation, fostering acts of organized crime, including maritime piracy. Furthermore, there is no single state of Somalia to speak of; instead, there are three autonomous regions existing in parallel within the internationally recognized borders of Somalia (Somaliland and Puntland enjoy relatively stronger institutional capacities than the southern part of the country).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0010836711433126">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The EU got involved in countering Somali piracy in response to numerous calls by the UN Security Council (Resolutions 1814, 1816, 1838, 1846 and 1851). To this end, it deployed the largest naval mission to the region, EUNAVFOR ‘Atalanta’, which is the EU’s first naval operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010836711433126">Council, 2008d</xref>); thus, it adds a new component to an already broad EU experience of conducting limited-scale, land-based CSDP military and civilian missions. ‘Atalanta’, like all CSDP missions, relies entirely on the voluntary contribution of Member States. It comprises navy ships, surveillance airplanes and independent vessels protection detachments. The mission is commanded from the operational headquarters in Northwood, near London, and from the force headquarters on the ground in Djibouti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010836711433126">Council, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, the CSDP component includes the Maritime Security Centre Horn of Africa (MSCHOA), which is a web-based platform enabling ship-owners to register their vessels securely and to update their position. MSCHOA also contains a secure chat-room, which states and non-state actors fighting piracy in the region utilize to communicate on a minute-to-minute basis. Rear Admiral Philip Jones, formerly heading the EU task force, notes that MSCHOA ‘has been one of the unexpected and very significant successes of the operation, where almost all of the shipping companies that transit through the Gulf of Aden register’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010836711433126">Great Britain House of Lords, 2010</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>Yet, experts and policy-makers alike underline that piracy off the coast of Somalia also requires longer-term, non-military efforts if it is to be tackled effectively. Notably, a deputy commander of the EU’s anti-piracy task force Thomas Ernst indicates that: ‘It is arguable how much of a deterrent effect counter-piracy forces are having’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010836711433126">BBC News, 2010</xref>). He notes that the structures on which pirates rely must be targeted, most notably the flow of money to pirate gangs and the impunity of pirate leaders. Moreover, experts point to addressing the economic, political and social problems of the failed state of Somalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0010836711433126">Vego, 2009</xref>: 178).</p>
<p>In this context, the EU stresses the comprehensive nature of its counter-piracy efforts, going beyond an immediate military operation off the Horn of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010836711433126">Council, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010836711433126">b</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010836711433126">Council, 2008f</xref>.). These efforts are grouped into political engagement, support for security and economic assistance. Politically, the EU supports the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) – the only Somali authority recognized by the international community. In the sphere of security, the EU supports politically and financially the peace-keeping operation in Somalia called AMISOM, deployed by the African Union to protect the TFG against ongoing attacks of Islamist insurgents and warlords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010836711433126">Council, 2011b</xref>). The EU’s African Peace Facility, another security-oriented non-CSDP instrument, has been utilized to support AMISOM. Furthermore, in 2010, the EU launched its own training mission for Somali soldiers in Uganda, called EUTM Somalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010836711433126">Council, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the EU remains the biggest donor of development assistance to Somalia. This includes contributions of the European Commission and Member States. The main instrument utilized by the EU to provide development assistance to Somalia is the European Development Fund; through this instrument, the Commission has committed €215 million for Somalia for the years 2008–13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010836711433126">European Union, 2008</xref>). In addition to this assistance, the Commission has also contributed €45 million of humanitarian aid in 2009 and €35 million in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010836711433126">Council, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of this wide range of activities, the EU emphasizes that it is ‘building up a comprehensive engagement in Somalia, with a view to responding to the priority needs of the Somali people and stabilising Somalia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010836711433126">Council, 2011a</xref>: 1). Indeed, the EU’s set of instruments deployed directly against piracy, and addressing the root causes of the broader range of insecurities in Somalia, is significant. Through its naval task-force and the popularity of MSCHOA, the EU emerged as a leader in regional counter-piracy measures. Furthermore, being the largest contributor of development aid, the EU is also leading longer-term efforts to restore peace and security in Somalia.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the effectiveness of international counter-piracy measures, including these of the EU, remains questionable. In the first quarter of 2011, $65 million was paid in ransoms compared to $39 million in the same period in 2009, with pirates ‘becoming significantly more prevalent, lucrative and violent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0010836711433126">Willis Group Holdings, 2011</xref>). Moreover, two important questions about the EU’s security actorness arise. First, to what extent is the EU presenting a strategic, comprehensive security approach rather than purely a policy-sector specific reactive set of measures? And second, to what extent are EU’s policies and institutions consistent (horizontal and institutional consistency)?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0010836711433126">
<title>Incorporating non-CSDP policies within the research agenda</title>
<p>Just as it is vital to include ‘new’ security problems within the analysis of the EU as an international security actor, it is also important to move beyond the CSDP framework to explore the broader range of security instruments that the EU has at its disposal. The empirical evidence suggests that, indeed, the EU has been widely utilizing different forms of political and economic measures when addressing even the more traditional international security problems, such as the threat of the WMD proliferation and maritime piracy. Yet, a number of interconnected obstacles prevent a more systematic inclusion of this wide range of measures within the analysis of the EU’s performance in international security. The first concerns the question of the EU’s grand strategy and the extent to which these diverging instruments are deployed purposefully, reflecting clearly defined and codified strategic objectives of the EU.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010836711433126">Biscop (2009)</xref> argues that the ESS and the Report on the Implementation of the ESS provide only a partial strategy. These documents set guidelines for the EU’s international conduct, underlining preventive, holistic and multilateral character of the EU’s action, but they do not explain what exactly the EU should do. This lack of clearly specified objectives and priorities, according to Biscop, is particularly problematic in the wake of Lisbon Treaty institutional reforms, NATO’s new Strategic Concept and the growing political role of BRIC countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010836711433126">Biscop, 2009</xref>: 3). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010836711433126">Howorth (2010)</xref> seconds these concerns, arguing that ‘the EU should adopt a more calculated strategic approach and begin at long last to think in terms of “large goals”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010836711433126">Howorth, 2010</xref>: 464). Only then, Howorth argues, can the EU make the best use of the wide range of crisis management instruments that it has at its disposal.</p>
<p>The above analysis has demonstrated that the EU is able to draw on a vast array of resources when addressing organized crime, such as maritime piracy. However, even though the EU presents its political and economic efforts in Somalia as part of its ‘comprehensive approach’, listing them together with EUNAVFOR ‘Atalanta’, these longer-term measures do not serve explicitly the purpose of countering piracy. Instead, they are largely part of the EU’s pre-programmed development policies in Somalia, as well as its multilateral policy aiming to strengthen the TFG. The ‘grand strategy’ or ‘strategic vision’, in this case, could contribute to a clearer identification of a set of relevant policies that the EU deploys in specific security situations. This would prevent the impression of randomness in international security policy of the EU.</p>
<p>The second obstacle hindering a more systematic inclusion of non-CSDP instruments and policies within the analysis of the EU as an international security actor concerns the traditional problem of institutional and horizontal inconsistency – the challenge closely related to the one discussed above. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0010836711433126">Nuttall’s (2005)</xref> categorization, horizontal consistency entails that different EU policies are aligned and support each other. Institutional consistency, on the other hand, has traditionally concerned the degree to which the Council and the Commission have been coordinating their policies and supporting each other’s actions. The Lisbon Treaty introduces important changes in this respect, discussed further in this section.</p>
<p>The problem of assuring inter-pillar consistency in the international security policy of the EU has attracted significant scholarly attention, and rightly so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010836711433126">Dijkstra, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0010836711433126">Missiroli, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0010836711433126">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0010836711433126">Tietje, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0010836711433126">Van Elsuwege, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0010836711433126">Zwolski, 2011a</xref>). The growing profile of the European Commission in international relations, particularly through its Directorate General for External Relations (DG Relex), coincided with the international role of the Council, including its Secretariat. Notably, the Council Secretariat has been steadily growing in quantitative (number of officials) and qualitative (number of policies) terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010836711433126">Hayes-Renshaw and Wallace, 2006</xref>: 101), thus increasing the risk of overlapping competences between the first and second pillars of the EU.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Treaty addressed this very problem, opening up the opportunity for a more holistic approach to researching the international security policy of the EU. On the personal level, it merged the post of the High Representative with that of the Vice-President of the European Commission in order to ‘ensure the consistency of the Union’s external action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010836711433126">Council, 2008c</xref>: 35). On the bureaucratic level, the Lisbon Treaty provided for the establishment of the EEAS, which brings together DG Relex and the part of the Council Secretariat responsible for foreign and security policy. The EEAS, which also includes Member States representatives, assists the High Representative.</p>
<p>These and other reforms provide an opportunity for a more consistent international security policy of the EU, but they also create a new set of challenges. On the personal level, the new permanent President of the European Council is entrusted with ensuring ‘the external representation of the Union on issues concerning its common foreign and security policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010836711433126">Council, 2008c</xref>: 30). Depending on personalities, the perception of interests and the interpretation of the EU law, this can lead to tensions with the High Representative. On the bureaucratic level, the EEAS consists of three different bodies with different institutional cultures. It will become fully effective only when old institutional loyalties are replaced with the new ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0010836711433126">Whitman, 2011</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>The underdeveloped strategic vision, together with the difficult task of ensuring consistency in the EU’s external action, has been to a large extent preventing a comprehensive approach to studying the EU’s international security policy. The Lisbon Treaty has initiated reforms which may bring consistency in a longer term, eventually forcing the EU to formulate a more explicit strategic objectives and goals.</p>
<p>However, regardless of the pace of the progress in these areas, this article argues that it is important to incorporate the analysis of all the relevant policies and instruments when assessing the EU’s role in international security. Some of them, for example the development and political assistance in Somalia, may not be directed at the security threat in question (such as maritime piracy). Nonetheless, they may still be contributing to addressing the problem indirectly and in a longer term.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has put forward two propositions. First, it has indicated the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach to studying the role of the EU in international security. In the author’s view, the case studies concerning the role of the EU in climate security policy and in countering Somali piracy amply demonstrate this necessity. Traditional security threats and the CSDP are rightly at the core of the research agenda; yet, problems such as climate and health security, together with the range of EU’s capacity-building financial instruments, must be incorporated in order to obtain a more accurate image of the EU as an international security actor.</p>
<p>Second, this article has also identified a set of roadblocks preventing such a holistic approach, or making it conceptually and methodologically a difficult exercise. These include: (a) the difficulty in delimiting security from non-security policies of the EU due to the contested nature of the security concept; (b) different perceptions of security among Member States, even if there is an agreement on security strategies at the EU level; (c) the lack of an overarching ‘grand strategy’ or a ‘strategic vision’, which would help to make better use of the diversity of security instruments at the EU’s disposal; and (d) a connected challenge of assuring consistency in developing and conducting the EU’s international security policy.</p>
<p>Although the security concept will remain contested, the move towards widening and deepening its understanding is fairly well established in Security Studies and in the practice of many states and non-state actors. The security consequences of climate change and pandemic diseases have been acknowledged by the UN Security Council, which further fosters the focus on non-state referent objects, such as societies and individuals. The EU subscribes to this broader view of security (including the concern with human security) and this must be taken into account when studying the EU’s role in security policy.</p>
<p>Similarly, the diverging perceptions of security problems and differing accents in national security strategies will remain part of the security landscape in the EU in the foreseeable future. However important these differences are, they did not prevent Member States from approving strategic documents at the EU level, which institutionalize the broadened approach to security, acknowledging the relevance of ‘new’ security problems. Some of the most important among these are the Joint Report on ‘Climate Change and International Security’, the EES and the Report on the Implementation of the EES.</p>
<p>A more assertive strategic vision for the EU is in order, not least to supplement the institutional reforms instigated by the Lisbon Treaty and to make better use of the diversity of resources in the EU’s security apparatus. Yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0010836711433126">Toje (2011)</xref> convincingly argues, the lack of ‘big thinking’ in the EU can be better understood if the Union is conceptualized as a small power. This approach can indeed serve as ‘the best path to making peace with the inconsistencies associated with the presence, capabilities and patterns of behaviour that characterize the European Union’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0010836711433126">Toje, 2011</xref>: 57).</p>
<p>Finally, the abandonment of the pillar structure in the Lisbon Treaty and institutional reforms concerning the EU’s foreign and security policy create conditions for improved consistency in the EU’s external action. Furthermore, these reforms offer an opportunity for further research concerning all three types of consistency: between Member States and the EU, between different EU policies and between different EU institutions.</p>

<p>In addition to literature on the EU as an international security actor, a comprehensive approach to EU security policy dominates scholarship on the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). See, for example, extensive research on the role of the European Commission in the AFSJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010836711433126">Kaunert, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010836711433126">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010836711433126">2010</xref>). On the role of Frontex in EU security, see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010836711433126">Germond (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0010836711433126">Leonard (2010)</xref>.</p></fn>

<p>The concept of societal security was developed by the so-called Copenhagen School of security in the seminal book by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0010836711433126">Wæver et al. (1993)</xref> entitled <italic>Identity, Migration and the New Security Agenda in Europe</italic>. This article does not aim to engage with the broad spectrum of approaches to security as developed over the past 20 years. Instead, it suggests that the EU has been promoting the concept of human security in its official narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0010836711433126">Martin and Kaldor, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the article suggests that although there are differences between different security approaches, there is almost universal understanding among security scholars and experts that security entails more than traditional military threats.</p></fn>
