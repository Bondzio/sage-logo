<p>The title of the book already shows Buckingham’s concern with the topic of children’s consumption. His underlying assumption is that children, as well as adults, must be seen as a part of consumer culture: ‘contemporary childhoods are lived out in a world of commercial goods and services’ (p. 5). Children are, therefore, already consumers from birth. This is the first important insight of the book. Buckingham takes a cultural-sociological perspective on children and their consumption. This is very interesting because few scientists in the context of consumption or also poverty observe children as a part of consumer culture.</p>
<p>The book gives a comprehensive overview of the discussion of children’s consumption. Buckingham explores a lot of different topics and aspects which all play a role in the context of the consumer culture of children. The first part of the book discusses the construction of the child consumer (Ch. 1), and theoretical findings on consumption generally (Ch. 2) and particularly on children’s consumption (Ch. 3). In the next two chapters, the author considers the history of children’s consumption and the contemporary children’s market. After this, he takes a critical look at two key areas of concern about children’s consumption, obesity and food (Ch. 6) and the sexualization of girls in marketing and the media (Ch. 7), which coincide with a change in his perspective, because in these two chapters he considers two concrete debates. He then moves on to the social network of children’s consumption. On the one hand, he describes the relations and consumer practices between children and parents (Ch. 8), and, on the other hand, he considers consumption and identity within peer groups (Ch. 9). He again changes perspectives in the following two chapters by analysing how market relations form children’s experience. Here, he looks at children’s television (Ch. 10), as well as consumption and education (Ch. 11). The book ends with a short conclusion in which the author summarizes and reflects on his findings.</p>
<p>Buckingham’s aim is to ‘reframe the whole issue of children’s consumption’ (p. 222). He pursues this by analysing different conceptions of this issue. He looks at the construction of the child consumer, which is defined in different ways. Buckingham deconstructs images about the child consumer. In general, one can say that marketers regard children as ‘autonomous and powerful consumers’ (p. 19) with a market particularly developed for them, while popular discourses construct children as ‘passive victims of commercial manipulation’ (p. 19). Beyond that, he considers different conceptions in psychology and studies which conceive children ‘not as beings but only as becomings’ (p. 49). In particular, he reviews research which looks at the effects of consumption and asserts that this is ‘a fatally reductive account of the social world’ (p. 227).</p>
<p>Buckingham distinguishes his conceptualization of consumption both from the popular debate and that of other scientists. He devises consumption in a broader context. He uses the term ‘consumer culture’ to focus on ‘how meanings are created within a given social context’ and ‘consumption as a means of communicating or signifying meaning’ (p. 2). His notion of consumer culture transcends ideas of autonomous and powerful consumers, as well as of passive victims. He also aims to overcome the ‘moralistic and sentimental views of children’s consumption’ (p. 2) and he cautions strongly against oversimplifying this issue. Buckingham develops an alternative understanding of this. He understands consumption as being embedded in everyday lives and in social relations. Thereby, he figures consumption as a cultural phenomenon that has both material and cultural meanings: ‘The consumption – purchasing, display, use and circulation – of commodities reflects broader processes of social communication and identity construction’ (p. 44). He sees consumption as ‘a mundane and inescapable necessity’ (p. 44). Thus, Buckingham neither takes it only in an individualistic way (using individualistic terms), nor does he relate it to the effects and results of consumption. Instead he argues that both children’s and adults’ consumption ‘is embedded within relationships with parents and peers and with the wider community’ (p. 226). Children develop their links with the people around them through the practices of consumption. They ‘participate in the social world: identity or subjectivity is inevitably produced within consumer culture’ (p. 226). He also draws attention to the fact that growing access to consumer goods and services is a part of a broader change in the history of capitalist society. In this society, he argues, childhood cannot exist outside the relation to the market. Overall, Buckingham’s thinking about consumption is complex. He looks at it as a cultural phenomenon which plays a role in the relations between people (not only between children) and it is also seen as ‘a domain both of constraint and control and of choice and creativity’ (p. 2). Buckingham suggests a cultural studies approach to consumption at the end of the book. This approach would analyse, first, the perspectives and activities of the consumer and second, the operation of the market, as well as the relations between them.</p>
<p>Buckingham successfully analyses both existing research and debate on consumption with insight. He defines consumer culture, which makes for very interesting reading. His book enriches the reader with new perspectives on children because it deconstructs images of children’s consumption and designs a new view of children and their consumption. Yet in the course of the book the notions of children and childhood are used in different ways. Sometimes he speaks of children and sometimes of childhood. Buckingham does not differ theoretically between children and childhood and does not explain the changing use of these notions. Another critique of the book is related to Buckingham’s ideas on a research programme, which unfortunately doesn’t become clear for the reader. What does it mean to analyse the perspectives and activities of the consumer <italic>as well as</italic> the operation of the market? How can these two parts be thought about together? Nevertheless, the book is in its comprehensiveness both interesting for researchers who are interested in children and childhood, and insightful for practitioners who work with children.</p>
