<p>The second edition of <italic>Human Factors in Web Design</italic>, like the first edition, is a collection of chapters by researchers who are leaders in their respective fields. All chapters in the second edition have been updated, and two chapters–one on cognition in Web search and the other on the value of usability in Web design–have been rewritten by new authors. This edition includes eight new chapters covering domains such as the semantic Web and online collaboration, content aggregators or “portals,” international standards for accessibility, modeling users on the Web, the mobile movement, online games, and avatar-based communication for education and business - all topics that have increased in relevance to Web design since the first edition was published in 2005.</p>
<p>The book is well organized, and although each chapter is written by different authors, it has a cohesive feel. The first few chapters provide a historical overview and introduction to the topic of human factors in Web design, but the rest of the book does not necessarily lend itself to a cover-to-cover reading on the subject. Readers will likely seek out chapters that are particularly relevant to their current interests while skipping others, at least for the moment. This task is made easier because the editors thoughtfully included a table of contents immediately prior to each chapter, which outlines the structure of the following article. The only small downside in terms of organization and readability is that all color figures are located in an inset located three quarters of the way through the book, rather than on the pages where they are mentioned.</p>
<p>The content covered in the book is incredibly broad and therefore suitable for a variety of readers. Practitioners will appreciate the examples and guidelines, and researchers will appreciate the straightforward, no-nonsense style and extensive references sections following each chapter. Although the book is comprehensive in terms of covering topics relevant to the human factors of Web design, it does not - nor should it be expected to - provide in-depth coverage of each field. Rather, the editors and authors have done a very nice job providing an introduction to, overview of, and pointers to relevant sources about each topic area.</p>
