<abstract>
<p>Binaries simplistically reduce complex relationships to two juxtaposed categories. Although binaries are myth rather than reality, they pit people against each other in everyday life. Many articles theorize the importance of binaries, but few provide empirical evidence of their impact. This paper analyzes more than six hundred incidents of racetalk from more than three hundred subjects to explore the ways that people construct and deploy the intersecting binaries of sexuality, gender, class, and race. Through a form of racetalk that I call “exotica,” subjects perpetuated false divisions across raced, classed, and gendered lines. Exotica operated as a controlling discourse, simultaneously eroticizing racial difference and proscribing heterosexual coupling with racial “others.”</p>

<p>As they unpacked boxes at the home improvement store where they worked, Tyrone (black, early twenties) asked Jonathan (white, early twenties) if he would “fuck a black girl.” Jonathan laughed nervously, and Tyrone said, “Seriously, it’s all the same on the inside.” Tyrone was testing Jonathan, who did not know how to respond: if he said, “yes,” he sounded sexist. If he said, “no,” he sounded racist. Jonathan was caught in a trap of intersecting binaries.</p>
<p>Binaries reduce complex social relationships falsely to two juxtaposed, static categories, where one status is venerated and the other is abhorred. Members of the privileged category have a stake in the binary, which they can deploy to protect their status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891241611431701">Augoustinos et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241611431701">Butler 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241611431701">Collins 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241611431701">Elliott 2010</xref>). Members of subordinated categories also employ binaries, harnessing their discursive power to police breaches. Binaries can be used to constrain human potential and constrict social possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241611431701">Mason and Lo 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891241611431701">Tyner and Houston 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611431701">Wilkins 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite their hegemony, binaries are myth, not reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0891241611431701">Valocchi 2005</xref>). The social world is almost never so easily condensed. Yet binaries persist, serving as tools for colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241611431701">Fanon [1952] 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891241611431701">Schiwy 2007</xref>) and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241611431701">Foucault 1990</xref>). Everyday people alter their behavior to manage the identities dictated by their binary categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0891241611431701">Speer and Potter 2000</xref>). As binaries are reified, their dehumanizing power grows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241611431701">Butler 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, I analyze how people construct and deploy gendered, raced, and classed binaries so as to regulate the heterosexual imaginings of a racial “other.” Because binaries intersect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241611431701">Collins 2000</xref>), their potential for control is great. When conjoined in discourse, they create a form of “identity talk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241611431701">Lichterman 1999</xref>) that I call “exotica.” When people use exotica, they help reproduce social inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891241611431701">Giddens 1986</xref>). Subjects in this study used exotica to build raced and gendered archetypes, with which they regulated interracial relationships of all kinds.</p>

<title>Exotica: A Nexus of Intersecting Binaries</title>
<p>Sexuality, gender, class, and race are oversimplified in the popular imagination. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241611431701">Collins (2000)</xref> has argued, most people incorrectly conceptualize these concepts as mutually exclusive binaries. Instead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241611431701">Collins (2000)</xref> explains, sexuality, gender, class, and race intersect both conceptually and practically. Nevertheless, binary constructions persist, shaping people’s perceptions, opportunities, and interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241611431701">Elliott 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241611431701">Myers 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611431701">Wilkins 2004</xref>). Everyday actors “buy” the myth, interacting in ways that uncritically accept and subsequently reify simplistic categories. False binaries reproduce power differentials, and ultimately benefit the dominants in society. The everyday people who rely on binaries to understand their social worlds often benefit as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241611431701">Elliott 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891241611431701">Johnson 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Socially constructed binaries produce archetypes of “good” versus “bad” kinds of people. With regard to sexuality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241611431701">Foucault (1990)</xref> says that Western society’s sexual obsessions produce “juridico-discourses,” establishing a limited set of behaviors as the standard. Concomitantly, an expanding group of behaviors are marked as abnormal. “Natural” and “unnatural” acts become codified over time, distinguishing licit vs. illicit sexual acts and couplings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241611431701">Butler (2004)</xref> says that people deploy this binary to police people’s sexual imaginings as well. Because sexuality involves bodies, the rules that we place upon bodies—gender, race, size, and ability—constrain sexual possibilities by asserting that only certain bodies are “allowed” to couple.</p>
<p>“Gender polarization”—a binary conceptualization of gender— constitutes a major “lens” through which people see social issues, each other, and themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891241611431701">Bem (1994</xref>, 80) defines gender polarization as “the ubiquitous organization of social life around the distinction between male and female.” She cites two consequences of polarization:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>First, it defines mutually exclusive scripts for being male and female. Second, it defines any person or behavior that deviates from these scripts as problematic. . . . Taken together, the effect of these two processes is to construct and naturalize a gender-polarizing link between the sex of one’s body and the character of one’s psyche and one’s sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891241611431701">Bem 1994</xref>, 81).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gender polarization takes numerous complex social processes—sex, gender, and sexuality—and forces them into a single, simplistic binary, which people then use to punish nonconformists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891241611431701">Fausto-Sterling 2000</xref>). Its discursive power derives from homophobia and the devaluation of femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891241611431701">Oranksy and Marecek 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241611431701">Pascoe 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891241611431701">Schippers 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Like sexuality and gender, the social construction of race has also been forced into a binary categorization: white vs. black. Although partly related to actual skin color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611431701">Hunter 2002</xref>), the racial binary is primarily about power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241611431701">Bonilla-Silva 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241611431701">Myers 2005</xref>). American race relations are obviously not just about whites and African Americans. Nevertheless, everyday people approach race as a binary, and we can observe its adverse effects throughout history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891241611431701">Feagin and McKinney 2005</xref>). In the United States, the white/black binary has always been connected to class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0891241611431701">Wilson 1990</xref>). The master-slave relationship continues to influence people’s conceptualizations of race, long after the abolition of slavery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891241611431701">Bell 1993</xref>), reinforcing racial and economic segregation in communities across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241611431701">Massey and Denton 1993</xref>). In the U.S. popular imagination, “black” is synonymous with poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241611431701">Bonilla-Silva 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891241611431701">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The racial binary intersects with the gender and sexuality binaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891241611431701">Schneider 2008</xref>). For example, miscegenation laws arose to govern race and heterosexuality, protecting the “pure blood” of the dominants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891241611431701">Rockquemore and Brunsma 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891241611431701">Sollors 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611431701">Nagel (2003</xref>, 56) argues that race and sexuality are intimately intertwined, grounded in taboo: “Hegemonic white sexual claims and attributions enhance white sexual self-imaginings and devalue black sexuality, play on white sexual fears of blacks, and reflect white racialized sexual desires” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241611431701">Fanon [1952] 2008</xref>). During European colonization, cross-race sexual couplings became illicit, and racial/ethnic boundaries became</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>ethnosexual frontiers—erotic locations and exotic destinations that are surveilled and supervised, patrolled and policed, regulated and restricted, but that are constantly penetrated by individuals forging sexual links with ethnic Others across ethnic borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611431701">Nagel 2003</xref>, 14).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During and after slavery in the United States, racial binaries protected “the purity and safety of white women [from] sexually menacing nonwhite men” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611431701">Nagel 2003</xref>, 22). Nagel notes that white women only deserved protection from sexual predators if they were considered respectable. If a white woman had sullied her own reputation by consorting with black people, then the white community ignored her sexual affairs with black men. In other words, white women could become contaminated by blackness, nullifying their sexual honor. Black women, on the other hand, had no sexual honor to begin with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891241611431701">Giddings 1996</xref>). Instead, they were seen as naturally hypersexed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891241611431701">hooks 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891241611431701">Tyner and Houston (2000)</xref> explain that white male slaveholders routinely raped black women, but this act was not criminalized. In fact, if a black woman fought back, it was she who was a criminal in the eyes of the law.</p>
<p>We see these intersecting binaries persisting over time. During the 1960s, interracial mixing became more common in the United States. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891241611431701">Wallace (1994)</xref> argues that black men sought white women as sex partners, partly because of their contempt for black women. She quotes black men who said, “I hate that black bitch.” She says that most interracial connections in the 1960s involved black men and white women: “For many white women, black men represented exotic and powerful sexuality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891241611431701">Wallace 1994</xref>, 119). However, black women saw black men’s relationships with white women as a betrayal by both groups.</p>
<p>Contemporary discourses on sexuality, gender, class, and race are reconstructions of older tropes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241611431701">Myers 2005</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241611431701">Collins’s (2004)</xref> analysis of Missy Elliot’s lyric, “Get Your Freak On,” shows the imprint of history on modern music: “freaky” sex is outside the boundaries of “normal sex.” Being labeled a freak “constitutes different sites of race, gender, and sexuality within popular culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241611431701">Collins 2004</xref>, 121). Freaky sex is associated with blackness. Similarly, sexual prowess is a major marker of black masculinity. Black male bodies communicate to whites in various ways: athletic hero, sexual predator, violent offender. Collins states, “The emphasis on black men’s bodies, when sexualized, becomes reduced to a focus on the black male penis as a distillation of the essence of black masculinity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241611431701">2004</xref>, 207). Because larger ideologies shape hegemonic masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241611431701">Connell 1987</xref>), black hegemonic masculinity takes a hyper-heterosexualized form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241611431701">Poulson-Bryant 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241611431701">Collins (2004</xref>, 193) explains that black masculinities and femininities garner meaning when juxtaposed against white masculinities and femininities:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In this context, black femininity as a subordinated gender identity becomes constructed not just in relation to white women, but also in relation to multiple others, namely all men, sexual outlaws (prostitutes and lesbians), unmarried women and girls. These benchmarks construct a discourse of hegemonic (white) femininity that becomes a normative yardstick for all femininities in which black women typically are relegated to the bottom of the gender hierarchy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891241611431701">Figure 1</xref> depicts this co-construction of black and white masculinities and femininities. Each category derives meaning from its opposition to another category.</p>

<p>People use these binaries to define and orient themselves toward others. Binaries shape people’s identities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241611431701">Lichterman (1999</xref>, 105) says that people signify their identities through “identity talk,” explaining: “Put simply, how people connect themselves to one another influences what they can say to each other.” This article concerns the ways that everyday actors reify and deploy intersecting cultural binaries through a form of identity talk that I call exotica. I conceptualize exotica as the nexus of gender, race, class, and sexual binaries in the popular imagination. The exotic is titillating yet taboo, alluring yet repulsive. Exotica serves as a controlling discourse, simultaneously eroticizing racial difference and proscribing interracial heterosexual coupling. Everyday people deploy this discourse, reproducing larger structural inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891241611431701">Schwalbe et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0891241611431701">
<title>The Research Project</title>
<p>The data for this article come from a larger project on a type of identity talk called “racetalk.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891241611431701">Morrison (1993</xref>, 57) defines racetalk as “the explicit insertion into everyday life of racial signs and symbols that have no meaning other than pressing African Americans to the lowest level of the racial hierarchy.” My conceptualization includes any talk that constructs a racial other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241611431701">Myers 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241611431701">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891241611431701">Myers and Williamson 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241611431701">Bonilla-Silva and Forman (2000)</xref> demonstrate that, when they know they are being studied, white people carefully select their words to describe racial attitudes. In face-to-face interviews, whites used semantic maneuvers to express racist ideas without taking personal responsibility for them. Phrases like “I’m not a racist, but…” distanced the speaker from racism. Racism persists, but individuals feel pressure to censor it. How, then, is such an unmentionable subject shared with others?</p>
<sec id="section3-0891241611431701">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>I designed an ethnographic research project to capture racetalk in its natural setting, where people would not self-censor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0891241611431701">Van Dijk 1993</xref>). I recruited and trained a racial/ethnically diverse team of sixty-two researchers to act as participant observers, taking field notes on racetalk that they encountered in their everyday lives, interacting in their natural worlds as they normally would. Participant observation is valued for its ability to capture the natural setting, without causing harm to subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891241611431701">Berg 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891241611431701">Lofland et al. 2005</xref>). The research team met in groups routinely so that they could debrief about challenges that they faced in data collection.</p>
<p>We collected data in two-month periods over three years, 2000-2003. Together, researchers logged more than six hundred incidents of private racetalk. All researchers signed Informed Consent forms, creating aliases for themselves. They also disguised the identities of their subjects. Thus, there were two layers of confidentiality. Although few subjects formally consented to participate, we protected everyone’s identity. We omitted informed consent for a theoretically sound reason: people censor their racial comments when they know they are being researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241611431701">Bonilla-Silva and Forman 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241611431701">Lewis 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0891241611431701">Van Dijk 1993</xref>). This project is similar to studies done on other hard-to-reach populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891241611431701">Bulmer 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891241611431701">Miller and Tewksbury 2001</xref>). My methodology has been borrowed in subsequent research projects on racetalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891241611431701">Picca and Feagin 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To protect the natural setting, I admonished researchers to participate in social interactions as naturally as possible. They made and responded to racializing/ethnic comments as they normally would, and they recorded their own comments in field notes along with comments of their subjects. I prohibited them from inciting any racetalk (unless they normally would).</p>
<p>The research team was primarily undergraduate students majoring in sociology. Two were middle-aged college graduates. Most of them were women (74%) and white (61%). African Americans were overrepresented (22%), and the percentage of Latinos (11%) was close to the national average. Asians (5%) were slightly underrepresented as a percentage of the research team. Each researcher had different kinds of interactions in her or his sites. Most observations took place within diverse work and home settings, as well as public spaces like stores and buses. We included as data everything that they experienced during their day-to-day lives, if racetalk occurred.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0891241611431701">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Who were these people who espoused such old-fashioned ideas? They were not neo-Nazis or skinheads. Researchers captured racetalk from all kinds of people: elementary school teachers, firefighters, Sunday school teachers, construction workers, landlords, bridesmaids, restaurant servers, parents, neighbors, college professors, college students, among others. They were white, black, Asian, and Latino. They were men and women of all ages, from fifteen to eighty-three. Most lived in the Chicagoland area. Most had at least attended college. Because other studies of racetalk deal only with whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891241611431701">Bobo, Kluegel, and Smith 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241611431701">Bonilla-Silva and Forman 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891241611431701">Picca and Feagin 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0891241611431701">Van Dijk 1993</xref>), my inclusion of people of color was an important innovation, providing a larger picture of racetalk and its effects. The research team collected data on more than three hundred subjects. However, I treat the incident of racetalk as the unit of analysis because the same subjects, like Lanie below, often appear repeatedly in field notes.</p>
<p>There were 613 incidents of racetalk in the larger project. The comments made by racetalkers are often shocking, as you will see in this paper. The data presented here have not been “cherry picked.” I include them because they emerged as important through a systematic coding process. They are indicative of the kinds of talk subjects said regularly in private conversations. The frequency with which subjects used degrading, racist language—particularly the “n-word”—reminds us that old racist tropes persist in private, even when such remarks are sanctioned in public (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241611431701">Myers 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Using an inductive, grounded approach to coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891241611431701">Charmaz 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891241611431701">Glaser and Strauss 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891241611431701">Lofland et al. 2005</xref>), I analyzed data in three stages. In open coding, I sifted and sorted through the data, making note of any possible theme that emerged. During axial coding, I sorted the initial codes themselves, so that the complex concepts could begin to coalesce. Finally, in the selective coding phase, I determined relationships among core concepts, substantiating a pattern. Through this coding process, I found several key patterns relating to the social construction of racial “others” while valorizing whiteness. However, several pieces of data did not fit into my initial coding schema. I marked those pieces, revisiting them with a new lens. In recoding these data remnants, I found that they coalesced around binary constructions of sexuality and gender. I conceptualized a new form of racetalk, “exotica,” which incorporated race, gender, and sexuality in its deployment of meanings. I recoded the entire data set with this new schema, reconceptualizing close to 10 percent of the data (fifty-nine incidents) as exotica. Exotica was not common, but potent.</p>
<p>Some incidents of exotica were simple, straightforward utterances. Others were complicated, with subjects policing multiple boundaries in various ways, simultaneously. Qualitative analysis allows the researcher to examine complex data from different angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891241611431701">Charmaz 2006</xref>), offering insight into the intricacies of social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0891241611431701">Van Ausdale and Feagin 2001</xref>). As such, in this article, I spend more time on complex incidents to explore nuanced uses of exotica.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0891241611431701">
<title>Exotica Deployed</title>
<p>Subjects used exotica to legislate and vilify cross-racial heterosexual desire and interaction by reifying binaries. Through exotica, subjects constructed gendered and raced heterosexual archetypes. Race in this analysis refers to the disembodied categories of whiteness and blackness. Gender concerns masculinities and femininities rather than men and women. Exotica transcended the bodies of actual black and white women and men to legislate their performances. Exotica falsely obscured important differences within a category (e.g., of men, of whites), exaggerating homogeneity within and distance between them. The archetypes were these: black femininity, white femininity, black masculinity, and white masculinity. These were not fundamentally different forms of masculinity and femininity, which would imply a nonbinary conceptualization of gender. Instead, they were polar opposites “refracted through race” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891241611431701">Schippers 2007</xref>, 98). Ultimately, exotica constructed white masculinity as a dominant category. I describe each archetype separately, and then examine their interconnectedness.</p>
<sec id="section7-0891241611431701">
<title>Black Femininity</title>
<p>Subjects used exotica to deploy black femininity only in opposition to white femininity. They seldom invoked black femininity at all, but when they did, they devalued it and valued white femininity. For example, Carol Ann (white, early twenties) wrote the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was talking to Mindy (late twenties), a white girl from work [an insurance firm]. She said that her sister is so gross. They were at a wedding, and her sister found a hot pink plastic fingernail on the ground and she put it on. Mindy said, “It had to be some nigger’s, because they wear that ugly shit.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many of the subjects referred to grown women as “girls.” While many people treat “girl” as a catch-all category for female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891241611431701">Harris 2004</xref>), its use also suggests that women were not taken as seriously as men, who were only occasionally referred to as “boys.” Here, Mindy associated black femininity with “ugly shit:” fake fingernails to help achieve elusive (white) beauty standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611431701">Hunter 2002</xref>). She implied that black femininity cannot be the “real thing,” which can only be accomplished legitimately by white women, those entitled by the binary construction to the spoils of privilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891241611431701">Augoustinos et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891241611431701">Giddings 1996</xref>). Not only was Mindy’s sister “gross” because she put on someone’s cast-off fingernail, with who-knows-what germs on it. Mindy also underscored her disgust by linking the fingernail to black femininity, seemingly another source of the pollution in her imagination. Mindy’s reaction could be “classed” as well. Plastic press-on nails are inexpensive and poorly made, available at discount drug stores. Conversely, acrylic nails are more expensive. They must be put on at a nail salon, and they require frequent upkeep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891241611431701">Kang 2010</xref>). Mindy conflated class with race in this incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611431701">Wilkins 2004</xref>), further distancing herself from her sister.</p>
<p>Black women in this study recognized their devaluation, and they used exotica to manage their embattled identity. In particular, they saw themselves as forced into competition with white women for black men’s romantic attentions. Elizabeth (black, early twenties) documented an illustrative incident. As she and her sister discussed black athletes and entertainers, Elizabeth said, “They all get money and want to date a white girl. Like a sister ain’t good enough.” Elizabeth constructed black–white coupling as (1) a symbol of status for the black man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241611431701">Fanon [1952] 2008</xref>) and (2) a betrayal of black womanhood. She highlighted the nexus of these interconnected binaries and their controlling impact on black women. Elizabeth later recorded another incident:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>While in the student center, me [<italic>sic</italic>] and a couple of friends were discussing this white girl who had a baby by a black boy, and Jasmine stated, “She’s just trying to be black, taking our men. I can’t stand them.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To Jasmine, this white woman was threatening because she was “trying to be black”: she violated Jasmine’s territory, poaching “our men.” Jasmine used exotica to fortify the boundary of acceptable sexual/racial couplings, with black women as casualties of a breach.</p>
<p>Precious (black, early twenties) recorded a similar incident that occurred as she, Penelope (black), and Monica (black) drove around their college town. Monica stared out of the window from the back seat of their car as it pulled up to a stop light. She noticed a couple in the next vehicle: a black man was screaming at a white woman, who hung her head and wept. Monica said, “White girls are dumb as hell. They act like they’re scared of their niggas” [<italic>sic</italic>]. The women laughed. She continued: “Have you ever noticed when you do see a nigga with a white girl, they’re those fat, ugly white girls? Probably just so they can get their dicks sucked.” Monica analyzed the scene by invoking several overlapping binaries: white vs. black; masculinity vs. femininity; fat/ugly vs. thin/pretty; sexually wanton vs. chaste. She saw this couple as violating boundaries, ignoring the order established by intersecting binaries, and she was bothered. Monica surmised that white women are scared of black men, so they allow themselves to be abused by them. She also thought that black men only liked “fat, ugly white girls” because they could “get their dicks sucked.” Monica’s friends laughed, but then Penelope offered another thought: “It’s all about control.” As they continued to drive alongside the couple, Penelope said, “He should just beat her ass.” She made cheering motions and gestures to the couple in the car, yelling, “Yeah, hit her!”</p>
<p>Penelope, Monica, and Precious saw this white woman as a threat to black women’s relationships with black men. They demonized her body—both how it looked (fat and ugly) and how she might use it sexually (to perform oral sex). At the same time, Monica seemed to empathize with the girlfriend, implying that rather than “taking” his rage, she should defend herself. Ultimately, however, Penelope reified a damning image of violent black masculinity in order to assuage her own frustration: “He should beat her ass! Yeah, hit her!” The momentarily blurred lines between sexuality, gender, and race were reestablished, marking black femininity as separate and unique from both black masculinity and white femininity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0891241611431701">
<title>White Femininity</title>
<p>Subjects constructed white femininity as both oppressed and oppressing. They used exotica to construct white femininity as a desirable heterosexual commodity. As Elizabeth complained above, black men could elevate their status by “acquiring” whiteness through cross-racial coupling. Many white women constructed themselves as victims of their commodification, tainted by their desirability to black men. For example, Hedi (white, early twenties) recorded this interaction with her friend Marsha (white, early twenties):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We passed by a black guy walking in the opposite direction. Marsha said, “I don’t know what it is but [black men] always hit on me. This one night, I was at a bar with some people and they were making fun of me because I was being thugged all night.” I asked her what “thugged” means. “Oh, that’s when a black guy hits on you. This guy was just following me around all night and he wouldn’t leave me alone. I just don’t know why they always hit on me.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The term “thugged” conjures the image of a vulgar, violent assault, clearly marking black masculinity as dangerous. Marsha implied that black men were irresistibly drawn by the siren-song of white femininity, responding to an innate attraction beyond the control of white women. Hedi elaborated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[When we were at the bar], a black guy came up to Marsha and started talking to her. She basically ignored him. He said, “Oh, you guys must have boyfriends, huh?” She said yes, and he walked away. She turned to me and said, “See what I mean? They always have to hit on me.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marsha interpreted this man’s casual conversation as a romantic proposition, which he seemed to confirm with, “Oh, you guys have boyfriends, huh?” Marsha dismissed him, using race to justify her reaction. She seemed to feel the need to guard against attention from black men.</p>
<p>The perceived “purity” of white femininity differed according to the positionality of the speaker, but both white and black women constructed white femininity as vulnerable. Monica (above) explained the white girlfriend’s passivity—“Her stupid ass is just gonna take that shit”—as resulting from her whiteness. At the same time, Monica held her responsible for not standing up for herself. The white woman’s passivity was constructed as a detestable flaw in white femininity itself.</p>
<p>Related to passivity, subjects also associated white femininity with wanton sexual permissiveness, sexuality without limits or taboos. Interestingly in these data, “freaky sex” was associated with white femininity rather than black femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241611431701">Collins 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891241611431701">hooks 1999</xref>). Subjects saw sexual permissiveness as an indication that white women had lost racial and class status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611431701">Nagel 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611431701">Wilkins 2004</xref>). Monica used sexuality to rationalize the black man’s interest in the “fat” white woman: “He just wants to get his dick sucked.” Women of color repeatedly used this characterization of white femininity to explain cross-racial breaches by black men. For example, Elizabeth overheard Carla (black, early thirties) say, “Only white trash want black guys. White girls are easy, that’s why black guys date them.” By linking an ostensibly valuable category (white femininity) to a devalued category (“white trash”), Carla used class to regulate the value of white femininity. Carla made a circular argument: black men only date white women because they are sexually permissive. White women lose racial status by dating black men. And yet, only degraded white women would deign to date black men in the first place. Similarly, Precious (black) recorded this incident:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sherice (black, early forties) made a comment about how her brother had sex with a white girl and the girl thinks she may be pregnant. She said, “Why is he fuckin’ them nasty ass dirty white bitches anyway? They’re jealous and they always think you wanna fuck they nigga. Plus, I wouldn’t want to mess with him after he slept with their dirty asses anyway!”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sherice deployed white femininity as sexually promiscuous: “nasty,” “dirty,” and contagious: “I wouldn’t want to mess with him after he slept with [them].” Cheyenne (white, late twenties) went to a party with Mexican Americans and recorded a similar deployment of exotica:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Someone “didn’t get” a sexual joke. My friend Virginia (Latina) said, “Why don’t you go ask Cheyenne—she’s one of them crazy white girls!” Of course I laughed and responded, “Yeah that’s why everybody wants a white girl!”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Though Cheyenne shrugged off the label, she recognized the association of sexual permissiveness with white femininity: she <italic>would</italic> get the joke.</p>
<p>White femininity is the norm by which all women are judged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611431701">Hunter 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241611431701">Myers 2004</xref>), regardless of race or class. All white women benefit from the ideal typical white femininity, but only a select few actually achieve this femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891241611431701">Fischer 2006</xref>). By definition, the unsuccessful—women of color and poor women—possess “spoiled” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241611431701">Connell 2001</xref>) or “pariah” femininities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891241611431701">Schippers 2007</xref>). Even ostensibly accomplished women can lose status, as seen in the use of exotica.</p>
<p>In this study, white femininity occupied a changeable status: sometimes a valuable commodity and at other times, as with “white trash,” spoiled. Ironically, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891241611431701">Fischer (2006</xref>, 56) states, “according to our culture’s dualistic logic, in order to become polluted, one must first be pure.” Subjects assumed white femininity to be pure until proven otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611431701">Wilkins 2004</xref>). “Pure” white femininity could spoil if a white woman became overidentified with black men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611431701">Nagel 2003</xref>). Such women undermined their privileges, inviting scorn. Here, Taylor’s (white, early twenties) boyfriend implied that black men pollute white women:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When my boyfriend, Jesse (white, late twenties), and I first started dating, we got to know each other and talked about our pasts. Jesse asked me in a nonchalant way, “You haven’t dated a black guy, have you?” I said, “Not yet.” He asked if I ever would go out with a black guy and I said, “Sure, why not? I dated a Mexican and Filipino before.” He said, “Mexicans are ok.” But he apparently didn’t think that blacks were ok.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Flora’s (white, late thirties) husband Cal (white) was less coy:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I told Cal about Connie (white) who had a date with a black man. I said that the date was a success, and she ended up sleeping with the guy. Cal said, “Why didn’t you tell her that she had fucked a nigger?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Flora was surprised that Cal was not happy for Connie. Instead, Cal became agitated, admonishing Flora to protect Connie from the irascible defilement of white femininity by black masculinity. In another example, Taylor (white) broke up with Jesse, and began dating a black man, DeWayne. She and DeWayne went to a restaurant where they encountered Jesse and his friend Martin (Asian):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I went over to introduce DeWayne to Martin. As we walked away, I heard Jesse remark, “She sure lowered her standards with this one.” Jesse must be making an issue of color since DeWayne was a college graduate with a good job. He didn’t smoke and he was nicely dressed—unlike Jesse.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite “raising her standards” regarding DeWayne’s social capital—education and employment—Taylor had “lowered her standards” racially. Taylor’s friend Kay (white, early thirties) pushed the point further:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Kay met DeWayne and said, “Why didn’t you tell me that [your boyfriend] was black?” I said, “I don’t know. Does it matter?” She said, “No, but be careful. You know what they say about white girls that go out with black guys.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kay warned Taylor not to deliberately disavow the entitlements of white femininity by consorting with a black man. “Be careful” or you might sever ties with dominants, your allies. Taylor’s dating DeWayne portended an unforgivable act of betrayal to white femininity, which Kay urged her to avoid.</p>
<p>In an extended example, Hedi (white, early twenties) recorded a night out with friend Lanie (white, early twenties). When they entered a bar, Lanie remarked, “God there are a lot of niggers here tonight. Where do all of these niggers come from? We’re in Wisconsin.” Hedi asked if she wanted to dance, and she said, “No thanks. Look. The only people dancing are niggers.” Hedi began talking to a black man, planning to go sit at his table. Lanie responded, “I don’t want to go over there and talk to those niggers. I’m gonna sit here and finish my drink and I’m leaving without you if you’re not back by the time my beer is gone.” Hedi confronted her, saying, “You wouldn’t be acting this way if the guy was white. You would come with me and you’d probably even want them to go back to your cottage or something.” She said, “Damn right. But they’re not white; they’re niggers. And I don’t want niggers at my house.” When Hedi gave the man her phone number, Lanie exploded:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“I can’t believe you gave your number to a nigger.” I asked her why she was so ignorant and I pointed out that one of her favorite teachers at her school is a black man. “Oh yeah, I love Tom. He’s a really cool nigger. I’ll be friends with them but I would never date them. I love them as friends, but they’re fucking niggers. I’m not going to have a half and half kid. That’s what they want. They want half and half kids. That’s why they’re always trying to get white girls. Niggers hate white people and they want to wipe out the white race because they’re pissed off about slavery. I won’t have a half-white kid.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lanie claimed that black men sought to undermine white femininity once and for all through ethnic cleansing. Although this may sound like a raving paranoid fantasy, policy makers created misogyny laws using a similar logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891241611431701">Tyner and Houston 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Hedi continued to pursue black men as dating interests. She talked to white friends Dan and Marie (mid-thirties) about Chuck (black), whom she liked:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Marie said, “It would be very hard to have a black relationship like that.” I said, “Would it bother you if I dated him?” Almost defensively, she said, “No. But lots of people don’t like that . . . that’s how it is.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hedi’s friends argued that because of <italic>other people’s</italic> racism, she should avoid “black relationships,” thereby protecting white femininity.</p>

<sec id="section9-0891241611431701">
<title>Black Masculinity</title>
<p>The section above implies that conceptualizations of black masculinity have not progressed much over the centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241611431701">Collins 2004</xref>). Not surprisingly, then, I found that subjects in this study—both black and white—had difficulty disentangling black masculinity from images of the penis. For example, Serenity (black, early twenties) recorded an incident that occurred in a common area on her campus, as she sat with a black friend:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>All of a sudden, this black boy called this black girl a “stupid bitch.” Then all hell broke loose. She started yelling about “how little his dick was,” and he said that “if her pussy didn’t smell so bad, he could get hard.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Serenity was embarrassed by this incident, asking, “Why do black people have to act so stupid?” As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891241611431701">West and Fenstermaker (2002)</xref> have argued, people know that their conduct affects how they are assessed as members of a social category. Here, both speakers played on pejorative images of blackness: penis size and cleanliness. Race exacerbated their sexualizing comments, underscoring their mutual degradation. While any man’s masculinity may be threatened by an assault on the size of his penis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241611431701">Connell 2001</xref>), black masculinity is particularly connected to size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241611431701">Collins 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241611431701">Poulson-Bryant 2010</xref>). Serenity referred to this man as a “boy” rather than a “man” or even a “guy,” a term that college students use for “young men.” Some people use “boy” and “girl” to refer to grown black men and women, to remind them of their lesser status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891241611431701">Romero 2002</xref>). Serenity was not doing that here. Instead, the man was acting immaturely, like a “boy.” Megan (white, early twenties) recorded another incident:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was at the gynecologist (white), and he was finishing up our appointment and telling me what to do and what to avoid doing. He told me that sex may be painful for a while, “especially since your boyfriend is black.” He realized that what he said did not come out right, so he then tried to clarify by saying how, statistically, black men have larger penises than other men and so on and so forth.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Megan had heard such references to penis size before, jokingly. But here an educated authority—her gynecologist—deployed the adage, bolstering its discursive power.</p>
<p>When black masculinity is reduced to large, erect penises, black men are reduced to sexual predators, “thugs” who use force to satisfy their desires. Predatory sexuality was the chief defining characteristic of black masculinity in the subjects’ use of exotica. Megan recorded this incident:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sammie (white, early twenties) and I were at her apartment and her friend Kim (white) came over. Like me, Kim is also dating a black guy. Sammie said, “I love your boyfriends. They are so different from the rest of them. They’re so cool.” Kim and I looked at each other. Kim confronted Sammie and asked her what she meant by that. Sammie said that it must be hard being white and dating a black guy. Sammie said, at least our boyfriends were not thugs, and were nice, even-tempered guys.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kim and Megan’s boyfriends were exceptions to the rule. Sammie underscored her perception on another occasion, as Megan wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was watching <italic>A Wedding Story</italic> with Sammie. The groom was a black ex-NFL football player, and the bride was a white elementary school teacher. Sammie blurted out, “Why do all the dirty professional athletes, who probably have fucked over hundred girls, always end up marrying a white girl?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sammie coded her language, avoiding talking about race overtly. She talked about “dirty professional athletes” instead. Megan took her comment as racetalk, however, given the context of the conversation about a black athlete marrying a white woman. Sammie seemed to equate blackness with predatory sexual promiscuity, “fucking over hundred girls.” He spoiled the purity of white femininity. Sammie’s analysis contrasts with a similar comment made by Elizabeth (black) above: “[Black athletes and entertainers] get money and want to date a white girl. Like a sister ain’t good enough.” We see here how the positionality of the speaker shapes her interpretation of cross-racial dating/marriage.</p>
<p>White subjects struggled to see black men as anything other than sexual predators. For example, Jean (white, early twenties) worried about going back to campus on a Sunday night. Her boyfriend, Daniel (white) teased her: “Are you afraid that a big, black man is going to come and get you?” Daniel used black masculinity to embody Jean’s nervousness about being alone at night. Jean recorded another incident involving a friend, Rose (white):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Rose was looking out her window as she was getting ready to go to work. All of a sudden three black guys were walking toward her building. One of them entered and the other two stayed outside. They stood right by her car, and they were looking in at her stuff. Rose was upset because she needed to go to work, but she didn’t want to go outside with those two black men standing right beside her car. She finally went out and said, “Excuse me,” when she walked by them. One of them said, “Pardon <italic>me</italic>, ma’am.” She told me that she couldn’t believe how polite he was. She was surprised at his manners and that he wasn’t scary.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These subjects used exotica to construct black masculinity as pathological and threatening, noting exceptions as surprising.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0891241611431701">
<title>White Masculinity</title>
<p>In these data, white masculinity occupied the dominant status across all binaries. A dominant masculinity requires subordinating other masculinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241611431701">Connell 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241611431701">2001</xref>) and femininities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891241611431701">Schippers 2007</xref>). Subjects deployed white masculinity so as to construct and maintain social dominance in various ways.</p>
<p>Subjects used exotica to erect walls between white and black masculinities. White men became befuddled when trying to identify with black men, as in the example, with Jonathan and Tyrone, introduced above:</p>
<p>Tyrone was listening to stereotypical “black” music. He asked me if I like this kind of music. I said it was alright to listen to. He then asked if I would fuck a black girl. I laughed in shock but Tyrone said, “Seriously, it’s all the same on the inside.” I didn’t say anything. He then said he just likes to fuck with all the white boys. I didn’t feel threatened; it was funny.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Tyrone used the term “white boys” to denote the separateness of black and white men. Jonathan felt the need to point out that he “didn’t feel threatened” while Tyrone was “fucking with him.” Tyrone tested Jonathan’s masculinity, perhaps questioning his heterosexuality, and/or perhaps trying to bond as men objectifying women. Maybe Tyrone wondered if Jonathan was an “ethnosexual tourist,” exploiting black women for sex. Tyrone may have genuinely wanted to know if Jonathan was open-minded. Jonathan refused to take the bait, leaving the racial wall intact.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The content of exotica bristled with the competition between white and black masculinities. White masculinity was not just different from black masculinity, but superior to it. People used exotica to construe black masculinity as threatening to white masculinity. Jonathan’s field notes were peppered with allusions to lynching, for example. This conversation occurred between his coworkers:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dave (white, midtwenties) said, “I have a new enemy here.” Chris (white) asked, “Who’s that?” Dave: “That nigger from down the hall.” Chris: “Why?” Dave: “He acts like he runs the place. Tells me what I should be doing.” Chris: “I don’t like him either.” Dave: “I’m going to get a rope.” (He said this sarcastically).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And another conversation among the same group:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Chris: “Why is that Black guy standing by that tree?” Dave: “He’s waiting to be hung in it.” Chris: (laughs) “Oh man . . . we can get some rope.” Dave: (laughs) “String him up!”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For generations, lynching was used to quell black independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891241611431701">Dray 2003</xref>). Chris and Dave casually invoked lynching, revealing the continued salience of a violent racist imagination and the desire to put black men in “their place.”</p>
<p>In another example, Rocker (white, early twenties) got angry over a dearth of parking spaces on campus. He and his friend Cat (white) waited for a space to open in a lot:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This black guy with ski glasses walked out [to the parking lot]. He walked to a car, then across the parking lot. I said, “You fucking crack head—go rob a store!” I was pissed because I was going to be late for class and he made it look like he was going to a car but he didn’t. I hate these fucks. They make it look like they’re the best when they’re not.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rocker thought this man mocked him, going to a car and then walking away. He was propelled into a racist tirade, invoking the threat posed to the hegemony of white masculinity by black masculinity.</p>
<p>All subjects actively deployed exotica, but white masculinity was its primary beneficiary. By policing the intersecting binaries, people reified old boundaries and reinforced a hierarchy in which white, heterosexual men dominated. Estella (white, early twenties) provided an example in which friends clearly used humor to sanction interracial flirtation, albeit indirectly:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At work [a restaurant] my friend, Harry (black, late twenties) and I always joke around and flirt, nothing big. We were sitting talking and he grabbed my hand. Then our friend Tony (white) started singing, “Jungle Fever.” It was funny. We all laughed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although amusing, Tony reminded Estella and Harry of the racial binary. Even if Tony was not personally interested in Estella, his policing bolstered the primacy of white masculinity. Rachel (white, midtwenties) recorded a similar incident:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I met Robert (black, late twenties) at a bar one night. This bar had about twenty local white people in it, mostly guys I know. Robert and I started talking and we realized that we had gone to the same high school. He was a senior when I was a freshman. He asked about certain people in my class and he knew Alvin, a black guy whom I dated through seventh and eighth grade. He said, “So was Alvin your first black boyfriend?” Joe (white, midtwenties) overheard us and came up to me and gave me a long look. Then he said, “You had a black boyfriend? Damn. They say once you go black you never go back.” Robert didn’t say a word. He looked at Joe and then at me. I told Joe, “Get the hell out of here.” Joe walked away laughing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Merely a bystander, Joe deployed exotica on behalf of white masculinity. The phrase “Once you go black you never go back” is laden with hypersexualized images of black masculinity. It underscores the pollution of white femininity by black masculinity, which failed to amuse Robert.</p>
<p>Carol Ann’s (white) grandfather echoed this idea: “My grandpa asked me if I was dating anybody. Then right away he told me, ‘I hope it isn’t anybody with shoe polish on their face!’” Similarly, Cherie (white, early twenties) recorded this conversation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Cherie: “You know who’s cute? Tiger Woods.” Billy (white): “You like niggers?” Cherie: “What?” Billy: “You like niggers?” Cherie: “I don’t like that word.” Billy: “Oh. I know. I’m not a racist. I have been called a nigger and I am not one. I’m just around them all of the time.”</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241611431701">Bonilla-Silva and Forman’s (2000)</xref> subjects, Billy claimed not to be a racist even while invoking racist ideas. Taylor’s white landlord (early forties) made a comment that conveyed the same message:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He said, “What in the hell [are] you doing going out with a coon?” I said, “He’s black. What do you care?” He said that he didn’t mean anything by it, it was just a comment, and so maybe he used the wrong word. He didn’t mean to offend me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Taylor—despite the cumulative derogation of her interracial relationship with DeWayne—still exonerated her landlord for using controlling exotica: He just accidentally said, “coon.” White male subjects reinforced the primacy of white masculinity through their exotica, and others allowed them to do so because of their privileged status.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Exotica is not merely talk. It is discourse that people use to deploy historically entrenched, controlling binaries in order to legislate contemporary racial, heterogendered identities and interactions. Each category has meaning only when juxtaposed to its binary opposite, and the binaries intersect. This study provides insight into the ways that exotica can be used to reinforce the racial/heterogendered order and larger unequal regimes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241611431701">Foucault (1990)</xref> explains that sexual behavior becomes a proxy for “deep truths” about a person’s moral character. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891241611431701">Fischer (2006)</xref> argues that sexual behavior cannot be understood as temporary, impulsive acts among people who are just caught up in a moment. Instead, once a person’s sexual/moral character has been impugned from one “aberrant” sex act, that person has been indelibly marked. In this study, individuals socially constructed the licit–illicit binary along racial lines. Subjects constructed the meaning of a sex act—or a potential sex act—according to larger racial and gendered ideologies.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0891241611431701">Figure 2</xref>, I depict the particular ways that subjects used exotica to form intersecting binaries.</p>
<fig id="fig2-0891241611431701" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0891241611431701-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Importantly, actors deployed binaries relationally. Within each binary was a disembodied archetype. Each stood alone, but its meaning depended on the meanings of the categories competing with it.</p>
<sec id="section12-0891241611431701">
<title>White Masculinity</title>
<p>White masculinity occupied the dominant position. According to the exotica used in this study, white masculinity had the power to define other statuses, hence the one-way arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0891241611431701">Figure 2</xref>. White masculinity opposed white femininity, black femininity and black masculinity—all of which were deemed threatening. People used exotica to safeguard white masculinity in several ways. People continually challenged black masculinity through the redeployment of historical fear tactics, such as jokes of lynching and accusations of “nigger loving.” Racetalkers excavated menacing reminders of the consequences to those who might unseat white masculinity for hegemonic status.</p>
<p>Femininity in general can be used to emasculate all men, diluting their “potency” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241611431701">Connell 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241611431701">Pascoe 2005</xref>). However, black and white femininities were differentially located in relation to white masculinity in this study. Subjects cast white femininity as much more desirable than black femininity, hence its higher status in the order. White masculinity acted as the purity police of white femininity. White masculinity in these data had no direct relationship with black femininity, hence the dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0891241611431701">Figure 2</xref>. Instead, black femininity was a cheapened status, used to police white femininity and to keep black masculinity denigrated. A surplus category, actors could strategically invoke it in order to insulate white masculinity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0891241611431701">
<title>The Threatening “Others”</title>
<p>The subjects constructed the other three categories so that they simultaneously depended on each other for their meanings, as indicated by the reciprocal arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0891241611431701">Figure 2</xref>. Black masculinity was at once hazardous to and attracted by white femininity. White femininity was spoiled by black masculinity, but elevated above black femininity. Black femininity competed with white femininity for valuation as feminine, and competed with black masculinity for valuation as blackness.</p>
<p>Black masculinity occupied a contradictory status when juxtaposed with white femininity. Subjects constructed a hypersexualized tension with violent overtones between black men and white women. They portrayed white femininity as victimized and spoiled by black masculinity, but drawn toward black masculinity because of sexual permissiveness. Subjects also depicted white femininity as “freaky,” the perfect foil for the embodied penis. However, this black–white union was verboten. Subjects’ exotica framed this coupling as the breach of an ethnosexual frontier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611431701">Nagel 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The potential coupling of black men and white women shaped all three devalued statuses. Subjects’ exotica threatened white women with a spoiled femininity, black men with violence, and black women to a second-rate, vulnerable position. Whether or not interracial coupling actually occurred, its potential legitimated a juridico-discourse that threatened subjects’ personhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241611431701">Butler 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although interconnected, these three categories did not sit on the same plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891241611431701">Augoustinos et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891241611431701">Tyner and Houston 2000</xref>). As the literature predicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241611431701">Collins 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891241611431701">Giddings 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891241611431701">hooks 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891241611431701">Wallace 1994</xref>), actors most degraded and least invoked black femininity. Black femininity seemed so devalued that few people—even black women themselves—negotiated its meaning in their racetalk. Black femininity does not threaten other statuses, as black masculinity does. It is not vulnerable to contamination, the way that white femininity is. Instead, subjects constructed black femininity as polluting to other statuses. Black femininity exists apart, serving as a resource to be used to police others. Black women themselves articulated insight, frustration, and sadness about their “surplus” status.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Ethnographic data such as these reported here allow us to capture and analyze a problem that often stays hidden from public view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0891241611431701">Van Dijk 1993</xref>). Exotica is a discourse that harnesses intersecting, controlling binaries to create taboos, regulate sexual imaginings, and relegate devalued people to the status of “other.” Power and oppression overlap. Exotica is a disembodied discourse with bodied repercussions. This study shows that there are patterns of deployment according to the positionality of the legislator. Studying exotica reveals the complex, hegemonic ways in which the larger structure is reproduced through everyday interactions among localized actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891241611431701">Giddens 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Our cultural imaginings about sexuality matter beyond the individual level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241611431701">Butler (2004</xref>, 28) argues that “Fantasy is part of the articulation of the possible; it moves beyond what is merely actual and present into a realm of possibility, the not yet actualized or the not actualizable.” If exotica renders us unable to conceptualize each other as viable intimates, condemning each others’ very personhood, then we have undone our ability to interrogate controlling binaries that reproduce oppression.</p>
<p>At a critical level, people use exotica to denigrate black men and black and white women. Exotica helps people to pit white women, black women, and black men against one another, further insulating the dominants from threat. The deployment of exotica damages our senses of self, our ability to imagine another social order, and our ability to unite in a common purpose. When we participate in the denigration of whole categories of people, we perpetuate the hegemony of racial and heterogendered inequality at the structural level. The regimes persist and reproduce themselves from era to era, on into the future. We can interrupt exotica, thereby impeding the dialectical reproduction of inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891241611431701">Giddens 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891241611431701">West and Fenstermaker 2002</xref>). We must recognize and problematize it first.</p>
