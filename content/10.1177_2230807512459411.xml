<p>This book is a compilation of essays by a young scholar who died before her work came to fruition. What is significant about this book is that the author has tried to historicise complex questions of identity in a nuanced manner and her understanding is shaped by events that occurred in her own lifetime such as the Godhra riots before her premature death in 2006. This can be seen through the collection of essays present in this book. It deals with historical questions on identity formation through the prism of census in colonial Ceylon and Punjab. This has been juxtaposed with examples of ‘composite culture’ and ‘hybrid communities’ in pre-partition Punjab and Ceylon, unexplainable in the colonial census. At the same time, the author has dealt with contemporary issues facing the subcontinent as well. She has used her experience in working with organisations working on peace movements and minority rights in India to understand the strategies employed by such organisations and the inherent limitations of their approaches. Her final unfinished essay deals with the problems faced by the Ahmadi community in Pakistan post partition, who after a short reign of peace were declared beyond the pale of Islam and a minority community of Pakistan in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The book begins with an introduction by Kumkum Sangari, who as the author’s aunt has tried to put her work in a proper perspective. She is of the view that Meeto in her work has tried to navigate the existing historiography of communal and religious identity. Her writing critiques the taken-for-granted opposition of Hindus and Muslims as separate and cohesive categories, the frequent coding of syncretism as deviant, impermanent or tolerant—and moves towards a more nuanced approach (p. xv). The composite culture of Punjab comprising of shared religious practices in Sufi shrines, romance narratives, ballads, poems, etc. is of special interest to her. She has sought to historicise the survival of these shared continuities alongside the reactive processes of Islamicisation, Sikhisation and Hinduisation in pre-partition Punjab. For Meeto, the colonial census played a significant role in homogenising these categories, and in her work, she wanted to find out if the turn from syncretic cultural traditions was ‘complete’ in Punjab: how far did the homogenising project of the census succeed? (p. xvi).</p>
<p>The first essay in this book seeks to analyse the existing historiography of Hindu–Muslim relationship on the Indian subcontinent since independence. While trying to survey the corpus on writing on communal relations between Hindus and Muslims since independence, from nationalist to Marxist to subaltern historiography, she brings forth the inherent limitations in their approach. She points out that the historiography of the Hindu–Muslim relationship in the subcontinent takes these two categories for granted. Furthermore, within these two categories, the preoccupation of the historians lays with ‘conflict’ rather than ‘peaceful co-existence’. Herein, she makes the important point that it is not just in moments of conflict that identities are formulated and articulated. Rather, for a more nuanced approach, she argues that the historiography of the Hindu–Muslim relationship will have to square the history of conflict and competition with that of co-existence and cultural exchange (p. 16).</p>
<p>Following from this understanding, the author explores the shared cultural and religious practices in pre-partition Punjab. She raises the question: ‘Did Punjabis indeed turn away completely from their syncretic culture? Or is there evidence to suggest that syncretic Punjabi culture was resilient in the face of reformist attacks and sharpening community boundaries?’ (p. 26) For Meeto, the continuing worship of <italic>sufi pirs</italic> despite reformist propaganda, the participation of Sikhs in Hindu festivals and of the Hindus in Muharram and Eid and the popularity of Punjabi’s <italic>quissas</italic> such as Sohni-Mahiwal and Heer-Ranjha across religion were examples of continuing cultural co-existence despite hardening religious boundaries. She ends her essay by locating the sources that she would look at to provide further evidence of a shared culture. She identified district gazetteers and municipal records, reports of pilgrim communities and murid registers, newspapers, reformist tracts and Punjabi literature (pre-partition and post-partition) to recover traces of cultural continuities across religion.</p>
<p>The next two essays in this book deal with the colonial census and have raised questions of contemporary importance through the prism of census categorisation introduced by the British. The author makes the important point that while census operations were not reserved for the colonies, census in Britain never recorded data on religion, apart from one survey in 1851. In India, however, colonial understanding of India and Indian diversity gave centrality to religious community and caste, institutionalised in the census (p. 47). What is significant is that the author uses these very census reports to re-examine the homogenising categories of ‘Hinduism’, ‘Sikhism’ and ‘Islam’. The author’s comparison with the census operations in colonial Ceylon also provides an interesting study. She points out how the three ethnic categories of Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim that we take for granted today developed into enclosed, monolithic, reified identities as a result of the colonial census operations that began in 1871. She further argues that the need to categorise and homogenise populations did not end with colonialism. It was inherited by anti-colonial nationalisms and was fundamental to the nationalist imagination, which reinforced the clear definition of people as being Sinhala Buddhist or Tamil, Hindu or Muslim, majority or minority, and this tendency has only intensified with the growth of ethnic and communal conflict in South Asian region (p. 94). Thus, she points to the need to look at contemporary censuses to find out to what extent post-colonial nation states have held on to colonial classification systems.</p>
<p>The last two essays deal with contemporary realities: one deals with minority rights and the role of civil society, which has been co-authored with Yamini Aiyar and the other is an unfinished essay on the status of Ahmadi community in Pakistan post Independence. The essay on minority rights focuses on the role played by civil society organisations working on and with Muslim communities, India’s largest religious minority. Tracing the work done by both secular organisations and organisations headed by Muslims, it highlights the limitations of these organisations, which have been preoccupied with cultural rights and have failed to address the question of socio-economic disadvantage faced by the community (p. 106). The author’s work on the Ahmadis is unfinished but represented her attempt to highlight the fate of this community within Pakistan as the state attempted to build a stable identity for itself.</p>
<p>The appendices of the book comprise of the author’s scholarship application at Oxford where she was pursuing her doctoral research and her concept notes on the Census and the Ahmadis. This work ends with Judith Brown’s message on Meeto who was her doctoral supervisor at Oxford. The author’s concept notes would be useful for students wishing to write their own draft applications. This work is a tribute to the author’s vision and the kind of work she was attempting to do. Based on an unfinished dissertation, the main limitation of the book are the sources used. The chapters on the Census and composite culture in pre-partition Punjab have mainly used census reports and native newspaper reports. Vernacular sources have not been consulted despite the author’s desire to bring forth the syncretic culture of Punjab. Nonetheless, the author’s nuanced arguments and her attempt to link the historical with the contemporary deserves credit. This work will be appreciated by historians, sociologists, research scholars as well as civil society organisations working on minority rights.</p>
