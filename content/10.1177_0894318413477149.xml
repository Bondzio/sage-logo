<abstract>
<p>The focus of this column is to provide a brief overview of several conceptual analyses of quality of life along with their resulting definitions. A discussion of the more specific construct of health-related quality of life in terms of chronic illness is considered followed by an in-depth review of health-related quality of life measurement instruments. Finally, the idea of health-related quality of life considered as input to decision-making instead of designated as an outcome measure is proposed.</p>

<p>“In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477149">Carroll, Gardner, &amp; Tenniel, 1960</xref>, p. 12). When one delves into the idea of quality of life (QOL), one can feel exactly like <italic>Alice in Wonderland</italic> because of the nature of the concept. It seems since the idea first came into focus after World War II there have been many attempts at defining the concept of QOL through conceptual analysis but to no avail. Instead of clarifying the concept, the proposed dimensions and definitions have only lead to more confusion about the nature of QOL. For example, it has been proposed that QOL is a global construct, while at the same time seen as one focused in nature. Even in light of a lack of a clear definition, there has been a proliferation of measurement instruments touted as being useful for research on the subject.</p>
<p>A comprehensive review of conceptual analyses and measurement of QOL is well beyond the scope of this column. Therefore, we will only briefly reiterate the critical attributes of QOL that have been discovered through conceptual analysis. The main focus of this column is to discuss the related concept of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its measurement. The principal focus is to examine QOL as it applies to persons living with chronic illness and to propose yet another way of considering QOL in this population.</p>
<sec id="section1-0894318413477149">
<title>Conceptual Analyses and Critical Attributes</title>
<p>Four concept analyses were chosen for review since they were ubiquitous in the literature. Each of the analyses put forth the idea that individuals make appraisals of their own lives in regard to satisfaction with current circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477149">Haas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477149">Kleinpell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477149">Mandzuk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318413477149">Meeberg, 1993</xref>). Since the appraisals are individual in nature, they are viewed as being subjective and value driven. Although the nature of QOL is seen by some as subjective, all of the reviewed analyses assert that QOL can be objectively measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477149">Haas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477149">Kleinpell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477149">Mandzuk &amp; McMillan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318413477149">Meeberg, 1993</xref>) and that this acts as a supplement to the subjective evaluation. A final commonality of the reviewed concept analyses was the critical attribute of QOL being multidimensional and consisting of several domains including physical, psychological, social, spiritual, and cognitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477149">Mandzuk &amp; McMillan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318413477149">Meeburg, 1993</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0894318413477149">
<title>Definitions</title>
<p>Stemming from the aforementioned concept analyses, definitions of QOL emerged. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318413477149">Meeburg (1993)</xref> proposed that “quality of life is a feeling of overall life satisfaction, as determined by the mentally alert individual whose life is being evaluated” (p. 37). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477149">Haas (1999)</xref> defined QOL as
<disp-quote>
<p>A multidimensional evaluation of an individual’s current life circumstances in the context of the culture in which they live and the values they hold. QOL is primarily a subjective sense of well-being encompassing physical, psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions. In some circumstances, objective indicators may supplement or, in the case of individuals unable to subjectively perceive, serve as proxy assessment of QOL. (p. 738)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another definition of QOL that shares similarities with those of Haas and Meeburg is the one that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318413477149">Ferrans (1985)</xref> developed. She stated that QOL is “a person’s sense of well-being that stems from satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the areas of life that are important to him/her” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318413477149">Ferrans, 1985</xref>, p. 6). Note that Ferrans’ definition builds upon the notion of satisfaction with various aspects of life by incorporating the importance of each aspect, as judged by the individual. The Ferrans and Powers QOL instrument calculates a numeric value for each aspect of life, based upon both satisfaction and importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318413477149">Ferrans &amp; Powers, 1985</xref>). Thus, satisfaction in an area that is judged as less important does not contribute as much weight to overall QOL as satisfaction in an area that has greater importance.</p>
<p>The definitions cited above share in common QOL characteristics of life satisfaction, multidimensionality, and subjectivity. Furthermore, the definitions are global in nature. An assumption of these definitions is the idea that one must have cognitive abilities and an environment that provides the basic necessities of life before an appraisal can be made. Aside from these areas of commonality, there is not general agreement on a definition of QOL, nor is there a gold standard for measuring it. Nevertheless, QOL is an important outcome measure in numerous clinical trials and research studies. Therefore, as a backdrop to the discussion on measuring QOL, one must keep in mind that critical decisions about care are made based on actual or potential QOL, even though healthcare professionals may not share the same understanding of the concept. Right now, somewhere in the healthcare arena, life and death decisions are made using QOL as a guide even though there is no clear definition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0894318413477149">
<title>Health-Related Quality of Life</title>
<p>Not only are the definitions unsatisfactory, the global nature of them are problematic when applied to healthcare situations, since when they are used as the basis of developing instruments to measure outcomes, they lack sensitivity. Health and functional states are essential aspects of the individual’s perception of QOL and lend themselves better to measurement. Therefore, in clinical research and other healthcare applications, the concept of QOL is usually narrowed to HRQOL. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477149">Guyatt, Feeny, and Patrick (1993)</xref> support the idea of the more specific construct of HRQOL. They stated that there are aspects of QOL that are not generally considered to be directly related to health, “including income, freedom, and quality of the environment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477149">Guyatt, Feeny, &amp; Patrick, 1993</xref>, p. 622), and that these other aspects interfere in the measurement of health-related issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0894318413477149">
<title>Definitions</title>
<p>Even the concept of HRQOL is problematic since it needs to be interpreted in various ways when applied to specific disease states. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318413477149">Taylor, Gibson, and Franck (2008)</xref> defined HRQOL for young people with chronic disease as:
<disp-quote>
<p>subjective, multidimensional, and dynamic. It is unique to each individual young person and includes aspects of physical, psychological and social function. <italic>It is dependent upon not only the stage of development but also the illness trajectory. This involves the achievement of goals and aspirations and the constraints imposed through ill-health and treatment.</italic> (p. 1831)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Whereas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477149">Cooley (1998)</xref> developed a definition of QOL for those with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to be “ quality of life in the context of NSCLC is the impact of the disease and/or treatment on the functional status, physical symptoms, affective state, and interpersonal relationships, as evaluated by the person with cancer” (para. 19). One can understand the proliferation of definitions of HRQOL since not only are they concerned with broad dimensions (chronic illness) but also disease-specific states (lung cancer).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0894318413477149">
<title>Purpose of Instruments to Measure HRQOL</title>
<p>Guyatt and colleagues (1993) identified two major purposes for HRQOL instruments in clinical research. The first is to <italic>discriminate</italic> among individuals in terms of better or worse QOL, and the second is to <italic>evaluate</italic> the degree to which HRQOL changes over time, for example in response to a new treatment. Thus, if the population of interest was women with rheumatoid arthritis, the researcher would need an instrument that can differentiate among individuals in terms of the level of QOL. If the researcher was testing a new intervention for rheumatoid arthritis, the instrument would need to be sensitive to positive and negative changes in QOL as a result of the intervention. Note that both the discriminative and evaluative purposes of these instruments regard HRQOL as an outcome or end-point of a disease process or intervention.</p>
<p>Regardless of type, a sound HRQOL instrument can yield results that are reproducible, valid, and interpretable. Discriminative instruments have high reliability, meaning that the instrument can accurately detect differences among individuals, but with stable results for one individual on repeated administration. For evaluative instruments, an important characteristic is responsiveness, meaning that the instrument measures <italic>true</italic> change in individuals who are affected positively or negatively by a treatment or progression of disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0894318413477149">
<title>Instrument Reliability and Validity</title>
<p>Both discriminative and evaluative instruments must also have validity, including the most rigorous type, construct validity. Essential to construct validity is the delineation of a theoretical framework, from which the researcher can make hypotheses about expected results from an instrument under certain conditions. This has been a problem in HRQOL instruments, in that many measures, although widely used in research, are not based on a sound theoretical framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477149">Bergner, 1989</xref>). In many instances, HRQOL is identified as a measurable outcome, but is not even defined. This lack of clarity has led to terms such as QOL, health status, and functional status being used interchangeably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477149">Bergner, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477149">Haas (1999)</xref> attempted to clarify distinctions among these concepts, pointing out that functional status is <italic>purely objective</italic>. However, the overlap between health status and QOL is considerable; Haas calls it a tautology because one’s current perception of health status is a major component of how one views current QOL. Is good health essential to a high level of QOL, or does a high level of QOL predict good health? Most importantly, how do people living with chronic illness define that relationship?</p>
<p>Analysis of the value of a measure of HRQOL requires consideration of potential sources of error. Since HRQOL is a subjective measure to such a large extent, it may not be possible to detect the veracity of an individual’s self-report. For example, errors in measurement can occur because of a desire to match what is thought to be ideal or what is expected by the researcher. Furthermore, in the case of an individual who is hospitalized, a lower evaluation of HRQOL might yield secondary gains in terms of increased nursing care or medical services. Additionally, mood-of-the-day effects must be considered, acknowledging that an individual’s mood can vary from one day to the next, or even from one hour to the next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318413477149">Hanestad, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Examples of HRQOL Instruments</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477149">Guyatt et al. (1993)</xref> offered a taxonomy of HRQOL instruments, categorizing them as generic or specific. Generic instruments are further classified as health profiles or utility measures. Health profiles are designed to be comprehensive measures of HRQOL. They have wide applicability to populations with various health-related conditions; however, they may not be sensitive enough to detect changes in individuals with specific conditions. The development of utility measures was an outgrowth of research focused on cost-effectiveness of treatments. Oftentimes expressed as a single number, a utility measure assigns value to specific scores and allows for comparisons among treatments in populations with specific health-related conditions.</p>
<p>Specific instruments focus on particular diseases, populations, functions, or conditions. They are generally more sensitive to changes in individuals with specific conditions, but on the other hand, have limited use in making comparisons across populations. In the past 20 years, there has been a proliferation of QOL instruments both generic and specific. In 2002, a website was launched which provides a database of available QOL instruments. Currently managed by MAPI Research Trust, the <italic>Patient-Reported Outcome and Quality of Life Instruments Database</italic> (PROQOLID, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proqolid.org">www.proqolid.org</ext-link>), includes more than 1000 instruments, categorized as generic or disease specific, and searchable by instrument name, author, population of intended use, domains included in the instrument, and available translations.</p>
<p>In their review of generic HRQOL instruments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477149">Coons and colleagues (2000)</xref> identified four health profile and three utility measures that have been widely used in clinical research, and compared them in terms of eight criteria. The review criteria, adopted from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medical Outcomes Trust, included the conceptual and measurement model upon which the instrument is based; its reliability, validity, responsiveness, and interpretability; the degree of burden to administrators and respondents; and the availability of alternative forms of administration and cultural or language adaptations. The instruments were categorized as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477149">Guyatt’s (1993)</xref> taxonomy, that is, health profiles and preference-based (utility) measures.</p>
<p>The four health profile instruments include the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36), the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), and the Dartmouth Primary Care Cooperative Information Project (CO-OP). Among the health profile instruments, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form (SF-36) Health Survey was judged to have extensive evidence of meeting all criteria. Indeed, the SF-36 is one of the most widely-used HRQOL instruments, with an advantage being that it is applicable to many different patient populations and contexts. The SF-36 measures eight aspects of physical and mental health, and also includes a single item to measure the respondent’s perceived change in health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318413477149">Ware &amp; Sherbourne, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The NHP was developed for use in epidemiological studies in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318413477149">McEwen &amp; McKenna, 1996</xref>). The strength of this instrument is that it was conceptualized and designed to reflect the non-professional’s perception of health status and concerns. It includes six dimensions, with 38 items that are responded to with <italic>yes</italic> or <italic>no</italic>. As such, it is quick and simple to administer, generally requiring 5 to 10 minutes. However, the dichotomous response results in a high prevalence of people scoring <italic>no problem</italic>, thus making the NHP less sensitive to lower levels of discomfort or minor changes in health status.</p>
<p>The SIP was designed as a self-report measure designed to detect changes in behavior that are due to illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477149">Bergner, 1993</xref>). Items measure physical and psychosocial domains. With 136 items in 12 categories, the SIP carries greater respondent burden, requiring approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete. Rather than asking the respondent to evaluate health status characteristics over a 2 or 4-week period, as is the case with many other instruments, SIP items are worded to determine the respondent’s perceptions on a given day.</p>
<p>Researchers have devised instruments to capture HRQOL perception in user-friendly, but meaningful, ways. The CO-OP Charts were developed in the late 1980’s as a way to measure health status in the primary care setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318413477149">Nelson, Johnson, &amp; Hays, 1996</xref>). Items are accompanied by cartoon-type graphics that illustrate response options. The nine items measure various aspects of health status over the past month. Self-administration requires approximately 5 minutes, and the instrument can be easily scored by an office staff member.</p>
<p>Preference-based utility measures aim to produce a single score that represents the respondent’s state of health at that time. The score is often entered into a formula from which is calculated a parameter such as cost-effectiveness or quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477149">Coons, Keininger, &amp; Hays, 2000</xref>). Among HRQOL measures, the Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB) is one of the oldest, having been developed in the late 1960s. This preference-based utility measure assesses performance on three scales (mobility, physical activity, and social activity) and 26 symptom/problem complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318413477149">Kaplan &amp; Anderson, 1996</xref>). It yields a single point-in-time well-being score. However, administration of the QWB requires a trained interviewer and approximately 10 to 30 minutes of administration time.</p>
<p>The Health Utilities Index (HUI) is similar to the QWB scale in that is measures health status along several parameters as well as the value of health status. In contrast to the QWB scale, the HUI measures functional capacity rather than performance. The HUI, currently available in three versions, is based on a conceptual framework that includes health attributes identified as being important by the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477149">Feeny, Torrance, &amp; Furlong, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1990, the EuroQol Group, a multidisciplinary group of European researchers, developed the EQ-5D. This instrument measures health on five dimensions. A single item visual analogue scale (VAS) asks respondents to mark a point on a 100 to 0 scale that corresponds with their rating of their health on that particular day. The EQ-5D requires only about one minute to complete, and is available in many languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318413477149">The EuroQol Group, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>These generic instruments, whether health profile or preference-based utility measures, share a common attribute, which is that they measure HRQOL as an enduring trait, not likely to change significantly except with intervention. Conceptualized as such, HRQOL has become an important outcome indicator in clinical research. The assumption is that disease conditions or interventions for the diseases will have positive or negative impacts on a person’s HRQOL. Yet, it is possible that an individual’s self-assessment of HRQOL is influenced by mood-of-the-day, and that even seemingly significant life events have only a temporary effect on HRQOL (Moum, 1998).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0894318413477149">
<title>HRQOL in Chronic Disease</title>
<p>Specifically in the case of chronic disease that requires daily self-management by the patient, there seems to be an assumption that particular interventions have the potential to improve HRQOL over time. However, there has been little attention to the day-to-day burden of adherence to recommended measures, and the effect of this burden on the patient’s perception of HRQOL <italic>right now</italic>. Patients report that it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to follow all the daily lifestyle recommendations, with the possibility of fewer or less severe long-term complications.</p>
<p>For example, in diabetes care, patients are taught that adherence to specific diet, medication, and activity recommendations will decrease or delay the incidence of long-term diabetes complications such as retinopathy, kidney disease, or neuropathy. The assumption is that the absence of such complications will yield an improved perception of HRQOL in future years. However, the person who is tasked with self-management of diabetes must make multiple decisions each day, such as whether or not to take all prescribed medications; whether to strictly follow the prescribed diet pattern; and, whether to engage in the prescribed level of daily exercise. These disease management decisions are made within the context of the patient’s life situation. In other words, pressures at home, at work, within the family, or within social networks must be dealt with on a daily basis, in addition to the pressures presented by diabetes management. If we were to ask the patient about HRQOL, they would likely respond in terms of right now, not where they were in the past, or where they would like to be at some ambiguous future point. The following story provides a concrete example of the right now HRQOL.</p>
<p>After dressing and preparing her breakfast and lunch, along with feeding the dogs, Katie enters into the Chicago morning rush. Nothing like merging into a work zone on the 294 going south with everyone traveling way over the speed limit, semi-tractor trailers drifting into your lane, and drivers with a glint of road rage in their eyes sitting almost in your trunk. By the time Katie pulls into the parking lot of the university, she can feel the tension begin to mount. She calls a cheery hello to all as she walks to her office and begins. Being a teacher has become a challenge over the past 10 years for Katie. For example, today she has numerous trivial e-mails to answer even before class starts. Once she gets to class, there is always the problem of connecting with students since they are always on their cellphones or Facebook while listening to a lecture. Looking out over the class, she at times feels inept. Katie begins to wonder if she is past her peak of being an effective teacher. However, she needs her teaching position to provide financial support and the job is a stable one in these hard times. Additionally, she derives much pleasure from the relationships that she has with other faculty at school and friendships have become very important to her as of late. So, by the time Katie gets home at night after a day of worrying about bills, responding to endless trivial demands by students, and crawling home in endless traffic, the last thing she wants to do today is to exercise and follow the healthy lifestyle practices that she knows are important for her own chronic health concerns. Although most of the time Katie is satisfied with life, right now she needs that one cool glass of white wine, a chocolate brownie, and a night of watching 1940’s movies to give her day just a little pleasure. Maybe tomorrow or, even better, on Monday she will exercise and improve her diet.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind Katie’s story, what we are suggesting is that, aside from considering HRQOL as a disease or intervention outcome, perhaps we should also think about HRQOL as an input into decision-making about chronic disease self-management. Many patients with chronic diseases describe cyclical patterns of adherence and non-adherence to recommendations for self-management. The patient becomes motivated, perhaps by a health scare or by the promise of a reward such as a vacation trip, to adhere closely to recommendations. For a period of time things go well and the patient sees improvements in health status and presumably HRQOL. However, for many people, once the short-term goal has been achieved, or an unexpected obstacle occurs, the commitment to adherence is shaken, and slowly but surely, the person returns to habits that are less healthful in the long run, but more comforting for the short term. In other words, the burden of self-management of disease affects the individual’s perception of QOL, shifting it in a more negative fashion.</p>
<p>We are suggesting that researchers consider a shift in perspective from thinking of HRQOL as a stable trait to thinking of it as a changeable, dynamic state and from thinking of HRQOL as an outcome to thinking of it as an input. Returning to Ferrans’ (1995) definition of QOL, we suggest thinking about what is important to the individual right now, and the level of satisfaction with those areas. Measuring short-term, right now HRQOL from the perspective of the patient might provide insight into how the individual makes day-to-day decisions about self-management of illness.</p>
