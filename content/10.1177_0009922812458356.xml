<p>The breath-actuated nebulizer (BAN) is a new respiratory device to deliver short-acting β-agonists to patients with asthma exacerbations. This pediatric convenience sample experimental study compares the BAN with conventional nebulizers and demonstrates that the BAN allows for shorter treatment times to achieve improved clinical asthma scores with less albuterol, shorter emergency department length of stay, and fewer hospitalizations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Standard treatment of acute asthma exacerbations includes administration of an inhaled short-acting β-agonist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812458356">1</xref></sup> Two common modes of delivery are nebulization or metered-dose inhaler with or without a spacer. A new delivery device is the AeroEclipse II breath-actuated nebulizer (BAN; Monaghan Medical Corporation, Plattsburgh, NY). The BAN device is a small-volume nebulizer that provides on-demand therapy in either continuous or intermittent modes. It requires an inspiratory flow rate of only 15 L/min to actuate and can be used with a mouthpiece or tight-fitting mask, thus making it ideal for use even in young pediatric patients. The device is reported to improve delivery and involve less waste because only approximately 4% of medicine is lost to the environment versus 30% or more in a conventional nebulizer. One pediatric study reported improved CAS and reduced hospitalization rates and respiratory rates with the use of the BAN in comparison with a conventional nebulizer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812458356">2</xref></sup> There are no other published studies investigating the device. The aim of our study was to determine the effectiveness of administering a short-acting β-agonist via BAN on the clinical asthma score (CAS), hospitalization rate, milligrams of albuterol used, and ED length of stay for children who present to a pediatric emergency department (PED) with acute asthma exacerbations.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This is a prospective, nonblinded, nonrandomized (convenience sample) experimental study of children 1 to 18 years of age who presented with wheezing to the PED over a 7-month period (May through November 2008). Patients who presented with first-time wheezing or wheezing with known diagnosis of reactive airway disease or asthma were considered for inclusion in the study. An initial CAS was assigned to each child with wheezing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812458356">Table 1</xref>). The CAS was developed by a multidisciplinary Children’s Hospital asthma committee and is used in both the PED and the entire Children’s Hospital. Asthma exacerbation severity category was determined as mild (CAS score of 0-2) or moderate (CAS score of 3-5). Patients receiving an initial CAS in the severe range (CAS score of 6-10) were excluded. Children 1 year and younger were excluded to minimize the impact of viral-associated bronchiolitis. Patients with chronic pulmonary disease (cystic fibrosis or bronchopulmonary dysplasia), cardiac disease, immunodeficiency disorders (including sickle cell disease), and suspected foreign-body aspiration were excluded.</p>

<p>Of the 43 respiratory therapists (RTs) available to service the PED, 20 were in-serviced and familiar with the BAN device. In agreement with the PED’s attending physician, on the days when a BAN-trained RT was covering the PED, patients eligible for the study received albuterol treatments via the BAN device. These patients made up the intervention group. On days when an RT not trained in the use of the BAN device was covering the PED, eligible patients received albuterol via intermittent or continuous nebulization (Up-Draft II Opti-Neb Hudson RCI, Research Triangle Park, NC). These patients made up the control group.</p>
<p>The albuterol dosing for the intervention group was as follows: 2.5 mg for children weighing 5 to 10 kg, 5 mg for children &gt;10 to 20 kg, and 7.5 mg for children weighing more than 20 kg. The albuterol dosing for the control group was at the discretion of the physician and ranged between 2.5 and 20 mg per treatment. In addition to albuterol, it is standard practice in our PED to combine ipratropium bromide as an adjunct to albuterol, dosed at 250 to 500 µg per treatment.</p>
<sec id="section3-0009922812458356">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>To determine the effectiveness of the BAN device, the following primary outcome measures were compared between the intervention and control groups: mean change in CAS at disposition (either at discharge from the ED or hospital admission), mean milligrams of albuterol given, mean length of stay within the ED (minutes), and hospitalization (yes/no). Secondary measures included the following demographic and clinical characteristics: age (categories of 1-5, 6-10, and 11-17 years), gender, race, ipratropium treatment (yes/no), steroid treatment (yes/no), and concurrent home treatment with controller asthma medicines (yes/no).</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics included counts, means, medians, standard deviations (SDs), and ranges. Categorical data were analyzed by χ<sup>2</sup> testing. If outcome variables were not normally distributed, continuous data were analyzed using Wilcoxon 2-sample and Wilcoxon sign rank tests. Otherwise, <italic>t</italic> tests were used to determine differences. Odds ratios for hospitalization were estimated using logistic regression and controlling for confounding variables. Variables included in regression models included those with <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.2 for their univariate analyses. Stepwise logistic regression methods were used to determine the final model, with only those significant values remaining in the model. The final model met the assumption of independent observations and had the best-fit criterion (Akaike’s information criterion, Schwarz criterion, and percentage concordance). A <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3.</p>
<p>The institutional review board at the study site approved this study. Monaghan Medical Corporation donated the BAN devices but did not participate in the design, collection, or analysis of our data.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the 7-month study period, May to November 2008, 159 patients were entered into the study. Of these, 57 were assigned to the BAN (intervention) group, and 102 were assigned to the continuous nebulizer (control) group. There were no patients unable to use the BAN device who were subsequently included in the control group.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812458356">Table 2</xref> shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the intervention and control groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in regard to age, gender, race, mild versus moderate asthma exacerbation severity, and treatment with ipratropium and steroids. However, there was a slightly higher percentage of children on controller treatment among the controls compared with the intervention group (<italic>P</italic> = .01).</p>

Our study is unique in that we were able to show not only that less amounts of albuterol were needed when it was administered with the BAN device but also improved CASs, decreased ED length of stays, and reduced hospitalization rates when compared with albuterol administration by continuous nebulization.</p>
<p>Although not determined in our study, the use of the BAN device in the management of asthma in the PED appears to have a potential to reduce cost. Effective treatment is achieved with less amounts of albuterol. The time to administer albuterol by the BAN device is typically 5 to 10 minutes, compared with 60 minutes for a typical continuous nebulization treatment. This is the likely explanation for reduced length of stay in the BAN group. We found that administering albuterol by the BAN device was more effective as validated by the reduction in CASs and the reduced rates of hospitalization.</p>
<p>Because the time to administration of the BAN is significantly shorter than that for continuous nebulization treatment, RTs remained in the room with the patient to supervise the entire treatment. The common practice with continuous nebulizers is to set up the treatment and return after an hour when the treatment is complete. There are multiple advantages to the presence of the RT for the entire BAN treatment, including the quality of administration and significant educational benefits for the patients and families. If a child was unable to actuate the BAN device in the intermittent mode, it was easily converted to continuous mode by the RT with little change in total treatment time. Furthermore, the device is reusable for up to 1 week either in the hospital or the patient’s home.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation to this study is the use of our institution’s CAS. This score was developed by our Children’s Hospital Asthma Committee and adopted in all areas of the Children’s Hospital that care for children with asthma, but it has not been validated. All physicians and RTs in the ED had been uniformly in-serviced on the CAS and had been using the scoring system for at least a year prior to the introduction of the BAN.</p>
<p>Internal validity of these results are limited by the study using a convenience sample, making selection bias more likely. In addition, there are several confounding variables that were not controlled for in regard to length of stay. Most important of these was ED overcrowding, but other factors include time of day, nurse and physician staffing, and timeliness of RT.</p>
<p>The finding that the control group had a significantly greater rate of controller medication use may suggest that, in general, the control group had more severe asthma and this is why CAS and hospitalizations were different in the groups.</p>
<p>This study was performed at only a single site. Thus, the external validity of the results is limited, and similar findings may not be found at other sites.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The use of the BAN device allows for shorter treatment times to achieve improved CAS with less albuterol, shorter ED length of stay, and fewer hospitalizations. If results similar to ours are found in further studies, it would appear that the BAN device has significant advantages over continuous nebulization for the administration of albuterol in the management of acute asthma exacerbations in children.</p>
