<abstract>
<p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) between parents has been linked to negative parenting and child maladjustment, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. Based on a theory that violence among parents disrupts the coparental alliance—which has been linked to parenting quality and child adjustment—the authors examined the effect of prebirth violence on coparenting across the transition to parenthood. A community sample of 156 couples reported on IPV prior to the birth of their first child and on coparenting at child age 1 year. Both men and women’s violence perpetration were related to coparenting quality. Couple relationship quality and parent mental health problems accounted for the links between prenatal IPV and coparenting. This study adds to an understanding of the associations between IPV and family functioning across the transition to parenthood, and has important implications for preventive intervention.</p>

<p>A substantial proportion of dating and married couples engage in intimate partner violence (IPV), which often has negative consequences for the health and well-being of the partners involved as well as for their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192513X11412037">Tolan, Gorman-Smith, &amp; Henry, 2006</xref>). Children often experience interparental violence as a traumatic event and exhibit internalizing and externalizing symptoms as a consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11412037">S. A. Anderson &amp; Cramer-Benjamin, 1999</xref>). The mechanisms through which IPV affects children likely include both direct exposure and indirect pathways (e.g., through disruptions in parenting quality; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11412037">S. A. Anderson &amp; Cramer-Benjamin, 1999</xref>). We propose that one indirect pathway occurs when violence undermines the quality of the coparenting relationship, which is defined as the ways in which couples coordinate their roles as parents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11412037">Katz &amp; Low, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11412037">Margolin, Gordis, &amp; John, 2001</xref>). The quality of the coparenting relationship, in turn, has been linked to parental negativity and warmth toward children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11412037">Abidin &amp; Brunner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11412037">Floyd, Gilliom, &amp; Costigan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11412037">Margolin et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, the influence of IPV on coparenting may itself operate through ongoing associations with couple relationship quality and parental adjustment (e.g., depression, stress). Thus, the current study extends research on the implications of IPV by examining the associations between IPV and coparenting across the transition to parenthood, as well as investigating potential mechanisms of such associations.</p>
<sec id="section1-0192513X11412037">
<title>Intimate Partner Violence and the Transition to Parenthood</title>
<p>The prevalence and frequency of IPV peak during early adulthood; estimates of the prevalence of IPV among dating, cohabiting, or married young adults range from about 22% to 55% (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X11412037">Low, Monarch, Hartman, &amp; Markman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X11412037">Magdol et al., 1997</xref>). Early adulthood is also a time when many couples experience the transition to parenthood, which is itself stressful for individual and couple well-being (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11412037">Feinberg, 2002</xref>). That young adulthood is a period during which IPV rates are high <italic>and</italic> a period when substantial numbers of couples become parents suggests that it is important to understand the impact of IPV on early parenthood and young children. However, much of the work examining links between IPV or couple conflict, family functioning, and child outcomes has been cross-sectional and/or has focused on parents with children in early and middle childhood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X11412037">Holden &amp; Ritchie, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11412037">Kaczynski, Lindahl, Malik, &amp; Laurenceau, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11412037">Katz &amp; Low, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X11412037">Levendosky &amp; Graham-Bermann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X11412037">Slep &amp; O’Leary, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192513X11412037">Sturge-Apple, Davies, &amp; Cummings, 2006</xref>). Relatively little longitudinal research has examined the influence of violence during the family formation period. According to a developmental perspective on family life, successful transition and adaptation to new stages (such as parenthood) in part depends on functioning in prior stages (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11412037">Duvall, 1988</xref>). Early parenthood is a period of reorganization and change of the family system to accommodate the infant. Mutual support and problem solving of differences in expectations and parenting beliefs may be especially helpful during the stressful period when new parents learn to attend to infants’ needs for security and nurturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11412037">Feinberg, 2002</xref>). There is evidence that negativity in the couple relationship during pregnancy predicts difficulties in later triadic interaction among both parents and the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X11412037">Lindahl, Clements, &amp; Markman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X11412037">McHale et al., 2004</xref>). By increasing levels of hostility and tension among partners and/or leading to withdrawal out of fear for safety or as an attempt to manage conflict, violence may inhibit open discussion and problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11412037">Katz &amp; Low, 2004</xref>). Thus, prior or current IPV may prevent partners from displaying mutual support and coordinating parenting roles, in turn impeding their adjustment to parenthood.</p>
<p>Documenting associations between IPV and family processes across the transition to parenthood would have important implications for prevention. For example, the prevention of violence before a child is born could have a positive impact on coparenting, parenting, and child adjustment over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X11412037">Cowan &amp; Cowan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11412037">Feinberg, 2002</xref>). An understanding of other malleable family characteristics that may account for the links between prenatal IPV and coparenting may offer additional targets for prevention.</p>

<title>Intimate Partner Violence and Coparenting</title>
<p>As mentioned above, the effect of violence on children may occur through the direct witnessing of violence, as well as through indirect pathways. Studies linking IPV and conflict to negative parenting and parent–child relationships strongly suggest the presence of indirect effects. For example, IPV is associated with harsh or inconsistent discipline, insecure attachment relationships, and child abuse and neglect, which in turn predict child maladjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11412037">S. A. Anderson &amp; Cramer-Benjamin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X11412037">Holden &amp; Ritchie, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11412037">Kaczynski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X11412037">McGuigan, Vuchinich, &amp; Pratt, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>We propose that one mechanism by which IPV may negatively affect parenting is through disrupted coparenting. Coparenting refers to the ways in which partners relate to one another as parents, and includes agreement about parenting practices, supportive versus undermining behaviors, division of parenting work, and joint family management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X11412037">Feinberg, 2003</xref>). The coparenting relationship is distinct from (but related to) the overall couple relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11412037">McHale, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192513X11412037">Schoppe-Sullivan, Mangelsdorf, Frosch, &amp; McHale, 2004</xref>), and research has demonstrated that coparenting quality is consistently associated with parenting and child adjustment, even more closely than other elements of couple relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11412037">Abidin &amp; Brunner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11412037">Feinberg, Kan, &amp; Hetherington, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11412037">Floyd et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11412037">Margolin et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Only one study has examined the links between IPV and coparenting: In a cross-sectional study of parents with preschool-age children, marital violence was associated with both positive and hostile-withdrawn coparenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11412037">Katz &amp; Low, 2004</xref>). Moreover, coparenting mediated the effects of violence on children’s anxiety and depression. Other work with related constructs also supports a meditational role for coparenting. For example, coparenting has been shown to mediate the influence of couple conflict and hostility on parenting quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11412037">Floyd et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11412037">Margolin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192513X11412037">Sturge-Apple et al., 2006</xref>). Based on this research, we hypothesized that IPV during pregnancy would predict later coparenting quality (Path a in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192513X11412037">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Mediating Variables</title>
<p>Conceptual models of coparenting suggest that multiple characteristics of both partners and their relationship may together affect coparenting quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X11412037">Feinberg, 2003</xref>). Therefore, in addition to examining the potential link between IPV and coparenting, we also sought to examine the mechanisms through which IPV may affect coparenting. Although no work has studied mediators of the links between IPV and coparenting, a great deal of research has examined correlates of both IPV and coparenting and can be used to make predictions about factors that may account for associations between violence and coparenting across the transition to parenthood. Based on this work, we predicted the existence of two mediating pathways (paths b-e in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192513X11412037">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0192513X11412037">
<title>Couple relationship quality</title>
<p>Compared with other couples, violent couples have been characterized as having more relationship problems overall, including conflict, difficulty in communication and problem solving, and less support and affection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11412037">Burman, Margolin, &amp; John, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X11412037">Low et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X11412037">Sagrestano, Carroll, Rodriguez, &amp; Nuwayhid, 2004</xref>). Violence is also associated with behavioral indicators of poor relationship quality, such as negative couple interaction, and greater reciprocity and escalation of negativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11412037">Burman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11412037">Gottman &amp; Notarius, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X11412037">Sagrestano et al., 2004</xref>). In turn, poor relationship quality is associated with negative and undermining coparenting relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X11412037">Belsky &amp; Hsieh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X11412037">Katz &amp; Gottman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11412037">McHale, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192513X11412037">Schoppe-Sullivan et al., 2004</xref>). It is, therefore, important to distinguish between IPV and general couple relationship quality in predicting coparenting: If IPV predicts coparenting above and beyond the effect of couple relationship quality, then violence itself should be included as a focus of prevention. In the current study, self-reported couple love and conflict were examined as mediators of the IPV–coparenting association.</p>

<title>Parent mental health</title>
<p>Violence victimization in couple relationships is associated with low self-esteem and increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X11412037">K. L. Anderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X11412037">Campbell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X11412037">Jasinski, 2004</xref>). In general, there is a gap in the literature regarding the implications of IPV for mental health among male partners and couples. Some research has found links between IPV and well-being for both male and female victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X11412037">Coker et al., 2002</xref>), but other work has found that women experience larger decrements in mental health related to victimization than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X11412037">K. L. Anderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X11412037">Beach et al., 2004</xref>). Mental health problems are also a risk factor for perpetration of IPV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192513X11412037">Tolan et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, elevated depression and anxiety may limit parents’ ability to support their partners’ parenting and resolve child-rearing differences with their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X11412037">Feinberg, 2003</xref>). Although parents’ personality characteristics have been linked to coparenting in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X11412037">Belsky &amp; Hsieh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192513X11412037">Van Egeren, 2003</xref>), this study is the first to examine parent mental health as a predictor of coparenting. We examined whether depressive symptoms and anxiety mediated associations between violence and coparenting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0192513X11412037">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>In sum, this study examined violence prior to the birth of a first child as a predictor of coparenting quality when children reached 1 year of age in a community sample of first-time parents. Whereas many studies have focused on mothers as victims of violence, this study focused on the coparenting of mothers and fathers who may be involved in mutually violent relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X11412037">Johnson, 1995</xref>); therefore, both partners’ reports of violence and coparenting were included.</p>
<p>In studying associations between IPV and coparenting, we also examined the role of demographic variables, including parent age, education, income, and marital status. Prior work has identified socioeconomic status as a correlate of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11412037">Cunradi, Caetano, &amp; Schafer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192513X11412037">Tolan et al., 2006</xref>). If demographic variables are also related to coparenting, they may represent third-variable confounds for the associations of interest. Therefore, we examined the extent to which demographic variables were related to coparenting and included them as control variables in subsequent analyses where necessary.</p>
<p>Finally, we predicted that mental health and couple relationship quality from the prenatal period to child age 6 months would mediate the associations between prenatal IPV and coparenting at child age 1 year. Although mental health problems and couple relationship quality were conceptualized in this study as mediators in the pathway from IPV to coparenting, it is important to note that these factors are likely to exhibit bidirectional associations with IPV across the transition to parenthood. Given that we expected mental health and couple relationship quality to be fairly highly correlated from the prenatal to postpartum period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X11412037">Belsky, Lang, &amp; Rovine, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X11412037">Perren, von Wyl, Bürgin, Simoni, &amp; von Klitzin, 2005</xref>), we combined measures across waves to test whether these factors accounted for the IPV–coparenting link. The implications of this approach, and alternative directions of associations between the constructs in our conceptual model, are considered further in the discussion.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were heterosexual couples who were expecting their first child and participating in a randomized study testing an intervention program for first-time parents that aimed to improve coparenting relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X11412037">Feinberg &amp; Kan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X11412037">Feinberg, Kan, &amp; Goslin, 2009</xref>). Couples were primarily (81%) recruited from childbirth education programs at two hospitals located in small cities. All other couples were recruited from doctors’ offices or health centers (8%), newspaper ads or flyers distributed in public places (7%), or by word of mouth (3%). Eligible couples were living together, at least 18 years old, and expecting their first child. Couples recruited from childbirth education programs were sent a letter and then contacted by phone. Couples recruited through health centers returned a postcard and all other couples called the program office if they were interested in participation. Of the eligible couples contacted by phone, 23% agreed to participate. A total of 169 couples completed a prenatal interview.</p>
<p>Participating couples resided in rural areas, towns, and small cities. At the prenatal interview (Time 1), 82% of couples were married and the majority of participants (91% of mothers and 90% of fathers) were non-Hispanic White. Median annual family income was $65,000.00 (<italic>SD</italic> = $34,372.79), with a range of $2,500.00 to $162,500.00. Average educational attainment was 15.06 years for mothers (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.82) and 14.51 years for fathers (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.19); 14.4% of mothers and 29.3% of fathers did not complete any college. Mean ages were 28.33 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.93) for mothers and 29.76 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.58) for fathers.</p>
<p>Data for this study were taken from three time points: prenatally (Time 1), 4 to 8 months after the birth of the baby (Time 2), and approximately 13 months after the birth of the baby (Time 3). Of the 169 couples who participated at Time 1, one couple was excluded from the study after Time 1 because the mother was deceased; another was excluded because of the child’s congenital health problems. Of the remaining 167 couples, 11 couples (6.6%) did not participate at Time 3 and were therefore excluded from main effects analyses for the current study (<italic>n</italic> = 156). An additional 10 couples (6.0%) did not participate at Time 2 and were excluded from mediation analyses (<italic>n</italic> = 146). There were no differences in parent age or family income as a function of participation at each wave. However, mothers in couples who participated at both follow-up waves had more education (<italic>M</italic> = 15.26, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.76) than mothers in couples who did not (<italic>M</italic> = 13.91, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.81), <italic>t</italic>(1, 163) = 3.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; fathers in participating couples also had more education (<italic>M</italic> = 14.77, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.10) than nonparticipating fathers (<italic>M</italic> = 12.95, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.20), <italic>t</italic>(1, 163) = 3.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Couples who participated at both follow-up waves were also more likely to be married (87%) than couples who did not (57%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1, 167) = 11.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Thus, the samples that were included in analyses were slightly more educated and more likely to be married than the full sample.</p>

Human subjects procedures were reviewed and couples were paid an honorarium for their participation ($200 total across the three waves). Mothers and fathers separately completed questionnaires regarding their relationship experiences, individual qualities and attitudes, and individual well-being.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>IPV</italic> was assessed at Time 1 with the physical assault subscale of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192513X11412037">Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &amp; Sugarman, 1996</xref>). Mothers and fathers completed eight items about their own behavior perpetrated toward their partner and the same eight items about their partner’s behavior toward themselves. Three of the eight items assess minor violence (e.g., pushing or shoving, twisting arm or hair) and five items assess severe violence (e.g., choking, beating up). All items are on a 7-point scale ranging from <italic>0 times</italic> to <italic>more than 20 times</italic> in the past year. Prevalence of violence was a dichotomous score; if respondents indicated that a behavior had happened in the past year, prevalence was coded 1, otherwise it was coded 0. Frequency of violence was calculated by recoding each item score as the midpoint of the response category (i.e., <italic>0 times</italic> = 0, <italic>1 time</italic> = 1, <italic>2 times</italic> = 2, <italic>3-5 times</italic> = 4, <italic>6-10 times</italic> = 8, <italic>10-20 times</italic> = 15, and <italic>more than 20 times</italic> = 25).</p>
<p>Given the possibility of underreporting of violence and to simplify the analyses, mothers’ and fathers’ reports of violence were combined using a method consistent with previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X11412037">Heyman &amp; Schlee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X11412037">Slep &amp; O’Leary, 2005</xref>). Specifically, if either parent reported that a behavior had occurred in the past year that behavior was considered to have occurred. The highest frequency reported by either parent was also used as the frequency for that behavior. These scores can be considered upper bound estimates of the true prevalence and frequency of violence in the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11412037">Schafer, Caetano, &amp; Clark, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192513X11412037">Szinovacz &amp; Egley, 1995</xref>). Cronbach’s alphas were .77 and .81 for prevalence and .92 and .76 for frequency for mothers’ and fathers’ behaviors, respectively.</p>
<p>Information about both severity and frequency may be important in measuring IPV; we used both in constructing the violence scores used in analyses. A frequency score consisted of the sum of the item frequency scores, and an overall severity score was created by summing item severity scores, which had values of 1 for presence of minor and 2 for presence of severe violence. The violence score used in analyses consisted of the frequency score multiplied by the severity score. This scoring method is highly correlated with violence frequency and severity and was chosen because it is sensitive to both aspects of violent behavior and avoids grouping individuals. Partners’ perpetration scores were significantly correlated, <italic>r</italic> = .66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; scores were log transformed to reduce skew.</p>
<p><italic>Coparenting</italic> was assessed among mothers and fathers at Time 3 using a measure developed for the study and adapted from previous measures of coparenting and the parental alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11412037">Abidin &amp; Brunner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11412037">Cordova, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X11412037">Frank, Jacobson, &amp; Avery, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X11412037">Margolin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192513X11412037">McHale, 1997</xref>). The measure consists of 47 items on a 7-point scale from <italic>not true of us</italic> to <italic>very true of us</italic>, and exploratory factor analyses revealed the following subscales with adequate internal consistency for mothers and fathers: agreement (e.g., “My partner and I have the same goals for our child”), parenting brings us closer (e.g., “My relationship with my partner is stronger now than before we had a child”), exposure to conflict (e.g., “How often in a typical week, when all 3 of you are together, do you yell at each other within earshot of the child?”), support (e.g., “My partner supports my parenting decisions”), and undermining (e.g., “My partner does not trust my abilities as a parent”). Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .71 to .89 for mothers and from .64 to .88 for fathers. To reduce the number of analyses undertaken and because all five subscales loaded on a single factor in exploratory factor analyses, composite scores representing coparenting for mothers and fathers were created, in which subscale scores were standardized, weighted on the basis of factor loadings, and averaged. Cronbach’s alphas for the composites were .82 and .78 for mothers and fathers, respectively; partners’ scores were correlated, <italic>r</italic> = .43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Higher scores indicated more positive coparenting.</p>
<p>A composite measure of <italic>relationship quality</italic> included couple love and conflict at Time 1 and Time 2. <italic>Love</italic> and <italic>conflict</italic> were measured using the Marital Interactions Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11412037">Braiker &amp; Kelley, 1979</xref>). Love was measured as the sum of nine items (e.g., “How close do you feel toward your partner?”) and conflict was measured as the sum of five items (e.g., “How often do you and your partner argue with one another?”). Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .78 to .87 for love and from .70 to .81 for conflict. These two scales were significantly intercorrelated for both parents at both time points (<italic>r</italic>s ranged from −.36 to −.55) and scores were significantly correlated across time (<italic>r</italic>s ranged from .47 to .59). The four scores loaded on a single factor for each parent in exploratory factor analyses and were standardized, weighted on the basis of factor loadings, and averaged separately for mothers and fathers. Higher composite scores reflected better relationship quality. Partners’ composite scores were highly correlated, <italic>r</italic> = .70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>
<p><italic>Depressive symptoms</italic> were measured at Time 1 and Time 2 with seven items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11412037">Howe, Levy, &amp; Caplan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X11412037">Radloff, 1977</xref>). Items referred to symptoms experienced during the past week (e.g., “How often did you feel sad?”) and were answered on a 4-point scale. <italic>Anxiety</italic> was measured at Time 1 and Time 2 with the 20-item short form of the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS), which measures chronic anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X11412037">Bendig, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192513X11412037">Taylor, 1953</xref>). Items were asked in a dichotomous yes/no format (e.g., “I am a high-strung person”). Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .66 to .84 for depressive symptoms and from .74 to .85 for anxiety. Depressive symptoms and anxiety were significantly correlated with each other for both parents at both time points (<italic>r</italic>s ranged from .54 to .67) and scores were significantly correlated across time (<italic>r</italic>s ranged from .49 to .62). The four scores loaded on a single factor for each parent in exploratory factor analyses, so separate composite scores representing <italic>mental health problems</italic> for mothers and fathers, in which the four scores were standardized, weighted on the basis of factor loadings, and averaged, were used in analyses. Partners’ composite scores were not significantly correlated, <italic>r</italic> = .15.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section13-0192513X11412037">
<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>The upper bound prevalence and frequency measures of violence revealed substantial perpetration—29.8% of mothers and 17.3% of fathers enacted at least one violent behavior in the past year. Average number of behaviors in the past year across the full sample was 2.60 (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.03) for mothers and 1.55 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.61) for fathers.</p>
<p>Approximately half of the couples involved in the study were randomly assigned to a treatment condition and thus participated in some or all of an intervention that aimed to improve coparenting. Indeed, our research has found self-reported and observed improvements in parent mental health, coparenting, and parenting as a function of the intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X11412037">Feinberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X11412037">Feinberg &amp; Kan, 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, including study condition (i.e., treatment vs. control) in analyses to control for group differences on postbirth variables did not modify the results. To test whether the intervention weakened the links between violence prior to the birth of the child and postbirth experiences, condition was examined as a moderator of the associations between violence and coparenting and between violence and the mediator variables. No interaction terms were significant, and the condition variable was dropped from analyses.</p>
<p>Finally, mothers’ education was significantly correlated with mothers’ coparenting. When partialled out, the remaining candidates for control variables were not significantly correlated with coparenting. Therefore, mothers’ education was included as a control variable in all analyses.</p>

<sec id="section14-0192513X11412037">
<title>Associations Between Intimate Partner Violence and Coparenting</title>
<p>Given that our data included partners nested within couples, a multilevel modeling strategy was used for all analyses. Specifically, a series of random intercept multivariate models was estimated in which mothers’ and fathers’ reports of coparenting were treated as two dependent measures. This approach accounted for dependencies in the data (i.e., within-family correlations between partners). To test whether estimates differed significantly for mothers’ versus fathers’ reports of the dependent variables, fixed effects were parameterized as main effects, which represented the effects for mothers, and as interactions of predictors with a dummy-coded parent variable, which represented the difference between the effect for mothers and the effect for fathers. If the difference was significant, the effects were reparameterized as interactions with dummy-coded variables representing mothers’ and fathers’ reports; that is, separate fixed effects were estimated for each parent. If the difference was not significant, the interaction term was dropped so that the main effect represented the effect across both parents’ reports.</p>
<p>Parameter estimates for the main effects models predicting coparenting are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X11412037">Table 1</xref>. Mothers’ and fathers’ violence were entered in separate models because of their intercorrelation. Controlling for mothers’ education at Time 1, mothers’ and fathers’ violence perpetration at Time 1 both negatively predicted coparenting at Time 3. There were no significant interactions between violence and parent: Mothers’ and fathers’ violence significantly predicted both parents’ reports of coparenting.</p>

<title>Mediation Analyses</title>
<p>Multivariate multilevel models were examined to test the associations between violence and the mediators (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X11412037">Table 1</xref>). Both parents’ violence perpetration negatively predicted relationship quality across both parents’ reports. Mothers’ violence positively predicted mental health problems across both parents’ reports and fathers’ violence positively predicted mothers’ more strongly than fathers’ mental health problems. These variables remained candidates for mediation.</p>
<p>To test for mediation, a series of four path analyses were conducted using full information maximum likelihood estimation (LISREL 8.8). We included all possible paths, resulting in saturated models. Two models tested mediation of the associations between mothers’ violence and both parents’ coparenting (through both parents’ reports of relationship quality and mental health problems), and two models tested mediation of the associations between fathers’ violence and both parents’ coparenting. All models included mothers’ education as a covariate.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X11412037">Table 2</xref> presents the direct and indirect (mediated) effects of violence on coparenting through relationship quality and mental health problems. Standard errors were calculated using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192513X11412037">Sobel’s (1982)</xref> formula. There was a significant mediation effect in all four models. Relationship quality fully mediated the associations between mothers’ and fathers’ violence and coparenting, such that violence was no longer related to coparenting when relationship quality was in the model. Mental health problems fully mediated the association between mothers’ violence and coparenting, and they fully mediated the association between fathers’ violence and mothers’, but not fathers’, coparenting. That is, a direct link between father’s violence and father’s coparenting remained even when mental health problems were included in the model.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined whether prenatal IPV is linked to later difficulties in the coparenting relationship, which has been shown to influence both parenting and child adjustment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11412037">Abidin &amp; Brunner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11412037">Feinberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11412037">Floyd et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11412037">Margolin et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with prior research and our expectations, prebirth IPV significantly predicted parents’ perceptions of the coparenting relationship at child age 1 year. Thus, results support our theoretical model describing how coparenting may play a role in the link between IPV and family functioning across the transition to parenthood. More complete support for this model awaits further research which examines the full pathway from prenatal IPV to coparenting difficulty to parenting, and eventually, to child outcomes. The current study began to unpack the relation between IPV and coparenting: We found that relationship quality, and to some extent, mental health problems, accounted for the associations between IPV and coparenting. These results build on past research with families of young children and add to our understanding of the implications of violence for emerging family systems.</p>
<p>The consistent associations found in this study between IPV and coparenting support a family systems perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X11412037">Minuchin, 1974</xref>) and suggest that preexisting couple relationship conflict spills over to parents’ early coparenting subsystem. Our findings are consistent with prior cross-sectional work on links between marital violence and coparenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11412037">Katz &amp; Low, 2004</xref>), and extend such work by examining these associations longitudinally across the transition to parenthood. Although the design of our study (i.e., that violence and coparenting were each measured only once) limits us from drawing conclusions about causal associations, the results suggest that working with couples to curtail or prevent violence in their relationships before the birth of their child may have positive implications for the development of coparenting relationships after the child is born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X11412037">Cowan &amp; Cowan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11412037">Feinberg, 2002</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section17-0192513X11412037">
<title>Mechanisms of Association</title>
<p>Couple relationship quality was a consistent mediator of the links between IPV and perceptions of coparenting. This finding accords with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X11412037">Levendosky and Graham-Bermann’s (2001)</xref> cross-sectional finding that marital satisfaction mediated the association between domestic violence and parenting in a sample of women, and extends these results to coparenting and to fathers. That IPV did not predict coparenting after accounting for relationship quality suggests that violence could be addressed in preventive interventions that focus primarily on enhancing the overall couple relationship at the transition to parenthood. Indeed, universal prevention programs aimed at improving couple relationships by teaching conflict management and problem-solving skills and helping increase positive interaction may have concomitant effects on IPV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X11412037">Low et al., 2002</xref>). Future research should examine similar mediation processes using measures of coparenting that are more distinct from relationship quality than ours (cross-sectional correlations were .72 for mothers and .66 for fathers in this sample). Additionally, we acknowledge that the associations demonstrated in this study could represent bidirectional pathways of influence between IPV and couple relationship quality. It is likely that poor prenatal couple relationship quality puts couples at risk of engaging in IPV, which further deteriorates relationship quality across the transition to parenthood. Because of the high correlation of relationship quality over time, we were unable to tease apart these associations in the current study. Instead, our findings suggest that it is the ongoing associations between IPV and couple relationship quality across the transition to parenthood that account for the link between prenatal IPV and later coparenting.</p>
<p>It is notable that fathers’ violence predicted mothers’ mental health more strongly than fathers’ mental health (though both associations were significant). This finding partially accords with prior studies that have found stronger mental health implications of violence for women than for men (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X11412037">K. L. Anderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X11412037">Beach et al., 2004</xref>), and suggests that the effects of IPV on each partner’s mental health should be examined closely in community samples. It is possible that men and women experience and react to violent acts differently, or that women’s mental health is more sensitive to relationship disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X11412037">K. L. Anderson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Parental mental health fully mediated the association between mothers’ violence perpetration and both parents’ reports of coparenting quality. It seems that mothers’ violence is related to couple difficulties that impair or are affected by the mental health of both partners, and that these difficulties account for poorer coparenting. In contrast, mental health problems fully mediated the association between fathers’ violence perpetration and mothers’, but not fathers’, report of coparenting. The stronger associations between fathers’ violence and mothers’ as compared with fathers’ mental health may also mean that mothers’ perceptions of coparenting are more reactive to violence as a function of decrements in mental health. Alternatively, the mental health problems that give rise to violent behavior among fathers may also affect mothers’ perceptions of the coparenting relationship. These findings add to prior work on violence, mental health, and parenting among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X11412037">Levendosky &amp; Graham-Bermann, 2001</xref>), and suggest that the processes linking violence and coparenting may differ somewhat for men versus women. Future research should investigate mothers’ versus fathers’ experiences of and reactions to IPV in relation to mental health and relationship outcomes, and should attempt to tease apart the direction of effects between IPV and mental health in the prediction of coparenting quality.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>The questions raised by this study suggest several directions for future research. First, the generalizability of the results is limited due to the nature of the sample. This sample comprised primarily White couples and, although there is a wide range of age, income, and education, on average the couples were well educated and middle class. It is possible that different associations between violence and coparenting would be evident among couples of different backgrounds, or in a sample in which violence is more prevalent or severe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X11412037">Johnson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192513X11412037">Szinovacz &amp; Egley, 1995</xref>). The patterns of violence reported herein suggest that the families in this sample primarily reported common couple violence, which refers to violence mutually perpetrated by both members of a couple in the context of conflict, as opposed to the less prevalent “patriarchal terrorism” type of recurring and largely male-perpetrated violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X11412037">Johnson, 1995</xref>). Thus, replication of this study with different samples is needed. Nonetheless, it is notable that associations between violence and perceptions of coparenting were detected in a community sample of couples, even after controlling for socioeconomic status. We also note that the couples volunteered to participate in this randomized trial of a prevention program. However, these couples exhibited a similar prevalence of violence as that reported in other studies of community samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11412037">Katz &amp; Low, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X11412037">Slep &amp; O’Leary, 2005</xref>); therefore, the effects of selection bias may be limited.</p>
<p>The conclusions drawn from this study are limited by the sole use of self-report measures. A previous study has found links between violence and observed coparenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11412037">Katz &amp; Low, 2004</xref>); replicating this association across the transition to parenthood, using observational data, is an important direction for future work. Additionally, the use of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales to measure IPV limited us to an understanding of the occurrence of violent acts. Future work should focus on the meaning of violent behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X11412037">Johnson, 1995</xref>), and potential differences among couples in which women, men, or both exhibit violence, when predicting family processes across the transition to parenthood. For instance, it is important to understand whether mothers’ violence is in retaliation for fathers’ violence among some couples, which could have different implications for mental health and coparenting and might contribute to an explanation of the different pathways through which mothers’ versus fathers’ violence are associated with coparenting.</p>
<p>As discussed above, although the theoretical model underlying this study proposes that prenatal violence affects parental and couple functioning from the prenatal to the postpartum period, which in turn has implications for coparenting at child age 1 year, alternative directions of effect between these constructs are plausible and cannot be ruled out by the present study. Couple relationship quality could be a cause or result of violence, coparenting, or both; mental health problems could contribute to violence perpetration and result from victimization, and could be a cause or result of coparenting. In addition, the influence of prenatal IPV is likely to depend on whether violence persists after the transition to parenthood; measurement of IPV at later stages would allow for a better understanding of the ongoing role of IPV in family life. The current study tests a theoretically grounded model using measurements of family processes at specific points in time, but future work should explore alternative explanations for the observed associations.</p>
<p>Similarly, the proposed mediators of the violence–coparenting link were measured at the same time point. In fact, it is likely that there are bidirectional influences between mental health and relationship quality. Future research should aim to establish clearer evidence of causality in the prediction of coparenting by these constructs over time. Nonetheless, that couple relationship quality and mental health problems accounted for the associations between violence and coparenting suggests that they are likely to be useful foci for intervention.</p>
<p>Finally, this study only tested the first part of the conceptual model that we proposed, in which coparenting is a mediator of the associations between violence and parenting. Further work should test the full mediation model by examining the degree to which violence affects parenting through coparenting. Additionally, the proposed model is not exhaustive, and there may be reciprocal relations among many of the variables in the model as families deal with the challenges of the early family formation period.</p>
<p>This study covered new terrain in the field of violence and family systems by studying the longitudinal implications of IPV for coparenting across the transition to parenthood. Couple relationship quality and parent mental health in particular were uncovered as possible mechanisms linking violence with coparenting quality. The results of this study suggest that decrements in coparenting may be an important pathway through which IPV affects family functioning, and this result has important implications for preventive intervention with couples during the transition to parenthood.</p>
