<abstract>
<p>In the mid-2000s, a new rail defect that was initially classified as a squat became increasingly common on London Underground's track. By 2006, there were about 600 of these and they had become the Underground’s single most common rail defect. This defect occurred almost exclusively on lines carrying relatively new rolling stock. The work reported here was undertaken initially to characterize this defect, advise as to whether it was indeed a squat, and propose a hypothesis that explained its mechanism of formation. This paper includes observations and track measurements made in the field and initial results of a metallurgical analysis. The hypothesis for formation of the defects is presented, and both similarities and differences are discussed between these defects and the classical ‘squat’. The defect on London Underground appears to be the same as that described by Marich and his colleagues in Australia and by Li and his colleagues in the Netherlands. It is evidently not a conventional rolling contact fatigue defect. In order to avoid confusion arising from simple misuse of an established term, it is proposed that these defects be given a different name, for which ‘stud’ is proposed. Evidence to date is that the ‘stud' is a significantly more benign defect than the ‘squat’.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409711421462"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>A squat is a rolling contact fatigue (RCF) defect in rails whose characteristics are well understood as a result of more than two decades of research from the mid-1970s, primarily in Europe and Japan, e.g. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711421462">1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711421462">2</xref></bold>]. Squats are particularly dangerous defects because if they are allowed to remain in track, they commonly develop into rail breaks. For this reason, railway systems are concerned about the presence of squats and ensure either that rails are ground routinely to prevent small surface breaking cracks propagating and to manage rail–wheel contact stresses, or that rails containing cracks which have developed too deeply to be ground out are removed. The fact that squats to date have been associated primarily with passenger and mixed traffic railways has heightened an awareness of this hazard.</p>
<p>There is evidence that in the last 10–15 years a defect that shares many characteristics with the classical squat has become more prevalent. The literature on this defect is very much less mature than that on squats: most if not all publications to date are from groups in Australia, e.g. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711421462">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711421462">4</xref></bold>] and the Netherlands, e.g. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711421462">5</xref></bold>]. In order to provide relevant background to this article, a companion paper [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711421462">6</xref></bold>] summarizes the current understanding of the classical squat, the very much more limited material on those more recent defects that have been classified as squats, and draws attention to a couple of earlier references where the current problem may have been discussed without this having been realized at the time.</p>
<p>The original work described here arose primarily in an attempt to understand and assist with these defects, which beset London Underground (LU) in the mid-2000s. These defects, of which there were about 600 on LU’s 840 track km in 2006, were classified by the ultrasonic operators as squats. They appeared as squats to the naked eye and also the signal on their ultrasonic equipment (the conventional and widely used ‘walking stick’) indicated that there was a subsurface defect of substantially the same character as a squat. The vast majority of these defects occurred on the Jubilee, Northern and Central Lines, which had the newest rolling stock on the Underground. It was noted also that the defects were almost absent in tunnels, which was consistent with what was known of classical squats.</p>
<p>Although Tubelines had received advice from several sources that these defects were indeed squats, it was proposed that this was not in fact the case. An initial hypothesis to explain their development was proposed and used as a basis for the further investigations presented here. This article contains initial measurements and observations from track in London and elsewhere and also the results of metallurgical investigations, which were essential to reveal critical characteristics of the defects. Similarities and differences between these defects and squats are tabulated and discussed, and a more complete hypothesis is proposed for their development that is consistent with research undertaken to date. It is difficult to be certain that these defects are identical to those studied elsewhere [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711421462">3</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711421462">5</xref></bold>], but the critical characteristics appear to be identical insofar as these can be determined from the published literature and otherwise.</p>
<p>The defects studied here are certainly not squats, insofar as the term was introduced and used by Clayton, Allery and others [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711421462">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711421462">2</xref></bold>]. However, the defects share superficial characteristics. To reduce confusion not only in the text but more importantly amongst railway engineers, it is proposed that these defects be referred to by another name, for which ‘stud’ is proposed. If these defects are indeed recognized as a different phenomenon with a different cause, this is a first step to devoting resources to solving the correct problem. The potential for confusion is exemplified by the recent publication of two ‘best practice’ handbooks on the wheel/rail interface. In one of these, the conventional explanation is given of squats as an RCF defect [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409711421462">7</xref></bold>], whereas in the other, squats are treated as a different type of defect whose characteristics are less well defined [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711421462">8</xref></bold>]. This article suggests that one way of resolving this undesirable state of affairs is to consider that there are two significantly different defects. It is proposed that one of these defects (the classical squat) is relatively well understood as a result of decades of fruitful research. On the other hand, research into and understanding of the other type of defect (a ‘stud’) is in its infancy.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0954409711421462"><title>2 CONTRIBUTION OF THE CURRENT WORK</title>
<sec id="sec3-0954409711421462"><title>2.1 Observations and characteristics</title>
<p>The majority of work described here were sponsored by Tubelines Ltd who maintained about half of LU's infrastructure in a Public–Private Partnership initiative that came to an end in 2010. In 2006–2007, a total of 528 defects on the 330 km of track maintained by Tubelines were classified by staff as being squats. Almost, 500 of these defects were found on the Jubilee and Northern Lines, which had new rolling stock. Elsewhere on LU, these defects had been found only on the Central Line, which was maintained at that time by Metronet Ltd and which also had relatively new rolling stock. This type of defect existed previously and some metallurgical analysis and prior investigations had been undertaken, but by 2006, they had become LU’s single most common rail defect problem. The cost of their removal, primarily by re-railing the affected sites, was then about £6 million p.a. Localized weld repair, which is used also elsewhere for this problem, has subsequently been developed as a less expensive treatment of studs.</p>
<p>Examples are shown of studs from the Northern Line and from two other metro lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711421462">Fig. 1</xref>(a) to (c), respectively). In the first two cases, several dozen defects were observed within a few hundred metres of track. Defects were observed in curves and also in straight track. In almost all cases, they had the characteristic appearance of the defects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711421462">Fig. 1</xref>(a) and (b), with a V-shaped surface-breaking crack whose apex pointed to the field side of the rail. In all cases, the stud is more or less in the centre of the running band. In some cases, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711421462">Fig. 1</xref>(a), corrugation was present and had been exacerbated by the irregularity of the stud. The stud shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711421462">Fig. 1</xref>(b) was in the high rail of a curve. This had some gauge-corner cracking; but there was no sign of the stud being associated with surface cracks on the gauge corner. There has been some spalling from the defect in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711421462">Fig. 1</xref>(c), probably as a result of relatively recent grinding.
<fig id="fig1-0954409711421462" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>‘Studs’ from three railways (arrows on the rails in (a) and (b) point in direction of traffic and towards gauge face; arrows superposed on photos point to the apex of the ‘V’ shaped crack)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711421462-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Defects on LU's track were concentrated not only on specific lines but also in so-called “hot spots” on those lines: ten sites on the Jubilee and Northern Lines were responsible for 45 per cent of Tubelines' defects. Defects occurred almost exclusively in open rather than covered/tunnel sections: this has also been observed by those working on this problem in Australia, e.g. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711421462">4</xref></bold>]. Both characteristics are apparent from the map of defects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711421462">Fig. 2</xref> (for the Central Line). Stations are shown along the middle of the map and left and right rails on the eastbound and westbound tracks are shown above and below the stations, respectively. There are clear concentrations of defects e.g. around 28 km on both lines and also a gap from about 32 to 48 km where there are very few defects. The line is underground in this area. Several hot spots occur on the approach to signals, where many trains would first be braking and then under traction. This characteristic has also been observed by the first author on other railway systems. Apparently, no correlation has been found between defects and signals on RailCorp’s track in Australia [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711421462">4</xref></bold>]. Some hot spots on LU are not where a train would be expected to stand awaiting signal clearance but are instead on the straight approaching a signal, where drivers may coast at low speed for a signal check then apply traction when the signal turns to green. Other hot spots on the Northern Line and on other metro systems are found on the grade rising out of the underground section, where trains would be under consistently high traction. Some particularly severe areas of studs are associated with a combination of the two conditions, i.e. signals at the top of the incline from an underground section.
<fig id="fig2-0954409711421462" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Defect map, showing position of defects on the Central Line</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711421462-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>One possibility is that defects initiate at a depth of about 3–5 mm and then propagate in both directions, i.e. along (and slightly down) into the rail, and up to the rail surface. However, an initiation mechanism would have to be proposed. A typical cross-section from a defect that was removed from the Jubilee Line in 2006 and classified as a squat is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711421462">Fig. 3</xref>.
<fig id="fig3-0954409711421462" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Cross-section of defect, showing depth of a few millimetres below rail surface and length of about 30 mm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711421462-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In some hot spots defects have developed in about 3 months from the laying of new rail (on lines carrying barely 20 MGT of traffic per annum), which is an order of magnitude faster than a classic squat (see, for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711421462">Fig. 4</xref> of [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711421462">6</xref></bold>]). Although many defects have been detected, they appear to be relatively benign: few if any rail breaks have been directly attributed to these defects. In 2006, only one broken rail on Tubelines’ system occurred in which the crack was initiated at the railhead. This crack has the appearance of a classic RCF defect with a crack developing through a highly sheared surface layer, then turning down into the rail which results in a transverse defect. This apparently more benign characteristic of studs as compared to squats has also been noted in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711421462">4</xref></bold>] and [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711421462">5</xref></bold>]. Nevertheless, because cracks exist only a few millimetres below the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711421462">Fig. 3</xref>), the rails are regarded as being ultrasonically untestable. If operators had more sophisticated equipment that enabled the rail to be tested from the side as well as from the running surface, it would be possible to test the defects in detail and determine the depth of cracks, their rate of development, and whether other defects were hidden by cracks close to the surface. However, a conventional (and certainly also a safe) approach is to consider that a crack that has developed sufficiently deeply in the rail is a potential hazard and to schedule this for renewal or repair.
<fig id="fig4-0954409711421462" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Observations and measurements from opposite rails at defect locations (classified as squats on left-hand rail at 3.55 m and on right-hand rail at 7.4 m)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711421462-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>

<sec id="sec4-0954409711421462"><title>2.2 Inspection and measurement in track</title>
<p>An initial hypothesis was proposed that the defects observed on LU were the product of wheelslip, and that it may accordingly be possible to observe and measure features on both left and right rails even if an ultrasonic defect had been noted on only one rail. Both rails would be affected by wheelslip since they are linked by a common axle, although effects may differ because of friction, torsion of the axle etc. To test whether this was the case, track observations were made in the field and these were later supplemented by more detailed metallurgical investigation (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-0954409711421462">Section 2.3</xref>). Measurements and photographs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711421462">Fig. 4</xref> from a known hot spot on the Northern Line where sub-surface cracking had been observed ultrasonically at about 3.55 and 7.4 m on the left and right rails, respectively (on the scale in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711421462">Fig. 4</xref>) and the defects classified as ‘squats’. Measurements of irregularities on the rails were made with the Corrugation Analysis Trolley (CAT) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409711421462">9</xref></bold>], which was not designed for the purpose but appears nevertheless to have worked satisfactorily. It is not proposed here that the defects arose from wheels slipping at the same time on the same bogie (although this could occur). Spacing of these pairs of defects along the track is therefore irrelevant.</p>
<p>At the larger defect, on the right hand rail at 7.4 m, irregularities were visible almost directly opposite one another on both rails. Their depth was about 0.4 and 0.1 mm on right and left rails, respectively. At 3.55 m, an irregularity was visible on the left hand rail, and was barely 0.1 mm deep. No irregularity was measurable on the right rail, and although no defect was visible the surface appeared heavily scuffed. The surface of both rails was relatively smooth, whereas a rail with surface-initiated RCF (such as a squat) is rough to the touch in one direction and smooth in the other. This roughness is attributable to the unidirectional accumulation of strain at the rail surface typical of RCF initiation. At the site shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711421462">Fig. 4</xref>, there were locations with quite distinct ‘blobs’ of white phase directly opposite one another on the two rails, but no ultrasonic defect had been noted. Quasi-periodic white phase of this nature is a feature of stud sites more generally, and may (for example) occur because of torsional oscillation of axles when starting from standstill. This is discussed further in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec9-0954409711421462">Section 2.3.4</xref>. It was also noted, and is to some extent visible in the photographs, that there was lubrication on the gauge face of the rail opposite the defect, i.e. the right rail at 3.55 m and left rail at 7.4 m. Evidence of an obvious difference in friction on opposite rails has been noted at other sites where studs are present.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954409711421462"><title>2.3 Metallurgical examination</title>
<p>Several defects were removed from an open section the Northern Line, on ballasted track, for detailed metallurgical examination. Results are given here from a rail removed from one of the sites examined (designated site A) at which samples were taken close to two visible defects. One defect was at 370–470 mm within the rail section removed, and is referred to as being nominally at 430 mm, whereas the other was at 1360–1480 mm and is referred to as being nominally at 1450 mm. The rail from site A was removed from 65 m before a signal. In view of the hypothesis that studs may be a consequence of wheelslip, samples were removed from both rails opposite one another. These were aligned in the laboratory using the marks that had been made by the sleepers on the railfoot. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711421462">Figure 5</xref> shows the defect at 430 mm aligned with the opposite rail.) The ultrasonic defects, which were the reason for removing the rail section, were in the right rail (where right and left are defined looking in the direction of traffic). The defect from location 430 mm is shown in greater detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711421462">Fig. 6</xref> and has the characteristic appearance of an inverted V, with the apex towards the field side of the rail. The right rail defect at 1450 mm was in fact a series of defects similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711421462">Fig. 1</xref>(b). In both cases, there was visible damage on the opposite (left) rail.
<fig id="fig5-0954409711421462" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Overview of rails at site A 430 mm defect</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711421462-fig5.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig6-0954409711421462" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Detail of defect on right-hand rail</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711421462-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<sec id="sec6-0954409711421462"><title>2.3.1 Surface profile examination</title>
<p>The surface profile of both left and right rails was measured at the defect location and compared to the profile of a section of rail at which there were no visible defects or surface irregularities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711421462">Fig. 7</xref>). For defect location 430 mm, the depth of the dip in the defective rail is about 400 µm, which is similar to that of the defect measured elsewhere in track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711421462">Fig. 4</xref>). The depression spans about 60 mm (390–450 mm, where the scale is that shown by the tape in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711421462">Figs 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711421462">6</xref>). The ridge in the middle of the depression (between the two 'lobes' of the defect) is barely an inflection in the height of the dip, at about 425 mm. On the opposite rail, there is a very much shallower irregularity with a length of about 30 mm (435–465 mm) and surface scratches of 20–50 µm in depth at about 427 and 442 mm, which are apparent also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711421462">Fig. 5</xref>. This irregularity on the ‘opposite’ rail is not greatly different from the background level of surface irregularity measured well away from any visible defects.
<fig id="fig7-0954409711421462" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Irregularities on defective rail, opposite rail, and a reference section of rail. The reference data is vertically offset for clarity: (a) defect location 430 mm and (b) defect location 1450 mm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711421462-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>For the defect at 1450 mm, the undulations reflect the multiple defects present. There are also undulations on the opposite rail. On the right rail the peak to trough surface height difference is about 100 µm, a quarter of the defect depth at the 430 mm location. The large spike in the right rail profile at 1425 mm was caused by a crack mouth in the main depression of the series of defects. The spike at 1460 mm was caused by a crack mouth in the adjacent depression. The small spikes on the opposite rail (1380 and 1460 mm) are similar to those on the left rail of the 430 mm sample. Inspection of the rail surface showed the most likely cause in both cases was damage sustained in removing the rail from track. At the 1450 mm location damage to the right rail (large visible defect) consists of two depressions of 80–100 µm depth, while on the opposite rail there is a trough of approximately 50 µm depth over a length of about 120 mm.</p>
<p>At both defect locations, the length of surface profile recorded should adequately cover the location for both wheels on a single wheelset. Site A was on tangent track; so, there would be little yaw of the wheelset, and both wheels would be running at approximately the same longitudinal location on the rail. Any effect on the surface profile at the left and right wheels should have been captured if it had progressed sufficiently to affect the surface profile of the rails. The different degree of damage on the ‘opposite’ rail was explored further by taking cross-sections and hardness readings as reported below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0954409711421462"><title>2.3.2 Cross-sections through major defects</title>
<p>Samples were removed from both rails at both defect locations by cutting vertically in the longitudinal rail direction along the centre of the running band and through the centre of the visible defects. Specimens were etched to show the grain structure and extent of plastic deformation, and micrographs were stitched together to show detail of the cracks in the defective rail. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409711421462">Figure 8</xref> shows that the defect at 430 mm was surface-breaking on the sectioning plane selected, whereas the defect at 1450 mm was subsurface on this sectioning plane. The defect at 1450 mm broke the surface elsewhere, as shown by the spike in the surface profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711421462">Fig. 7</xref>(b). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409711421462">Figure 8</xref>(b) is therefore not an indication of completely subsurface growth, just that the crack was entirely below the surface on this sectioning plane through the rail. Both defects had developed more extensively from their shallowest point in the direction of traffic, but also had branches running in the opposite direction to traffic.
<fig id="fig8-0954409711421462" position="float"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Detail of crack in defective rail, formed using multiple micrographs: (a) location 430 mm and (b) location 1450 mm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711421462-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Although there is superficial similarity between the cracks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409711421462">Fig. 8</xref> and a conventional RCF crack, closer inspection reveals that there are also significant differences. Close to the surface, there is almost no accumulated plastic flow in the rail except just above the crack mouth. Minor distortion of the microstructure to a maximum depth of about 130 µm is present across the sample. This is far below the ‘ductility exhaustion’ level typically seen in RCF crack initiation for which plastic flow accumulates in a heavily sheared layer throughout the rail (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711421462">Fig. 3</xref> of Ref. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711421462">6</xref></bold>]). RCF cracks initiate when the ductility of this layer has been exhausted. The only location of greater plastic flow (to a depth of 450 µm) is in the poorly supported material just above the crack. However, even here the well supported material below the crack remains undeformed below 130 µm. This localization of plastic flow indicates that flow is a consequence of the crack rather than its cause: the material has become poorly restrained due to the crack and has then undergone plastic deformation. The ‘ductility exhaustion’ level of plastic flow at the surface needed for crack initiation is not present.</p>
<p>At depths below 450 µm, the cracks follow an erratic path crossing grains of pearlite. They are not restricted to the softer inter-granular ferrite. There is also no evidence in the individual micrographs which make up the composite pictures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409711421462">Fig. 8</xref> of corrosion of the crack faces. It is therefore unlikely that water contributed to crack growth. This strongly suggests that fluid entrapment, which is a commonly accepted mechanism for propagation of surface-initiated RCF cracks was not active for these cracks. There is also no evidence from the meandering crack faces of the smoothing that would have taken place if significant shear displacement with rubbing of the crack faces had been responsible for crack growth.</p>
<p>It is improbable that these cracks appeared ‘fully formed' or spontaneously. However, the metallurgical evidence presented here does not support either of the commonly accepted mechanisms of crack growth.</p>
<p>The two cracks that are apparent in the cross-section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409711421462">Fig. 8</xref>(a), forward and reverse of the surface breaking location) correspond to the two surface depressions in the rail. The crack mouth coincides roughly with the ridge at about 420 mm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711421462">Fig. 6</xref>(a).</p>

<sec id="sec8-0954409711421462"><title>2.3.3 Cross-sections to reveal white etching layer</title>
<p>Examination of rail cross-sections at just below the running surface revealed patches of white etching layer (WEL) on both right (visibly cracked) and left (opposite) rails. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711421462">Figure 9</xref> illustrates the white etching layers found very close to the main defects on the right rail, and in the ‘opposite’ left rail at the same location. The WEL in most cases is well attached to the rail surface. In some locations, there were small voids below patches of WEL, although these were not observed close to the major defects. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711421462">Figure 9</xref> also shows the absence of all but minor plastic flow at the rail surface.
<fig id="fig9-0954409711421462" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>WEL on the rail running surface: (a) location 430 mm, left-hand rail; (b) location 430 mm, right-hand rail; (c) location 1450 mm, left-hand rail; and (d) location 1450 mm, right-hand rail. All sections are in the rail longitudinal direction, except (b) which is from a transverse section</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711421462-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>At location 430 mm, the WEL thickness was greater on the right rail (70 µm depth) than on the left rail (18 µm depth). On both rails, it was found in patches rather than as a continuous layer. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711421462">Fig. 9</xref>(b), it is clear that the pro-eutectoid ferrite has persisted within the WEL, and this emphasizes how little plastic damage is present. This strongly supports formation of this layer by a thermal mechanism rather than by the plastic work mechanism proposed in Ref. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711421462">3</xref></bold>] and by Ivanisenko <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711421462">11</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>The WEL on the left rail at location 1450 mm was different from that observed elsewhere in that it was much thicker. The boundary between WEL and the underlying pearlite was also much less distinct. The patchy nature of the WEL is revealed in this sample, with a separation of about 2 mm between the centres of WEL patches. Although the bottom of the WEL layer is indistinct, the layer is nevertheless more than 125 µm thick. In track, this sample was opposite the site of the undulating surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711421462">Fig. 7</xref>(b)). Such a thick layer of WEL strongly suggests that the rail steel was exposed to very high ‘flash’ temperatures. Formation of martensite, which gives the white etching appearance, requires that the rail steel reaches a temperature in excess of 727 °C followed by rapid cooling [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954409711421462">12</xref></bold>]. Sufficiently rapid cooling occurs because of the high thermal inertia of the rail, with heat at the surface rapidly dissipated into the surrounding steel [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711421462">13</xref></bold>].</p>

<sec id="sec9-0954409711421462"><title>2.3.4 Rail surface hardness</title>
<p>Core hardness readings were taken at 23 and 28 mm depth on the defective and non-defective rails, respectively. The difference was dictated by the size of the samples. In both cases, the measurements were made well below the contact surface and any accumulated plastic flow. The core hardness (HV, 10 kg, average of five readings) was 232 HV on the right (visibly defective) rail and 290 HV on the non-defective left rail. Since both sets of readings were taken well away from any plastic flow produced by the passage of trains, the hardness readings demonstrate a difference in rail microstructure. The production year of the right rail was determined from its rolling mark as 1984, but unfortunately the left rail section did not have a visible rolling mark. (In view of the history of defects at this site, this rail may well have replaced one with defects.)</p>
<p>Surface hardness (HV with a 1 kg indenter) was measured along the running band on both left and right rails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409711421462">Fig. 10</xref>). There is some periodicity in the hardness on both rails and at both sites with a similar wavelength of about 20–30 mm. At location 430 mm, where there is a single defect, the peaks in right rail hardness at 390, 420, and 440 mm correspond roughly to the running-off end of that defect, the centre and the running-on end, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711421462">Figs 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711421462">6</xref>). At location 1450 mm, the correlation of hardness and features of the multiple defects is less clear.
<fig id="fig10-0954409711421462" position="float"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Variation in surface hardness on defective rail and opposite rail (aligned) for locations: (a) 430 mm and (b) 1450 mm. Average of two readings at each position</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711421462-fig10.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The hardness variations are the result of patchy, quasi-periodic white etching layer (WEL) on the rail crown. One possible cause of the quasi-periodic WEL is that it was established by some periodic behaviour of the wheelset. A second possible cause is short-wavelength rail corrugation associated with the track’s pinned-pinned resonance [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711421462">10</xref></bold>]. This is commonly at about 460 Hz on LU as a result of the small rail section and wide sleeper spacing; so, a 20–30 mm wavelength would correspond to a speed of 33–48 km/h. However, in view of the slightly different wavelength of the variation in railhead profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711421462">Fig. 7</xref>), particularly on the undamaged rail, it would be desirable to examine other samples to resolve the interdependence of periodicity of WEL and corrugation, and to what extent (if any) their periodicity is associated with the stud. In the work of Li <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711421462">5</xref></bold>], it appears that the periodicity of corrugation is closely related to the spacing of the two ‘lobes' of the defect, although it is unclear whether this is a necessary condition for either the defect or corrugation to exist. It is quite possible that WEL is established in a quasi-periodic manner at some locations whereas at others it is initially more continuous and then worn away (or detached) quasi-periodically by traffic.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0954409711421462"><title>2.5 Hypothesis</title>
<p>The following hypothesis is proposed to explain the features of studs that have been observed to date and the circumstantial evidence regarding their appearance. This is substantially the same as that which was advanced in early work with Tubelines in 2007.
<list id="list1-0954409711421462" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Studs are initiated by thermal damage of the rail.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Thermal damage results from limited wheelslip, possibly associated with localized areas of poor adhesion. Where studs appear on one rail, there is circumstantial evidence that this results from different friction conditions on the two rails. These would cause one wheel to slip preferentially and the other to slip as a result of the two wheels being interconnected. In such circumstances, thermal damage would be greater on the rail with greater friction, so the stud would initiate on this rail.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Studs are associated with vehicles having AC traction or thyristor-controlled DC traction because wheelslip is better controlled than with conventional DC traction. Severe wheelburns are a consequence of gross wheelslip, which may be more common on older forms of DC traction because of more basic wheelslip control. More modern traction systems commonly have higher limiting values of traction coefficient i.e. the ratio of traction to normal load. This is particularly the case with so-called high-traction locomotives that are widely used on the heavy-haul systems examined in Refs [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711421462">3</xref></bold>] and [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711421462">4</xref></bold>].</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Studs appear on open track and not in tunnels because wheel/rail friction is lower in open track and conditions exist for wheelslip to occur. In tunnels, limiting friction is commonly (but not always) sufficiently high to sustain high traction ratios.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The mechanism by which studs propagate is unclear, but it may be a low-cycle fatigue mechanism associated with contact stresses, of a similar form to that which causes shells to propagate initially parallel to the rail surface [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954409711421462">14</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954409711421462">15</xref></bold>].</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec12-0954409711421462"><title>3 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>A type of rail defect has been observed increasingly in the last 10–15 years that bears superficial similarities to the so-called ‘squat’, which is a surface-initiated rolling contact fatigue defect that was first identified in the 1970s. The more recent defect which is christened here as a ‘stud’, appears to those who undertake ultrasonic testing of rails to be sufficiently similar to the classical squat for them to classify it as such. Although there is no evidence to date that studs break rails, whereas breaks commonly develop from squats, the fact that there is a subsurface crack makes the rail ‘ultrasonically untestable’ (at least by conventional means). The defect must therefore be removed or an alternative treatment or inspection method developed. Studs can be extremely common and concentrated within short sections of track: they appear to be particularly prolific on the approach to signals and on the incline up from underground sections of metro systems, where dozens may exist within a few hundred metres. Studs also develop within about 10 MGT, which is almost an order of magnitude more quickly than squats.</p>
<p>Examinations have been made of studs in the field and a detailed metallurgical examination has been made of studs removed from a metro line. From this study, it is clear that studs are not a conventional RCF phenomenon, and indeed that they can develop (as in the sample considered here) in the absence of significant plastic deformation of the rail surface. White-etching layer (WEL) is closely associated here and in some previous work with studs, and it is proposed here that the white-etching layer is a fundamental component of the mechanism of thermal damage as a result of controlled wheelslip that initiates a stud. Different forms of damage, such as irregularity of the running surface and patches of WEL, have been noted on pairs of opposite (left and right) rails in the field and in the laboratory, which is consistent with the proposed initiation mechanism by controlled wheelslip.</p>
<p>Studs appear to be associated with more modern traction control systems, in particular AC traction, in which wheelslip is better controlled to permit operation at higher traction ratios. It may correspondingly be the case that wheelburns are less common with such traction packages.</p>
<p>Work is in hand to test the proposed hypothesis more fully and, if it is found to be viable, to develop a way of obtaining the benefits of modern traction control systems at less cost in rail (and possibly also wheel) damage.</p>
