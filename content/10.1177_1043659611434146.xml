<p>Spring has arrived and calls us to move forward with renewed optimism and enthusiasm. As we plant our seeds of knowledge, experience, and wisdom, hoping for a bountiful harvest, we realize that we may have to deal with the potential obstacles along the way. If we were “real farmers” we’d have to deal with rain, drought, and frost. As TCNS members, we must contend with differences of opinion, perspective, and, of course, those whose view may be “my way or the highway.” My sons can attest to the latter in me. As a single mom, raising two children and working full time, there was no Plan B. Yet, as the President of the TCNS, my goal is to ensure that everyone is at the table and all voices are heard as we plan our future together.</p>
<p>First, thank you for your response to our request for input for Goal 1: To advance cultural competence for nurses worldwide. Great ideas come from great minds willing to think “outside the box” and envision new possibilities. Now it is time to look at Goal 2: To advance the scholarship of the discipline. For some, this may be an area of expertise, and for others, this information is applied in the clinical setting. We all strive, though, to gain insights into cultures, competency, and care. So let’s look at how we have met this objective in the past.</p>
<p>One very significant venture that has provided substantive knowledge is the <italic>Journal of Transcultural Nursing</italic>. Included in every publication are research findings, clinical practice, and newly published books that satiate those of us with “inquiring minds that want to know more.” Each offers insight into a myriad cultures, countries, and concerns that we encounter in our clinical and academic settings. We have answers backed by research and experience, helping guide us as we respond to dilemmas that rise unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Another opportunity to advance scholarship is the annual Transcultural Nursing Society conference. For 37 years, this gathering has brought together scholars and experts who bring cutting-edge research to the forefront. We have been challenged by the each keynote speaker, every session attended, and every poster purveyed. All grapple with new information and its application to health care.</p>
<p>Now it’s your turn. How would you advance the scholarship of our discipline? Visit TCNS website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tcns.org">www.tcns.org</ext-link>) and let your voice be heard!</p>
