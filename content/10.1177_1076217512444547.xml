<p>For decades, mass media outlets have portrayed Black males along a continuum that can be described as implicitly stereotypical (at best) to overtly racist (at worst). For example, the image of successful Black male entertainers and athletes is as common in popular discourse as is the portrayal of them as dangerous criminals and hypersexed misogynists. K-12 educational literature has, traditionally, served as a microcosm of this discourse in its narrow depiction of Black male students as well. Despite the popularity of these representations, such a narrow portrayal of Black males has the potential to have long-lasting negative impacts on how these students make meaning of themselves with respect to their race and gender.</p>
<p>Social scientific literature has offered a vast array of evidence to suggest the salience of individuals’ changing perceptions of themselves—otherwise known as identity development. In the field of gifted education, for example, there has been a clear emphasis on exploring how students classified as gifted make sense of being classified as gifted. This is important as being formally identified as a gifted student differentiates many students from school norms and produces a “stigma of giftedness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217512444547">Cross, Coleman, &amp; Terhaar-Yonkers, 1991</xref>, p. 45). The field has also displayed an interest in understanding masculinity as it pertains to males enrolled in gifted education programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217512444547">Cross, Speirs Neumeister, &amp; Cassady, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076217512444547">Shepard, Nicpon, Haley, Lind, &amp; Liu, 2011</xref>); however, the gifted education literature devoted to Black male masculinity is comparatively silent.</p>
<p>Scholars in other fields directly and indirectly associated with education have taken great care to explore how Black males make sense of their identities—particularly masculinity identities—and how said sense making has implications for their mental health and wellness in general and their academic performance, more specifically. Gifted educators have not been as vigilant about discussing this topic up to this point providing only cursory exploration of the topic. Considering the tumultuous psychological and sociological experiences that have historically and are currently associated with being a Black male in the United States and the fact that schools, to a degree, act as microcosms of the United States, it seems important for gifted educators to understand how Black males develop perceptions of what it means to be a Black male in today’s social context. Moreover, it has been argued that gifted educators should be interested in learning about the possible relationship between Black males’ understanding of their masculinity and subsequent thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to school in general, and gifted education, in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1076217512444547">Whiting, 2006</xref>). Perhaps, within this understanding lie answers to the field’s persistent conundrum of successfully recruiting and retaining Black male students in gifted and advanced classes and programs.</p>
<p>That said, the purpose of the article is to provide a brief introduction to Black male masculine identity development and relate it to the field of gifted education. It will begin with information related to identity development that is applicable to Black males. Next, the Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory (PVEST) theory will be explored and used as a framework for understanding how Black males develop identities that may enhance or impede the likelihood that they become willing participants in more challenging academic contexts. Finally, the article will end with a discussion of the implications of an increased understanding of Black male masculine identity development for gifted educators as well as recommendations for improved recruitment and retention of Black males in advanced academic classes and programs.</p>

<title>Historical Masculine Identity Development</title>
<p>Developing an understanding of how individuals make sense of themselves has fascinated scholars for quite some time. Associated with this interest has been a desire to ascertain how certain identities relate to how much or how little an individual values himself or herself or feels valued by others. Different personal attributes have been valued to varying degrees in society. Being a male has been, and continues to be, one of the more valued identifying characteristics an individual may possess. Historically, masculinity was primarily described from a biological perspective and very much culture free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217512444547">Smiler, 2004</xref>). It was believed that men inherently attempt to achieve goals and acquire attributes that affirm their biological identity as men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217512444547">Pleck, 1987</xref>). Men were assumed to be inherently strong, active in society, and rational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217512444547">Pleck, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1076217512444547">Terman &amp; Miles, 1936</xref>). Failure to achieve this ideal was thought to be problematic.</p>
<p>Like many other forms of identity scholarship, the early literature on masculinity was based on the experiences and norms of White men. In the book <italic>The Male Machine</italic>, a very stereotypical notion of masculinity is endorsed. In it, it is asserted that men were “programmed to tackle jobs, override obstacles, attack problems, overcome difficulties, and always seize the offensive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512444547">Fasteau, 1975</xref>, p. 2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1076217512444547">Tolson (1977)</xref>, however, urged a move away from conceptualizing masculinity as a summary of what men do toward a more holistic purview—manhood as a state of being. This critique of the masculinity literature led to explorations of the difficulty associated with trying to reach standardized male accomplishments.</p>

<title>Black Male Masculine Identity Development</title>
<p>The fascination with Black males in popular and scholarly literature is astounding. This attention could, in theory, be a fantastic thing given the tremendous barriers to success for this segment of society; however, oftentimes, this interest is skewed and biased to the point of promoting a distorted image. Black males have been repeatedly reported to be criminals, sexually charged, unintelligent, unconcerned with family, and prone to violence. Given the historic nature of these descriptors, despite important exceptions, it is not difficult to suggest that Black males may be the most stigmatized members of our society. In essence, negative Black male images seem to have evolved into a structural entity that may, unfortunately, never cease to exist.</p>
<p>These misrepresentations have been and continue to be internalized by many (including Black males, themselves) and have led to difficulties for Black males not only in the past but also manifest in the present. For instance, due to the election of President Barack Obama, there is now a popular belief in the notion of equal opportunities for success for all men regardless of racial background. This color-blind ethos is closely associated with a meritocratic belief system that ultimately blames individuals for their present condition; in essence, if you do not succeed, it is your own fault. What this belief system does not take into account, however, are the numerous factors associated with an individual’s racial background and social class that may impede or enhance the likelihood of success and represent inequalities that are structural in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217512444547">Sanchez, Liu, Leathers, Goins, &amp; Vilain, 2011</xref>). For instance, overall, there is a strong positive correlation between quality and quantity of education and upward mobility in terms of career advancement. So, it is much more likely that an individual born into a family with a high socioeconomic status (SES) and social class status will attend high-quality schools and pursue higher levels of education. Because Black males tend to be born into families with lower SES and social class status than White males, they are much less likely to experience similar qualities and quantities of education. Some scholars associate this example and other similar disparities between Black and White individuals to a long-standing legacy of racism as manifested through slavery, Jim Crow laws, and current incidents of subtle racism that are much more difficult to detect than in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512444547">Majors &amp; Billson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076217512444547">Shapiro, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512444547">Cazenave (1984)</xref> was one of the first researchers to take multiple factors into consideration in the discussion of masculinity among Black males. Many other scholars soon followed with similar broad-based analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217512444547">Franklin (1984)</xref>, for instance, contended that White and Black male masculinity differ in the sense that White men work toward modifying current masculinity standards whereas Black men work toward definitions of masculinity that take their differential life circumstances into account. Along these lines, other researchers have since focused more attention to examining how Black males make sense of their masculine identity that takes contextual factors into account. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217512444547">Oliver (1984)</xref> discussed the process of Black males’ meaning-making in the face of racism, for example. In probably the most popular book exploring Black male masculine meaning-making, <italic>Cool Pose: The Dilemmas of Black Manhood in America</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512444547">Majors and Billson (1992)</xref> submitted the widely cited term <italic>cool pose</italic> to describe how Black males cope with race and gender discrimination:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>By cool pose we mean the presentation of self many black males use to establish their male identity. Cool pose is a ritualized form of masculinity that entails behaviors, scripts, physical posturing, impression management, and carefully crafted performances that deliver a single, critical message: pride, strength, and control. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512444547">Majors &amp; Billson, 1992</xref>, p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Clearly, conceptions of masculinity are now thought of as context dependent. Over time, literature related to the topic has evolved from the notion of one meaning based on White male norms to multiple meanings—the understanding of masculinity as a social construction that differs according to a number of different factors such as race, social class, ethnic group, sexual orientations as well as generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217512444547">Levant, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Now that we live in the age of the Obama Administration, there are those who assert society is now color-blind and all males—regardless of racial background—have equal opportunity to succeed. The deeply imbedded nature of this societal ethos presents a salient departure from previous attitudes and contexts in which masculinity was formerly defined. If a belief that egalitarianism and meritocracy are the current norm, past concepts such as cool pose may no longer have the explanatory power it once had. In fact, a reliance on cool pose to explain Black male behavior may serve to further isolate them if detractors continue to use the selection of a Black male president as reason to discount present-day racial inequalities.</p>
<p>The author’s critique of cool pose is certainly not the first. Despite its popularity, it was also suggested that using “cool pose” as a frame to describe Black male masculinity may be inadequate for the purposes of explaining Black masculinity in much depth. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217512444547">Hammond and Mattis (2005)</xref> contended that cool pose as an exploratory paradigm and defined Black male masculinity in such a way that could be described as inauthentic. In other words, the authors contend that cool pose describes detached, masking performances designed to resist racism and hide true feelings:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>By acting calm, emotionless, fearless, aloof, and tough, the African-American male strives to offset an externally imposed “zero” image. Being cool shows both the dominant culture and the black male himself that he is strong and proud. He is somebody. He is a survivor despite the systematic harm done by the legacy of slavery and the realities of racial oppression, in spite of the centuries of hardship and mistrust. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512444547">Majors &amp; Billson, 1992</xref>, p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote>

<sec id="section3-1076217512444547">
<title>Current Context of Black Male Masculinity Development</title>
<p>In addition to critiques related to cool pose’s present-day relevance and its explanatory depth, it can also be argued that a more holistic explanation detailing developmental thoughts, behaviors, and attitudes learned over time may be more useful in describing how school-age Black males make sense of their masculinity and, thus, make subsequent choices. If it is true that a number of individual and social factors contribute to cultivating masculine identities, it stands to reason that the current conditions in which school-age Black males develop should be explored and understood instead of relying on adult explanations.</p>
<p>There is a more robust body of literature focused on the educational experiences and outcomes of Black males than any other ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512444547">Lee &amp; Ransom, 2011</xref>). The statistics related to Black students’ educational state as a whole are quite abysmal. According to any number of different measures, Black students trail many of their school-age peers, with Black males faring worse than others—including Black females—on most standardized assessments of academic achievement. Lee and Ransom’s comprehensive report titled <italic>The Educational Experience of Young Men of Color: A Review of Research Pathways and Progress</italic> offers a great deal of statistics detailing the crisis. For example, according to the report, in 2008, 12% of Black males aged 16 to 24 dropped out of high school compared with 9% of Black females. In 2009, 51% of Black male 12th graders scored below basic in reading according to National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) compared with 36% of Black females and more Black males (64%) scored below basic according to math NAEP scores than Black females (63%) as well. The same NAEP math and reading trends were found for those Black male and female 4th-and 8th-grade students who took the NAEP in 2009 as well (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES]).</p>
<sec id="section4-1076217512444547">
<title>Post-High School Pathways</title>
<p>In terms of what happens to Black students post high school, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512444547">Lee and Ransom (2011)</xref> offered an explanation of six pathways: (a) enrollment in a 2-year or a 4-year college or a vocational school; (b) enlistment in U. S. Armed Forces; (c) employment in U. S. workforce; (d) unemployment; (e) incarceration in state or federal prisons, or in local jails; and (f) death.</p>
<sec id="section5-1076217512444547">
<title>Enrollment in a 2-year or a 4-year college or a vocational school</title>
<p>According to scholars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512444547">Lee and Ransom (2011)</xref>, the first pathway is attendance in secondary educational settings. In 2008, 33.4% of Black males ages 15 to 24 with a high school diploma enrolled in some form of secondary education. Of those Black students with and without a high school diploma, Black females represented 55.5% of those enrolled in a 2-year, 4-year, or vocational institution compared with Black male 15- to 24-year-olds who represented 44.5%. More specifically, in 2008, fewer Black 15- to 25-year-old males than 15- to 24-year-old Black females attended vocational schools (0.9%-2.1%), 2-year institutions (12.9%-18.4%), 4-year institutions (29.0%-32.6%), and graduate schools (1.7%-2.5%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1076217512444547">
<title>Enlistment in U. S. Armed Forces</title>
<p>This is one statistic Black males tended to far outdistance their Black female peers. Of all Black 15- to 24-year-old high school graduates, 0.9% enrolled in the military in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512444547">Lee &amp; Ransom, 2011</xref>); 74.3% of Black male 15- to 24-year-olds entered the military compared with 25.7% of 15-to 24-year-old Black females.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1076217512444547">
<title>Employment in U. S. workforce</title>
<p>21.0% of Black male ages 15 to 24 with a high school diploma entered the workforce in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512444547">Lee &amp; Ransom, 2011</xref>). Black females accounted for 50.2% of all 15- to 24-year-olds employed compared with 49.2% of Black males.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1076217512444547">
<title>Unemployment in the United States</title>
<p>This represents another pathway in which Black males outperform Black females. In 2008, 34.4% of Black males ages 15 to 24 with high school diplomas were unemployed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512444547">Lee &amp; Ransom, 2011</xref>); 52.6% of all 15- to 24-year-old Black males were unemployed in 2008 compared with 47.4% of Black females.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1076217512444547">
<title>Incarceration</title>
<p>Out of all the pathways, this is the one in which there is the greatest discrepancy between male and female representation. Of Black males ages 15 to 24 with a high school diploma, 9.9% were incarcerated in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512444547">Lee &amp; Ransom, 2011</xref>); Black males represent 94.6% of all Black 15- to 24-year-olds incarcerated with Black females representing 5.6%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1076217512444547">
<title>Death</title>
<p>Of Black males ages 15 to 24 with high school diplomas, 0.3% died in 2008; 77.5% of all 15- to 24-year-olds who died in 2007 were Black males; 24.5% were Black females.</p>
<p>These statistics provide salient information that helps explain the current context in which Black males must grow into men and develop their personal masculine identities. Despite having the first Black male president in the history of the United States, unmistakably clear evidence exists that we, as a society, have yet to become postracial. In fact, it could be argued that according to the aforementioned pathways, Black males may be in a crisis that is unlike any other time in our nation’s history. Indeed, school-age Black males in today’s society, it can be argued, are developing in one of the most ironic periods in this nation’s history. Despite Black males’ disturbingly close relationship with statistics indicating their struggles for success as a whole, they are also closely aligned with one of the most strikingly intuitive displays of Black male success—the selection of President Barack Obama. This strange juxtaposition constitutes a weirdly ironic occurrence and further reason to analyze Black school-age males’ development of a masculine identity with this context in mind. That is, despite the election of our nation’s first Black president, it may be quite difficult to convince Black males of the potential for positive outcomes in their personal lives. The fact still remains that, as a whole, Black males are struggling despite this historical event. For example, they are underrepresented in positive pathways in comparison with Black females (enrollment in a 2-year or a 4-year college or a vocational school, and employment in U. S. workforce) and overrepresented in negative pathways (unemployment, incarceration in state or federal prisons or in local jails, and death) and enlistment in U. S. Armed Forces, which some might consider to be a less desirable pathway for Black males.</p>

<title>Using Theory to Understand Black Male Masculine Identity Development</title>
<p>Originally, masculinity was thought to be based on standards related to accomplishing tasks associated with stereotypical White male standards of success. Now, the literature has evolved to the point of considering masculine identity development to be very context specific and unique to the individual. Most recent masculinity literature is promoting the notion of multiple masculinities that vary according to individual characteristics such as race, social class, sexuality, as well as generation, with an emphasis on the context in which the individual is experiencing meaning-making associated with the characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217512444547">Levant, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Black males have been found to have different conceptualizations of masculinity as a function of their unique history of oppression and stigmatization associated with their characteristics, namely, race and gender. As such, a different framework for understanding their masculine identity development that takes these individual and societal factors into consideration is necessary.</p>
<p>It is probably most useful to use an ecological perspective to understand the intricate contexts in which school-aged Black males must mature in this generation. Essentially, the basic premise of an ecological perspective is the assumption that human behavior is a product of interactions between different aspects of a person’s environment or ecosystem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512444547">Bronfenbrenner (1977)</xref> introduced the most popular ecological model comprising four subsystems: (a) microsystems consist of interactions that take place within a particular environment such as a school, home, or church; (b) mesosystems refer to the interactions between two or more different microsystems such as those between a school and family; (c) exosystems comprise subsystems that have an indirect impact on an individual’s behaviors such as the mass media or community; and (d) macrosystems are the explicit and implicit societal norms and values such as those related to race, gender, and social class that may be subtle but are, nonetheless, quite powerful.</p>
<p>Considering that most discussions of Black male masculine identity development focuses on adults, it is necessary to use an alternative approach that breaks away from the status quo and takes the distinct nature of the experience of being a Black male child and adolescent within this generation into consideration. Although extremely useful, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217512444547">Spencer (1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217512444547">Spencer, Dupree, &amp; Hartmann, 1997</xref>) not only recognized this need and took <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512444547">Bronfenbrenner’s (1977)</xref> model a step further and added a developmental aspect that considers the various subsystems that impact individuals’ lives but also takes into account how meaning-making is made prior to adulthood. Called the Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory (PVEST), it is useful because it focuses on experiences of youth within their context and how these context-specific experiences lead to belief systems and behaviors that develop over time. In essence, the model assists in clarifying how individuals’ perceptions serve to mediate or exacerbate the connections between identities—including race and masculine identities—context, and behaviors.</p>
<p>Similar to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512444547">Bronfenbrenner’s (1977)</xref> model on which it is grounded, the PVEST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217512444547">Spencer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217512444547">Spencer et al., 1997</xref>) is based on a series of interconnected components. First, the <italic>risk contributors</italic> component takes self-appraisal processes into account and defines them as being heavily dependent on social cognitions. In other words, perceptions of self are intricately linked to what one thinks others think about him or her. Factors such as race, gender, social class, physical appearance, and other identifying characteristics may be considered positive or negative attributes based largely on information gleaned from individuals other than oneself. The second component, <italic>stress engagement</italic>, entails the actual experience of stress related to the recursive evaluation process. In other words, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217512444547">Spencer (1995)</xref>, the very act of attempting to understand how one perceives his or her personal characteristics (e.g., Black and male) in relation to how others perceive those characteristics can be thought of as an intermediate experience of stress. The third component, <italic>reactive coping methods</italic>, focuses on the process associated with the aforementioned analysis. Being engaged with stress requires corrective problem-solving strategies designed to reduce the effects of said stress. Reactive coping methods can be described as maladaptive and adaptive. Adaptive solutions are thought to produce productive outcomes (e.g., increased self-efficacy, improved resiliency) whereas maladaptive solutions may be considered unproductive (e.g., dropping out of school/underachievement). The fourth component, <italic>stable coping responses</italic>, is associated with <italic>emerging identities</italic> development (e.g., racial identity and masculine identity). “[A]n unavoidable, reciprocal, and bidirectional linkage exists between the two [reactive and stable] coping responses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217512444547">Spencer et al., 1997</xref>, p. 819). That is, evaluative efforts associated with the products of reactive coping methods are ongoing and developmental. These appraisals, again, are based on self–other social-cognition processes or, stated differently, what you think of yourself and what you think others think of you. Over time, these social cognitions become so ingrained to the point where they are considered stable coping responses and help form the basis of an emerging identity. The fifth and final component, <italic>life stage outcomes</italic>, is a culmination of the products associated with coping with stress and consist of relevant behavioral and health-related outcomes that may be considered adverse (e.g., mental illness, poor health, violence) or productive (e.g., high academic achievement, good health, positive relationships).</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Based on the PVEST approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217512444547">Spencer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217512444547">Spencer et al., 1997</xref>), the following recommendations will be provided to assist teachers committed to helping Black students explore, and seriously consider, all of their options as it relates to gifted and advanced academic programs and classes. It is important to note, however, that many of the recommendations can be adopted by teachers who are not necessarily identified as a formal gifted educator.</p>
<sec id="section13-1076217512444547">
<title>Risk Contributors</title>
<p>Educators and students (Black females and students identified as races other than Black) may perceive Black males in negative terms. This, in and of itself, it can be argued, makes being Black and male a risk contributor. Given the social-cognitive nature of identity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512444547">Bronfenbrenner, 1977</xref>), it is imperative that Black males not be the sole focus of any interventions designed to assist them. Although these perceptions may not be confirmed, it is important to be proactive in dispelling myths others have about Black males as well as those negative notions Black males may have about themselves.</p>
<p>To proactively address this concern before it becomes an issue, all educators should develop activities with this goal. Teachers can include curriculum that highlights the achievements of famous Black male figures within context, as opposed to presenting it as an ancillary portion of courses. For instance, when discussing the particular periods in history, it might be useful to discuss the contributions of Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois, Malcolm X, Benjamin Oliver Davis Jr., Martin Luther King Jr., and others during that specific time period. Helping all students understand and become more aware of their tradition of excellence and human agency may help instill a sense of pride in Black males and admiration in other students which may, in turn, lead to Black males being aware of the stereotypes associated with being Black and male, but not internalizing them.</p>
<p>To gain a better understanding of the quantity and quality of stress Black males are exposed to, it is incumbent on teachers to collaborate with school counselors to identity those students most at-risk for stress. Indeed, it is quite difficult for any student to focus on more challenging coursework when confronted with stress. Nonetheless, scholars contend that resilience can only be realized when individuals are involved with stressful experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217512444547">Spencer et al., 1997</xref>). As such, teachers can work very closely with school counselors to develop classroom guidance activities that support this agenda through hands-on activities and in-depth discussions. The ultimate goal in this case would be to help students in the class understand what it is like to be a Black male in multiple contexts and some of the barriers and support systems they encounter on a daily basis. Also, a skilled school counselor can provide an atmosphere in which Black males feel safe enough to explore how they perceive their life and situations that may be considered stressful. Some of these things may be subtle in nature and serve as an awareness-building exercise for other students as well as educators.</p>
<p>As important as it is to understand stressful events encountered by Black males, it may be more important for educators to gain an understanding of how students react to events. Teachers have a great opportunity to gather information related to this in a variety of classes. For instance, a writing assignment in an English class might involve students reading <italic>Dreams From My Father</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217512444547">Obama, 2004</xref>) and having students discuss the stressful events President Barack Obama experienced in his life. Once a complete list is created, students can be instructed to compare and contrast how they might respond with similar situations. Teachers can then collaborate with school counselors to develop classroom guidance lessons that extend the learning to school, family, and community contexts. It may be surprising for some students and educators to become aware of events that some consider stressful but Black males do not (e.g., repeatedly getting pulled for “driving while Black”). Caution should be taken to not have Black males pressured to serve as representatives of all Black males.</p>
<p>In addition to classroom guidance, school counselors can also use small group counseling to help students understand the notion of adaptive and maladaptive solutions in response to stressful experiences. For those Black males who display the potential to succeed in a gifted program or advanced courses, this atmosphere may be conducive to more in-depth discussions of how students respond to stressful events and what they consider to be adaptive and maladaptive. For instance, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217512444547">Ford (1993)</xref>, many Black students, including males, say they want to succeed in school but their actions do not support such a belief. During group counseling, the school counselor can confront students about maladaptive behaviors that do not lead to high academic achievement. For some students, this may be the first time they have ever been challenged to consider how their actions align with their goals. As such, this could represent an opportunity for the school counselor to explore how these actions may be related to perceptions they have of themselves (e.g., “Black guys don’t belong in gifted classes!”), others have of them (“Black guys who are in gifted classes are soft!”), and develop a plan to rectify the problem with more adaptive solutions.</p>
<p>It is hoped that educators will be hypervigilant about helping students critique their solutions to stressful events in the hopes that they will not incorporate maladaptive coping methods that evolve into stable coping responses—thus, a salient aspect of their emerging identity. For instance, at some point in their lives, Black males will have to evaluate how their perceptions of what it means to be a Black male compares with others’ perceptions. If, for example, others associate poor performance in school with what it means to be a Black male and the student in question associates it with high academic achievement, this can represent a very stressful experience. The student may respond to this stress by ignoring others’ perceptions which could lead to being marginalized or not being accepted by peers. From the student’s standpoint, peer acceptance may be more important than high academic achievement in which case, he may adopt maladaptive solutions in response to the stress (e.g., cutting class, not turning homework) as opposed to more adaptive solutions (e.g., aligning with other students who hold similar perceptions of masculinity). Either one of these types of solutions, if consistent over time, evolves into evidence of an emerging identity.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>“While gaining an understanding of the relevance of race is of utmost importance, so too is an understanding of the confluence of race and masculinity perceptions as it pertains to educating Black males.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As an extension of the interventions designed to explore reactive coping methods, the activities associated with students at the point of displaying stable coping responses stage may be more about consistent “check-ins” with Black male students. Although students at this stage display consistent behaviors as part of their identity that educators may disagree with (e.g., misogyny, poor school performance, violence), they must not give up hope. Teachers can collaborate with school counselors to identify particular students who may benefit from individual counseling sessions that explore perceptions of masculine identities. During these sessions, counselors can ask students broad questions aimed at determining how they perceive of themselves as Black males and how this relates to how others’ perceive them. If students have adopted masculine identities that do not pigeonhole them into narrow categories, this time can be spent working toward future goals (e.g., enrolling in advanced classes) and exploring how this relates to productive behavioral and health outcomes within the context of their perception of what it means to be a man. If students’ masculine identities require them to behave in maladaptive ways (e.g., dropping out of school, drug use), it is also helpful to explore how these behaviors are associated with adverse behavioral and health outcomes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is imperative that educators develop an understanding of the context in which Black males must develop masculine identities. Incorporating this information into their work with those students who have been—or have the potential to be—formally identified as gifted is especially critical. Much of the literature that speaks to meeting the needs of formally gifted and potentially gifted Black males tends to give cursory attention to masculinity in favor of a more explicit emphasis on race. This article contends that while gaining an understanding of the relevance of race is of utmost importance, so too is an understanding of the confluence of race and masculinity perceptions as it pertains to educating Black males. To give scant attention to the relationship between race and masculinity is to treat Black students as a monolith which has dangerous implications for educators. A one-size-fits-all approach does not take into account the unique experience of being Black and male, which is quite different from Black females in most cases. If gifted educators are truly concerned with increasing the likelihood of successfully recruiting and retaining Black males in gifted programs and advanced courses, it is imperative they get into the mind of these students and attempt to gain a better understanding of what it is like to be them.</p>
