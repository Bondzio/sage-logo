<sec id="sec1-1460408611400806" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Zygomatic complex fractures are the second most common fractures of the facial skeleton after nasal bones and management of these fractures represents a large proportion of the workload of maxillofacial units. Males in the 21–35 age groups are more likely to be affected. Interpersonal violence and motor vehicle accidents outnumber all other causes of zygomatic complex trauma; assaults predominate in the United Kingdom; globally, however, motor vehicle accidents account for the largest proportion.</p>
<p>The zygomatic bone occupies a prominent and important position in the facial skeleton. The zygoma forms a significant portion of the floor and lateral wall of the orbit and forms a portion of the zygomatic arch, otherwise known as the malar eminence, which plays a key role in the determination of facial morphology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408611400806"><title>Surgical anatomy</title>
<p>The zygoma is a dense bone and is the main buttress between the maxilla and the skull, transmitting forces from the dentition to the skull base. In spite of its sturdiness, its prominent location makes it prone to fracture. The mechanism of injury usually involves a blow to the side of the face from a fist, from an object or secondary to a motor vehicle collision.</p>
<p>From a reconstructive viewpoint, the zygoma can be considered to have four main articulations: (1) with the frontal bone at the zygomaticofrontal (ZF) suture, (2) with the maxilla forming the orbital floor and anterolaterally at the zygomatic buttress, (3) with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone at the zygomatic arch and (4) with the greater wing of the sphenoid at the lateral wall of the orbit. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408611400806">Gruss et al., 1990</xref>) The sphenozygomatic junction is an important landmark (especially in laterally displaced fractures) in the management of zygomatic complex fractures. The alignment of the zygoma with the greater wing of the sphenoid in the lateral orbit is critical for determining adequate reduction of zygomatic fractures. Reducing the three points that make up the buttresses also helps ensure proper alignment of the zygoma.</p>
<p>Laterally, the masseter muscle from below attaches to the zygomatic arch and produces displacing forces on the zygoma. The coronoid process and the attached tendon of the temporalis muscle lie deep to the zygomatic arch.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1460408611400806"><title>Pattern of injury</title>
<p>Trauma to the zygoma often leaves the bone intact with fractures occurring at its articulations. The bone can be considered as a four legged stool; if one leg fractures with displacement there must be fracture and displacement at the other legs (apart from localised arch fractures). Displacement is often in the direction of the force producing the fracture and is frequently in a horizontal plane rotating around the ZF suture. Moderate force may result in minimally or nondisplaced fractures at the suture lines. More severe blows frequently result in inferior, medial and posterior displacement of the zygoma. Comminuted fractures of the body with separation at the suture lines are most often the result of high-velocity motor vehicle collisions.</p>
<p>A number of efforts have been made to produce classifications of these fractures in an attempt to predict stability (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408611400806">Knight and North, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611400806">Henderson, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611400806">Banks, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611400806">Manson et al., 1990</xref>) and to better determine the prognosis and treatment of these injuries, but these have not been widely adopted. In general, clues to instability are: the degree of displacement, vertical displacement with widening of the ZF suture and comminution.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1460408611400806"><title>Treatment</title>
<p>In uncomplicated fractures, treatment is often delayed for approximately 7 days to allow soft tissue swelling to settle. This will allow reassessment of clinical displacement and if intervention is indicated, access through tissue which is not swollen.</p>
<p>The principles of treatment of zygomatic fractures are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611400806">Banks, 1987</xref>):
<list id="list3-1460408611400806" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>restoration of facial contour,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>restoration of the orbital rim and globe protection and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>removal of any interference to mandibular movement.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The traditional method of reduction is via a temporal incision (Gillies’ lift), where an instrument is slid beneath the temporalis fascia and, consequently, under the arch and the fracture reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408611400806">Gillies et al., 1927</xref>). An alternative method is to introduce a bone hook beneath the anterior arch through a stab incision in the cheek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408611400806">Strohmeyer, 1844</xref>). Although in simple fractures these techniques will prove satisfactory, they have a number of disadvantages when used alone: they are essentially blind reductions with the operator relying on feel; they do not allow for fixation of the fracture.</p>
<p>The authors’ preferred method is to expose the zygomatic buttress through an intraoral buccal sulcus incision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611400806">Keen, 1906</xref>). This allows an elevator to be introduced beneath the arch through the mouth and the fracture reduced under direct vision. Accurate positioning of the buttress has been shown to be an excellent determinant of proper reduction of the zygomatic complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408611400806">Markowitz and Manson, 1998</xref>). Fixation of the fracture can be achieved through the same incision using a 1.5 mm titanium miniplate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408611400806">Figure 2</xref>). In cases with marked displacement of the ZF suture, exposure of this fracture through an upper blepharoplasty incision will allow repositioning of the suture prior to reduction of the body of the zygoma through the buttress approach. The upper blepharoplasty produces a more aesthetic postoperative result than the frequently used lateral eyebrow incision. A useful technique is to initially reduce the vertical or horizontal discrepancy at the ZF suture with a stainless steel wire; after reduction and fixation at the buttress, the wire may be left in situ or replaced by a small miniplate. Although the buttress and ZF approaches will manage the majority of fractures, there are occasions where further exposure is required to achieve anatomical reduction. In these cases, access incisions to the orbital rim (as discussed in orbital floor fractures) and/or exposure of the arch via a hemicoronal flap may be required. These latter approaches should not be used as primary methods as they do not allow for adequate reduction. It is important that zygomatic fractures are well treated as failure to correct the anatomical projection and width can result in poor appearance, which is difficult to address at a later stage.
<fig id="fig2-1460408611400806" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>A comminuted fracture with three point fixation at the zygomatic buttress, orbital rim and zygomaticofrontal (ZF) suture.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611400806-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Isolated zygomatic arch fractures may be reduced either by a Gilles temporal lift or via the buccal sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611400806">Keen, 1906</xref>). Clearly, these approaches do not allow for direct fixation. Unstable arch fractures may require a coronal approach to stabilize the fracture by direct osteosynthesis.</p>
<p>In the early postoperative hours, patients should have their eye signs monitored. Although uncommon (0.3%), retrobulbar haemorrhage may occur after surgery and requires prompt intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408611400806">Ord, 1981</xref>). Although medical management is described, early surgical evacuation of the clot and decompression is ideal.</p>
<p>Pharmacological management of retrobulbar haemorrhage is just as important as operation and has even been shown to produce a satisfactory outcome, when used as sole treatment. It can be instituted immediately after the diagnosis or while lateral canthotomy is being done. Hyperosmotic agents, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and corticosteroids are the mainstay. Osmotic agents, such as mannitol, shrink the vitreous and reduce the volume of tissue in the orbit. Acetazolamide reduces intraocular pressure by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase and dramatically reducing production of aqueous humour. The following medical management should be used immediately on diagnosis:
<list id="list4-1460408611400806" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>mannitol 1–2 g/kg of 20% solution intravenously over 30–60 min;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>acetazolamide 500 mg bolus followed by 125–250 mg intravenously four times a day and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>dexamethasone 8 mg intravenously as a single dose.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>If the condition responds, treatment should be continued for 5–7 days. Other simple conservative measures that may be overlooked include elevation of the head, topical ice packs, and avoidance of dressings that can often be compressive and increase intraocular pressure. Analgesics and sedatives can also be used to lower the blood pressure.</p>
<p>Persistent loss of vision to no perception of light or deterioration in vision despite medical treatment and lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis are ominous signs and warrant formal orbital decompression. This can be accomplished through a pre-existing surgical wound, or by other techniques including transantral ethmoidectomy and the transantral sphenoidal approach.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1460408611400806"><title>Orbital fractures</title>
<sec id="sec10-1460408611400806"><title>Surgical anatomy</title>
<p>The orbit is roughly pyramidal; its base is the opening at the rim and its apex is the optic foramen. The superficial bony orbit is defined by the orbital margin, which is rectangular with rounded corners. In cross section, its shape varies from the rim backward as a rough square, to circular and pyramidal towards the apex. The orbits are aligned so that the medial walls are parallel and the lateral walls are perpendicular. The arc from medial to lateral wall in each orbit is 45°. Lines dropped through a central anterior-to-posterior axis of each orbit bisect at a 45° angle. The floor is two thirds the depth of the orbit. The average dimensions of the orbit are as follows:
<list id="list5-1460408611400806" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Height of orbital margin – 40 mm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Width of orbital margin – 35 mm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Depth of orbit – 40–50 mm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interorbital distance – 25 mm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Volume of orbit – 30 cm<sup>3</sup><sub>.</sub></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The orbit has two fissures; the inferior lies between the floor and the lateral wall. The greater wing of the sphenoid, the maxilla, and the palatine bones form the boundaries of the inferior orbital fissure. It communicates with the infratemporal fossa. The superior orbital fissure lies between the roof and the lateral walls bounded by the lesser and greater wings of the sphenoid.</p>
<p>The floor is thin and lies below the level of the rim and rises in its proximal third; this ‘postbulbar constriction’ is important in globe projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408611400806">Manson, 1998</xref>). The inferior orbital groove, in the proximal floor leads to the infraorbital canal, its foramen leaving below the rim. The floor forms the roof of the maxillary sinus.</p>
<p>The medial wall is also thin and contains the lacrimal apparatus and the attachment of the medial canthus. The roof forms the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. The lateral canthus is attached to Whitnall’s tubercle lying 10 mm below the ZF suture and 2–4 mm from the rim. The lateral wall and the bone around the optic foramen (fortunately) are thicker. The approximate distance from the rim to the inferior orbital fissure is 20 mm, and to the orbital apex 40–45 mm. Knowledge of orbital bony anatomy is essential if orbital trauma is to be adequately treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1460408611400806">Figure 3</xref>(a) and (b)).

</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1460408611400806"><title>Mechanisms of injury</title>
<p>Fractures of the thin floor and medial wall may occur without disruption of the rim; such injuries are described as blowout fractures. Two mechanisms of blowout fractures are described here:
<list id="list6-1460408611400806" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The ‘buckling theory’; direct impact on the orbital rim may lead to flexion rather than fracture, but the deformation of the thin floor and medial wall leads to fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611400806">Fujino and Makino, 1980</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ‘hydraulic’ theory; direct impact on the globe produced a pulsion effect leading to increased intraorbital pressure and fracture of the thin floor and/or medial wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408611400806">Smith and Reagan, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1460408611400806">Figure 4</xref>).</p></list-item>

</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1460408611400806"><title>Patterns, signs and symptoms</title>
<p>Orbital floor fractures may be ‘trap door’ or linear and produce their typical clinical signs by herniation of orbital contents into the antrum and trapping of the inferior rectus muscle. Small changes in the converging orbital walls have a significant impact on orbital volume. Consequently, patients with orbital floor fractures present with enophthalmos and limitation of upward gaze producing diplopia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1460408611400806">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1460408611400806">6</xref>). Additional signs are paraesthesia in the distribution of the infraorbital nerve, subconjunctival haemorrhage and circumobital ecchymosis. Classically, occipitomental radiographs show the ‘hanging drop sign’ of the orbital fat into the antrum, however, this is best demonstrated on coronal CT scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1460408611400806">Figure 7</xref>). It is desirable that all patients with diplopia see an orthoptist and ophthalmologist to document acuity, motility and range of movement, and any enophthalmos (Hertels’ exopthalmometer).

<p>The complex orbital anatomy must be reconstructed and every attempt must be made to restore orbital volume in order to treat enopthalmos and correct globe position primarily. This avoids the development of delayed enophthalmos, which is significantly more difficult to correct.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1460408611400806"><title>Approaches</title>
<p>A number of approaches have been described to access the orbital floor for repair: skin incisions, blepharoplasty, mid-tarsal crease and transconjunctival. The latter is the authors’ preferred approach because of its lack of facial scar; its access can be improved by extending laterally as a lateral canthotomy, or medially combined with a transcaruncular/retrocaruncular approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611400806">Edgin et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Many materials have been used to cover the floor or wall defect, including silastic sheet, titanium mesh or stock preformed titanium plates, and, where the defect is particularly large or volume is required, bone harvested from calvarium or iliac crest.</p>
<p>Transantral endoscopic repair of orbital floor fractures has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408611400806">Person and Wong, 2002</xref>). This has found its supporters but is not widely practiced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611400806">Fernandez et al., 2007</xref>). Navigation-guided reduction of orbital floor fractures is also being undertaken in some units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408611400806">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Postoperative management of orbital floor injuries should include close monitoring of visual acuity and motility for 24 h due to the risk of retrobulbar haemorrhage. Postoperative CT scanning is the norm in centres in the United States and mainland Europe, although this is not routine practice in the United Kingdom. With the advent of conebeam technology, perhaps this will change.</p>
<p>Recovery of diplopia following repair is variable, particularly in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408611400806">Worthington, 2010</xref>). It should be realised that soft tissue injury and fibrosis will also contribute to disordered ocular motility. Improvement may occur over the following months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408611400806">McGurk, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Complex injuries of the orbit involving the bones comprising the rim and the internal anatomy can be challenging. In such cases, preoperative planning is the key. Fine cut spiral CT scans with appropriate 3D reconstructions are of immense value in planning. Firstly, the rim should be reduced and fixed, followed by reconstruction of bony defects of the walls and floor and, finally, the disrupted canthal tendons should be repositioned. Occasionally, bespoke prostheses can be reconstructed on stereolithographic models generated from the images in the management of cases where there has been tissue loss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1460408611400806" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Fractures of the orbitozygomatic complex are common. Restoration of function and appearance remains the objective. A good knowledge of the local anatomy allows an appropriate approach to be planned. Team working with colleagues in orthoptics and opthalmology is required to produce optimum results for the patient. Increasingly, sophisticated imaging for assessment and endoscopic aids for diagnosis and management are in vogue.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim is to provide adequate protection of the globe and improve final aesthetic outcome.</p>
