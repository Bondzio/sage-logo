In Japan, GLP inspections of facilities that test pharmaceuticals and medical devices are coordinated by the Office of the Conformity Audit of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). All of the applications received for GLP inspection by the PMDA from fiscal years (FY) 2009 to 2011 were reviewed. The article analyzes the VAI (Voluntary Action Indicated) recommendations that were made to the test facilities after inspection. Using these data sources, the study calculates the number of VAI recommendations made to the facilities, classifies the topics of notification, and demonstrates trends in the VAIs issued in FY2011. In FY2011, the number of VAI issues about animal care and management as well as computerized systems increased compared with FY2009 and FY2010. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)</kwd><kwd>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA)</kwd><kwd>GLP inspection</kwd><kwd>regulation</kwd><kwd>nonclinical safety studies</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) was established and came into service on April 1, 2004, under the Act on the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, which consolidated the services of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Evaluation Center of the National Institute of Health Sciences (PMDEC), the Organization for Pharmaceutical Safety and Research (OPSR/KIKO), and part of the Japan Association for the Advancement of Medical Equipment (JAAME).</p><p>The PMDA’s mission is to improve public health in Japan through such activities as reviewing submissions for pharmaceuticals and medical devices for marketing authorization based on the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law of Japan; collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information related to the quality, efficacy, and safety of pharmaceuticals and medical devices; and providing medical expenses, disability pensions, bereaved family pensions, and other benefits for people who have suffered severe illness or disabilities caused by adverse reactions from pharmaceuticals or infections from biological products. The PMDA reviews applications for new pharmaceuticals and medical devices and provides related services.</p><p>Nonclinical tests intended to support applications for marketing permits are required to follow the applicable Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).

The test facilities, which either belong directly to pharmaceutical or medical device companies or are contract research organizations (CROs), have been applying to PMDA for a GLP inspection voluntarily almost continuously for 2 or 3 years after notification of GLP compliance certification. In general, 2 to 4 GLP inspectors are present for an inspection. Their inspection includes a test facility inspection (laboratory tour) and 1 or more study audits, and the inspection takes about 2 to 5 days. The typical inspection (a total of 4 or 5 days) consists of the following: opening meeting, Q&amp;A of a summary report of the GLP system in the facility, laboratory tour, study audit, computer system inspection, and commentary from the inspectors. The length of the inspection depends on the number of study audits and the size of the facility. When the inspection is finished, the inspectors make a report that is submitted to the GLP Evaluating Committee. The committee makes the final decisions as reported in the inspection result notification and the GLP compliance certification for the test facility.</p><p>The inspection result notification in Japan is graded as follows: Grade A (complies with GLP), Grade B (some issues have to be corrected but the establishment complies with GLP as a whole), and Grade C (the establishment does not comply with GLP). The notification of the results includes the following details: for Grade A, “No objectionable conditions or practices were found during the inspection” (No Action Indicated [NAI]), and “Objectionable conditions or practices were found, but the agency is not prepared to take or recommend any administrative or regulatory action” (Voluntary Action Indicated [VAI]); for Grade B, “PMDA requests that the test facility officially submit an improvement plan” for the VAI; and for Grade C, “Regulatory and/or administrative actions will be required of the test facilities” (Official Action Indicated [OAI]). In addition, the certification of the GLP inspection indicates that Grade A and B inspection results are in GLP compliance but Grade C is not in GLP compliance.</p><p>This study reviewed all the applications for GLP inspection submitted to PMDA between fiscal year (FY) 2009 and 2011, using the inspection result notification documents as reported to the testing facilities over the 3 years. Detailed examination of the VAI ratings given in FY2011 was conducted, although the number of VAIs was decreasing. In addition, we selected the topics that showed increases over the 3 years. Using these data sources, which cover all domestic Japanese facilities and were compiled for the 3-year period, we calculated the number of instructed items in the VAI recommendations (ie, specific items recommended for improvement), classified the topics of notification, and demonstrated the trends for VAIs in FY2011. The objective of this study was to determine the changes in GLP inspection findings in Japan over this time period.</p><sec id="section1-2168479013489302" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study calculated the number of inspection result notifications that PMDA issued to testing facilities between FY2009 and FY2011. There were no duplicate inspections in those 3 years. There were no Grade B or Grade C certified facilities in Japan during those 3 years, so this study classified the instructed items as VAI or “No Instructed Items.” The “No Instructed Items” classification also includes NAI classification, but NAI included a few oral recommendations made during the inspection (not recorded in the notifications). Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Washington) was used for the statistical analysis.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2168479013489302">Figure 5</xref>, VAI recommendations for animal care and management were separated into 5 types. The issues that prompted VAI recommendations in FY2011 were “Inadequate” animals (28%), “Unhealthy” animals (27%), and “Records of animal care and administration” (27%). “Inadequate” indicated that animal identification numbers overlapped or were obscured and confused, “Unhealthy” indicated that animals were improperly treated, and “Records of animal care and administration” entailed a lack of records or discrepancies between raw data and final reports.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2168479013489302">Figure 6</xref> shows the percentages of computer systems issues in the total number of VAIs. The VAI concerning “Stand alone systems” first occurred in FY2011. The main problem that prompted the “Stand alone systems” category was incomplete validation of the systems. The percentages for “Toxicology systems” and “Thermo and hydro measurement systems” were the highest in FY2011. Problems in these categories included that validation tests were incomplete or the definitions of raw data were unclear.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section6-2168479013489302"><title>Discussion</title><p>The percentages of “No Instructed Items” in the inspected test facilities reports increased between FY2009 and FY2011. The number of VAI recommendations to the facilities tended to decrease throughout the 3 years, and the percentages of VAIs submitted to facilities with Pharmaceuticals GLP decreased through the 3 years. However, the changes were not different whether classified as Pharmaceuticals GLP or Medical Devices GLP. The mean number of VAIs per test facility was about 3 items. For both the Pharmaceuticals GLP and Medical Devices GLP facilities, the mean number of VAIs per facility was the smallest in FY2011. The results of the number of VAIs show that the quality of the test facilities improved during the 3 years. There was a differentiation between Pharmaceuticals GLP and Medical Devices GLP because the number of inspections for Medical Devices GLP facilities in FY2010 was extremely small (only 2 facilities). However, the total percentages of “No Instructed Items” in FY2011 were 6 times as much as in FY2009. This suggests that the facilities’ adherence to GLP improved during these years.</p><p>The breakdown of VAIs in FY2011 showed that several unfavorable issues were increasing. The results of the GLP inspections revealed that the number of “animal care and management” and “computer systems” issues increased during the 3 years. Improper identification of animals (or cages) will become a major problem for research studies if it leads to inaccurate results and unusable data. In addition, if the staff of the GLP facility treat unhealthy animals improperly, the animal facility may need to be closed due to infection or disease. Inappropriate treatment of unhealthy animals also may be a cause of infectious disease contamination. Therefore, facilities should be more careful about animal care and management; GLP inspectors would prefer that these facilities voluntarily improve their procedures for animal care.</p><p>Computerized systems are making tremendous progress, and the number of facilities that have adopted computerized systems is increasing. In parallel with this, VAIs regarding computer systems have also increased. For the 3 years of this study, the number of VAI issues concerning “Stand alone systems,” “Toxicology systems,” and “Thermo and hydro measurement systems” increased. Remarkably, there was a lack of validation testing and a problem with misdefinition of raw data. It is easy to use GLP automated-computerized systems, but such systems are more difficult to control and manage than paper-based GLP systems. Also, it is difficult to maintain security for computer systems and electronic raw data. Therefore, facilities should improve validation procedures and systems managers should validate the computer systems periodically.</p></sec><sec id="section7-2168479013489302"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper reveals findings from GLP inspections in Japan. Several unfavorable issues were noted, but the results of the study show that the quality of facilities in terms of GLP improved greatly in the 3 years examined. The GLP inspectors from PMDA hope all facilities in Japan will observe GLP regulations and will improve their GLP systems voluntarily. This study should benefit facilities that conduct regulated nonclinical studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The author thanks Ms Emiko Kondo and Dr Toshihiko Asano for insight and critical feedback on this manuscript.
