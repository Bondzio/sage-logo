<abstract>
<p>The Winnipeg River Drainage Basin (WRDB), within the boreal forest region of northwest Ontario, is a region that is expected to be negatively affected by climate warming. Inferences of droughts over the past two millennia from Little Raleigh Lake were based on two nearshore sediment cores. The core locations were from depths of ~12 and 15 m and were based on sufficient nearshore sediment accumulation and distance from the modern benthic-to-planktonic diatom boundary, where a distinct shift from dominance of benthic taxa changed to dominance of planktonic taxa in surficial sediments at ~11.8 m. Diatom-inferred depth was based on a model developed from 60 surficial sediments within the study lake. Depth inferences indicate that prolonged periods of aridity occurred from ~<sc>ad</sc> 950 to 1300 (corresponds to ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly’) and from ~<sc>ad</sc> 1625 to 1750 (aridity during ‘Little Ice Age’). We found that the core collected from a depth closer to the benthic-to-planktonic diatom boundary was more sensitive to changes in lake level than the deeper core where planktonic diatoms dominated the assemblage. The inferred low-water stands of the past two millennia are well outside of the range of the past ~100 years, suggesting that recent drought history may not be a good estimate of future extremes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The boreal region covers a large portion of Canada and contains ~80–90% of the freshwater in Canada in its lakes, rivers and wetlands. The boreal biome is predicted to be one of the most affected by climate warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683612463103">Schindler and Lee, 2010</xref>). Increasing temperatures are predicted to decrease lake levels and river flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683612463103">Ruckstuhl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683612463103">Schindler and Lee, 2010</xref>). Lakes are integrators of overall water balance, and changes in the hydrological balance of a lake can impact the physical, chemical and biological processes, particularly if the changes are prolonged. Lake response to changes in water balance can thus provide key insights into the effects of climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683612463103">Williamson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Droughts are a normal feature of climate, but when droughts are frequent or of long duration, they can have significant impacts on lake levels. For example, Lake Chad, the second largest lake in West Africa, has shrunk dramatically over the last few decades because of both low rainfall and ever-increasing human withdrawals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683612463103">Williamson et al., 2009</xref>). Evidence from the sedimentary records of lakes indicate that dramatic declines in lake level have also occurred in the past. For example, during the extreme aridity of the mid Holocene the southern basin of Lake Winnipeg dried out for several millennia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683612463103">Lewis et al., 2001</xref>) and the water level in the Great Lakes fell below their outlets, disconnecting the basins during a dry period between ~8300 and 8800 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683612463103">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Sediment records from topographically closed-basin lakes in arid and semi-arid regions commonly have been used to infer past climatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683612463103">Fritz, 2008</xref>), but deciphering the signal in lake sediments in humid regions is more complex. The extent to which drainage lakes (those with surface outlets) respond to climate can often be difficult to estimate from sediment records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683612463103">Smol and Cumming, 2000</xref>). Calibration data sets using the depth distributions of diatom assemblages within individual lake basins have been used to assess changes in lake level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683612463103">Brugam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683612463103">Laird and Cumming, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683612463103">Yang and Duthie, 1995</xref>). When combined with the utilization of nearshore sediment cores, collected near the boundary between primarily shallower benthic diatom assemblages and deeper planktonic-dominated assemblages, this approach can provide a robust means of inferring past droughts in drainage lakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612463103">2012</xref>). Defining the boundary between primarily benthic and planktonic diatoms (B:P) through analysis of surface-sediment samples along a depth gradient within a lake has been found to be robust across many lakes in northwest Ontario within the Winnipeg River Drainage Basin (WRDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683612463103">Kingsbury et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In this project, changes in diatom assemblages and inferences of diatom-inferred depth are used to reconstruct changes in effective moisture from two nearshore sediment cores in Little Raleigh Lake located in the eastern region of the WRDB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612463103">Figure 1</xref>). The main objective of this paper is to investigate whether the range of variability in effective moisture (particularly arid conditions) in Little Raleigh Lake during the last ~100 years (time period of instrumental record) is representative of the natural variability over the past two millennia. The second objective of this paper is to provide insight on reconstruction methods for effective moisture with regards to coring location. This study contributed to the development of a basin-wide assessment of the susceptibility of the WRDB to drought over the last 2000 years and, thereby, scenarios of possible future change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Study site</title>
<p>The WRDB is composed of two main watersheds: Lake of the Woods/Rainy River and English River (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612463103">Figure 1</xref>), both of which flow towards the Winnipeg River and into Lake Winnipeg and then into the Hudson Bay drainage system. The eastern portion of the WRDB is dominated by forests comprised primarily of black spruce (<italic>Picea mariana</italic>), jack pine (<italic>Pinus banksiana</italic>) and poplar (<italic>Populus</italic> spp.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683612463103">Kingsbury et al., 2012</xref>). The closest climate station to Little Raleigh Lake (LRL) is in Dryden, Ontario which is located ~90 km northwest. Average annual precipitation at Dryden is ~790 mm, with average annual (summer) temperatures of 1.8 (17.2)°C.</p>
<p>Little Raleigh Lake (N 49°27′13″, W 91°53′46″) is a headwater lake with a surface area of 73 ha (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612463103">Figure 1</xref>), a maximum depth of ~20 m, a mean depth of ~7 m and a watershed to surface area ratio of 2.8. Water sampling in June 2008 indicated LRL is oligotrophic (total phosphorus = 7.0 µg/l, total Kjeldahl nitrogen = 280 µg/l) with low specific conductance (24 µS/cm), slightly acidic (pH of 6.1) and relatively clear (dissolved organic carbon of 5.2 mg/l, Secchi depth of 4.8 m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683612463103">Kingsbury et al., 2012</xref>). Thermocline depth in June 2008 was 5–7 m, and in July 2008 6–8 m.</p>

<p>The location of nearshore cores in LRL were selected based on seismic profiling of sediments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612463103">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Figures S1 and S2, available online) and the analysis of diatoms in surface-sediment samples along a depth gradient to define the diatom benthic to planktonic (B:P) boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683612463103">Kingsbury et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683612463103">Figure 2</xref>). Based on the surface-sediment analysis from LRL, three diatom zones were defined: (1) a nearshore assemblage (0–6 m) of <italic>Achnanthes</italic> (sensu lato), <italic>Nitzschia, Cymbella</italic> (sensu lato), and other benthic species; (2) a mid-depth assemblage (6–11.5 m) of small <italic>Fragilaria</italic> (sensu lato) and various <italic>Navicula</italic> taxa; and (3) a deep-water assemblage (&gt; 11.5 m) of planktonic origin (mainly <italic>Disco stella stelligera</italic> and <italic>Cyclotella bodanica</italic> v. <italic>lemanica</italic>). These zones were based on the results from a constrained cluster analysis (CONISS) using TILIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683612463103">Grimm, 1987</xref>) and verified by the broken-stick model using PSIMPOLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683612463103">Bennett, 1996</xref>).</p>

<p>High-resolution seismic data determined that the east–west axis of the lake has a gentle slope with sufficient sediment accumulation to detail changes in lake level over the past two millennia (Supplementary Figure S2, available online). Seismic profiling was carried out using a Knudsen 320M marine sounder with 200 kHz and 28 kHz transducers, and lake floor and sub-bottom acoustic reflections were recorded graphically on thermal recording media.</p>
<p>Gravity and piston cores were collected in June 2009 and June 2010 using a Glew gravity corer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683612463103">Glew, 1989</xref>) and a Livingstone piston corer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683612463103">Glew et al., 2001</xref>), and sectioned into 0.25 cm intervals on site and in the laboratory, respectively. In 2009, a gravity core of 44 cm in length and a piston core of 4.9 m in length were collected from a lake depth of ~14.9 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612463103">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Figure S3, available online). In 2010, a gravity core of 45 cm in length and a piston core of 4.3 m in length were collected from a lake depth of ~11.8 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612463103">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Figure S3, available online). In this paper, we refer to the core taken from a lake depth of ~12 m as ‘Core 1’ and the core taken from a lake depth of ~15 m as ‘Core 2’.</p>

Major diatom assemblage zones were identified using a constrained incremental sums of squares cluster analysis (CONISS) using the program Tilia v. 2.02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683612463103">Grimm, 1987</xref>).

The significance and robustness of the CONISS zones were evaluated by comparison with the broken-stick and optimal splitting sum-of-squares zoning methods using PSIMPOLL v. 4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683612463103">Bennett, 1996</xref>).

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to summarize the main directions of variation in the diatom assemblage data in the cores. PCA was chosen to represent the main direction of variation of the diatom assemblages because the gradient length in an initial detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was &lt;1.5 standard deviation units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683612463103">Legendre and Birks, 2012</xref>).

<title>Matching of the gravity and piston cores</title>
<p>Organic matter (OM) content was used to match the depth of overlap between the gravity and piston cores retrieved from the same lake-water depth (Supplementary Figure S4, available online). For Core 1, collected from a lake depth of ~12 m, the top of the first section of the piston core overlapped at ~15 cm depth of the gravity core. For Core 2, collected from a lake depth of ~15 m, the gravity core and the top of the first section of the piston core overlapped at ~18 cm depth of the gravity core. The OM data suggests that the top ~15–18 cm of the piston cores was lost when placed horizontally for extrusion because of the high water content of the uppermost sediments.</p>
<p>The overlap of the gravity and piston cores, based on OM, was consistent with the changes in relative abundance of diatom species. Periods of overlapping data between the piston and gravity core are shown in order to provide information on the reproducibility of diatom counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683612463103">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683612463103">5</xref>). Diatom-inferred depths were calculated separately for each gravity and piston core, and plotted according to the overlap based on the OM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683612463103">Figures 4</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683612463103"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683612463103">6</xref>). The high reproducibility in the overlap area enabled a composite core comprised of the higher-resolution gravity core and the piston cores from 45 cm to the bottom for both cores 1 and 2 to be utilized in analysis for determination of assemblage zones and the main direction of variation, represented by PCA axis-1 scores.</p>

<title>Comparison of diatom assemblages and depth inferences between the coring locations</title>
<p>The collection of the two core sequences from different lake depths allowed this study to address the sensitivity of core location relative to the depth model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683612463103">Figure 2</xref>). The Core 1 sequence, retrieved from ~12 m, is adjacent to the boundary between assemblages dominated by benthic taxa and those dominated by planktonic taxa (B:P) at ~11.8 m in the surface-sample calibration data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683612463103">Kingsbury et al., 2012</xref>). The Core 2 sequence was collected ~ 3 m deeper than the B:P boundary, and is located near the onset of where the depth inference model underestimates owing to the higher abundance of planktonic taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683612463103">Figure 2</xref>). Core 1 was located at a depth where model performance is more sensitive to change (less change in depth has to occur to produce a change in the inference), whereas a higher magnitude decline in depth has to occur to be recorded at the Core 2 location.</p>
<p>Comparison of the lake–depth inferences and PCA axis-1 scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683612463103">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683612463103">5</xref>), were highly correlated for Core 1 (<italic>r</italic>=0.94, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and lower for Core 2 (<italic>r</italic>=0.66, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). PCA axis-1 scores explained less of the total variation in Core 2 (C1 λ<sub>1</sub>=0.46, C2 λ<sub>1</sub>=0.26). The high correspondence suggests that depth, or variables associated with depth, are major drivers of the changes in the diatom assemblages, but less so for Core 2. Inferences of lake depth over the last ~2000 years for Core 1 (relative to its location) had a range from ~10.4 to 16.4 m and the core tracked changes of ±3.0 m from the overall mean of 13.4 m depth. Inferences of water depth for Core 2 (relative to its deeper location) had a range from ~14.8 to 17.8 m and the core tracked changes of ±1.5 m from the overall mean of 16.3 m depth. Based on the amount of sediment deposited over the past two millennia, shallowing resulting from infilling of the lake could only maximally account for ~35 cm of the estimated 3 m decline from ~<sc>ad</sc> 0 to <sc>ad</sc> 1200 (lowest lake stand) in Core 1.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many variables within a lake change with depth that can influence the distribution of diatoms including: substrate type, disturbance regime, temperature, light availability and nutrients (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2011</xref>). Wave action, substrate type and light are particularly important drivers in the zonation of the benthic communities into nearshore assemblages composed of attached life forms and some motile benthic taxa, and the mid-depth assemblage, composed largely of motile life forms and other benthic taxa that are adapted to lower light conditions. Availability of light is also one of the dominant variables in the zonation between the benthic and the planktonic algal assemblages (B:P boundary), particularly in nutrient-poor lakes where benthic algae are limited primarily by light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683612463103">Karlsson et al., 2009</xref>). Lake clarity and its influence on mixing depth will influence the depth of the euphotic zone and thermocline depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683612463103">Fee et al., 1996</xref>), which in turn will influence planktonic productivity and species composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683612463103">Findlay et al., 2001</xref>). In boreal Canadian Shield lakes, such as LRL, the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has been found to be a major driver determining lake clarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683612463103">Keller, 2007</xref>). The concentration of DOC within lakes can be influenced by climate. For example, DOC concentrations decreased in boreal lakes in the Experimental Lakes Area during the drier years of the late 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683612463103">Schindler et al., 1996</xref>), which resulted in increases in both the epilimnetic depth (average ~1 m) and euphotic zone depth (~0.5 m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683612463103">Findlay et al., 2001</xref>). In addition to light, changes in lake level through time will change the location of the B:P diatom boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2011</xref>). As a result of the interactions between changes in lake level and light penetration, which move in concert during droughts, our down-core depth inferences from cores retrieved near the present-day B:P diatom boundary record the temporal movement associated with this ecological boundary.</p>

<title>Core location and the effectiveness of a reconstruction</title>
<p>The location of nearshore cores for this study was based on high-resolution seismic reflection data, and surface-sample diatom species data. A key component to projects utilizing nearshore sediments is the location of sufficient nearshore sediment deposition along a relatively gentle slope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612463103">Laird and Cumming, 2009</xref>). The other key component of within lake diatom-inferred depth calibrations in drainage lakes is to locate the core near to the B:P boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2011</xref>). In order to define this ecological boundary a high-resolution sampling (~ every 1 m) of surface samples along a gentle slope from nearshore to deeper sediments is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683612463103">Kingsbury et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In a number of studies, diatom-depth models based on sampling surface samples along a depth gradient within the study lake resulted in strong performance of weighted-averaging methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683612463103">Brugam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683612463103">Moos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683612463103">Yang and Duthie, 1995</xref>). Analysis of eight within-lake calibrations using diatoms to infer depth in the WRDB indicated that taxa common to all lakes varied in their depth distributions and optima (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2011</xref>), further providing evidence for usage of within-lake calibrations for depth inferences. Application of the within-lake models to cores taken from the deep basin are often not sensitive, because the depth model has poor performance once diatom assemblages are dominated by planktonic taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612463103">Laird and Cumming, 2009</xref>). Comparison of a transect of nearshore cores from 7 to 13 m and the deep basin core at 30 m from Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) Lake 239 indicated that similar trends in the percent abundance of the dominant planktonic, <italic>D. stelligera</italic>, were evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612463103">Laird and Cumming, 2009</xref>). However, at the 30 m depth, where the planktonic taxa dominated the assemblage, the model underestimated depth and proved to be insensitive to the fluctuations in the diatom species, whereas the performance was strong at lower depths (below the maximum inference of the model). Alternatively, diatom-based depth models can be based on a suite of surface samples collected from the central basin of many lakes, and then applied to a central deep-basin core of the study lake. However, these models were not always reliable because of complex interactions within the lake because of variables such as macrophyte abundance, water clarity and other variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683612463103">Brugam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683612463103">Moser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683612463103">Shinneman et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

The idea behind this method is that as lake level declines, the sediment limit or depositional boundary depth (i.e. the lower edge of the littoral zone) will move towards the center of the lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683612463103">Dearing, 1997</xref>). Large changes in the percent organic matter (%OM) can occur at the boundary of the nearshore littoral zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612463103">Shuman, 2003</xref>) and can be used to track the movement of the position of the depositional sediment limit, particularly when in combination with seismic profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612463103">Shuman et al., 2009</xref>). Late-Holocene trends in %OM in a series of nearshore cores from ELA Lake 239 generally followed the trends of the diatom-inferred depths; however, a number of inferred low periods were not detectable by the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612463103">Laird and Cumming, 2009</xref>). This was likely because the OM content is generally a coarser proxy of lake level that can be influenced by many factors. In the Holocene record of the same study lake, the %OM tracked the larger changes in diatom-inferred lake level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683612463103">Laird and Cumming, 2008</xref>). In LRL, higher OM content was found in some of the nearshore surface sediments than in the deeper samples with sharp declines only occurring at around 2 m lake depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2011</xref>), thus limiting the usefulness of %OM in tracking the boundary of the littoral zone in this lake.</p>
<p>Defining and tracking the depth at which there is a distinct assemblage shift from primarily benthic diatoms to an assemblage dominated primarily by planktonic diatoms (B:P depth boundary) is similar to tracking the physical depositional boundary depth. As lake level declines, the boundary of the transition from benthic to planktonic diatom assemblages will move towards the center of the lake. Cores collected close to the present-day B:P diatom boundary should be more sensitive to changes in drought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2011</xref>). This was seen in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612463103">Laird and Cumming (2009)</xref> when comparing diatom inferences from nearshore cores to the deep basin core. In this study of LRL, two cores were compared: one at ~12 m, within the sensitive region of the depth model, and another one at ~15 m, a less-sensitive region of the diatom model. These locations were chosen to examine the sensitivity of core location within the nearer-shore environs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683612463103">Figure 2</xref>). The comparison of the two core sequences clearly showed that cores collected from depths closer to the B:P boundary were more sensitive in detecting lake-level declines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683612463103">Figure 6</xref>). The lower sensitivity of the depth model when applied to Core 2 may be due to the fact that the diatom assemblages found in this core were composed of ~65–89% planktonic species. In comparison, planktonic species varied from ~30% to 70% in the shallower Core 1. Owing to the high abundance of planktonic species in Core 2, changes to an increased abundance of benthic taxa will only be realized with much larger changes in lake depth. Thus a single core retrieved close to the B:P boundary of lakes can provide a good semi-quantitative estimate of the magnitude of low-water stands, whereas a transect of cores can provide a better estimate of the magnitude of both high- and low-water stands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612463103">Laird and Cumming, 2009</xref>). Thus, particularly in the case of single-core analysis, interpretations are most appropriate when based on the trends rather than absolute inferences.</p>

<title>Changes in effective moisture and coherency with other records</title>
<p>Diatom inferences of climate in this section are based primarily on the shallower Core 1 because of the greater sensitivity of this location. Two major periods of low effective moisture, ~<sc>ad</sc> 950 to <sc>ad</sc> 1300 and ~<sc>ad</sc> 1625 to <sc>ad</sc> 1750, were found in the LRL record. These reconstructions are consistent with other proxy records of arid conditions in the WRDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2012</xref>), Minnesota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683612463103">Dean, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683612463103">St. Jacques et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683612463103">Tian et al., 2006</xref>), Nebraska Sandhills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683612463103">Schmieder et al., 2011</xref>) and further to the west (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612463103">Cook et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959683612463103">Woodhouse et al., 2009</xref>). The most extreme inferred low-lake stand in our record in both magnitude and duration at ~<sc>ad</sc> 950 to <sc>ad</sc> 1300 is consistent with the time period commonly known as the ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly’ (MCA, <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 900–1400; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683612463103">Graham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612463103">Seager et al., 2007</xref>). Prior to the recent synthesis of sediment records from lakes in northwest Ontario spanning across ~250 km west to east, which includes LRL, the MCA had not been clearly defined in this portion of the boreal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2012</xref>). Further to the west in the boreal region of northern Alberta, a MCA signal of lower lake level is inferred for Lake Athabasca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959683612463103">Wolfe et al., 2011</xref>). We had expected our sites closer to the present-day parkland (prairie)–forest boundary in the west to exhibit more arid conditions in the past than in the east, and had not expected extreme conditions, such as the MCA, to penetrate so far east into the boreal region of northwest Ontario.</p>
<p>Inferred lows in effective moisture during the MCA have been found in dendrochronological studies from western North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612463103">Cook et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683612463103">2010</xref>). Sand deposits in a 900 year record from Lake Mina, Minnesota (MN) suggested large declines in lake levels during the 1300s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683612463103">St. Jacques et al., 2008</xref>). High eolian activity in Elk Lake, Minnesota indicated arid conditions from ~<sc>ad</sc> 1280 to <sc>ad</sc> 1410 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683612463103">Dean, 1997</xref>). The MCA was also recorded in Steel Lake, MN from ~<sc>ad</sc> 1100 to 1400 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683612463103">Tian et al., 2006</xref>). Diatom inferences from nearby lakes within the WRDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2012</xref>) and further south in the Nebraska Sandhills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683612463103">Schmieder et al., 2011</xref>) also indicated prolonged low lake levels during the MCA. Whereas in other North American prairie sites the variability in lake-level inferences was high during the MCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2003</xref>). This variability was likely because of either complex interactions between groundwater and climate, which resulted in inferences not being directly related to climate, or climate was spatially variable dependent on the location of high-pressure ridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the MCA, a period commonly referred to as the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) spans from approximately the 14th to mid-19th centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683612463103">Grove, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683612463103">Mann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683612463103">Matthews and Briffa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683612463103">Miller et al. 2012</xref>). Despite the fact that the LIA is defined as a generally colder period, there were intervals of warming that separate the cold periods. The highly resolved record of the Glosser Aletsch Glacier in the Swiss Alps highlights this variability of temperature during the LIA and has been used as a benchmark for comparison of other glacier and paleoclimatic records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683612463103">Grove, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683612463103">Matthews and Briffa, 2005</xref>). The inferred low-water stand from ~<sc>ad</sc> 1625 to 1750 in the LRL record reached lows similar to the MCA but of much shorter duration. The timing of this low stand in LRL corresponds to other studies indicating arid conditions in surrounding regions of the WRDB, as well as to a retreat phase in the Glosser Aletsch Glacier from ~<sc>ad</sc> 1650 to 1750 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683612463103">Matthews and Briffa, 2005</xref>). Pollen records from Lake Mina, MN indicated severe drought from ~<sc>ad</sc> 1660 to 1710 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683612463103">St. Jacques et al., 2008</xref>). Peaks in eolian activity were recorded from ~<sc>ad</sc> 1670 to 1750 in Elk Lake, MN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683612463103">Dean, 1997</xref>). Arid conditions were also indicated from ~<sc>ad</sc> 1650 to 1700 in Steel Lake, Minnesota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683612463103">Tian et al., 2006</xref>). Tree-ring data in southern Manitoba indicated an extreme dry period from ~ <sc>ad</sc> 1670 to 1775 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959683612463103">St. George and Nielsen, 2002</xref>). In northwest Ontario, diatom inferences of low-lake levels from ~<sc>ad</sc> 1650 to 1800 occurred in ELA Lake 239 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612463103">Laird and Cumming, 2009</xref>). Other lakes in the western portion of the WRDB indicated lower lake levels generally consistent with the timing in LRL, however Gall Lake which is north and slightly east of LRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612463103">Figure 1</xref>) did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting the drought from ~<sc>ad</sc> 1625 to 1750 did not penetrate that far northeast.</p>
<p>In LRL, the low stands described above are particularly evident by increases in the dominant benthic <italic>S. pinnata</italic>, and corresponding decreases in the dominant planktonic <italic>D. stelligera</italic>. A previous study of a transect of cores along a depth gradient in ELA Lake 239 suggested that fluctuations of the dominant <italic>D. stelligera</italic> can be highly positively correlated with diatom-inferred depth particularly in cores closest to the modern-day B:P boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612463103">Laird and Cumming, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Another particularly evident change in species assemblage was the occurrence of <italic>C. tripartita</italic> and <italic>C. ocellata</italic> from ~ <sc>ad</sc> 960 to 1700 which appeared abruptly in both cores, with peak relative abundances during the 15th and 16th centuries, and its disappearance from the records in the 18th century. In LRL, <italic>C. tripartita</italic> and <italic>C. ocellata</italic> were rare or non-existent in the modern assemblages. Nearby lakes of the WRDB that contain <italic>C. ocellata</italic> and <italic>C. tripartita</italic> in their modern assemblages can provide some insight to the conditions of LRL when these species were present in the record. These species occur in the modern assemblages of Worth Lake, Atlantic Lake and Troutfly Lake at maximum abundances ranging from 2.8% to 10.3% for <italic>C. ocellata</italic>, and 1.0% to 7.6% for <italic>C. tripartita</italic>, and were found at their highest abundances in the planktonic assemblage zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683612463103">Kingsbury, 2010</xref>). All of these lakes have ~ 2–5 times higher conductivity than LRL (24 µS/cm versus 46–102 µS/cm), slightly higher present-day total phosphorus concentrations (7µg/l versus 7.6–9.1 µg/l), as well as slightly higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 5.2 mg/l versus 7.7–8.7 mg/l) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683612463103">Kingsbury et al., 2012</xref>) suggesting that chemical conditions in LRL were more similar to those lakes when <italic>C. ocellata</italic> and <italic>C. tripartita</italic> were present. Lake-level declines can lead to the concentration of ions and other chemical components because of increased residence time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683612463103">Schindler et al., 1996</xref>). Thus small chemical changes may have enabled <italic>C. ocellata</italic> and <italic>C. tripartita</italic> to better compete with the other planktonic taxa as the result of a change in hydrology.</p>

<title>Relevance to future trends</title>
<p>Currently, regions such as the WRDB and Minnesota are experiencing increased stream flow as the result of increased precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683612463103">Novotny and Stefan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683612463103">St. George, 2007</xref>). The increased precipitation in these regions may have an anthropogenic signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683612463103">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Warming winters has led to earlier and more frequent snowmelt in Minnesota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683612463103">Novotny and Stefan, 2007</xref>) and also to a decline in the snow on the ground at the end of March in the Experimental Lakes Area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683612463103">Parker et al., 2009</xref>). Although these current conditions bode well for water availability in the near future in the WRDB, the occurrence of the inferred low-lake levels recorded in LRL from ~ <sc>ad</sc> 950 to 1300 and <sc>ad</sc> 1625 to 1750 and from other lake records in the WRDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2012</xref>) indicates that the re-occurrence of such conditions is plausible. These low-water stands are outside of the range of those recorded in the sediments over the past ~100 years, suggesting that the range of recent history may not be a good estimate of potential future changes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Numerous studies indicate that the instrumental record represents only a small subset of the range in natural climatic variability of drought (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683612463103">Cook et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683612463103">Laird et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683612463103">Woodhouse et al., 2010</xref>). The past ~100 years of the LRL record has a range of ±0.25 m for lake-level variability whereas our 2000 year record reveals changes of ±3 m. The magnitude and duration of the droughts in LRL over the past two millennia were also larger than those we have seen in the past century.</p>
<p>The data presented here from Little Raleigh Lake provide substantive evidence of large drought during the MCA and parts of the LIA in the southeastern region of the WRDB in northwest Ontario during the late Holocene. Climate change models project future temperature increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683612463103">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2007</xref>) and studies such as the LRL record may provide regional insights on the effects of climate warming on water availability in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683612463103">Woodhouse et al., 2010</xref>). This study provides information for water managers who may want to adjust their mitigation strategies for arid periods greater than those recorded in the instrumental record.</p>
