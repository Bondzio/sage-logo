<p>Parts cast of metals such as iron, using expandable polystyrene foams, may have an unacceptable amount of surface defects, such as lustrous carbon. The use of foams made of styrene/methyl methacrylate copolymers can improve the quality of foam molds and metal parts made using such molds. In this work, expandable copolymers were synthesized by suspension copolymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate in the presence of blowing agents (pentane isomers). When the surrounding temperature was high enough to vaporize the blowing agent and soften the polymer shell, the beads were expanded. The effects of monomer composition and cell structure modifying aid (polyethylene wax) on the particle size, average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of synthesized copolymer, pentane content and expansion properties (density, residual pentane of pre-expanded particles and cell structure) were investigated. The results showed that monomer composition had a significant effect on the copolymerization kinetic and the copolymer molecular weight. In addition, cell structure, cell size and cell size distribution of the pre-expanded particles were strongly influenced by cell structure modifying aid concentration. The effects of comonomer composition and copolymer particle size on pentane content of expandable particles were also studied.</p>

<p>In recent years, a lost foam-casting technique is increasingly used in casting technology. Since a readily volatizable foam is used as mold pattern, it is unnecessary to take out the mold, any mold joint and any sand core are eliminated. In this method, the dimensional accuracy and the surface roughness of the cast metal parts are comparable to the ones in investment casting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X11433225">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X11433225">4</xref></sup> Expandable polystyrene (EPS) with a weight-average molecular weight (<inline-formula id="ilm1-0021955X11433225"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0021955X11433225"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) of about 300,000 g/mol that is expanded to a bulk density between 20 and 30 kg/m<sup>3</sup> is typically used for mold ﬁlling of aluminum alloys in the lost foam process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021955X11433225">5</xref></sup> Because of the possibility of carbon pickup, the process employing EPS patterns is not suitable for black metal casting since the carbon-rich benzene structure produced during degradation of EPS is thermodynamically stable and difficult to be decomposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X11433225">6</xref></sup> The EPS decomposition leads to a large quantity of liquid, which is contacted with molten metal for a long time, making carbon–hydrogen bond of benzene ring structure be cracked to form carbon residual and therefore increasing the possibility of carbon being captured by liquid metal. Therefore, the molds made from EPS have a main disadvantage of carbon pickup defect in casting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X11433225">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X11433225">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of foams made of styrene (St)/methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymers can improve the quality of foam molds and metal parts made using such molds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X11433225">9</xref></sup> During casting process, the expanded beads undergo thermal degradation by random chain scission through a series of complex physicochemical transitions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X11433225">10</xref></sup> The types of degradation products formed, the kinetics of degradation and the associated endothermic losses in the liquid metal are all inﬂuenced by the characteristics of the foam. The primary factors controlling the properties of the foam are the bulk density, cell size and orientation, degree of bead fusion, molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI), and also monomer composition in the copolymer beads. The molecular weight can be expected to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the molding characteristics of the foam. Variations in the molecular weight distribution (MWD) may change the glass transition temperature (<italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic>) of the polymer and affect the viscoelastic properties of polymer melt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X11433225">11</xref></sup> These changes may inﬂuence the expansion of the beads during pre-expansion and molding steps, and lead to an unfavorable shrinkage in the polymer pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X11433225">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, molecular weights can also inﬂuence the rate of polymer degradation. Thermal degradation experiments of polystyrene (PS) have shown that the dynamics of polymer degradation and the nature of the products formed depend on the macromolecular chain length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021955X11433225">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The suspension polymerization is a suitable method for expandable polymer particles production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X11433225">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X11433225">4</xref></sup> The suspension polymerization process can generally be distinguished into two types:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X11433225">14</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X11433225">16</xref></sup> the bead polymerization, where the polymer is soluble in its monomer and smooth spherical particles are produced; and the powder polymerization, where the polymer is insoluble in its monomer and, thus, precipitates out leading to the formation of irregular grains or particles. The most important thermoplastic produced by bead suspension polymerization is PS. In the presence of volatile hydrocarbons (C<sub>4</sub>–C<sub>6</sub>), foamable beads (EPS) can be produced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X11433225">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X11433225">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our objectives in this work were: (1) investigation of copolymerization kinetics and copolymer microstructure and their effects on expansion performance of final copolymer beads, (2) to prepare expandable poly(St-<italic>co</italic>-MMA) beads with controlled particle size and particle size distribution (PSD), and thermoexpansion properties, such as pre-foamed particles density and remained blowing agent in pre-foamed particles and (3) to study the effects of expansion conditions on expansion properties of the copolymer beads.</p>

The monomers were washed twice with 5 weight percent (wt%) aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide followed by washing twice with double distilled water to eliminate the inhibitor. Tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (DBSNa) were supplied by Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany). Zinc stearate and pentane (35 wt% <italic>n</italic>-pentane and 65 wt% <italic>i</italic>-pentane) as blowing agent were supplied by Tabriz Petrochemical Company (TPC; Tabriz, Iran). Polyethylene wax (PW) with a weight average molecular weight of 6,770 g/mol and a melting point of 105°C as a cell structure modifying aid was purchased from Degussa (Marl, Germany). Silicone oil (Therm 420) was supplied by Lauda (Königshofen, Germany). Distillated water was used as suspension copolymerization media.</p>

<p>Suspension copolymerization of St–MMA in the presence of blowing agents was carried out in a laboratory-scale reactor. A 1 -L stainless steel reactor was equipped with chilled water, silicone oil jacket, a nitrogen inlet and outlet for purging, one baffle and a pentane inlet line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X11433225">Figure 1</xref>). Agitation was supplied by two four-bladed 45° pitched bladed propeller (PBP) impellers, which were driven by a variable speed motor through the impeller shaft. The system was equipped with a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller to control the temperature inside the reactor by adjusting the temperature of circulating silicone oil.

</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021955X11433225"><title>Preparation of expandable copolymer</title>
<p>The expandable St–MMA copolymer particles were synthesized by a batch suspension copolymerization using the reagents listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X11433225">Table 1</xref>. The required amounts of PVA, TCP, PVP, HEC, DBSNa and K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> were fed into the reactor containing pre-weighed amount of distilled water. The mixture was kept stirred at ambient temperature under moderate stirring (280 rpm) for 2 h to produce a homogeneous mixture. In order to control the final polymer particle size and size distribution, the reaction parameters including the concentrations of stabilizer and suspending agents and the stirring speed used in the experiments were optimized using an experimental design procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X11433225">9</xref></sup> A monomer emulsion tank reactor was made by adding a mixture of St and MMA monomers, free radical initiator (BPO), molecular weight modifying aid (DVB) and cell structure improver (PW). After this, the blowing agent containing mixed pentanes (35 wt% <italic>n</italic>-pentane and 65 wt% <italic>i</italic>-pentane) was fed into the emulsion tank. After the mixture was stirred for 30 min, the content of emulsion tank was transferred to the reactor. The reactor was sealed and purged with nitrogen and repressurized to about 35 kPa nitrogen. When all of the reaction mixture was added and after 30 min holding time, the reactor was heated to the reaction temperature (80°C) and held for 8 h. In order to control the final blowing agent content in the expandable copolymer particles, we used a pressurized period created by nitrogen purging during the polymerization course. The reaction temperature profile and a typical utilized pressure cycle are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X11433225">Figure 2</xref>. After the completion of the reaction, the reactor was cooled to ambient temperature. The reaction mixture containing the expandable St–MMA copolymer beads was transferred to a batch out tank and acidified to a pH of 1.6–2.0 and after 15 min, the residue was washed with water and dewatered, dried at a temperature of less than 40°C to obtain foamable resin pellets. The mean particle size (MPS) and PSD of resulting beads were determined by sieving the beads through an adequate set of different mesh sizes. The dried, cooled and screened copolymer particles were aired and maturated at 24°C for 1.5 h. The polymer particles were blended with silicone oil (about 0.2 g of silicone oil per kg of particles) and zinc stearate (about 8 g zinc stearate per kg of particles). The particles were expanded at 60–120 s expansion times by saturated steam (<italic>T</italic> = 100°C and <italic>P</italic> = 101.3 kPa) using a Teubert (Germany) pre-expander built in a fluid bed drying system to form pre-puff beads. The pre-puff beads had densities ranging from about 5–35 g/L depending on the pre-expansion condition and on synthesized copolymer properties. To obtain optimum morphological and microstructural properties of produced copolymer particles, after an initial period of test runs, in order to establish a preliminary recipe for each case (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X11433225">Table 1</xref>), two reaction parameters, monomers feed composition and cell structure modifying aid concentration, were optimized using launching of two series of experimental designs.

<p>According to monomer composition in synthesized copolymers and test conditions (temperature and solvent), constant factors (<italic>K</italic> and <italic>a</italic>) were selected (based on ASTM D446). 1-Cholorobutane was employed as a solvent for St–MMA copolymer at related temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021955X11433225">27</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec10-0021955X11433225"><title>Foaming process</title>
<p>The conversion of St–MMA copolymer beads into foam consisted of three major steps: (a) pre-expansion (pre-foaming) of St–MMA copolymer particles; (b) maturation or temporary storage of pre-expanded beads and (c) final foaming (molding or blocking process). In the pre-foaming stage, the expandable particles were heated by saturated steam (<italic>T</italic> = 100°C and <italic>P</italic> = 101.3 KPa) to more than the glass transition temperature of the St–MMA copolymer in a laboratory pre-foamer. The expandable St–MMA beads were loaded batchwise into the prefoamer, and upon reaching the target foam density, the foam beads were discharged at the bottom of the pre-foamer into the fluid bed for drying. After the maturation process of the pre-expanded beads and temporary storage, the pre-foamed beads were welded into homogeneous foam by renewed steam supply, in a perforated mold.</p>

The molar percentage of monomer incorporated to the particles was determined using the peak of OCH<sub>3</sub> group (at 3.6 ppm), and the peaks correlated to the aromatic ring (between 6.5 and 7.5 ppm).

<p>Thermoanalytical thermograms of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were recorded using Netzsch-DSC200 F3 Maia. The heat flow and temperature calibration were carried out according to the instrument manual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021955X11433225">29</xref></sup> All the experiments were carried out in an inert dynamic atmosphere of high-purity nitrogen set at a flow rate of 50 mL/min. About 1 mg of St–MMA copolymer and 10 mg of polymerization mixture were taken in standard 40 µL aluminum crucibles. For optimization of DSC condition in order to obtain a high-resolution thermogram for <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> determination, the following general protocol was performed in the case of St–MMA copolymers: samples in DSC pans were heated from ambient temperature to 135°C at a heating rate of 1°C/min. The weights of aluminum crucibles containing polymerization mixtures before and after reaction in DSC experiments were controlled to ensure lack of evaporation from crucibles during reaction time.</p>
<p>In this work, MWD was determined from melt rheometry. For preparing the rheometry samples, dissolution–precipitation extraction was carried out with chloroform/methanol (1:3). The synthesized expandable beads were dissolved completely in chloroform and the solution was purified by a filter paper. At this stage, methanol was added and the solution was vigorously shaken to reprecipitate copolymer. The precipitated copolymer was dried at 120°C under vacuum for 48 h. Viscoelastic measurements were made on a Physica MCR 301 (Anton paar, Austria) strain-controlled spectrometer over a range of temperature (140–200°C), angular frequencies (0.1–256 rad/s) and strain 1% in a dry nitrogen atmosphere; degradation was not suspected as measured by viscosity as a function of time. By performing strain sweeps on the disentangled and fully entangled samples, the linear viscoelastic region (LVR) was obtained. Due to high sample stiffness and ease of loading of high molecular weight samples, parallel plates were used instead of the cone-and-plate geometry with a disk diameter of 25 mm and a sample thickness of 1 mm. Experimentally, it has been verified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021955X11433225">30</xref></sup> that cone-and-plate and parallel plates gave identical results.

The data was analyzed with built-in Rheometric Scientific software (Anton Paar). Disks were compression molded at 180–200°C and approximately 6.9 MPa. A vacuum port was fitted to the mold to prevent air dissolving in the disks, while molding at high pressure; when melted in the rheometer at ambient pressure, dissolved air would foam the sample.</p>
<p>Scanning electron micrographs were taken on a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Vega II Tescan SEM, Czech Republic). The samples were prepared by the precise cutting of the pre-expanded beads and the subsequent application of a gold coating of approximately 20–30 Å was accomplished for electron microscopy. Moreover, the average cell size, cell size distribution and cell density in pre-expanded beads were analyzed from SEM pictures. For this work, the number of cells, cells average diameter and variance environs cells average diameter were calculated, and finally, cell size Gaussian distribution function was plotted versus average cell size (Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-0021955X11433225">7</xref>)).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021955X11433225">32</xref></sup>

<p>One of the most important parameters influencing the kinetic of copolymerization is monomer composition. The DSC thermograms presenting the polymerization of monomers with different compositions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X11433225">Figure 4(a)</xref>) first reach the maximum of the heat flow (gel effect; except Trial 1), which is caused by an exothermic radical polymerization of monomers, followed by a steep decline of the heat flow. By comparison of different levels of monomer composition from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X11433225">Figure 4(a)</xref>, it can be seen that increasing St composition in the monomer feed significantly shifts the positions of the maximum peak to the higher times and a reduction in the heat of reaction value (the area under the peak), showing an alleviating trend in the polymerization rate or gel effect can be seen. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X11433225">Figure 4(b)</xref> also shows the effect of the monomer composition on the conversion history of St–MMA copolymerization in the presence of pentane. Real-time polymerization was assessed by isothermal DSC measurement method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021955X11433225">38</xref></sup> The conversion of the monomer was calculated using the following expression:

where Δ<italic>H<sub>r</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the generated heat. When using the Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0021955X11433225">9</xref>) it is assumed that the maximum conversion is 100%, which this fact was previously presented by ampoule polymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021955X11433225">39</xref></sup> and that the heat of polymerization is linearly dependent on the conversion. Probably, these assumptions are not completely valid, but the DSC experiments are useful for comparing the rates of polymerization of the different mixtures. These figures indicate that with increasing St composition in the feed, the rate of polymerization decreases and the gel effect shifts to longer times and higher monomer conversions.

<p>The difference between the suspension polymerization and liquid–liquid dispersion processes, in fact, arises from the presence of an initiator that initiates the chain propagation reactions within the drops, leading to an increase in drop viscosity. The kinetic of polymerization can play an important role in the evolution of particle size in a typical suspension polymerization reaction and, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X11433225">Figure 4(a)</xref>, monomer composition has a significant effect on polymerization rate. In fact, the viscosity of monomer drops and its variation with time is a reflection of the rate of polymerization inside the drops. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X11433225">Figure 7</xref> illustrates the final PSD of the synthesized St–MMA copolymer beads by suspension copolymerization in the presence of pentane with different monomer compositions.

<p>The final PSD in suspension polymerization in general depends on the type and concentration of the surface-active agents, the quality of agitation and the physical properties (e.g., density, viscosity and interfacial tension) of the continuous and dispersed phases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X11433225">9</xref></sup> In this respect, the monomer composition can only alter the viscosity of the dispersed phase or monomer droplets during dynamic evolution of droplet/PSD without significant change in other properties especially interfacial tension. The results of different surveys show that the interfacial tension between two immiscible liquids depends on the temperature, and the type, as well as the concentration of surface-active agents. Moreover, the investigation of the correlation between interfacial tension and surfactants concentration indicates that interfacial tension depends on the hydroxyl group content of the hydrophilic surfactants (PVA, PVP and HEC) and, especially on the number of adsorbed and unadsorbed surfactants segments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021955X11433225">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021955X11433225">41</xref></sup> In terms of the effect of PVA concentration on the equilibrium interfacial tension, the obtained results show that with increasing PVA concentration, the interfacial tension decreases and reaching a plateau value at very high concentrations (e.g., &gt;0.1 g/L). This means that at high surfactant concentrations, the interfacial tension is not only independent of monomer composition but also independent of surfactants concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021955X11433225">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>The transient droplet/PSD is controlled by two dynamic processes, namely, the drop/particle breakage and coalescence rates. The former mainly occurs in regions of high-shear stress (i.e., near the agitator blades) or because of turbulent velocity and pressure fluctuations along the surface of a drop. The latter is either increased or decreased by the turbulent flow field and can be assumed negligible for very dilute dispersions at sufficiently high concentrations of surface-active agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021955X11433225">43</xref></sup> As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X11433225">Figure 4(b)</xref>, by increasing the St concentration, the rate of polymerization decreases and the gel effect is postponed to higher conversions. The onset conversions for gel effects pertaining to St compositions of 20, 30, 53 and 70 wt% were 35, 55, 66 and &gt;90 wt%, respectively. Moreover, since increasing St amount in initial monomer feed causes a decrease in the prepared copolymer molecular weight, hence, the viscosity of dispersed phase decreases and the balance between drop/particle breakage and coalescence rates is shifted to higher times. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X11433225">Figure 7</xref> reveals that the difference between steady state drop sizes in the suspension polymerization is grown with increasing St concentration. On the other hand, the size of the particles from the suspension polymerization increased with decreasing St concentration. This was also confirmed by the results for PSPI and mean particle diameter measurement, as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0021955X11433225">Table 6</xref>. Consequently, the gap between the final particle sizes in suspension polymerization decreased with increasing St concentration. This is due to a lower rate of viscosity build up in the drops containing a higher concentration of St monomer. A high viscosity of drops, associated with a higher rate of polymerization and higher copolymer molecular weight at low St concentration, damps the rate of drop breakup so that the rates of drop breakup and drop coalescence are balanced earlier. This also results in a broader PSD than the higher concentration of St monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X11433225">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0021955X11433225">Table 6</xref>). Another event that is revealed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X11433225">Figure 7</xref> is the slight difference in peak location of PSD pertaining to 350 µm particle size between different monomer compositions. This is because of the constant hydrodynamic conditions such as stirring speed, stirrer type, surface-active agent concentration and so on that were established during the polymerization course in all runs with different monomer compositions.

<p>Suspension polymerization can be characterized by up to four intervals including transition stage during which drops are reduced in size, quasi-steady-state stage with a rather constant drop size, growth stage with a sharp increase in the size of drops and identification stage where the full transformation of drops to particles occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021955X11433225">44</xref></sup> The existence, duration and the boundaries of these intervals are subject to massive change with polymerization conditions. Since, the explained variations were obtained by increasing the MMA concentration, while keeping constant the other polymerization conditions, the largest decrease in the average size of drops during the transition stage was obtained for the highest St concentration. This is due to a lower rate of viscosity build up in the drops containing a lower concentration of St. A high viscosity of drops at low St concentration results in a larger drop size at the beginning of the quasi-steady-state stage. During this stage, drops have undergone a slight increase with time. The quasi-steady-state lasted longer for the higher St concentration.</p>

<sec id="sec16-0021955X11433225"><title>Expansion properties of synthesized beads</title>
<p>One of the most important factors influencing expansion properties of prepared expandable St–MMA copolymer beads is the pentane content in compact and pre-expanded beads. In previous work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X11433225">20</xref></sup> we directed a complete discussion about the methods of measuring of blowing agent in compact and pre-expanded beads. The amount of total pentane content in compact form particles with different sizes for prepared particles having different monomer compositions are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0021955X11433225">Table 7</xref>. This table shows that for every trial the pentane content in expandable beads decreases with decline in the particles size. Although pentane is homogeneously distributed in the dispersed phase during the initial stages of polymerization process, the fraction with the finest particle size range contains significantly lower pentane concentration compared to the largest sizes. The reason for this is the shorter diffusion paths over the particle diameter, which leads, during the finishing process, to the differential diffusion of pentane out of the particles, depending on their diameters. Pentane short diffusion passages in small particles and higher surface area/volume ratio in smaller particles are prone to lose more blowing agent. Moreover, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0021955X11433225">Table 7</xref> indicates that the pentane content in particles with same size increases with increasing MMA monomer concentration in oil phase. Increasing the MMA concentration in the monomer feed increases the molecular weights of prepared copolymers, which increases the viscosity of dispersed phase. On the other hand, the pentane permeability of St–MMA copolymers decreases with increasing the MMA concentration in the monomeric feed. Therefore, the differential diffusion of pentane from beads decreases during the polymerization period and the pentane contents in these beads are higher, compared with the particles having higher St concentrations.

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021955X11433225">Figure 8</xref>, the variation of pre-expanded particle density after maturation step as a function of average particle diameter for four different levels of monomer composition is shown. This figure reveals that, in a constant monomer composition (copolymer molecular weight), the pre-expanded particle density decreases with particle size. This is, it increases with increasing MMA concentration (and copolymer molecular weight) for a constant particle size. The former aspect is due to an increase in the pentane content encapsulated within the particle which results in an increase in the internal pressure of the expandable beads that acts as driving force for steam-stimulated expansion process. Furthermore, the presence of pentane in the expandable beads decreases the <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> of the synthesized copolymers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021955X11433225">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021955X11433225">46</xref></sup> Thus, due to having higher pentane content, the larger particles have a lower <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> than the smaller ones. Consequently, this leads to a higher expansion ratios and lower density for larger particles. In the latter case, increasing the copolymer molecular weight, as well as the glass transition temperature of St–MMA copolymers, increase the pre-expanded copolymer density through increasing the copolymer melt viscosity and declining the particle expansion capability by decreasing the pentane permeability of St–MMA copolymer and impeding the pentane diffusion out of the particle.
<fig id="fig8-0021955X11433225" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>The effect of monomer composition on densities of pre-expanded particles as a function of particle mean diameter (Trials 1–4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X11433225">Table 3</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X11433225-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>After the pre-expansion process, the pre-foamed beads are cooled. Consequently, the remaining pentane in the cells condenses, creating a vacuum in the beads. In this state, the pre-foamed particles are very friable. A definite residence time of maturation of pre-expanded beads is required before the molding process can be carried out.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021955X11433225">47</xref></sup> For final molding process, after pre-expansion and maturation of pre-foamed beads, the remaining pentane (usually 3–4 wt% blowing agent content is necessary) has a strong influence on the properties of the final pattern. By regulating the amount of blowing agent in the final particles having different monomer compositions (different molecular weights), the residual blowing agent concentration for final foaming (molding or blocking process) at same pre-expansion conditions changes in a single particle with given particle size. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021955X11433225">Figure 9</xref>, the residual pentane content ratio (residual pentane after pre-expansion process divided by total pentane content) after maturation process increases with increasing MMA concentration (increasing average molecular weight and decreasing pentane permeability of St–MMA copolymer) for all mesh sizes. The pressure differential, which is the driving force of expansion, determines the expansion capability especially in pre-expansion stage. Meanwhile, if the polymer shell has a relatively low permeability due to higher molecular weight, then the polymer shell can hold the gas upon pre-expansion process and maintain a higher amount residual gas content in comparison to lower molecular weight (much permeable) copolymer beads. This arises entirely from a decrease in the available free volume as the molecular weight of copolymer increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021955X11433225">48</xref></sup> The same results were given by Loutfy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021955X11433225">48</xref></sup> by using fluorescence probes for polymer free volume and its correlation with average molecular weight of polymer.

<sec id="sec17-0021955X11433225"><title>The effect of nucleation agent (PW)</title>
<p>Nucleation agents are substances that are able to initiate and control cell formation and growth. They are purposely incorporated into the polymeric structure. At their location, the blowing agent (pentane) preferably evaporates when the prepared expandable beads are exposed to saturated steam. However, unwanted nucleation effects can arise from incorporated water or suspension stabilizer. Nucleation agents must be able to control nucleation independent of other effects and must have the ability to mask the bubble initiation of other sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021955X11433225">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Waxes such as paraffin, and Fischer-Tropsch waxes, and also esters and amides of fatty acids have been proposed for this function. Finely-divided phase-incompatible polymers, such as low molecular weight polyethylene (PW), are normally used in industry for cell size control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021955X11433225">47</xref></sup> Above its melting point, PW will dissolve into monomers mixture. With growing conversion, phase inversion occurs and the domain size of polyethylene is set after the cooling step. The PW domains operate as gathering sites for the blowing agent, which are able to form bubbles when treatment with heated steam occurs. So, one of the most important factors in the synthesis of expandable copolymer beads is nucleation agent concentration, which has a significant effect on expansion properties of these beads.</p>
<p>The existence of PW in dispersed phase increases the droplets viscosity and influences the average size and size distribution of prepared particles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021955X11433225">Figure 10</xref> indicates that the size of the particles from the suspension polymerization increases with increasing PW concentration. Increasing PW concentration increases the viscosity of dispersed phase, so the balance between breakage and coalescence of droplets transfers to lower times. Moreover, the more contact among dispersed droplets having higher viscosity leads to increasing polymer particles size. This is also confirmed by the results for PSPI and mean particle diameter data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0021955X11433225">Table 8</xref>), which show that the gap between the final particle sizes in suspension polymerization increased with increasing PW concentration. This is due to a lower rate of viscosity build up in the drops containing a lower concentration of PW.

<p>The decreased pre-foamed particle density at constant heating time observed with increasing expandable particle size is related to higher pentane content and lower glass transition temperature in larger particles. Moreover, this figure indicates that the density of pre-foamed particles with same size decreases with increasing heating time. With increasing heating time, the diffusion of saturated steam to particles increases, which results in an increased in blowing agent vapor pressure. Moreover, with increasing expansion time, the copolymer shell softens more and the pentane permeability and pentane diffusion toward more softened copolymer shell increases, thus cells and expanded beads become larger and larger. Additionally, for the heating times longer than 110 s, the pre-foamed particles collapsed and cell structure was destroyed. This can be resulted from very high vapor pressure of blowing agent and insufficient resistance of softened copolymer against vapor pressure of blowing agent that leads to high blowing agent diffusion out of particles and the creation of a vacuum in the particles.</p>
<p>With lower vapor pressure of blowing agent as expansion driving force, and also inadequate softness in copolymer shell, the internal structure of the expanding particle is formed by small cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021955X11433225">Figures 15</xref>(a) and (b)). The structure of the expanded particles was composed of polyhedral shaped cells containing the evaporated blowing agent and, at this stage, cell walls were still thick. When the expansion was carried out for 90 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021955X11433225">Figure 15(c)</xref>), the cell density decreased and the cells increased in size due to the continuous evaporation of the blowing agent and higher softness in copolymer shell. When the expansion was carried out for a longer time (110 s, for instance; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021955X11433225">Figure 15(d)</xref>), cell sizes increased more and the cell walls became thinner, but they had sufficient strength to preserve their shapes.

<p>In this study, the effects of monomer composition and cell structure modifying agent (PW) concentration on the different aspects of suspension polymerization of St and MMA monomers in the presence of blowing agent, as well as prepared particle properties were investigated. It was found that monomer composition in feed had significant effects on polymerization kinetic, molecular weight and MWD, particle size and PSD, blowing agent amount in compact beads, as well as expansion properties of pre-expanded beads (pre-expanded particles density and remained blowing agent in pre-expanded beads). With increasing MMA monomer concentration in monomeric feed, the polymerization rate increased, molecular weight and MWD index as well as the viscosity of polymer droplets increased, so the MPS raised and PSD became broader. Moreover, our funding revealed that molecular weight and MWD index were the most significant parameters influencing expansion properties of pre-expanded beads. The increasing copolymer molecular weight and MWD index caused an increase in pre-expanded particle density and remained blowing agents in the pre-expanded copolymer particles. In addition, cell structure modifying agent had no significant effect on some expansion properties such as blowing agents amount in compact and pre-expanded beads, and also pre-expanded beads density, but its effect on pre-expanded beads morphology such as cell structure, cell size and cell size distribution was very significant. The cell size became smaller and cell size distribution became narrower with increasing PW concentration. This consistency might be due to the nonpolar nature of PW, which caused the blowing agents (pentane isomers) dispersion to become more homogenous, and also higher PW concentrations provide more nucleation sites.</p>
