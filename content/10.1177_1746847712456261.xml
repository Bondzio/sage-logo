<abstract>
<p>Ecological approaches give an insight to the story-world of <italic>Avatar</italic>. They are extended in this article to facilitate an exploration of the connectivity between the feature film and its associated texts (production culture disclosures, making of featurettes, interviews). Drawing on the ecological thinking of Gregory Bateson, Félix Guattari and Jane Bennett, this article argues that <italic>Avatar</italic> and its associated texts are considered as an ecology of emergent space. The materiality of such a space is drawn from the various entities involved in its configuration: animation software, motion capture technologies, actors, designers and filmmakers. This argument is pursued primarily through a discussion of the ways in which real-time motion capture technologies alter our understandings of the ecologies of CG imagery in <italic>Avatar</italic>. Remaining focused on only the realism of these images, or the traces of humanness within them, misses the way in which such spaces emerge at an intersection of codes.</p>

<body>
<p>Ecology is explicit in the environmentalism of the story-world of <italic>Avatar</italic> (James Cameron, 2009). The fictional Na’vi lifeworld of Pandora has resonances with deep ecology and the Gaia hypothesis, which both propose that the biosphere and the physical components of the Earth are closely integrated to form a complex interacting system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1746847712456261">Lovelock, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1746847712456261">Naess and Rothenberg, 1990</xref>). <italic>Avatar</italic> literalizes such interconnectedness in giving the Na’vi and avatars the ability to physically link to the planet Pandora and all its entities, including their combined accumulated histories, through a kind of neural network. Beyond the film’s story-world, however, there is an ecology of technologically mediated spaces that extends the imaginative possibilities for <italic>Avatar</italic>’s audiences.</p>
<p>Proliferating websites and tie-ins marketing the film open up alternative avenues for engagement with <italic>Avatar</italic>. The Coca-Cola cinema campaign introduced viewers to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.AVTR.com">www.AVTR.com</ext-link>, a website that included regular updates from Pandora. Pandorapedia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pandorapedia.com">www.pandorapedia.com</ext-link>) describes itself as an authoritative guide to all things Pandoran. Gadgets exist for translating English into Na’vi (the Navilator), and software can convert human into Na’vi faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746847712456261">Hadhazy, 2010</xref>). The ecology of <italic>Avatar</italic> can be expanded further by the inclusion of associated texts, such as production culture disclosures released online on <italic>Wired</italic>’s website as interviews and featurettes, along with numerous articles discussing 3D cameras and techniques, motion capture developments and extensive CGI work. These associated texts tell stories about connections between filmmakers and filmmaking technologies.</p>
<p>Ecological approaches, while giving insight into the story-world of <italic>Avatar</italic>, also facilitate an exploration of the connectivity between the film and its associated texts. The ecological thinking of Gregory Bateson and Félix Guattari, and more recently Jane Bennett, emphasizes the connections running between humans and objects. Within the connections running between humans and technologies in <italic>Avatar</italic> and its associated texts is an ecology of emergent space. The materiality of this space is drawn from the various entities involved in its configuration. Consider, for instance, the film’s bioluminescent landscape built using 3D animation software. The animation was created using Lightwave 3D, and informed by director James Cameron and effects artist Rob Power’s knowledge of bioluminescent underwater life. The materiality of the bioluminescent space seen in watching <italic>Avatar</italic> is multifaceted, a site of converging codes. The codes include Lightwave 3D software used to generate stereoscopic imagery, contributing to the illusion of a touch responsive bioluminescent plant life. Other software involved in making <italic>Avatar</italic> comprised Autodesk Maya and Autodesk MotionBuilder, both used in the creation of characters such as Jake Sully’s avatar and the Na’vi Ney’tiri, with whom Jake forms a relationship. Widening the term ‘code’ beyond computer-based language and software, others include the conventions of an actor’s performance, camera movements possible in the technologically mediated motion capture set up, editing patterns, colour palette and sound design. Often the term ‘photorealistic’ is used to describe even fantastical imagery in <italic>Avatar</italic>. But this description only tells us that we recognize one of the codes that inform the materiality of the emergent space that defines the Pandoran landscape.</p>
<p>A similar bottleneck occurs in discussions of motion capture. The emergent space of motion capture is defined in a collision of codes: the codes of CG imaging packages and motion capture technologies (including the real-time systems used in making <italic>Avatar</italic>), the codes of performance, aesthetic codes and those of representations. Nevertheless, critical discussions and production culture disclosures frequently focus on the changing status of humanness in a technologically mediated environment. The claim made here is that humanness is a code amongst several, and all of these codes co-exist in an ecology. Paying closer attention to that ecology provides a way of thinking about the emergence of technologically mediated spaces in the landscapes of audio-visual media.</p>
<sec id="section1-1746847712456261">
<title>Technologies and ecologies</title>
<p>Technology features strongly in both the story-world of <italic>Avatar</italic> and its associated texts. Released in 2009, <italic>Avatar</italic> is described as a game changer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746847712456261">Desowitz, 2009</xref>). Although critics’ responses to the story of the film were ambivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746847712456261">Ebert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1746847712456261">Hart, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746847712456261">Pulver, 2009</xref>), the technological achievements associated with making <italic>Avatar</italic> have been widely acknowledged. These include advances in high-definition digital 3D camera technology (Fusion Camera System), motion capture technologies (especially performance capture), along with an on-set ‘SimulCam’ and real-time virtual cameras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847712456261">Duncan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1746847712456261">Holben, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In commentaries on <italic>Avatar</italic>, technology is often portrayed as an element central to the creation of credible simulations of imagined locations and entities, the capture of emotion, and the simulation of human vision. Frequently, these various technologies are described in terms of their ability to generate familiar imagery, to ‘keep things real’. Upon the release of <italic>Avatar</italic>, for instance, reviews often focused on the realism of the CGI used to create the avatars, the Na’vi, and the flora and fauna of Pandora’s environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746847712456261">Ebert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1746847712456261">Teo, 2009</xref>). In designing the look of Pandora and its inhabitants, Cameron is said to have consulted botanists, zoologists and language experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1746847712456261">Wilhelm and Mathison, 2009</xref>). The lush environment of Pandora (created by Weta Digital with help from Industrial Light and Magic) has captured people’s imaginations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746847712456261">Fitzpatrick, 2009</xref>), and so has the technology of the avatar figures, leading to discussions about the reality of the science in <italic>Avatar</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746847712456261">Gleghorn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746847712456261">Hadhazy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1746847712456261">Landau, 2010</xref>). The 3D camera system has been applauded by its developers for its similarity with human vision: ‘The technology behind FUSION is exciting. It’s a highly advanced imaging tool that captures images in a similar manner to human eyesight as a seamless acquisition system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746847712456261">Cameron Pace Group</xref>). Finally, Cameron says that he prefers the term ‘performance capture’ to ‘motion capture’, ‘because that’s what it is: it’s capturing the actor’s performance – that critical moment of truth that the actor creates and capturing it fully and completely’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746847712456261">Desowitz, 2009</xref>). Despite these plaudits, in such figurations, technology itself surprisingly remains opaque, hidden behind ideas of realism, human vision and an actor’s performance.</p>
<p>An alternative figuration of technology is as a series of entanglements with its surroundings, a consequence of intersecting social, economic, political and cultural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746847712456261">Bennett et al., 2008</xref>). By drawing out these entanglements, it is possible to build an understanding of the ecologies that form around connections with technology. In the story-world of <italic>Avatar</italic>, entanglements can take the form of narratives exploring the connections running between nature, culture and technology, especially in relation to human and nonhuman entities. In the expanded terrain that includes the associated texts of <italic>Avatar</italic>, these connections also exist and complement those of the story-world. Before coming to consider these connections as they appear in production culture disclosures, it is first necessary to expand further on what is meant by an ecology. Essentially, ecological thinking places an emphasis on connectivity. Connectivity is not simply meant in the sense that A is connected to B, where the in-between is of little interest. Instead, the materiality of a connection has consequences, leading to boundaries between A and B becoming unmarked. For instance, when using real-time motion capture to generate CG figures, a familiar question has been to ask where human and CG figures begin and end. Ecologically speaking, there is no straightforward marker of beginnings or ends. The CG figure finally seen on the screen emerges from a hybrid materiality, and the constitution of this materiality draws from both the human and technological entities involved.</p>
<p>To expand further, the concept of an ecology is familiar from biological systems, where ecological approaches describe interactions between organisms and the transformation and flux of energy and matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746847712456261">Begon et al., 2006</xref>). Ecological approaches have been adapted beyond biological systems, and extend to human organizations as well as human–technological ones. Examples include workplace organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746847712456261">Baum, 1996</xref>), information ecologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1746847712456261">Nardi and O’Day, 2000</xref>), media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746847712456261">Cubitt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746847712456261">Fuller, 2007</xref>) and theatre ecologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746847712456261">Kershaw, 2007</xref>), as well as ecologies of thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746847712456261">Morton, 2010</xref>) and of things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746847712456261">Bennett, 2010</xref>). Ecology also informs the theoretical concerns of Gregory Bateson and Félix Guattari. Whichever the kind of system being described, understanding the connections between its contributing elements is central to gaining an understanding of that ecology.</p>
<p>In ecological approaches, descriptions are impossible to reduce to isolated participating elements, an idea that is embedded in both Bateson and Guattari’s writings on ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746847712456261">Bateson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746847712456261">Guattari, 2000</xref>). Bateson and Guattari regard an ecology as a complex relationship between human subjectivity, the environment and social relations, all of which are interconnected. A resistance to the reduction of an ecology to instances of isolated participating elements, to humans or nature or animals or machines, is explicit in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746847712456261">Gregory Bateson’s (1972</xref>: 491) hypothetical discussion of whether or not a computer can think:<disp-quote>
<p>Now, let us consider for a moment the question of whether a computer thinks. I would state that it does not. What ‘thinks’ and engages in ‘trial and error’ is the man plus the computer plus the environment. And the lines between man, computer, and environment are purely artificial, fictitious lines. They are lines across the pathways along which information or difference is transmitted. They are not boundaries of the thinking system.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even though Bateson is writing in the 1970s, when computers were less able to execute the complex algorithms they can nowadays, his ecological approach remains relevant. He describes an ecology in which each entity (‘man’, computer, environment) participates in combination, generating actions from transversal relations between the heterogeneous domains of human, environment and machine. Transversality is also explicit in Guattari’s <italic>Three Ecologies</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746847712456261">2000</xref>), which describes complex relations as combinations of elements from all the participating influences. There is no cut between the points of mutuality, or intersection.</p>
<p>The idea that there are no cuts between points of mutuality is especially pertinent to the avatar figures in <italic>Avatar</italic> as well as to discussions of motion capture technologies. In the story-world of <italic>Avatar</italic>, the avatar body provides a human with a sensorium beyond the human body. The hybrid body of the avatar, cloned from both human and Na’vi DNA, embodies the sensorium as an inseparable combination of elements. The human–avatar unit is neither a disembodied perception mediated by a technological apparatus, an example of machinic vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746847712456261">Johnston, 1999</xref>), nor a mediated and extended embodied human perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1746847712456261">Hansen, 2006</xref>). When Jake first links to his avatar, his pleasure at being able to move his legs again is not only shown by his exuberant sprint, but also by the fact that he can feel the soil on which he is standing, demonstrated as he digs his toes into the brown earth. Similarly, when he eats a piece of fruit, his enjoyment is in its taste and smell, his amazement at the experience given in his facial expression and exclamations. The technology of the avatar not only blurs human–Na’vi boundaries by being a hybrid clone, but also the human driver’s embodied experience of Pandora. When connected to the avatar, humans experience Pandora through tastes and smells and feelings that are not quite their own. As the avatar technology mediates the experiences of the human body in Pandora, we become uncertain about where the human and avatar begin and end. In an ecological approach, this uncertainty is potentially productive. Rather than looking at how the human body is transformed, questions begin to arise about the entity that has emerged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1746847712456261">
<title>Virtual cameras in real time: Multiple codes and emergent space</title>
<p>The uncertainty about where humans end and technology begins also informs discussions of motion capture. <italic>Avatar</italic>’s innovative use of motion capture includes performance capture (the capture of facial expressions in addition to body movements), a real-time virtual camera and the SimulCam. Both the virtual camera and the SimulCam extend the mediations of motion capture technology, and their associated disclosures provide a way of re-thinking existing approaches to motion capture.</p>
<p>In the motion capture of humans, data generated from the embodied performance of actors is reconfigured into the movements of CG figures. Technology mediates actors’ performances in various ways: by capturing the performance; reconfiguring live-action performance into digital information; aligning the motion captured information with the CG images and generating a new figure. Even in their early guise of rotoscoping, motion capture technologies are associated with blurred boundaries between motion derived from humans and motion generated using technology. The release of <italic>The Lord of the Rings</italic> (Peter Jackson, 2001–2003) focused interest more particularly on the motion capture of performance as opposed to movement. This brought into play performance as another marker for traces of humanness. The character Gollum was one of the first to weave together the motion captured performance of actor Andy Serkis with CG modelling completed in post-production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746847712456261">Balcerzak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746847712456261">Gunning, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746847712456261">Scott Balcerzak (2009</xref>: 206) remarks about <italic>The Lord of the Rings</italic>: ‘we can see the supposedly “real time” recording of performing bodies as easily identifiable markers of what the viewer recognizes, on some level, as what the film “preserves”’. The motion capture of Bill Nighy’s Davy Jones in <italic>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest</italic> (Gore Verbinski, 2006) is also notable as the technique used was the first to capture a performance delivered on-set while interacting with other actors. The motion capture of <italic>Avatar</italic> follows both of these trajectories. Actors were filmed in a studio known as the Volume, surrounded by around 100 motion capture cameras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746847712456261">Essman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746847712456261">Hand, 2009</xref>). In addition, a much smaller camera was hung on a boom across the actors’ faces. Through an array of micro sensors placed on the actors’ faces, the boom camera was used to capture a range of expressions as they performed.</p>
<p>The disclosures surrounding this latter technique lead again to questions about the identity of the entity onscreen. Many discussions of motion capture retain a primary interest in the human figure, even while acknowledging a spectrum of technological mediations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746847712456261">Bode, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746847712456261">Broadhurst, 2007</xref>). This tends to obscure the onscreen entity as existing at an intersection, or as emerging as the consequence of a collision of codes. The two lead actors of <italic>Avatar</italic>, Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington, rely on describing their acting input when talking about how something of themselves, or at least their performance, has been transposed into the digital figure that filmgoers see on the screen. In separate DVD featurettes, Saldana remarks that ‘you’re able to really dig into your character’, while Worthington states that ‘it is my performance, this walks, and talks and acts like me. It’s my interpretation.’ In both cases, the emphasis is on the human figure, and on which aspects of it are embodied in the onscreen entity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1746847712456261">Dan North (2008</xref>: 180) says of the motion capture in <italic>King Kong</italic> (Peter Jackson, 2005), that ‘the insinuation of human agency is an important factor in selling Kong as creature not computation.’ This is true of Saldana and Worthington’s comments too: they are part of <italic>Avatar</italic>’s marketing strategy, enticing audiences to engage with the emotional heart of the romance between the characters that they play, and asserting the human condition of the onscreen digital entities that they were involved in creating.</p>
<p>Looking in more detail at the production culture disclosures surrounding the virtual camera and SimulCam offers a contrast to this emphasis on human agency, providing more insights into the materiality of their ecologies. These disclosures often retain a figuration in which Cameron acts as the main motivating agent. But as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1746847712456261">Donna Haraway (1997</xref>: 11) suggests, figurations are contestable maps. The following lays out the ecologies of the virtual camera and the SimulCam as ones in which several elements mediate each other. As they mediate each other, these elements generate the various codes contributing to the materiality of motion captured imagery. The virtual camera combines motion captured images with CG in real time, while the SimulCam allows the filmmakers to overlay a virtual camera environment on a live-action set. Both systems bring together live-action performances with CG characters rendered in low resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1746847712456261">Thompson, 2009</xref>). The question of ecological connections becomes active as these human and nonhuman entities cohabit an emergent space between live action and computer generated imagery. In her ‘political ecology of things’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746847712456261">Jane Bennett (2010</xref>: 14) argues for a way of thinking that recognizes humans not as central but as co-participants in a materiality comprised of both human and nonhuman objects: ‘We <italic>are</italic> vital materiality and we are surrounded by it, though we do not always see it that way’ (emphasis in original).</p>
<p>The virtual camera provides a starting point for teasing apart a number of the elements that contribute to the materiality of an emergent image. A virtual camera image emerges at an interface of human input (performance and camera control), technological efficiency (speed of real-time rendering), and the artistic and modeling facilities of the software (Autodesk MotionBuilder and Autodesk Maya). Whereas previously CG elements and live-action or motion capture elements could not be combined in real time, the virtual camera enables the pre-constructed CG assets, the motion capture elements, and the live action to be rendered simultaneously, although, as mentioned, at a low resolution.</p>
<p>This creates a distinct and emergent space within which interactions occur between actors, filmmakers and technology – the human and nonhuman elements of which combine to form, after Bennett, a new ecology. Effects supervisor Joe Letteri (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746847712456261">Essman, 2010</xref>) describes the way in which the emergent space of the real-time virtual camera enabled interactions both in real time on set, and then virtually after the moment. The CGI could be played back and a virtual camera moved within the space:<disp-quote>
<p>These camera moves throughout the movie are like what Jim would have done [in live action photography]. He would do them on the day on the capture stage, but you can play back the characters like a pre-recorded track. You can pick the take that you like and play it back, and you can do different camera moves. You can get all of your coverage after the fact … it generated enough material for Cameron to resculpt the terrain of the alien planet, Pandora, and move the camera around his characters.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The virtual camera as described by Letteri offers a different set of interactions, then, an ecology whose materiality is based on a digital environment. Even though Letteri’s statement presents a figuration of Cameron as the main agent influencing the outcome of using the virtual camera, the wider materiality of the virtual camera system also becomes apparent. The materiality emerges from the space established through the connections between the interacting elements, both human and technological. CGI is combined with motion capture data using Autodesk MotionBuilder. MotionBuilder, a 3D animation package, incorporates real-time data with pre-existing assets. Assets include elements of the 3D environment and rigged models into which the motion capture data are brought. On the motion capture stage, a computer records the movement of dots attached to actors, triangulates their location, and assembles these data points into wire-frame skeletons that in <italic>Avatar</italic> will be ‘dressed’ with digital assets.</p>
<p>Connections established within such a technologized space have the potential to influence decisions in other parts of the filmmaking ecology. Commenting on the interplay between virtual camera work, motion capture camera placements and the editors, Cameron (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1746847712456261">Kunkes, 2010</xref>) says:<disp-quote>
<p>So, in some cases, my hand-held virtual camera would be used to drive the live action motion-control camera. The new shot would stream into the Avid, and Steve [Rivkin] and John [Refoua] would, in effect, become visual effects comp artists, making sure the shots were working before moving on.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The SimulCam reveals an equally fascinating series of questions about emergent space, hybrid entities and workspaces as live-action performance co-exists in a digital space with CG figures:<disp-quote>
<p>… when Cameron was shooting a scene in a set involving an actor and a CG Na’vi, if he tilted the camera down to the actor’s feet, the viewfinder would show not only the actor’s feet, but also the Na’vi’s feet, the entire CG environment and the CG details outside the set, such as action visible through windows. All of this could be seen in real time through the SimulCam’s viewfinder and on live monitors on the set, allowing the human actors to interact directly with the CG characters and enabling Cameron to frame up exactly what he wanted. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1746847712456261">Holben, 2010</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, not only can the live action and CG be seen together, but the performance of the actor can be directed in relation to the CG figure. In this way, the SimulCam is part of an ecology in which actors perform in the context of CG imagery, which in turn generates the template for the hybrid figure that appears in the final version of <italic>Avatar</italic>.</p>
<p>Motion capture through virtual camera systems involves a process of mapping different materialities across distinct spaces. The boundaries between human performance, motion capture and CG images blur as they create an emergent space. Within the space defined by such transversal relations between interdependent elements, human agency is decentred. Descriptions of the malleability of the hybrid space of the SimulCam show this decentring. As described by Glenn Derry, Virtual Production Supervisor at Weta Digital, James Cameron is consistently placed within a figuration in which he, as the director, is given agency. However, also apparent is a space mediated by technology, and without which Cameron would have no material conditions with which to engage:<disp-quote>
<p>Because the SimulCam becomes a virtual camera in a virtual world, it can be placed anywhere in space. Standing more than 9 feet tall, the Na’vi are larger than humans by a ratio of 1.67:1. If Cameron wanted a shot to be at the Na’vi’s eye level, he would ask the system operator to make him 1.67:1, which would reset Cameron’s height to that level. In other words, he could continue to handhold the camera on the real stage floor while ‘standing’ at a height of 9 feet in the virtual world. ‘Jim used the SimulCam as a kind of virtual viewfinder to direct the performances and get the shots he wanted, and then, in post, we’d tweak things further,’ says Derry. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1746847712456261">Holben, 2010</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Derry’s comment exposes the multi-faceted ecology of the SimulCam, and expands on its malleability. Cameron is able to work within this space because of other personnel (the system operator), the technology (virtual viewfinder and programming behind the capacity to reset heights), and also the actors and CG assets. In addition, Derry’s disclosure provides insight into the interrelations between the elements as the dimensions of the space transform. The CG space is encoded in such a way that it is scalable from 1:1 (human to human) to 1.67:1 (Na’vi to human). The relationship between Cameron and the entity in the space (actor and/or digital figure), occurs in relation to the SimulCam system and the CG imagery depicted within it. The point that begins to emerge more strongly in Derry’s description of the SimulCam is that this emergent space is highly encoded.</p>
<p>The real-time processing involved in the virtual camera/SimulCam brings together elements of motion capture that had previously been both temporally and spatially dispersed. Motion capture data processed after the fact also have an ecology, but the ecologies of the virtual camera and SimulCam are distinct because of the real-time connections. The space of a performance is located at a site of intersecting elements, which include software, hardware, actors, technicians, artists and filmmakers. Space emerges at this intersection and is contingent on the interactions of the contributing elements. This space does not pre-exist the activities of any of the contributing elements, instead it comes into being for the duration of those activities. Sometimes, in wider discussions of motion capture, there is an impression that the traces of a human figure are incorporated into a space already created in CG. This neglects the ecology, dispersed though it is. A motion capture performance is influenced by the environment within which it occurs. That environment is both the actual space of the motion capture stage and the other actors present, but it is also the virtual set design and figures not actually in the performance space, but which will be in the final image. The performance of an actor is informed by both the actual and virtual connections. The location for a performance is configured around that performance. Perspective and depth, for instance, are oriented in relation to the ways in which objects and figures are framed. This in turn influences what might be included in the space or not. The space is not simply the location of a figure, the hybrid figure of the motion captured entity, but the figure is part of the constitution of the space.</p>
<p>In real-time motion capture, the connections are spatially and temporally closer together and, through the mediations of technology, actually present together in a digital environment. The space, existing at transversal intersections of human and nonhuman elements, emerges in a real-time series of reconfigurations between those elements. Consequently, this emergent space includes traces of many different entities, and humanness is only one among many. Exploring these traces involves looking more closely at their codes and the ways in which they collide within the emergent space.</p>

<title>Where codes collide</title>
<p>In this section, motion capture imagery is explored in two ways. The first is informed by the above exploration of the ecologies of the virtual camera and the SimulCam. The second aims to see motion capture imagery not simply in terms of the figures, but through the relations between the figures and space. One of the features of a real-time virtual camera is that actors do not straightforwardly perform in a pre-existing space. Instead, space emerges and is encoded in a relationship with their performance and the other entities involved. Accordingly, in motion capture imagery, space is understood as being in an active relationship to the figures, and not simply a static backdrop for their activities.</p>
<p>In an ecology, nothing ever exists as an isolated element. Traces that occur do so within a series of transversal relations. Everything mediates everything else. In motion capture, technologically mediated encoding occurs as a performance is transformed from movements in time and space to data. This literal encoding of a performance is only one sense in which codes are active, mediating and influencing. The word ‘code’ can easily appear transparent but is used in many different ways. Broadly defined, a code is a system of words, letters, figures, or symbols used to represent others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1746847712456261">Friedrich Kittler (2008</xref>: 40) comments that ‘codes are not a peculiarity of computer technology or genetic engineering; as sequences of signals over time they are part of every communication technology, every transmission medium’. A code, whether generated by cinematic or computer language, is based on rules and conventions about how you combine signs, and how signs relate to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1746847712456261">Mackenzie, 2006</xref>). The ‘tightness’ of a code varies, potentially leaving open gaps in which interpretation and degrees of transformation arise. Encryption, for instance, involves a very tight encoding, and is associated with security. The information is encoded to make it unrecognizable, and then decoded again accurately to reveal the information. In motion capture, encoding occurs through sampling. An event, including the most simple gesture, occurs in an unbroken duration. The motion capture version of that event exists as discrete data, a series of coordinates. Motion capture always involves some kind of loss, the digital information finally an approximation of an event. The precision of that approximation depends on the amount of detail captured. <italic>Avatar</italic> includes an innovative use of performance capture technology (a motion capture camera is hung across an actor’s face). This device is celebrated as an effective means of capturing the emotions of a performance, reiterating the presence of traces of humanness. A focus only on capturing human emotions, however, obscures all of the other codes that are involved in encoding emergent space in <italic>Avatar</italic>. These codes do not simply fill in the gaps generated through sampling, they mingle to create the imagery on the screen.</p>
<p>The encoding of space occurs through machine codes, scripting generated by particular kinds of software, such as Autodesk MotionBuilder and Autodesk Maya. It also occurs through codes that have evolved within cinema, such as framing and editing practices, shot sequences, and so forth. Similarly, performance also has codes, both within cinema generally as well as within specific genres. The sequence in which Jake first encounters Ney’tiri illustrates the different codes that come into play in the emergent space. Jake, linked into his avatar body, has got lost following his encounter with a wild creature (known in the film as a thanator). Attacked by a pack of dog-like viperwolves, the Na’vi Ney’tiri saves Jake and begins to lead him back to her home. The space in which the actions occur is an environment populated with a diverse plant life, visible far into the depth of the image. The sound design aims to pick up environmental noises, using surround sound to give an impression of being inside a space. At the same time, movements of plants in the foreground give the impression that Jake, Ney’tiri and the viperwolves are running and leaping within the space. The bioluminescent plants light up against passing movement, allowing space actively to come into view. The movement of distant waterfalls adds to the mid-range and background imagery that might otherwise begin to seem static.</p>
<p>Reading this sequence only in terms of its photorealism acts to frame the imagery in ways that obscure the other codes that contribute to the imagery. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1746847712456261">Dan North (2008)</xref> has argued, the realism associated with the imitative capabilities of visual effects has more to do with cinematic and theatrical traditions than actuality. Disclosures around the real-time performance capture of <italic>Avatar</italic> also reveal the importance of existing codes:<disp-quote>
<p>The fascinating thing is, if that realtime environment had not been there for him [Cameron] to explore and shoot in, the film would have been immensely different because it was a process that is timeless – it is the filmmaking process in its essence that he was able to tap into. This has not been the case ever before with these heavy visual effects films. And there’s been no film like <italic>Avatar</italic> to this degree. It’s definitely changed the art of digital filmmaking, and especially visual effects, which are increasingly part of our movies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746847712456261">Desowitz, 2010</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These remarks make explicit the ways in which the motion capture imagery is encoded through cinematic conventions, enabling a fluidity that is already familiar in existing cinema. A mobile framing is evident in the opening of the sequence as Ney’tiri attacks the viperwolves. The editing cuts across the action, drawing the audience in and pushing them away in a fashion familiar from contemporary action films.</p>
<p>The cinematic codes of <italic>Avatar</italic> can be seen, then, in terms of coming closer to live-action cinema, but they also sit in relation to another influence: a desire to display the possibilities of the technology used in making <italic>Avatar</italic>. The latter is not a code, but it certainly exerts an influence over the parameters of the emergent space. Until Ney’tiri throws Jake’s burning torch into water, the background is dark, while the foreground is bathed in the yellow light of the flame. With the firelight gone, the dynamics of the location begin to change, the darkness becoming more alive until Jake finally sees the extensive glow of plant life. Jake had not understood or seen the space of Pandora, his technological improvisation of lighting a torch distancing him further from the life of the forest. Once he sees, however, the camera moves in a three-quarters turn showing how far the bioluminescent life extends into the forest. The forest is no longer dark green, but ablaze with blues and greens, pinks and purples, scattered with patches of white. The transforming landscape shows space emerging. It is not a static place, but responsive and changing, connected to other entities within it.</p>
<p>The use of familiar cinematic codes in conjunction with a display of the bioluminescent forest embeds the motion capture imagery, processed into high-resolution animation, into the story-world of the film. The framing and editing patterns help actively to encode the figures as much as they do the space. When the camera moves high to oversee Jake as he runs along a tree trunk that bridges a chasm, his precarious movements are shown along with the view down into the plummeting gorge. The film cuts to a moving camera shot that is untethered from a conventional physical location. Seeming to simply to be in the air, it gives another perspective from which Jake and Ney’tiri are included as a part of the vast luminescent landscape. Such examples show how the figures are located as part of the emergent space of the action. A closer look at the figures themselves shows that they too exist at an intersection of codes.</p>
<p>Thinking about the intersection of codes in the motion capture figures expands the ecology of connections both towards the decoding strategies of viewers and also machine code. Writing about performance capture, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746847712456261">Sue Ellen Case (2006</xref>: 165) comments that ‘codes do not remain unmarked, as they accrete into a figure, whose social attributes actually locate its appearance with the social surround’. Case is referring here to codes through which viewers read the figure, and make interpretations about their actions and their identities. Such readings rely on how we interpret the codes of humanness, gender, race, or alienness as they are embodied in the figures, and as they are given more context in a story that explores conflicts between technology and nature, humans and aliens, invaders and inhabitants. The reading frames used and the connections made in making interpretations are complex and multiple, and are informed by an individual’s history of viewing and experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746847712456261">Thomas Elsaesser (2011</xref>: 252) suggests that <italic>Avatar</italic> works by encouraging multiple and even contradictory readings: ‘“Access for all” in <italic>Avatar</italic> functions at the level of the code, ensuring multiple readings, while not predicting or privileging any one in particular.’</p>
<p>The idea of decoding through multiple readings complicates a process that is nonetheless familiar territory. It involves an activation of our reading strategies that rely on knowledge of social and cultural politics, an awareness of cinema past and present, and an understanding of the thematic and stylistic histories of cinema in general and of genres in particular. But one of the things still missing from this ecology of connections is the participation of machine code. Code, when used in the sense of digital data, is often treated transparently, a device that changes materiality but has no materiality of its own. Code, however, always exists in a context, and that context gives it substance, a material presence. Hardware is part of the materiality of a machine, and it is central in generating the processing power on which software relies. Software, meanwhile, is active in giving detail to the transformations of data, as algorithms are dedicated to enabling data input and also to creating a range of outputs.</p>
<p>Like any software, or technology more generally, those used on <italic>Avatar</italic>, such as Autodesk Maya and Autodesk MotionBuilder, offer particular affordances. The parameters of the software, what they can and cannot support, what they can and cannot output, are part of the ecology of <italic>Avatar</italic>. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1746847712456261">Lev Manovich (2008)</xref>, software defines the options for navigating, editing and sharing output, and in the case of an animation package, we can add that software also defines the details of any created imagery. Even though most of us do not have access to the code of a program, the influence of codes materializes in what is produced. For example, the most explicit affordance of Autodesk MotionBuilder is its capacity for the real-time rendering of digital assets with motion capture data. The capacity for real-time rendering is an influencing element within the ecology of motion capture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746847712456261">David Berry (2011</xref>: 3) argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>Software is a tangle, a knot, which ties together the physical and the ephemeral, the material and the ethereal, into a multi-linear ensemble that can be controlled and directed. From the mundane activities of alarm clocks and heating systems, to complex structures like stock market trading systems and electricity grid markets, software helps these material objects function.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Software helps many aspects of contemporary filmmaking, from digital light meters to the high capacity processors of render farms used in generating CGI, together with the many kinds of software used during a production. Furthermore, software is rarely neutral. Philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746847712456261">Don Ihde (2009</xref>: 44) challenges any idea that the mediations of technology are neutral: ‘Technologies transform our experience of the world and our perception and interpretations of our world, and we in turn become transformed in this process.’ In <italic>Avatar</italic>, the real-time engine of MotionBuilder, the animation and modeling software of Maya, and the virtual camera systems are all influences within the film’s ecology. The performance of the actors occurs in an emergent space that is visible on a screen only because of the real-time software, in conjunction with Maya-produced digital assets. As a consequence, acting occurs not only in relation to how an actor imagines a scene to be, but also in relation to how they are incorporated into a low-resolution version of that scene. In this low-resolution environment, actors’ actions are streamed with digital assets, and they can see and be directed according to the emergence of those hybrid images. In the world of Pandora as it is finally rendered, viewers see the interactions between two alien creatures, the Na’vi Ney’tiri and the human-Na’vi Jake connected to his avatar. In the virtual camera systems of <italic>Avatar</italic>, the performances of the human actors are mediated through the images created and encoded using software. A doubled articulation of space lies in its relational emergence with the actors. Space comes into being through the functionality of the real-time software, and in turn mediates the actions of the actors. The actors are not the sole site of meaning, nor the source of agency; instead meaning and agency lie in the tranversal relations of the materiality of interacting entities.</p>
<p>As technology is taken up and developed further in films such as <italic>The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn</italic> (Steven Spielberg, 2011), the interactive possibilities of directors, actors and software evolve too. Remaining focused only on the realism of these images, or the traces of humanness within them, misses the way in which these spaces emerge at an intersection of codes. Using an ecological approach considers transversal relations between things, and the question becomes not about markers of humanness, but how we can discern materialities as a coming together of multiple codes. The answer to this question is not only relevant to fictions, but also to encounters with the everyday world. Just as software is increasingly embedded in filmmaking practices, it too is embedded in many varied practices of everyday life within technologically mediated environments. Writing about software in the world, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1746847712456261">Kitchen and Dodge (2011</xref>: 44) argue:<disp-quote>
<p>As such, software needs to be understood as an actant in the world – it augments, supplements, mediates, and regulates our lives and opens up new possibilities – but not in a deterministic way. Rather, software is afforded power by a network of contingencies that allows it to work in the world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As software works in the world, it makes a material contribution through the various ways in which it mediates. Thinking ecologically keeps in mind that the materiality of which we are a part is hybrid, a multifaceted space where the codes of software collide with the many others that constitute the social, cultural and political possibilities of the world.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Films (and also television programmes and games) accumulate meaning in relation to circulating discourse or paratexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746847712456261">Gray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1746847712456261">Klinger, 2006</xref>). The argument presented in this article adds to our understandings of the ways in which associated texts actively connect to one another. The materiality that emerges in these connections is more fully emphasized by taking an ecological approach. Thinking in this way has been explored in relation to <italic>Avatar</italic>, particularly through motion capture technologies: the SimulCam and virtual camera. Though humanness has often been a primary concern in discussions of motion capture, the ecology surrounding <italic>Avatar</italic> consists of multiple entities. It is an intersection of numerous technologies, software, performances and film-making practices, each of which contributes codes that influence understandings of motion captured imagery.</p>
<p>Arguing that humanness be considered as a code amongst several relies on the idea that a multiplicity of codes co-exists in an ecology. This perspective is relevant to any film and its associated texts. The discussion of <italic>Avatar</italic> has focused on the emergence of technologically mediated spaces in the landscapes of audio-visual media. But there are many other issues that can be elucidated by paying closer attention to an ecology, drawing it out for what it tells us about moving image production, the story-worlds of films, actors participating in performances, as well as the hybrid materialities constituting the world.</p>
