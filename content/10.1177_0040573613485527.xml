<abstract>
<p><italic>Theology Today</italic>’s Book Forum presents essays that focus attention on one book, followed by a response from the author. These forums originate from panel discussions at the American Academy of Religion and may retain some of the style of an oral presentation, such as the use of first person and references to the author by first name. The essays that follow are based on a panel discussion that occurred at the 2012 meeting of the AAR in Chicago in response to James Cone’s book, <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> sponsored by the working group, “Explorations in Theology and Apocalyptic.” Panelists were Christopher Morse, Nathan R. Kerr, and J. Kameron Carter.</p>

<p>James H. Cone is the Charles Augustus Briggs Distinguished Professor of Systematic Theology at Union Theological Seminary in New York City, where he has taught since 1969. Professor Cone is best known for his work as a black liberation theologian, a movement in theology that he initiated with the publication of his book <italic>Black Theology and Black Power</italic> (Seabury Press, 1969). That book was followed by numerous others, including <italic>God of the Oppressed</italic> (Seabury Press, 1975) and <italic>Martin &amp; Malcolm &amp; America: A Dream or a Nightmare?</italic> (Orbis, 1991). <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> (Orbis, 2011) is his most recent and eagerly anticipated book.</p>
<p>While being my teacher does not stand among the highlights of James Cone’s academic career, it is certainly one of the highlights of mine. As a Ph.D. student at Union Seminary in New York, I took numerous courses from him, and he was the second reader of my dissertation. He is a dynamic and engaging teacher, who listens to his students while simultaneously demanding careful listening and analytical skills from them. I count it a privilege that he was my teacher, and I was pleased to moderate the panel discussion of his book at the AAR.</p>
<p>Christopher Morse is the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Professor of Theology and Ethics at Union Theological Seminary in New York, where he has taught since 1974. His book, <italic>The Difference Heaven Makes: Rehearing the Gospel as News</italic> (T&amp;T Clark, 2010), was the subject of a Book Forum for <italic>Theology Today</italic> 68.1, April 2011. When invited by Phillip Ziegler, one of the organizers of the event, to serve on the panel to discuss James Cone’s book, he was given the specific task of addressing issues that are raised by a conversation between James Cone’s book on lynching and the work of New Testament scholar J. Louis Martyn on apocalyptic rectification. As readers will see, James Cone does not believe the comparison was such a good idea. Cone’s critique of Morse’s essay both interests and concerns me, because all three—James Cone, Christopher Morse, and J. Louis Martyn—were my teachers at Union and have significantly influenced my work as a theological ethicist. I find that by following the assignment given to him, Morse’s use of Martyn acknowledges the profound insights that arise from Cone’s book. Cone disagrees. I invite readers to make their own assessment.</p>
<p>Nathan R. Kerr is Associate Professor of Religion at Trevecca Nazarene University in Nashville, Tennessee and is the author of <italic>Christ, History and Apocalyptic: The Politics of Christian Mission</italic> (Cascade, 2008). Drawing on the New Testament scholar, Ernst Käsemann, and his own experience in ministry at a women’s prison in Nashville, Tennessee, Kerr argues that white theology has lost the sense of “imminent expectancy” of the coming kingdom revealed in Christ’s cross and resurrection, and thereby fails to recognize the passing away of the present form of this world that seeks to maintain its present oppressive order. Kerr draws on the significance of song in oppressed communities to give witness to the power of God’s “making a way out of no way” and agrees with Cone’s insistence that salvation revealed on the cross is available only by being in solidarity with those in our midst who are crucified.</p>
<p>J. Kameron Carter is Associate Professor of Theology, the Divinity School and the Graduate Faculty of Religion at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. He is the author of <italic>Race: A Theological Account</italic> (Oxford University Press, 2008). As the title of his essay (“Apocalyptic Blues”) indicates, he weaves a powerful connection between singing the blues and his reading of James Cone’s <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic>, making reference to James Baldwin, M. Shawn Copeland, Toni Morrison, and W.E.B. Du Bois along the way. For him, Cone’s book can be described as a “new sonic and apocalyptic artistry” where the scandal of the Gospel is revealed at the intersection of the cross and the lynching tree.</p>
<p>As reviews editor for <italic>Theology Today</italic>, I am grateful to the three panelists and most especially to James Cone for their contribution to this Book Forum on this powerful and significant book, <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree.</italic></p>
