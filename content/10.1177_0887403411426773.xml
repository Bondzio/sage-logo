<abstract>
<p>Given the limited opportunities for consensual, sexual relationships in prisons, inmates must often seek to fulfill their sexual needs through other avenues, including use of sexually explicit materials. The current study explores the policies of correctional agencies regarding allowing inmates’ access to sexually explicit materials. Drawing on Department of Corrections (DOC) policies, this study indicates important variations across systems. Current research, as it relates to the effects of viewing sexually explicit materials on prison inmates, is scarce. Although more data are available from the general population, it is not entirely clear whether these results translate to prison inmates. Nonetheless, prison administrators may still have a legitimate penological interest in restricting these materials. Examining both the current state of correctional policies on access to sexually explicit materials and the current research, potential implications for policy development are discussed.</p>

<p>Inmates in correctional facilities throughout the United States are limited in their opportunities to continue their sexual relationships they once maintained outside. Only six states (California, Connecticut, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, and Washington) allow conjugal visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887403411426773">Camp, 2003</xref>). Even then such visits are often very limited in terms of the types of inmates who are eligible and the number of times in a given year an inmate can receive a visit. Furthermore, individual visits are limited in terms of overall time allowed for the inmate and a partner to be together.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0887403411426773">1</xref></sup> One possible alternative may be for inmates to turn to sexually explicit publications or photographs as a sexual outlet.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a correctional system permits, prohibits, or stands silent in policy on issues of whether to allow sexually explicit materials (and what types), there are important policy implications to consider. Among the states that have less restrictive standards regarding what they will allow inmates to receive, access to these materials could encourage inmate sexual behavior, sexual harassment, or sexual violence. Some researchers have found relationships between viewing sexually explicit materials and an increase in violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403411426773">Scully, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887403411426773">Seto, Maric, &amp; Barbaree, 2000</xref>). Other researchers have found relationships between viewing sexually explicit materials and increased aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887403411426773">Allen, D’Alessio, &amp; Brezgel, 1995</xref>). The purpose of the present article is to examine what types of sexually explicit materials Department of Corrections’ (DOC) policies allow/prohibit inmates to receive.</p>

<title>Restricting Nude and Sexually Explicit Materials: Furtherance of a Legitimate Penological Interest?</title>
<p>Crucial to knowing why some correctional systems prohibit nude or sexually explicit materials is understanding the potential effects of viewing these materials on prison inmates. Unfortunately, there is only very sparse research evidence to support claims that allowing or prohibiting sexually explicit materials in prisons has any effect on inmate behavior.</p>
<p>The available literature on the effects of sexually explicit materials on men’s behavior, although mixed, does largely lend support to the belief that prohibition of nude and sexually explicit materials furthers a legitimate penological interest. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403411426773">Scully (1994)</xref> suggests that men who are predisposed to sexually offend are not only more likely to become violent after consuming these materials but also may further internalize sexual abuse and maltreatment of women as normal. Furthermore, men who are predisposed to sexually offend tend to show the strongest changes in violent attitudes after viewing sexually explicit materials, whereas men who are not inclined to commit sexual offenses have demonstrated considerably smaller changes in attitudes in comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887403411426773">Seto et al., 2000</xref>). Building on this idea, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887403411426773">Bergen (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403411426773">Cramer et al. (1998)</xref> showed that among women who have been victims of sexual violence, use of pornography is a common activity for their abusers. Finally, in a study of 102 male undergraduate students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887403411426773">Vega and Malamuth (2007)</xref> found that pornography consumption was strongly related to increased sexual aggression among male college students as well. Currently, 12.3% of inmates are serving sentences for rape or sexual assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403411426773">West &amp; Sabol, 2010</xref>). Therefore, prison administrators may have a significant interest in keeping nude and sexually explicit materials out of their facilities (as these inmates, as well as perhaps others, have demonstrated a predisposition to sexually offend).</p>
<p>However, other researchers have rejected the link between viewing sexually explicit materials and increased violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887403411426773">Smith and Hand (1987)</xref> found very little difference in increased levels of violence toward women between men who were exposed to sexually explicit material and a comparison group of men who were not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887403411426773">Davies (1997)</xref> in a study of 194 men who had rented sexually explicit videos during a 1-year period concurs and concluded “pornography does not affect attitudes toward rape or women’s rights” (p. 131).</p>
<p>Some researchers have addressed the potential link between viewing sexually explicit materials and increased levels of aggression (which does not necessarily result in a violent outburst). Large scale meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887403411426773">Malamuth, Addison, &amp; Koss (2000)</xref> support that frequent pornography consumption by men is linked with sexually aggressive behaviors, especially for consumption of violent sexual images. More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887403411426773">Hald, Malamuth, and Yuen (2010)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis of nine nonexperimental studies of men’s consumption of sexually explicit materials and attitudes supporting violence against women. They conclude that nonexperimental studies have similar conclusions to experimental studies—consumption of pornography is associated with attitudes supportive of violence against women. In addition, consumption of violent sexually explicit materials are most strongly connected with attitudes supportive of violence against women. Arguably more specific to a prison setting where a large number of inmates have lower than average IQs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403411426773">Bogaert, Woodard, and Hafer (1999)</xref> reported that viewing sexually explicit materials has a stronger effect on attitudes and actions on men with lower IQs. When coupled with the fact that significant numbers of inmates have demonstrated a predisposition (or willingness) to sexually offend, this would appear to suggest that there is a legitimate penological interest in restricting/prohibiting sexually explicit materials in prisons.</p>

<title>Support and Opposition to Allowing Inmates Access to Sexually Explicit Materials</title>
<p>Few people may recognize that at least some inmates may have access to sexually explicit materials while incarcerated. When queried about whether they believe such materials are appropriate for inmates to possess, most members of the public oppose such a privilege. Couched in the debate about whether inmates should be provided amenities while incarcerated, two studies have shown general disapproval of allowing sexually explicit materials in prison. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887403411426773">Applegate (2001)</xref> surveyed members of the general community in Central Florida and reports that fully 82.9% of respondents support prohibiting inmates from receiving sexually explicit magazines. Sexually explicit magazines received the least support from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887403411426773">Applegate’s (2001)</xref> sample of 26 different “amenities.” Whereas 82.9% support prohibiting sexually explicit magazines, only 26.6% support prohibiting conjugal visitations and 36.5% support removing access to college programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403411426773">Hensley, Koscheski, and Tewksbury (2003)</xref> surveyed 533 undergraduate students and also report that sexually explicit materials are the least supported “amenity” for prison inmates. Only provision of cable television and boxing/martial arts were close in the level of opposition voiced by students. In a subsequent analysis, these researchers report that sexually explicit materials are the least supported amenity among students regardless of whether the inmates in question are minimum or maximum security inmates. Although when compared with other amenities, there is less distance between the expressed support for this and other amenities (e.g., cable television, R-rated movies and boxing/martial arts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887403411426773">Hensley, Koscheski, &amp; Tewksbury, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Looking at corrections officials specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403411426773">Johnson, Bennett, and Flanagan (1997)</xref> report that in a survey of 641 prison wardens in 1995, fully 75% support eliminating or reducing the access inmates have to “sexually oriented reading material.” A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887403411426773">Corrections Compendium (2002)</xref> review of inmate amenities in 45 state DOCs reported that 31% of systems allowed some inmates access to at least some varieties of sexually explicit materials. In sum, a decade or more ago, access to sexually explicit materials for prison inmates was available in less than one third of state correctional systems, and generally opposed by both correctional officials and the public. However, whether these same views and degrees of access remain in place today has yet to be addressed.</p>
<p>Overall, research has established a link between the viewing of sexually explicit materials and increased overall aggression, sexual aggression, violence, and negative attitudes toward women. Although research related to such consumption and its effects on inmates is sparse, it is not unreasonable to think that findings from the general population cannot be applied to help explain the same behavior among inmates. Given that such a link could reasonably exist, although not empirically verified, prison administrators still may have a legitimate penological interest in restricting inmates’ access to these materials. In recent years, public support as well as support among prison wardens for allowing inmates to receive sexually explicit materials (among other “amenities”) remains low.</p>

<title>Legal Background</title>
<p>Federal courts have addressed challenges to departmental policies regarding the receipt of sexually explicit materials. The courts have consistently rejected the idea that receiving such materials is a constitutional right.</p>
<p>In <italic>Turner v. Safley</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403411426773">1987</xref>), the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the issue of correspondence between inmates at different correctional facilities. Although the case did not specifically address prohibitions against receiving nude or sexually explicit materials, the Court established a 4-prong test for determining whether regulations established by prison officials that would ordinarily violate the Constitution are permissible when such regulations are “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests” (p. 89). In applying the 4-part test set forth in <italic>Turner</italic>, courts will consider whether:</p>
<list id="list1-0887403411426773" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>There is a valid, rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have an impact on guards or other inmates and on the allocation of prison resources generally.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The absence of ready alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Although the 1st Amendment issue of prohibiting nude and sexually explicit materials in prisons has never reached the U.S. Supreme Court, the legitimacy of policies that prohibit these materials is well founded in the federal appellate courts (<italic>Dean v. Bowersox</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887403411426773">2009</xref>; <italic>Frost v. Symington</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411426773">1999</xref>; <italic>Giano v. Senkowski</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411426773">1995</xref>; <italic>Josselyn v.

Most typically, inmates will claim that policies prohibiting the receipt of nude or sexually explicit materials infringe on protected speech under the 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (see <italic>Dean v. Bowersox</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887403411426773">2009</xref>; <italic>Frost v. Symington</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411426773">1999</xref>; <italic>Giano v.

Federal Circuit Courts, however, have consistently rejected this argument on various grounds including the furtherance of legitimate penological interests (<italic>Giano v. Senkowski</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411426773">1995</xref>; <italic>Sperry v. Werholtz</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403411426773">2011</xref>); furtherance of legitimate governmental interests (see <italic>Dean v. Bowersox</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887403411426773">2009</xref>; <italic>Frost v. Symington</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403411426773">1999</xref>; <italic>Trapnell v. Riggsby</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887403411426773">1980</xref>); and deference to the DOC Commissioner’s views based on his or her prior experience (see <italic>Giano v. Senkowski</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403411426773">1995</xref>; <italic>Josselyn v. Dennehy</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887403411426773">2009</xref>). In addition, the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in <italic>Josselyn v. Dennehy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887403411426773">2009</xref>) that institutions within individual correctional systems may draft policies that are more restrictive than other facilities in the same system.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section5-0887403411426773">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The primary function of the current study is to identify the range of policies on nude and sexually explicit materials (from the least to most restrictive) in state DOCs. Drawing on this information, as well as findings of previous studies, we also examine potential implications for DOCs, including whether such policies may facilitate sexual misconduct among inmates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0887403411426773" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data/Method</title>
<p>For the current study, data were gathered from inmate mail policies from the DOCs in 48 states and the District of Columbia. In early 2011, policies were gathered from the states’ DOCs websites, or if unavailable through the websites, requested directly from the individual department’s Director or Secretary. After repeated requests, policies from all but two systems were obtained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0887403411426773">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0887403411426773">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>There are currently wide variations across state correctional systems as far as whether systems do or do not prohibit inmates’ access to sexually explicit materials through the mail. In reviewing the policies, five primary themes emerge. (a) Some states’ policies are silent on the issue of allowing inmates to receive through the mail publications or photographs which depict nudity (most generally defined as the showing of the genitalia of either gender, buttocks of either gender, or female breasts) implying that such materials may be authorized after review at individual facilities. (b) Other states explicitly prohibit inmates from accessing through the mail any publications or photographs which depict nudity. (c) Some states are silent on the issue of inmates receiving materials which depict certain sexually explicit acts (most generally defined as actual or simulated sex acts). (d) Some states clearly prohibit inmates from receiving materials which depict any sex act. (e) No states allow inmates to receive publications or photographs that depict any of the following: sadomasochism, bestiality, nudity, or sex involving an individual who appears to be a minor, sexual acts in which one participant appears to be nonconsenting and publications or photographs that depict excretory functions.</p>
<sec id="section8-0887403411426773">
<title>States That Do Not Prohibit Nude Publications or Photographs</title>
<p>Currently, DOCs in 18 states have policies which do not prohibit inmates receiving nude publications or photographs through the mail. However, all such materials are also subject to review by institutional staff. Policies for these states indicate that prohibition of specific materials may occur if materials are deemed to be a threat to good order, security, or effective rehabilitation efforts within the facilities. States in this category either do not explicitly prohibit or allow nude photographs or publications and explicitly state under which limited conditions these materials may be permissible. In addition to the 18 states listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887403411426773">Table 1</xref>, three states (Minnesota, Nebraska, and New York) do not explicitly address nude publications or photographs in their policies, thereby, indicating that such materials are not categorically prohibited and instead are prohibited or permitted based on a case by case review.</p>

<p>Several states’ policies do not mention nudity as one of the department’s prohibited items, suggesting that nude publications and photographs may be allowed. Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, New Jersey, and West Virginia bar receipt of sexually illicit or deviant materials<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0887403411426773">3</xref></sup> but do not include mere (adult) nudity in their list of prohibited items. Iowa has perhaps one of the least restrictive standards. Take, for example, the following subsection of this department’s policy:
<disp-quote>
<p>20.6(6): Portrayal or simulation of fellatio, cunnilingus, masturbation, ejaculation, sexual intercourse, male erection, bestiality, sadomasochism, excretory functions, lewd exhibition of genitals, or other sexually explicit materials will be denied to offenders when the material is inconsistent with rehabilitation goals.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This provision clearly allows the subjective interpretation of an individual facility’s administrator and ostensibly allows wide latitude. New Mexico’s policy falls in concert with the Supreme Court’s definition of obscenity in <italic>Miller v. California</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887403411426773">1973</xref>). The Court determined material to obscene when
<disp-quote>
<p>the average person, applying contemporary community standards, finds that the work appeals to the prurient interest, depicts patently offensive sexual conduct defined by state law and lacks serious literary, artistic, or scientific value.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, this standard still falls to a facility’s administrator to interpret. Finally, North Dakota’s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0887403411426773">4</xref></sup> and Oregon’s policies explicitly prohibit any depiction of sex acts (deviant, illicit, or otherwise) and explicitly deny access to nude personal photographs. Notably, no mention is made in their policies of nudity in publications suggesting some leeway for institutional staff to allow inmates access to these materials.</p>
<p>Five states ostensibly will authorize nude publications or photographs under limited conditions set forth in policy. Ohio, for example, explicitly prohibits nude personal photographs but does not include nude publications in its definition of nudity stating that such materials only “remain subject to review under the procedures for withholding printed materials.” Michigan’s policy is similar although slightly more explicit in terms of allowing nude publications. This policy states that nude publications or photographs shall be rejected “except if included in a publication sent directly from the publisher or an authorized vendor.” Also, Virginia’s policy strictly prohibits nude personal photographs but only explicitly prohibits nude publications in the context of unlawful or sexually deviant materials remaining silent on mere adult nudity. Nevada explicitly allows for the receipt of nude photographs but limits these to pictures that do not depict sexual activity of any kind. Finally, Rhode Island’s policy seemingly allows receipt of nude materials for inmates except those who would be required to register as sex offenders if they were not incarcerated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0887403411426773">
<title>States That Prohibit Nude Publications or Photographs</title>
<p>The remaining 27 states’ and the District of Columbia’s DOCs each have policies forbidding all nude publications or photographs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0887403411426773">5</xref></sup> The majority of these states define nudity and later explicitly state that such materials are not permitted. The Utah DOC explicitly prohibits nude publications or photographs under provisions which disallow state funds from being paid to institutional staff to disseminate such materials. Other states are less explicit. Alabama and South Dakota define nudity in their policies and state that these items shall be rejected as “contraband.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0887403411426773">
<title>States That Do Not Prohibit Depictions of Certain Sex Acts</title>
<p>Currently, 5 states’ (Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, and Kentucky) policies seem to leave open the possibility that publications or photographs depicting some actual or simulated sex acts may be permitted. Once again, these states cite the maintenance of good order, security, or effective rehabilitation as the deciding factor in whether particular items are or are not prohibited. In addition to the five states listed above, four states (Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, and Ohio) do not address sexually explicit (beyond mere adult nudity) materials in their policies, so it is unclear whether facilities in these states may permit them. The policies of Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, and Kentucky prohibit all publications which depict bestiality, sadomasochism, nudity, or sex acts with children or minors and forced sex. However, by their silence regarding certain actual or simulated sex acts such as vaginal, anal or oral penetration, and masturbation, they suggest a willingness to permit inmates to receive such materials. Iowa has arguably the least restrictive standard. The policy clearly allows for the prohibition of publications or photographs which depict the same illicit or deviant sex acts listed above, although it does not necessarily prohibit these items. Publications and photographs showing the sex acts listed above may be approved (see Iowa DOC Policy 20.6[6] listed above), possibly with the exception of forced, nonconsensual sex acts. Furthermore, Iowa’s policy has an additional provision stating that publications may neither be approved nor denied but rather “controlled.” In such situation, correctional staff will hold on to the publication and designate certain times and places for inmates to view the material.</p>

<title>States That Prohibit Depictions of Any Sex Act</title>
<p>The remaining 39 states’ and the District of Columbia’s DOCs have provisions forbidding depictions of all sex acts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0887403411426773">6</xref></sup> The majority of these states define “sexually explicit” and state that such materials are prohibited. Some states’ policies, however, are less explicit. New Mexico’s policy, for example, does not list specific depictions of sex acts which are not allowed. Rather, this policy states that incoming mail will be rejected if it “appeals primarily to prurient interests.” Alabama’s policy also does not list specific sex acts yet will reject these materials under the same provisions which allow for the refusal of nude publications or photographs. Finally, Texas’ policy also does not list specific sex acts yet explicitly bars receipt of nude materials, suggesting that material depicting sex acts would be prohibited as well.</p>

<sec id="section12-0887403411426773">
<title>Policy Implications</title>
<p>Given that previous research on the effects of consumption of sexually explicit materials on attitudes, aggression, and violence—although somewhat mixed in results and implications—shows a strong indication that consumption of sexually explicit materials is related to attitudes supportive of sexual aggression and violence there would appear to be legitimate penological reasons for restricting/prohibiting inmates from receiving, possessing, and consuming sexually explicit materials. However, there is little or no existing evidence to support the extension of findings of research from the general community to the behaviors of prison inmates. As a first step toward providing evidence of such, we offer two initial indications that inmates’ receipt of sexually explicit materials may contribute to disruptions of institutional security and custody.</p>
<p>First, drawing on the policies of state DOCs regarding what sexually explicit materials inmates are allowed to receive and state-based rates of inmate sexual misconduct (using reported instances of nonconsensual sexual acts as reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887403411426773">Guerino &amp; Beck, 2011</xref>), it is possible to see that there does appear to be relationship between state DOC policies on sexually explicit materials and inmate sexual misconduct rates. Calculations of mean annual rates of officially reported nonconsensual sexual acts in DOCs that do not allow any sexually explicit (including mere depictions of nudity) materials, DOCs that allow inmates to receive only materials showing nudity and DOCs that allow inmates to receive materials depicting sexual acts show states whose policies permit inmates to receive sexually explicit publications have lower rates of reported inmate-inmate sexual assaults. States whose policies allow receipt of publications containing nudity (column 1 on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887403411426773">Table 1</xref>) have a mean rate of 0.87 reported nonconsensual sexual acts per 1,000 inmates, states whose policies allow receipt of depictions of sexual activity (column 2 on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887403411426773">Table 1</xref>) have a mean rate of 1.47 per 1,000 inmates. In contrast, states that do not allow receipt of any sexually explicit materials have a mean rate of reported sexual assault of 2.72 per 1,000 inmates.</p>
<p>Second, a small pilot study (conducted by the authors) of inmates in a 2,000-bed, medium-security men’s prison in a Southern state shows that over a 6-month period in 2011, a total of 75 (3.7%) inmates received a sexually explicit magazine. Review of received magazines for explicitness<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0887403411426773">7</xref></sup> shows that inmates who received more explicit publications were statistically significantly more likely to also receive at least one disciplinary write up for a disruptive infraction<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0887403411426773">8</xref></sup> (mean disruptive disciplinary infractions: .55 vs. .27, <italic>F</italic> = 6.887, <italic>p</italic> = .015. However, there are no differences in inmates who do and do not receive explicit magazines in regards to violent or drug related disciplinary infractions.</p>
<p>Based on the above, state DOCs are urged to exercise caution when determining which materials will be allowed into their facilities. When enforcing provisions of their respective state’s policy, individual institutions should consider the potential for increased violence (including sexual violence), the opportunities for such materials to become available to sex offenders (possibly negating rehabilitative efforts), and the potential for those consuming such materials to subsequently act out sexually toward other inmates and facility staff (especially female staff). If these issues are foreseeable at a specific institution or become problems as a result of more permissive standards, then modifications to policies and policy enforcement should be considered.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section13-0887403411426773" sec-type="conclusions|discussions">
<title>Conclusion/Discussion</title>
<p>Although the language in many states’ policies is clear as to whether materials depicting nudity or sexually explicit acts are or are not permitted, many states’ policies are more implicit and are left open to interpretation, presumably by administrators. Whether the DOCs choose to allow inmates to receive nude or sexually explicit publications or photographs, there are important implications. In choosing to prohibit such materials, many states cite the need to maintain good order and security, as well as facilitate rehabilitation. However, it is possible that prohibiting inmates from receiving these materials is actually counterproductive to this goal. That is, good order, security, and rehabilitation may actually be hindered if inmates are not afforded some form of sexual outlet and instead choose sexual abuse or sexual violence. One could also argue that allowing inmates to receive nude or sexually explicit materials may also lead to sexual abuse or violence directed at other inmates or correctional staff. Although there is no evidence to support this contention presently,(and the initial evidence presented above shows the opposite) the possibility exists that a thorough review of the behavior of both individual inmates who do and do not consume sexually explicit materials, and a comparison of rates of violence (including sexual violence), disciplinary infractions and recidivism rates of inmates housed in institutions that do and do not permit sexually explicit materials may show important differences. Future research should investigate these issues so as to provide evidence to support and direct policy modifications.</p>
<p>This study is not without limitations. Although we have examined the current state of policies across DOCs, this is only a snapshot in time and does not take into account historical developments/changes in policies or issues of how and why policies have been developed as they are. Administrators’ motivations in writing policies of particular content and direction would be important to know but is beyond the scope of the present study. Future researchers are urged to examine how and why DOCs have established the policies they have in place. A second limitation is that this assessment looked only at system-wide policies, and not at how such policies are implemented at the facility level. As many DOC policies leave open the issue of what may or may not be permitted into the facility, it would be of value for future studies to examine how decisions are made at individual institutions regarding what materials are or are not allowed to be received by inmates.</p>
<p>At present, the research is still mixed and there remains debate as to the link between the consumption of such materials and subsequent sexual abuse or violence. Further research on the potential causal link between consumption of nude or sexually explicit materials and heightened sexual abuse or violence, as well as all forms of inmate behavior, is clearly needed.</p>

<p>Nudity is most generally defined as the showing of the genitalia of either gender, buttocks of either gender, or female breasts. Many states include nude drawings in this definition as well. However, nearly every state has an additional provision which may allow inmates access to nude publications or photographs when such materials have artistic, medical, cultural, or anthropological value.
