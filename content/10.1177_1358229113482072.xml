<p>Discrimination against people with disabilities remains one of the greatest human rights issues of our time. This article represents a critical overview of international, and in particular European, human rights and of the non-discrimination frameworks relevant and applicable to the unequal treatment of persons with disabilities in order to ascertain whether these norms provide for adequate legal, policy and institutional bases for dealing with discrimination on the grounds of disability. Having considered the contents and scope of relevant international human rights and non-discrimination provisions, the author turns to the questions of how these provisions might be exercised, who the rights holders and duty bearers would be and what the challenges of balancing different rights and needs are. The article also includes the definition of the concept of disability in the context of non-discrimination law and examines the dimensions of disability discrimination as defined in international and EU law. The author concludes that international, and especially modern EU, non-discrimination law establishes a wide and inclusive legal framework for dealing with disability discrimination. However, the actual scope of the realisation of international and European legal standards on disability discrimination in each state will depend on the consistency and effectiveness of their national implementation and on the manner of putting them into practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In spite of a multitude of international, supranational and national legal and policy instruments and actions pursuing better participation and enhanced inclusion of persons with disabilities in mainstream society, the exclusion, discrimination and marginalisation of disabled people remain some of the greatest global human rights issues of our time, still gaining importance owing to factors such as war and destruction, unhealthy living conditions and the global increase in chronic health conditions, ageing populations and the higher risk of disability in older people, as well as the general absence of knowledge about disability, its causes, prevention and treatment. Discrimination against any person on the grounds of disability is ‘a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person’, as it is stated in the Preamble to the <italic>UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</italic>.</p>
<p>According to the <italic>World Report on Disability 2011</italic>, produced and published jointly by the World Health Organization and the World Bank Group, disabled persons in all countries experience inequalities and are denied equal access to health care, work and employment, education, political participation, transport, public buildings and even information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1358229113482072">World Health Organization, 2011</xref>: XI). In addition, in the <italic>General Comment No. 5 (1994) Persons with Disabilities</italic> adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights it is stated that the consequences of discrimination on the grounds of disability have also been particularly severe in the fields of housing, cultural life and access to public places and services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1358229113482072">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The overarching aim of this article is to critically analyse international, and in particular EU, human rights and non-discrimination frameworks and to find out whether these norms provide for the adequate legal, policy and institutional bases for dealing with the problems that persons with disabilities face when it comes to their equal treatment and equal opportunities. Having considered the contents and scope of relevant international human rights and non-discrimination provisions, I will turn to the questions of how these provisions might be exercised, who the rights holders and duty bearers would be and what the challenges of balancing different rights and needs are. However, the article will not examine existing mechanisms or institutions and procedural issues (e.g. burden of proof, remedies and sanctions) – at international, EU and national levels – for giving effect to and enforcing the rights in question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1358229113482072">
<title>International law</title>
<p>Today, provisions for the equality or non-discrimination of persons with disabilities constitute a significant body of international human rights law as they can be found in all key human rights treaties adopted at universal and regional levels. However, one should distinguish between general human rights documents and specialised instruments on the discrimination against certain groups of people (including those with disabilities).</p>
<sec id="section3-1358229113482072">
<title>a) General human rights documents</title>
<p>The <italic>Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 (UDHR)</italic>,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1358229113482072">2</xref>
</sup> which sets out basic human rights standards accepted by all Member States of the United Nations (UN), and thus forms the normative foundation for formulating the universal standards concerning persons with disabilities, provides in Article 2 that ‘everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status’. The words ‘other status’ in this provision indicate that the non-discrimination clause in this Article is openly formulated and can also be interpreted to include disability as a ground for unlawful discrimination. In addition, Article 7 of the <italic>UDHR</italic> guarantees equality before the law and equal protection by the law for all people, including against any discrimination and against any incitement to such discrimination. Similarly, the <italic>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</italic> <italic>1966 </italic>contains in Article 26 a free-standing equality clause stating that all persons are equal before the law and have the right to equal protection of the law without any discrimination. Although not explicitly mentioned in this Article, disability as a reason for unequal treatment before the law or unequal protection of the law shall be seen as falling within the wording ‘other status’. In contrast, the Article 2(2) of the <italic>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966 (ICESCR)</italic> only requires the states parties to ensure that ‘the rights enunciated in the present Covenant will be exercised without discrimination of any kind…’ based on certain specified grounds, whereby this provision does not explicitly refer to disability discrimination. However, also in this case, discrimination on the grounds of disability can be clearly dealt with in the frame of ‘other status’. Such a stand was also taken by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), a specific treaty body monitoring the implementation of the <italic>ICESCR</italic> in the states parties, in its <italic>General Comment No. 5</italic> dedicated to the situation of persons with disabilities in the fields of economic, social and cultural rights.<sup>

<title>b) Specialised human rights documents</title>
<p>In addition to provisions in general human rights instruments, which explicitly prohibit discrimination on various grounds, there are also specialised treaties relating to equal treatment and non-discrimination. The <italic>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 1979</italic> <italic>(CEDAW)</italic> does not contain any specific provision on disability in relation to gender discrimination. However, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (a treaty body established to monitor the implementation of <italic>CEDAW</italic>) underlined in its <italic>General Recommendation No. 18 (1991) Disabled Women </italic>the phenomenon of multiple discrimination in the case of disabled women. Such double (gender and disability) discrimination against women with disabilities raises particular concerns in the view of the Committee and the states parties are invited to 
<disp-quote>
<p>provide information on disabled women in their periodic reports, and on measures taken to deal with their particular situation, including special measures to ensure that they have equal access to education and employment, health services and social security, and to ensure that they can participate in all areas of social and cultural life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1358229113482072">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recognising the particularly vulnerable status of children with disabilities, Article 2(1) of the <italic>Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 (CRC)</italic> expressly lists disability among the prohibited grounds of discrimination in the exercising and enjoyment of children’s rights. The <italic>CRC</italic> was thus the first human rights treaty containing a specific reference to disability as one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination in its article on non-discrimination. The Committee on the Rights of the Child, a human rights treaty body entrusted with the mandate to monitor the implementation of the <italic>CRC</italic> in states parties and to provide the interpretations of its various provisions, adopted in 2006 the <italic>General Comment No. 9</italic> on the rights of children with disabilities in which it identified the problems and cases of severe disability discrimination faced by disabled children. The Committee on the Rights of Child stressed in this document that children with disabilities represent one of the most vulnerable groups of children as they are in many cases victims of multiple discrimination (e.g. indigenous girls with disabilities). It considers de facto discrimination against children on the grounds of their disability a very serious problem that exists in almost all societies. According to its observations, children with disabilities are discriminated against in various aspects of their lives and development and this has, of course, certain far-reaching and negative consequences. The Committee thus concluded that ‘social stigma, fears, overprotection, negative attitudes, misbeliefs and prevailing prejudices against children with disabilities remain strong in many communities and lead to the marginalization and alienation of children with disabilities’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1358229113482072">5</xref>
</sup> Therefore, it recommended to states parties that they take some concrete measures in order to eliminate and prevent all forms of discrimination against children with disabilities, such as a) to mention explicitly disability as a prohibited ground for discrimination in constitutional provisions on non-discrimination and/or include specific prohibition of discrimination on the ground of disability in specific non-discrimination laws or legal provisions; b) to provide for effective and easily accessible remedies in case of breaches of the rights of children with disabilities; c) to conduct awareness-raising and educational campaigns targeting the public at large and specific groups of professionals with a view to preventing and eliminating de facto discrimination against children with disabilities; d) to take due account of the fact that girls with disabilities are often even more vulnerable to discrimination because of their gender and, in this context, to pay particular attention to girls with disabilities by taking the necessary measures, and when needed extra measures, in order to ensure that they are well protected, have access to all services and are fully included in society.<sup>

<title>c) Disability-specific human rights instruments</title>
<p>On 13 December 2006, the UN General Assembly adopted a specialised international convention dealing with the rights of persons with disabilities. Non-discrimination, full and effective participation and inclusion in society, respect for difference, equality of opportunity and equality between men and women are the fundamental principles followed by this convention. The convention contains an extensive list of rights for persons with disabilities, aimed at securing equality and non-discrimination in the enjoyment of their rights, as well as imposing a range of obligations on the states parties to this treaty to undertake positive measures. The <italic>UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)</italic> is of paramount importance not only for the EU Member States that have acceded to it, and are thus directly obligated by its provisions, but also for those EU Member States that have not ratified it yet, as well as for EU institutions since the EU's ratification of this convention in December 2010.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1358229113482072">7</xref>
</sup> This means that its provisions bind EU institutions and will also bind the EU Member States when they are applying EU law. As a result, the <italic>CRPD</italic> is likely to become a reference point for interpreting both EU and ECHR law relating to discrimination on the grounds of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1358229113482072">European Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2011</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>The International Labour Organization (ILO) as a UN specialised agency adopted in 1983 <italic>Convention (No. 159) concerning Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment of Disabled Persons</italic>, which emphasises the principle of equal opportunity by stating that ‘positive measures aimed at effective equality of opportunity and treatment between disabled workers and other workers shall not be regarded as discriminating against other workers’ (Article 4). This provision reflects the importance of the concept of positive discrimination. The aim of special positive measures, according to the ILO <italic>Convention</italic>, is to provide persons with disabilities (as members of an ‘unprivileged group’) with special (i.e. additional) protection in order to enable them full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In Article 4, it is expressly stated that such special measures in favour of disabled employees do not constitute discrimination against non-disabled employees.<sup>

<sec id="section6-1358229113482072">
<title>European law</title>
<p>Given the European focus of this article, the relevant legal instruments adopted within the Council of Europe (CoE) are of particular importance. Moreover, all EU Member States are also members of the CoE and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regularly refers to the treaties and case law of the CoE, particularly that of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). As with the UN, the CoE has both general and specialised legal documents of relevance to non-discrimination.</p>
<sec id="section7-1358229113482072">
<title>a) Human rights law</title>
<p>Beginning with general legal instruments, the CoE adopted two core human rights treaties that include the protection of persons with disabilities from disability-based discrimination. The first, and most famous, is of course the <italic>European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</italic> of 1950. Although not expressly listed among the protected grounds of discrimination, disability has been included by the ECtHR in its interpretation of ‘other status’ under Article 14 of the <italic>ECHR</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1358229113482072">9</xref>
</sup> In this context, the free-standing non-discrimination clause in Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 to the <italic>ECHR</italic> is even more far-reaching as it prohibits discrimination in relation to ‘enjoyment of any right set forth by law’ and is thus much broader in scope than Article 14, which relates only to the rights guaranteed by the <italic>ECHR</italic>. In <italic>Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina</italic>, the ECtHR stated that Protocol No. 12 to the <italic>ECHR</italic> ‘introduces a general prohibition of discrimination’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1358229113482072">10</xref>
</sup> Indeed, this general prohibition of discrimination also covers discrimination on the grounds of disability, provided that the cumulative approach of a substantive right in question and the Protocol’s provisions prohibiting discrimination are employed.</p>
<p>Another legal instrument constituting a general human rights framework of the CoE is the <italic>European Social Charter (ESC)</italic>, which was first adopted in 1961 and then substantially revised in 1996. Both the original and the revised <italic>ESC</italic> refer to non-discrimination, although the prohibition of discrimination is more clearly formulated in the latter (Article E). It includes both a right to equal opportunities and equal treatment in matters of employment and occupation, protecting against discrimination, inter alia, on the grounds of ‘other status’, which also includes disability as a protected ground as it is reflected in the decision adopted by the body monitoring the implementation of the <italic>ESC</italic> – the European Committee of Social Rights (ECSR) – in <italic>Autism-Europe v. France</italic>,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1358229113482072">11</xref>
</sup> where it was found that France failed to comply with Article E of the revised <italic>ESC</italic> in the field of provision of education to people with autism. In addition, the 1961 <italic>ESC</italic> was the first human rights treaty to explicitly mention disability and guarantee to persons with disabilities the right to vocational training, rehabilitation and social resettlement (Article 15).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1358229113482072">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Beyond the <italic>ECHR</italic> and the <italic>ESC</italic>, non-discrimination provisions can be found also in some specialised instruments adopted within the CoE. Here, for instance, mention can be made of the 2005 <italic>Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings</italic> (Article 3) and the 2008 <italic>Convention on Access to Official Documents</italic> (Article 2(1)), which apply also to disability-based discrimination, although disability is not expressly listed among the prohibited grounds of discrimination but is indeed covered by ‘other status’ and ‘any ground’ respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1358229113482072">
<title>b) EU law</title>
<p>As for the EU legislation on non-discrimination, disability is explicitly included on the list of prohibited grounds for discrimination. Following the new primary legal base of Article 13, inserted in the <italic>EC Treaty</italic> in 1999 (the <italic>Treaty of Amsterdam</italic>), the EU legislative framework on non-discrimination has been substantially extended and consolidated. There are now four core EU non-discrimination directives, including the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> (Directive 2000/78/EC) which also prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability (in addition to other grounds such as religion or belief, age and sexual orientation), but only in respect of employment and vocational training – what is considered to be one of the major shortcomings of the advanced EU framework legislation on non-discrimination. Most recently, the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union stated its commitment to building consensus in the Council to push through the Commission’s proposal (known as the ‘Horizontal Directive’)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1358229113482072">13</xref>
</sup> to extend protection for these discriminatory grounds outside the labour market (i.e. to the area of accessing goods and services). As stated in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1358229113482072"><italic>Programme of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union</italic> (2013</xref>: 34), the intensive work on the proposed horizontal non-discrimination directive – which had been stuck in the Council for the past few years – to sustain the necessary political will and to ensure the accelerated process of its adoption is one of the firm priorities for the new trio-presidency (formed by Cyprus, Ireland and Lithuania). Allegedly, a progress report on the issue is currently being drawn up and will be presented at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) meeting in June 2013.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1358229113482072">14</xref>
</sup> However, we shall see whether the EU institutions (under the Irish Presidency) will be able to make any real headway in this regard. The <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> is binding upon the EU Member States. They should have transposed its provisions into their national legal systems by December 2003, except for provisions on age and disability discrimination where it was possible to extend the implementation period until 2006. Candidate Member States are required to have completed national implementation of this Directive before joining the EU.</p>
<p>Another very important document of the EU relevant for combating disability-based discrimination is the <italic>Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</italic>, which became legally binding with the coming into force of the <italic>Lisbon Treaty </italic>in 2009. As a result, the EU institutions are now legally bound to observe the <italic>Charter</italic> and to comply with its provisions. The EU Member States (except for Czech Republic, Poland and the UK) are also legally bound to comply with the <italic>Charter</italic>, but only when implementing (i.e. interpreting and applying) EU law. Article 21 of the <italic>Charter</italic> contains a general prohibition of discrimination on various grounds, including disability, whereas Article 26 provides for the social and occupational integration of persons with disabilities as well as for their participation in the life of the community.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1358229113482072">
<title>What does ‘disability’ imply?</title>
<p>In order to be able to identify those entitled to international protection against discrimination on the grounds of disability, it is first necessary to define more precisely what conditions the term ‘disability’ covers in the context of international non-discrimination law. Although disability is included in the list of protected discriminatory grounds contained in the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic>, and was recognised by the ECtHR as being covered by ‘other status’ in Article 14 of the <italic>ECHR</italic> and Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 to the <italic>ECHR</italic>, neither the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> nor the <italic>ECHR</italic> case law provides a definition of the notion. However, the <italic>CRPD</italic> does provide some guidance in this respect by recognising disability as an evolving concept which ‘results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others’. Furthermore, Article 1 of the <italic>CRPD</italic> determines the personal scope of this convention by defining persons with disabilities as those having ‘long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others’. Given that the EU (as a regional integration organisation) is a party to the <italic>CRPD</italic>, it is very probable that the CJEU will also be guided by both the convention itself and by the interpretations given by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, a specific human rights treaty body responsible for the supervision of implementation of the principles and standards enshrined in the <italic>CRPD</italic> and for their interpretation. What is more, the EU and its institutions, as well as the EU Member States, when implementing EU law will be required to pursue a broad and inclusive approach to interpreting the meaning of disability as it ensues from the <italic>CRPD</italic>.</p>
<p>It has happened many times that both in theory and practice the terms ‘disability’ and ‘handicap’ have been used interchangeably. However, one should be aware of the difference in their meanings. Also, the 1993 <italic>UN Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities</italic> clearly distinguish between these two notions by ascribing to ‘disability’ a mainly medical connotation (i.e. permanent or transitory physical, intellectual or sensory impairment, medical conditions or mental illness), whereas they define ‘handicap’ as a disability in more social terms (i.e. an environmental barrier for a person to take part in the life of the community on an equal footing with others). Still, there appears to be no general consensus on such an approach to these two definitions, although the term ‘disability’ is usually employed in the context of European non-discrimination law. In addition, it is worth noting that disability can be defined as a medical impairment or as a social construct. The medical definition of disability is based on ‘a rather functional view of disability, which regards disability primarily as a physical or psychological impairment impeding someone’s daily functioning in society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1358229113482072">Schiek et al., 2007</xref>: 131). The medical model of disability is often criticised by authors for being inadequate in providing protection against disability-based discrimination because it pays too little attention to the failure of the social environment to adjust to the need and aspirations of persons with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1358229113482072">Schiek et al., 2007</xref>: 132). In contrast, the social model considers disability not so much a functional impairment but rather a social construct and explains disability discrimination as a consequence of a disabling environment and impairments created by society. In order to provide an inclusive and effective protection against disability discrimination, a wide definition of disability, which is based on a social model and includes past, present and future disability as well as assumed disability and discrimination by association, should be opted for. It must be mentioned here that the social approach to the concept of disability is also more in line with current international trends and with the EU policy instruments on disability than the purely medical approach. However, the definition of the concept of disability formulated by the CJEU in <italic>Sonia</italic> <italic>Chacón Navas v. Eurest Colectividades SA</italic> seems to be closer to the medical model than the social model, as it focuses on present disability, which is defined in a rather functional and medical manner.</p>
<p>Emphasising the distinction that must be drawn between ‘disability’ and ‘sickness’, the CJEU produced a definition of disability, which is made up of three requirements:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1358229113482072">15</xref>
</sup> </p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>there must be a limitation which results in particular from physical, mental or psychological impairments; </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the limitation must hinder the participation of the person concerned in professional life; </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>it must be probable that the limitation will last for a long time (disability must be permanent or at least long-term in character). </p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Such a restrictive interpretation of disability given by the CJEU is somewhat surprising as its previous case law relating to the EU non-discrimination directives always tended to pursue a broad and inclusive approach to the legal protection against discrimination. It is also true that the CJEU’s definition of the term ‘disability’ is not intended to be exhaustive and fixed. This means that the CJEU left itself enough room to elucidate further and to develop this definition in favour of disability as a social construct in later cases referred to it by the national courts.</p>
<p>The next very significant and also controversial question that pertains to the interpretation of disability as a basis for discrimination is whether ‘disability’ should be defined in a symmetrical or an asymmetrical way. The <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> does not provide for any implications in this regard, although the <italic>CRPD</italic> favours the asymmetrical approach in many of its provisions. Various commentators and scholars seem to be divided on this issue (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1358229113482072">Skidmore, 2001</xref>: 131; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1358229113482072">Waddington, 2005</xref>: 115). In its first decision on the definition of disability in the <italic>Chacón Navas </italic>case, the CJEU did not touch upon this question, but it is quite obvious that a symmetrical approach is more protective of the rights of non-disabled persons. On the other hand, it is just as clear that an asymmetrical interpretation of disability in non-discrimination legislation provides better protection to persons with disabilities. Its future decisions will probably show us what approach to this issue is preferred by the CJEU.</p>
<p>The question of whether disability, as it is defined in international and EU law, can be perceived as a suspect ground for discrimination is also very relevant for defining the scope of protection against disability discrimination. Unfortunately, no answer to this question can be found so far in the case law of the CJEU and the ECtHR. However, if we take into consideration the fact that disability was included in the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic>’s list of protected discriminatory grounds, and the many legal and policy efforts made on both the international and European levels, we might arrive at the conclusion that a strong protection needs to be offered against disability discrimination and that special accommodation measures need to be provided for in order to meet the needs and aspirations of persons with disabilities. Thus, in general, disability can be regarded as a particularly suspect ground for unequal treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1358229113482072">Schiek et al., 2007</xref>: 147). It is, therefore, to be expected that the CJEU and the ECtHR will apply a relatively strict test in considering the justifiability of a distinction based on disability and that states will have at their disposal a relatively narrow margin of appreciation to decide if certain distinctions on the grounds of disability are reasonable and justifiable.</p>

<title>Defining dimensions of disability discrimination</title>
<p>In this section, I will try to work out what situations, incidents and concepts are to be seen as amounting to disability discrimination under international and EU law. The most important international legal instrument on the rights of persons with disabilities, the <italic>CRPD</italic>, defines discrimination on the grounds of disability as 
<disp-quote>
<p>any distinction, exclusion or restriction on the basis of disability which has the purpose or effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal basis with others, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field (Article 2). </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We can see that the text of this universal definition to a great extent resembles wording in similar non-discrimination provisions contained in other UN specialised human rights treaties, such as the 1965 <italic>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD)</italic> and the 1979 <italic>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)</italic>. In addition, one should note that in principle no free-standing claim can be made under Article 2 of the <italic>CRPD</italic>. As a result, its non-discrimination clause can be invoked only in conjunction with other substantive rights provided under the <italic>CRPD</italic>, as it was also pointed out by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in its first decision adopted in the frame of the individual communications procedure under the Optional Protocol to the <italic>CRPD</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1358229113482072">16</xref>
</sup> The CESCR also came up with the definition of disability-based discrimination in the context of the <italic>ICESCR</italic>. Such discrimination, in its belief, includes ‘any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference, or denial of reasonable accommodation based on disability which has the effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise of economic, social or cultural rights’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1358229113482072">17</xref>
</sup> On the other hand, positive discrimination towards persons with disabilities – in the form of appropriate and concrete measures – is necessary in order to do away with existing discrimination and to establish equitable opportunities for persons with disabilities. According to CESCR, such positive measures ‘should not be considered discriminatory in the sense of Article 2(2) of the <italic>ICESCR</italic> as long as they are based on the principle of equality and are employed only to the extent necessary to achieve that objective’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1358229113482072">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The prohibition of disability-based discrimination under Article 2 of the <italic>CRPD</italic> covers all forms and types of discrimination, including the denial of reasonable accommodation. However, unlike in the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic>, in this Article it is not specifically mentioned whether this general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability also extends to concepts such as indirect discrimination, harassment, discrimination based on imputed disability, discrimination by association, instructions to discriminate and victimisation. As far as indirect discrimination is concerned, it is not disputable that this form of discrimination is covered by the <italic>CRPD</italic>’s provisions as well. A statement in support of this view can be found in <italic>H.M. v. Sweden</italic> where the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities allowed for the possibility that a national law, though applied in a neutral way, may lead to discriminatory consequences if the particular circumstances of the individuals to whom it is applied are disregarded. Thus, in the Committee’s view, discrimination can take place even when persons who are in a significantly different situation are not treated differently by the state and there is no objective and reasonable justification for such treatment in the enjoyment of rights guaranteed under the <italic>CRPD</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1358229113482072">19</xref>
</sup> In the same vein, the CESCR took the position that
<disp-quote>
<p>both de jure and de facto discrimination against persons with disabilities takes various forms, which range from invidious discrimination, such as the denial of educational opportunities, to more ‘subtle’ forms of discrimination such as segregation and isolation achieved through the imposition of physical and social barriers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1358229113482072">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Harassment on any of the protected grounds of discrimination (including disability) is a particularly harmful and insidious type of discrimination. Therefore, it was included in the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> as a specific form of unlawful discrimination, which occurs when an ‘unwanted conduct’ related to a protected ground (in our case to disability) takes place ‘with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment’ (Article 2(3)). As in the case of the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic>, the <italic>CRPD</italic> protects persons with disabilities from harassment only in the context of work and employment (Article 27(1)(b)).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1358229113482072">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A person may be subjected to less favourable treatment, not so much because of his/her particular personal characteristic, such as a disability, but on the basis of assumptions relating to that characteristic. It might well happen, for instance, that an employer decides not to employ a certain candidate because he thinks that he is disabled or chronically ill and, therefore, unable to perform his job responsibilities and tasks to the employer’s satisfaction. A crucial question here is whether such cases of unequal treatment are also covered by non-discrimination legislation. If we take into consideration that the primary mission of provisions on the prohibition of discrimination is to protect individuals against discrimination, this question should be answered in the affirmative. From this point of view, it is completely irrelevant whether discrimination is based on a real or perceived characteristic. The <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> does not contain express references to discrimination on the grounds of perceived characteristics. Also, it cannot be derived from its content that such discrimination is excluded from its scope. Thus, bearing in mind the importance of the inclusion of discrimination by assumption and the fact that relevant international instruments seem to offer protection against such discrimination, one can conclude that individuals are also protected against discrimination based on perceived characteristics under the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic>. International support for such a broad definition of the prohibition of discrimination can be found in the case of <italic>Timishev v. Russia</italic> in which the ECtHR held that Article 14 of the <italic>ECHR</italic> prohibits not only discrimination based on one’s real or actual characteristics, but also discrimination based on perceived characteristics (in this case ethnicity),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1358229113482072">22</xref>
</sup> that is discrimination by assumption. As a result, even persons who are, for example, not really disabled can enjoy the legal protection against disability discrimination if they are regarded by others as having disabilities.</p>
<p>Another important concept is discrimination by association, which relates to the situation where someone is discriminated against not so much on account of their own characteristics but on account of their relations with someone else. An example is that of parents, who are not themselves disabled, but are refused entry to a bar because they are with their disabled child. The <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether discrimination by association is covered by its non-discrimination provisions. However, in the <italic>Coleman</italic> case, the CJEU were afforded the opportunity to consider the concept of discrimination by association and decided that unfavourable treatment of an employee by her employer, based on the fact that her son was disabled, amounted to discrimination and harassment by association.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1358229113482072">23</xref>
</sup> The employee’s requests were refused and she was threatened with dismissal while also receiving abusive comments relating to her child’s disability.</p>
<p>The <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> also regulates two phenomena which are closely related to non-discrimination law: instructions to discriminate and victimisation. Whereas instructions to discriminate against persons on any of the protected grounds (including disability) are treated as a specific form of discrimination (Article 2(4)), victimisation is only outlawed in general and does not constitute discrimination (Article 11). It can be noted that the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> provides wider protection of individuals against instructions to discriminate on the grounds of disability than other relevant international human rights instruments (e.g. <italic>ICCPR </italic>and <italic>ECHR</italic>) as it prohibits instructions to discriminate in relation to several grounds of discrimination (including disability) and not only acts of advocacy of or incitement to racial, national or religious hatred, discrimination, hostility or violence. However, the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> and other core EU non-discrimination directives do not provide a definition of what amounts to an instruction to discriminate. The opaque formulation, saying that an instruction to discriminate ‘shall be deemed to be discrimination’ without any further explanations of the concept, leaves crucial issues unresolved and for the EU Member States and the CJEU to interpret.</p>
<p>A prohibition of victimisation in the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> aims at providing protection to employees involved in a complaint of discrimination in whatever capacity (complainants; those who provide evidence or otherwise act in support of a discrimination claim; witnesses; those who provide advice, information and representation) from facing adverse consequences as a result of their involvement in that claim. If people are fearful of the adverse consequences of their involvement in a discrimination claim, then enforcement of the non-discrimination law will become impossible. Protection against victimisation is thus crucial in maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of provisions contained in the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic>. Article 11 of the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> requires the EU Member States to 
<disp-quote>
<p>introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to protect employees against dismissal or other adverse treatment by the employer as a reaction to a complaint within the undertaking or to any legal proceedings aimed at enforcing compliance with the principle of equal treatment. </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It follows from that provision that the EU Member States must take measures which are sufficiently effective to achieve the aim of this directive. This will also include an adequate legal and judicial protection against victimisation. The CJEU considered the scope of the concept of victimisation in <italic>Coote v. Granada Hospitality</italic>. In this case, the CJEU recognised the importance of providing protection from victimisation by reasoning that the prohibition on victimisation includes not only dismissal but also any other measure that ‘may effectively deter a worker from making use of the right to judicial protection’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1358229113482072">24</xref>
</sup> In addition, the CJEU emphasised in this case that the scope of protection against victimisation must be extended beyond the employment relationship and include also retaliatory measures taken by an employer in response to proceedings brought against the employer which are intended to ‘obstruct the dismissed employee’s attempts to find new employment’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1358229113482072">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the context of disability discrimination, special attention needs to be paid to the specific concept of ‘reasonable accommodation’. The obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation is a relatively new phenomenon in international and European non-discrimination law. However, the concept has quickly received global international recognition in Article 2(4) of the <italic>CRPD</italic>, which defines discrimination on the grounds of disability as including a failure to make a reasonable accommodation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1358229113482072">26</xref>
</sup> Reasonable accommodation, as defined in this provision, means 
<disp-quote>
<p>necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The issue of the reasonable accommodation is relevant also in the European context, given that the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> in its Article 5 expressly requires employers to take appropriate measures and to make reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in the fields of employment and training. Such measures may include, for instance, installing a lift or a ramp or a disabled toilet in the workplace in order to allow wheelchair access. The CJEU has only briefly referred to the obligation to provide for reasonable accommodation in <italic>Chacón Navas</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1358229113482072">27</xref>
</sup> and the concept is not expressly provided for in the <italic>ECHR</italic> or the <italic>ESC</italic>. However, according to Gerard Quinn, the ECSR on several occasions interpreted Article 15 of the revised <italic>ESC</italic> in combination with Article E to include also reasonable accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1358229113482072">Quinn, 2005</xref>: 300).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1358229113482072">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic>, unlike the <italic>CRPD</italic>, contains a reasonable accommodation requirement with regard to persons with disabilities only in the employment context. The purpose of the employment-related accommodation for people with disabilities is to equalise their opportunities in the labour market with non-disabled employees and job applicants. Although Article 5 of the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> clearly locates the obligation to make a reasonable accommodation within the paradigm of equal treatment, as this can be seen from the text ‘in order to guarantee compliance with the principle of equal treatment’, it does not explicitly define a failure to comply with the duty as a (specific) form of discrimination. Given the briefness of this article, and the scarcity of the CJEU’s case law regarding the interpretation of the concept, there remains plenty of room for further elaboration on the extent of the duty to accommodate, as well as for a wide-ranging and authoritative interpretation of key terms within this provision.</p>
<p>When transposing the <italic>Employment Equality Directive</italic> into their domestic legislations, a vast majority of the EU Member States did not go beyond the minimal requirements of the directive, for example by extending the obligation to provide reasonable accommodation to people with disabilities also outside the employment context. Nonetheless, a limited number of Member States did adopt legal measures requiring reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities who wished to access certain facilities such as goods, services and education.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This analytical review of international and EU law on the prohibition of disability discrimination reveals that an overwhelming advancement in the field has been made over the last two decades through the adoption or amendments of relevant international and European legal instruments on human rights and non-discrimination as well as through case law and scholarship related to these instruments. Various concepts of discrimination on the grounds of disability have been extensively elaborated and elucidated. Thus, it is possible to conclude that international, and especially modern EU, non-discrimination law establishes a wide and inclusive legal framework for dealing with disability discrimination, which can take different forms in societies, ranging from direct and indirect disability discrimination and harassment to instructions to discriminate, victimisation and, last but not least, denial of reasonable accommodation. Also, the concept of ‘disability’ in the context of non-discrimination law has been interpreted broadly in order to cover cases of discrimination based on perceived disability as well as incidents of discrimination due to association with a disabled person.</p>
<p>The EU Member States and other European countries are, under international and EU law, required to develop, adopt and implement comprehensive non-discrimination legislation in relation to disability in order to eliminate all forms of disability discrimination. Such legislation should not only provide persons with disabilities with judicial remedies but also provide for social policy programmes, which enable persons with disabilities to live integrated, self-determined and independent lives. Disability policies should ensure the access of persons with disabilities to all community services. Therefore, anti-discrimination measures should be based on the principle of equal rights and equal opportunities for persons with disabilities and the non-disabled. Indeed, the actual scope of the realisation of international and European legal standards on disability discrimination in each state will depend on the consistency and effectiveness of their national implementation and on the manner of putting them into practice.</p>
