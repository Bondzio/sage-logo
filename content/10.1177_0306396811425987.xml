<abstract>
<p>In April 2011, in the inner-city Stokes Croft area of Bristol, a riot broke out triggered by the heavy-handed policing of a sustained campaign opposed to the building of a Tesco store in the area. Stokes Croft is adjacent to the St Paul’s area where, thirty-one years ago, the first of the 1980s series of riots, across cities throughout Britain, took place. This piece examines the underlying background to the ‘Tesco riots’, including increasing gentrification, lack of housing and rising levels of inequality; the mixed and multicultural nature of the local population; and the inordinate power and control wielded by a giant corporation like Tesco. Was the Tesco riot a harbinger of a growing, subterranean mood of resistance? Was it one aspect of a new social movement?</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In this country, you need to know, nothing’s cheap innit. We all live off money. Everything that goes around in this world, it’s surrounded by money.</p>
<p>All the time, I feel like I’m not being noticed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306396811425987">1</xref></sup></p>

</p>
<p>The August 2011 riots that tore across a swathe of English cities have dramatically exposed how the dispossessed of all ages can take to the streets and powerfully challenge the rule of governments and corporations. They point to a degree of popular disenchantment and alienation from the rules of our civil society. In that sense, they show a society that is broken, where its rulers have broken their ‘social contract’ to include all its members and have treated the poorest sections of our cities with the greatest degree of contempt and disrespect. This was symbolised by the police shooting of Mark Duggan in Tottenham, London, but is also manifest in so many other inequalities now coming to the fore. This article deals with these issues by looking at one, relatively small, example: the Easter ‘Tesco riots’ in Bristol. These were the first in mainland Britain since 2001 – the first swallow of the eventful summer to come. 2011 witnessed a new social movement arising in English cities: areas where the centre of the city is surrounded by ‘zones in transition’ or inner cities. While, in US cities, these are often ‘new black ghettos’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306396811425987">2</xref></sup> in Europe they are multicultural territories. In Britain, the heritage of slavery and empire also figures in how these areas have evolved, for example, in the 1980s inner-city riots, which themselves began in St Paul’s, Bristol, the area adjacent to the scene of the April 2011 riots in Stokes Croft.</p>
<p>The riot initially occurred on 21 April 2011 as a result of police opposition to an ongoing campaign against Tesco opening a store in the area. The common interest of the police and the corporation in shutting down any sites of protest has bred a series of street actions involving several hundred local people resisting police raids, arrests and road closures – perceived as a violent act against the whole area of the inner city. In some ways, this movement is one of self-defence, emerging from the need to preserve the ‘habitus’, the ‘lifeworld’ of the community. However, in resistance, different groups within the multicultural reality of the inner city have also discovered a shared interest, a unity that pulls together different fragments of the expanding inner-city population: students, squatters, local youth and others.</p>
<p>By examining what were the underlying causes of the riot, besides the more immediate triggers of the determination of the Tesco corporation to build its store and the inordinate attack launched by 160 riot police on one squat, I highlight how the rising rate of gentrification of sections of the neighbourhood, alongside ever-more precarious patterns of employment available for existing residents, are generating increasing inequalities of income, education and lifestyle. Can the state of advanced marginality of this ‘under-pressure’ population continue without further outbursts?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0306396811425987">
<title>The city in history</title>
<p>Every city’s culture reflects its history. Bristol’s urban development bears the scars of slavery and has been constantly reconfigured through migration, trade, slavery and industrialisation:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306396811425987">3</xref></sup> cycles of frenetic expansion and equally dramatic decline. The contours of its inner city represent all of these factors and the social reactions to them. The mini-precinct of Stokes Croft sits immediately to the north of ‘downtown’ Bristol. It begins at the central roundabout, a hub of hotels, flats and student halls, and snakes up the A38 Cheltenham Road for around half a mile. It is flanked to the west by a steep hill, upon which sits the solidly wealthy district of Kingsdown, while to the east stretch the neighbouring inner-city districts of Montpelier and St Paul’s. Stokes Croft is really just a subsection of St Paul’s, the historic home of Bristol’s West Indian community and the scene, in April of that year, of the first of Britain’s 1980s series of riots.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306396811425987">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The St Paul’s riot is part of the folklore of the city. It began with a massive police raid on a black-owned café (an attempt, it was said, to preserve ‘law and order’ by attacking a local business), in contrast to today’s flashpoint, where police were ‘defending’ a business from the threat of the local residents. The way in which dozens of officers in riot gear piled into the Black and White Café in April 1980 displayed a shocking degree of institutionalised racism, provoking a civilised, but defiant exercise of their civil rights by the local population. This successful defence of the community was condemned and labelled as a riot by the press, the police and the government, but, in the long term, the British inner-city riots of the 1980s finally brought all the issues of racism in schooling, housing and the labour market out into the open. They were, essentially, a blow for multiculturalism. They were infectious too. Local historian Roger Ball has plotted how those youth ‘riding the storm’ in St Paul’s were bussed up to school on a north Bristol council estate, whose residents precipitated their own riot the following night!<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306396811425987">5</xref></sup> The Black and White Café’s location on Grosvenor Road is within a few hundred metres of the Stokes Croft Tesco. It remained open for around twenty years after the riots, but was then compulsorily purchased by the local authority and ‘regenerated’ into housing, alongside a new learning centre and additional shop units constructed over the last decade.</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare these two provincial city riots, which occurred in the same location, but are separated by thirty-one years. They reflect some of the changes in the composition and density of the population. The St Paul’s of the 1970s was a ghettoised area where African Caribbean and white residents lived side by side, mostly in the tenement blocks and terraces. Some were already losing their employment as city industry relocated, and the informal industry of shebeens, drugs and vice provided an alternative labour market for some. Youth unemployment was rising rapidly, as neoliberalism’s first wave of restructuring was undermining the resilience of what Thatcher disparagingly referred to as ‘those inner cities’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306396811425987">6</xref></sup> St Paul’s was ghettoised at the time in the sense that a dominant white British culture looked down upon it, and institutions discriminated in racist fashion in schools, housing and policing. The 1980 riot, and those in thirteen other UK cities the following year, represented a resounding challenge to this state of affairs and displayed an anti-racist, multicultural reality, both in their composition and impact over the next thirty years.</p>
<p>In 2011, the areas surrounding St Paul’s have been regenerated with shopping malls, new apartment blocks and some social housing, leading to a substantially denser pattern of population. This has been accompanied by a ‘magical urbanism’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306396811425987">7</xref></sup> the regeneration of its squats and art spaces, which mirrors the ways in which areas like Brixton and Dalston in London have evolved from their 1980s counterparts. But, while everyday life tends to emphasise the cultural contrasts between these different segments of the inner-city population (e.g. the ‘locals’ and the ‘artists’), the two nights of riot and resistance in Stokes Croft seemed to bring them together.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0306396811425987">
<title>The process of urban compaction</title>
<p>Although much of the new housing in St Paul’s qualifies as social housing, the whole area has also seen substantial commercial development. In neighbouring Montpelier, the wealthier and whiter district, a new complex of commercial flats has been created at the northern end of Cheltenham Road – probably generating the potential demand that encouraged Tesco to set up its store in the first place. Tesco already has another store built into the new student halls that sit at the base of the downtown roundabout linking the A38 and the incoming M32 motorway. Alongside them, old council offices have been converted into hotels and another residential ‘buy to let’ property development. As the footprint of this inner-city square mile becomes more densely populated, it places greater stress upon those relatively poor and increasingly marginalised residents needing more space for themselves and their families, even as rising property values result in the incoming population often out-ranking them in terms of employment, status and spending power. The new social housing units in St Paul’s don’t come anywhere near to meeting the real level of housing need. The insistence on property as a vehicle for investment and profit by Bristol’s partnerships between business and local government has bred an anti-social disequilibrium in the housing market.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306396811425987">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This lack of housing is especially marked in Stokes Croft itself, and matched by illegally available housing in the form of potential squats. The result has been a predictable explosion of informally occupied property. This has developed alongside a number of shop fronts being leased by enterprises with a cultural/artistic feel, breeding a ‘creative’ ambience in the area’s galleries and cafés, pubs and nightclubs. Graffiti by Bristol’s cultural icon Banksy first appeared in Stokes Croft over a decade ago, when the area was still rundown and no superstore was even contemplating locating there. As his fame has grown, this style of graffiti art has blossomed over a range of urban spaces, becoming an artistic signature for the reviving area. With the arrival of more squatters and artists, the area has become fashionable: the art of Banksy has become commodified as Stokes Croft has become more popular with students and young workers who live, work or travel through there. Because of its counter-cultural ‘scene’, the presence of Tesco and its multinational ilk was certainly not welcome among a wide range of local citizens and traders. The campaign against the store began with a lobby of the council’s planning meeting by over 300 people, mostly young, in summer 2010. Squats have since grown over the winter, adding to the mood of autonomy and anti-authoritarianism; after all, the ‘do it yourself’ regeneration process has bred the turnaround from a semi-derelict area to a thriving ‘alternative’ zone. No wonder so many saw Tesco’s insistence on planting itself there as an unwelcome incursion by those commercial forces that had left the area to run down for so long.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, Bristol City Council had created a ‘one-stop-shop’ for housing, called the Hub, in Stokes Croft, where the homeless could drop in to access its services. By 2009, the council decided that this approach was sucking in too much demand and planned to close it down, locating it to another area with an appointment-only system. Once the Hub closed in autumn 2010, it was promptly squatted, a skull and crossbones was flown from its roof, and enthusiastic activists dispensed alternative ‘housing advice’, promoting self-help in the form of direct action. The squatters were dislodged by a military-style police raid, despite some resistance, in January 2011 – a harbinger of events to come. The squats have become both a necessary and a counter-cultural action that challenges the right of corporations and landlords to control increasing aspects of city living. The ‘People’s Republic of Stokes Croft’ has been declared on mock road signs on its borders, while the forest of cafés, bars, art spaces and meeting places demonstrates that another less commercial and more sustainable inner city is possible – only possible, however, by avoiding the attentions of vested interests intent on what David Harvey terms ‘flexible accumulation through urbanization’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306396811425987">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Engrossing corporations</title>
<p>Tesco is a huge multinational corporation. As the UK’s biggest supermarket, it leads the exploits of the corporation’s overwhelmingly dominant monopoly of the commissioning and distribution of commodities. Its reach and wealth are often resented in a situation where, increasingly, the threat of public austerity sits alongside growing mountains of corporate wealth. Britain’s banks and supermarkets are mirrors of one another: controlling each of their respective so-called free markets, demonstrating how a few huge institutions monopolise business and exploit their customers.</p>
<p>The supermarkets are a form of partner corporation to the banks. Even more concentrated than the ‘big four’ banks, the profits of market leader Tesco rank with the oil corporations in size and scale. The density of their market penetration means that a significant proportion of the wages of the whole population flows directly into their coffers – again, processed by the banks via debit cards, so the worker/consumer doesn’t even get to handle the fruits of his/her labour, just to exchange it for so much food, clothing and petrol. No wonder so many feel like the ‘squeezed middle’ or members of a marginalised ‘underclass’.</p>
<p>As this process illustrates, the twenty-first century has seen a dramatic expansion in the power and reach – in depth as well as breadth – of those corporations that manage so many aspects of everyday life. Since the 2008 financial crash, the switch from credit provision to debt recovery has meant a clamour for more and more of our wages to be claimed as payment for goods and services, undermining sustainable living. In the process, governments and corporations are forfeiting the environment of conformist consumption, the bubble they blew up to fuel the Blairite boom. But, while contemporary urban development refuses to meet social needs, it prioritises the commercial exploitation of space, particularly by the ‘big players’ of property and retail development. According to protesters, Tesco is Bristol’s biggest supermarket chain, and the Stokes Croft outlet will bring its total number of stores in the city up to thirty-one. When you add in the proliferation of Sainsbury’s and other rivals, there are over sixty supermarkets in Bristol. The number of outlets has more than doubled in the last decade, in line with national trends. The room for other local retailers is thus squeezed, and the urban lifeworld becomes increasingly homogenised. Having begun by attracting consumers away from their local shops in the 1980s and 1990s through price-cutting at out-of-town stores, UK supermarkets have gone on to reconquer the high streets and suburbs, as they return and undercut independent rivals. By loss-leading on core convenience items, the vitality of local custom is sucked into the coffers of the multinationals, which become ever more bloated and monopolistic.</p>
<p>The remorseless advance of the supermarkets is occasionally checked, as when Sainsbury’s’ plans for a store in suburban Westbury-on-Trym were checked in 2005. When a Morrison’s store opened in 2008 in Bristol’s deprived Hartcliffe ward, it was largely welcomed by locals, as it replaced empty stores, rather than existing rivals, and could therefore claim to be part of the area’s regeneration. The attitude of many inner-city residents in Stokes Croft was the reverse, seeing the arrival of Tesco as an unwelcome corporate incursion upon the developing ‘alternative’ street scene.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0306396811425987">
<title>Riding the storm</title>
<p>By the time Tesco opened its doors in April 2011, campaigners had spent several months conducting low-level resistance. Leaflets were distributed, signatures collected and several supporters gathered in ‘Telepathic Heights’, a garishly graffitied squat just across the road from the site, which acted as a visible, and audible, testament to their ongoing opposition. Activists believe that Tesco’s management were infuriated by this continuing dissent and disruption and may well have encouraged the police to take action. This was the scene, then, on Thursday 21 April 2011. A whole range of factors were coming together to energise a lively campaign against the right of the UK’s largest retailer to monopolise trade, a corporation that had just announced a profit of £3.2 billion for the first three months of 2011 alone. But still, in all likelihood, these factors would not have been sufficient to provoke the direct action that exploded onto the streets that night, would not have led to the ‘Tesco riot’, without the vital ingredient: a seriously disproportionate and provocative police action. One hundred and sixty officers from the Avon and Somerset, Wiltshire and South Wales forces cordoned off the upper half of Stokes Croft, closing off access to this major trunk road for several hours and drawing many bystanders and commuters into the situation. Having ‘secured the area’, the police then moved in to clear the squat, but they had failed to anticipate the response of residents.</p>
<p>Dozens of bystanders began to resist by using street furniture and anything to hand to hurl at the police and block off their advance. Rather than using their recent practice of ‘kettling’ (encircling) people, the police tactics meant that they themselves became kettled and were unable to resist the incursions of protesters at either end of the A38 cordon. Police charged back and forth, and protesters resisted and reoccupied the squat over several hours. By now, the mood was certainly riotous; a serious bout of disorder had been shaken into being by provocative policing on behalf of a giant corporation against the local community.</p>
<p>Tesco’s was now thoroughly looted. Symbolic anti-capitalist protesters were joined by local youth keen to join the resistance (and make some gains in the process – all the store’s cigarettes disappeared). This action was repeated one week later, the night before the royal wedding. This time, the police were massed to make a series of arrests related to the events of the week before. The effectiveness of the first riot had sparked a lot more interest from local youth, who were keen to participate in a powerful expression of their ‘right to the streets’. The focus had moved beyond merely Tesco by this point, with marchers setting off to find a suitable multinational target in the nearby city centre, thus keeping the police occupied in tracking them. The composition of the group of several hundred people had now become more multicultural, more representative of St Paul’s in general, where there are fewer squats, but, rather, a well-established community experiencing rising unemployment and insecurity.</p>
<p>So what can we expect to find when exploring the ecology of a typical UK city? In rightly rejecting the too-readily ascribed notion of its poor neighbourhoods as ghettos, mired in the culture of poverty that breeds vice, crime and violence, we must not overlook the parallels with America that still obtain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306396811425987">10</xref></sup> As Wilkinson has shown in <italic>The Spirit Level</italic>, examining inequality among populations in the twenty-one richest countries, the UK is closer to the US on various indices of poverty, stress, educational underachievement and obesity than are more economically equal states in Europe, reminding us of the realities of elements of marginalisation, insecurity, class and race discrimination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306396811425987">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Bristol Tesco riots are an example of how those most fearful for their future can find themselves confronting the plans of the rich and their corporations as they ratchet up their exploitative practices. In the ‘new poverty’ of the twenty-first century’s second decade, many people’s ‘consumer consciousness’ – their methodological individualism – is in the process of being modified: as prices rise and credit withers, it is pared back by the spectre of debt, poverty and insecurity. Collective action can become a force for change, and riots can be the start of a process that needs to go further. In the words of Tony Cliff in the wake of the 1981 Toxteth riots: ‘We must teach [the kids] to take the bakery, not just the bread.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306396811425987">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Stokes Croft riots were a small-scale evocation of the power of social movements to create a social explosion. Whether this heralds a further storm or rises like a rocket only to drop like a stick is a question for the future, but those who wrote off Bristol’s 1980 riot as the exception to the rule were thoroughly confounded by events, when it presaged the long hot summer of 1981, with similar ‘uprisings’ spread across British cities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306396811425987">13</xref></sup> As the August 2011 riots erupt, I’m reminded of Kenneth Clark’s description of the rioters in New York’s Harlem in 1964, who ‘[s]eemed deliberately to be prodding the police to behave openly as the barbarians that they felt they actually were … Paradoxically, [their] apparent lawlessness was a protest against lawlessness directed against [them].’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306396811425987">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The degree of disrespect and stigmatisation dealt out to the poorest sections of the population is most unbearable to the youth. Those who have not yet been worn down by decades of living hand to mouth are those with the greatest willingness to take to the streets. Whenever riots occur, we are told that the mob has returned. Thomas Carlyle’s description of their role in the French Revolution aptly describes the phenomenon in the twenty-first century: ‘Your mob is a genuine outburst of Nature … The thing they will do is known to no man; least of all to themselves. It is the inflammablest immeasurable Firework, generating, consuming itself.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306396811425987">15</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Back in the early 1980s, many commentators concluded (in the words of Eric Hobsbawm) that we were witnessing ‘the forward march of labour halted’ and speculated that anti-racist riots were a sign of how new social movements based on the streets were replacing the traditional labour movement monolith. These campaigns, clustered around ‘single issues’ – race, gender, nuclear power, animal rights and the like – tended to see their issue as standing apart from the others. Rather than unity across the oppressed and exploited, this fragmented the widespread opposition to neoliberalism’s steady erosion of welfare and social democracy. Feminists, anti-racists, anarchists and socialists often disagreed, among themselves and with one another, about who were their real enemies and how to advance their cause.</p>
<p>Thirty years on, there is a new unity in action emerging, encouraged no doubt by the spirit of the revolutionary year of 2011. The message of Tahrir Square has crept beyond the Arab world and into the fight against austerity from Spain to Wisconsin. Of course, all these events are occurring in a world where the shadow of austerity looms. At the time of writing, the June 2011 Greek general strikes represent the firmest European blows yet struck against the ramparts of the banks, corporations and neoliberal governments. The UK’s protests may have been relatively small so far, but the mass of the population face the same looming threat to the fabric of welfare and employment security. Reclaiming public streets and squares and protesting through strikes and occupations are increasingly seen as viable means to confront private power and defend public space and services. Thus it was, in April 2011, that squatters, local youth, besieged residents, students and many others found themselves ‘hurled forth, in their transcendental mood’, onto the streets of Stokes Croft, ‘to act and react, on circumstances and on one another’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306396811425987">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>These events do not occur in a vacuum. The dramatic spectacles of student rioters attacking Prince Charles’ and Camilla’s Rolls Royce in December 2010, and ransacking the government’s Millbank headquarters the month before, have bred a defiant new anti-authoritarianism. In the month before the Easter riot, over 2,000 people from Bristol were bussed up to London by the trade unions to join a demonstration of over half a million people against public sector cuts. This was the UK’s biggest ever trade union protest, itself testament to the new mood. Students, workers and the unemployed are seeing their education, their jobs and services threatened by an austerity that is already breaking down the welfare state across Europe. This resurgence of mass struggle was reflected in the 5,000 who marched in Bristol as part of the pension strikes of 30 June 2011. What was begun by students and other rioters is starting to reach across significant sections of the working-class majority. Andy Mather’s conclusion regarding the powers of those ‘struggling for a social Europe’ in 2007 seems even more true today:</p>

<p>[T]he recent round of resistance has demonstrated a determined defence of previous social gains and has led to mobilization on new fronts and alongside new forces so as to suggest the formation of a new strategic identity for labour at the heart of an anti- capitalist social movement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306396811425987">17</xref></sup></p>
