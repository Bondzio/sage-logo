<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For the practicing pediatrician the challenge is to recognize serious bacterial illness (SBI) in the febrile child with an evolving disease state. Clinical practice guidelines use a combination of age, clinical state, and laboratory findings to provide guidance on the need for observation and expectant therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813483873">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813483873">2</xref></sup> The prevalence of serious bacterial infection in febrile infants in the developed world is reported to be 7% to 8%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813483873">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Procalcitonin (PCT) is a glycoprotein and is undetectable in normal subjects. Levels rise rapidly during infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813483873">4</xref></sup> Studies show it discriminates the presence of bacterial infection in hospitalized children, particularly in intensive care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813483873">5</xref></sup> PCT has also been studied in the emergency department (ED) with promising results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813483873">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813483873"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813483873">8</xref></sup> However, the prevalence of bacterial illness in these studies was 18% to 28%, higher than the 7% to 8% quoted in epidemiological studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813483873">3</xref></sup> Prevalence was also affected by the definition of bacterial illness between studies. Disease prevalence significantly affects the utility of a diagnostic test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813483873">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Acute Infantile Observation Score (AIOS) has been used to assess toxicity status in febrile children. A score of &gt;10 is significantly associated with bacterial illness in infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813483873">10</xref></sup> The AIOS functioned well in a prospective cohort of Indian children where the prevalence of bacteremia was 40%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813483873">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section2-0009922813483873">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>This study assessed the utility of serum PCT and the AIOS as markers of significant evolving illness and confirmed bacterial infection in febrile infants 6 to 36 months old presenting to pediatric ED of a medium-sized general hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0009922813483873" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Infants aged 6 to 36 months with a confirmed axillary temperature of &gt;38.1°C who presented to the ED between the hours of 8.00 <sc>am</sc> and 12.00 midnight were considered for enrollment. Exclusion criteria were underlying chronic illness, vaccination within 2 days or antipyretic use within 2 hours. The investigator obtained consent and an AIOS score in triage. The AIOS score was sealed in an envelope and not available to the treating physicians. After enrollment, infants were assessed by the pediatric senior house officer on call who decided on the need for laboratory investigation. Routine laboratory investigation in this situation includes blood culture, urinalysis, white cell count (WCC), urea and electrolytes, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Serum PCT was added to these samples on enrolled patients.</p>
<p>Procalcitonin samples were frozen for 4 hours postphlebotomy as recommended by BRAHMS Diagnostica. Procalcitonin values were measured in duplicate using the LUMItest quantitative PCT; a “sandwich” assay type luminescence immunoassay involving 2 monocloncal antibodies that are directed against the C-terminal and mid-region catacalcin sequence. Bound anti-catacalcin antibody is then labeled using a luminescent acridine derivative. Results were not available to treating physicians. CRP levels were obtained by the immunoturbidimetric assay involving an anti-CRP–coated latex, measured at 540 nm.</p>
<p>In the context of twice daily consultant-led active discharge ward rounds, length of stay (LOS) was taken as the gold standard to indicate illness severity, which was classified as mild (&lt;24 hours), moderate (24-96 hours), and severe (&gt;96 hours).</p>
<p>Serious bacterial illness refers to sepsis, meningitis, urinary tract infection, and bone or soft tissue infection with confirmatory positive culture as appropriate. Community-acquired pneumonia was defined as fever plus consolidation on chest x-ray diagnosed by a consultant radiologist. Infants were assessed daily for evidence of bone or soft tissue infection. The diagnostic utility of tests were calculated at the following cut offs; An AIOS of greater than 10, CRP &gt;20 mg/L, serum PCT &gt;1.0 ng/mL, and a total white cell count &lt;5000 or &gt;15 000. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios of a positive and negative test (LR+/LR−) were calculated. Approval for the study was granted by the hospital ethics committee.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Forty-six patients were included in the study. The mean age was 18.8 months. The male to female ratio was 1:1. Twenty-five (54.3%) represented a secondary selection having been initially assessed by a general practitioner. There were 11 cases of bacterial illness, 7 of which met the criteria for serious bacterial infection and 4 with a diagnosis of streptococcal phayngitis. The remaining 35 (76%) infants were diagnosed with a viral syndrome. There was no case of fever due to noninfective systemic causes. There were positive cultures: <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> from urine culture and group B Streptococcus from blood. There were 5 cases of community-acquired pneumonia.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight infants were classified as moderately ill based on LOS. Four of these infants had SBI (1 urinary tract infection and 3 pneumonia) and 3 others were diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis. Twenty-one infants (75%) were diagnosed with a viral syndrome of who 13 received antibiotics.</p>
<p>Twelve infants (26%) were classified as severely ill; 3 had SBI and 1 had streptococcal pharyngitis leaving 6 infants diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Eight (66%) of the children in this group were treated with antibiotics. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813483873">Table 1</xref> reports the relative diagnostic utility of routine and study tests for infants admitted &gt;24 hours and for those with diagnosed SBI.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reports the utility of PCT and the AIOS in modifying diagnostic uncertainty during the assessment of febrile infants in the ED. The enrolment process occurred in tandem with the real time assessment of infants providing a field test of these diagnostics. The setting is relevant to the majority of general pediatricians making the results highly generalizable.</p>
<p>For pediatricians assessing febrile infants with no discernible focus of disease there are 2 important considerations: Could this represent the onset of serious bacterial illness and will this child manage without supportive inpatient care? None of the diagnostic tests in this study functioned with sufficient discriminatory power to answer these questions. The CRP had an LR+ of 5.3 for the detection of SBI; this test is clinically relevant. Abnormal WCC and AIOS had LR+ of less than 2 and as such would be unlikely to influence the clinical decision making. The utility of the AIOS may be affected by interrater reliability. Serum PCT performed poorly with an LR+ of 0.43 and as such we would not advocate the introduction of this diagnostic test in similar settings.</p>
<p>With the exception of CRP, these diagnostics performed poorly when compared with previous studies conducted in the ED setting with the same age range and identical exclusion criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813483873">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813483873"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813483873">8</xref></sup> Comparison with these studies is complicated by several factors. The prevalence of diagnosed SBI was high in these studies (18% vs 28%). Prevalence was directly affected by the definition of SBI employed by the authors. They were conducted in tertiary referral centers of major cities and no information is provided on primary care presentation and selection.</p>
<p>The prevalence of serious bacterial illness in pediatric patients in the developed world in the era of extended vaccination coverage is estimated at 7.2%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813483873">3</xref></sup> There were 7 cases of SBI in this population (15.2%). This represents a secondary selection of infants and is not indicative of the local population prevalence. Definitive diagnosis of SBI presents a challenge in infants. Five cases of SBI in this analysis were community-acquired pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed using a standardized definition of fever with consolidation. There are documented limitations to this approach, which aimed to exclude viral pneumonia with infiltrates on x-ray from the analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813483873">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813483873">13</xref></sup> In all, 35 infants (76%) were diagnosed with a viral syndrome. These demographics outline the changing face of ED pediatrics with increased vaccination coverage. Of 40 infants admitted for &gt;24 hours, there were 7 cases of serious bacterial illness, 5 cases of streptoccoal pharyngitis, and 29 cases of viral syndromes requiring supportive therapy as an inpatient (intravenous hydration, supplemental oxygen). Admission of the remaining 6 infants with LOS less than 24 hours might have been prevented with an adequate observational facility. The diagnostics studied here showed poor discriminatory power in identifying infants who required admission.</p>
<p>This study has limitations related to small sample size and the lack of information on time from symptom onset and which may affect biomarker peaks. There were 2 main outcome measures. SBI included positive culture and a standardized definition that aimed to exclude viral pneumonias from the analysis; however, the absolute number of bacterial pneumonias cannot be confirmed. We chose LOS as a surrogate marker of illness severity in the context of a consultant-led discharge policy. This may not be generalizable and refers to the need for ongoing inpatient care as distinct from bacterial illness. No children discharged were subsequently readmitted. Bias was actively eliminated by choosing a gold standard remote from the diagnostics being studied and by blinding discharging physicians to the AIOS and PCT results.</p>
<p>Pediatric admissions for the febrile state are increasingly related to nonbacterial etiologies. Our study suggests that where there is a low prevalence of SBI, PCT is not helpful as a diagnostic tool. The AIOS may have a role in teaching pediatric trainees in the assessment of toxicity in children. It is not, however, a discriminatory tool in the diagnosis of bacterial illness. Enhanced awareness of the clinical presentation of specific viral syndromes will aid diagnosis and may affect admission patterns in this setting.</p>
