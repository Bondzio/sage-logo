<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783i"><title>Craig Brandist and Katya Chown, eds, <italic>Politics and the Theory of Language in the USSR 1917–1938: The Birth of Sociological Linguistics</italic>, Anthem Press: London, 2010; vi + 199 pp.; 9781843318408, £60.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>This succinct volume of articles straddles the interdisciplinary divide between history, political science, linguistics and literary studies; its contributors are, appropriately, linguists, a student of culture, an ethnologist, a philologist, and historians from Britain, Finland, Russia, Switzerland and the United States. Though the scholarly fruits of interdisciplinarity have been praised during recent decades, relatively few researchers dare transgress the boundaries of their specialty, as it may entail tacit ostracism and difficulties when applying for university jobs. But the character of the modern social world is irredeemably interdisciplinary, and a mono-disciplinarian take on a social or historical phenomenon often obfuscates or leaves out as much as it explains (7). An exemplary case of such an interdisciplinary phenomenon is the emergence of the Soviet Union in the interwar period. The genocidal Bolshevik regime set about transforming the entire existing social reality into a new communist one, leaving untouched very few elements or aspects of life from imperial Russia. And even those which did persist (such as the army, the universities or money) were radically altered in their substance and practices.</p>
<p>The focus of the book under review is on one such element, namely language. Uncharacteristically for Stalin, he conceded that the single element of social reality he could not engineer to his liking was language (118). (This surprises the reader since Atatürk, who borrowed his methods of linguistic engineering from the Soviets, successfully transformed the Ottomans’ official language of Ottoman Turkish into the radically different Turkish of today.) But the Bolsheviks tried to and, indeed, did destroy languages and they created new ones across the Soviet Union in the course of <italic>korenizatsiia</italic> (‘nativization’, meaning the bolstering or even the creation of ethnolinguistically defined nations) during the 1920s and 1930s. Throughout the linguistic conflagration that this caused, the Russian language remained a relative constant, needed as an instrument of unambiguous communication for the bureaucracy-intensive regime.</p>
<p>The volume’s authors scrutinize the linguists, historians and politicians behind the Soviet brand of sociolinguistic engineering, its methods, goals and Western European origins (14). Soviet thought took, for example, much from the ideas of Francis Galton, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Antoine Miellet, Ferdinand de Saussure, and William Stern; the last’s concept of ‘psychotechnics’ lent Soviet psychology and psychiatry a decisively nasty turn.</p>
<p>The book is an important corrective on many counts. First, it acknowledges the validity and applicability of Soviet linguistic thought and research, even though Western scholars still tend to disparage it as hopelessly ideologized (10); but, one must ask, what language politics pursued by a state is not ideologized? Second, Nikolai Marr’s official Marxist linguistics (90–92) and Stalin’s 1950 essay on linguistics (117) were ridiculed in the West, but, seen in the context of the times, the volume uncovers salient insights in both of them. Third, the contributors bring to light, among others, Rozaliia Shor, a forgotten precursor of sociolinguistics (40); Evgenii Polianov, a forerunner of historical sociolinguistics (45); Boris Larin who developed urban sociolinguistics half a century before William Labov’s research on New Yorkers’ speech (60–67); and Mikołaj Kruszewski and Jan Baudouin de Courteney who developed many linguistic concepts earlier than in the West, and also laid the foundations of Russian linguistics from which its Soviet successor sprang (17). Fourth, the popularity of Bakhtin and Vygotskii that began in the West in the 1980s with translations of their works seems to be accidental. They were brilliant Soviet scholars in their specialties, but not the most brilliant. Bakhtin and Vygotskii were not as original as is usually maintained; they drew many of their crucial concepts from others (69). That this conclusion should be coming from Craig Brandist, former Director of the Bakhtin Center at the University of Sheffield, indicates the coming of age of this field of studies. It opens a new vista for future research that will take into account the entire milieu of the interwar Soviet theoreticians and implementers of linguistic and social engineering. Sadly, but not atypically, many of them perished, through being either executed or exiled to the Gulag in the late 1930s purges. There was no clear logic to their deaths; their fate was shared equally by adversaries identified with either bourgeois or Marxist linguistics (89–90, 103). Contingency played the biggest role in the process, as after 1932, once ideological dogmas had become established and entrenched, no innovative tinkering with linguistics was looked upon favourably (12).</p>
<p>Minor deficits of the volume lie in the inconsistent transliteration of personal names: both the Russian spelling (V. Doroshevskii) and the Latin script version (W. Doroszewski) are used (181–183, 185, 189). The thoughtful glossary of names offers potted biographies of the members of the milieu of interwar Soviet linguistics and politics (from which, inexplicably, Roman Jakobson is missing). Apart from the index of names, a subject index would have been most helpful, because the book’s subject matter is so rich in concepts, disputes and arcane terms. It is to be hoped that other scholars will take up from, and expand on, where the book stops, in order to analyse the interface of linguistics and politics in the later Soviet Union, as well as the export of the practices and customs of Soviet linguistics to the Soviet bloc countries after World War II.</p>
