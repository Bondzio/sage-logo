<abstract>
<p>This article describes private-sector evaluation in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) from the beginning of the institution in 1991 until the end of 2010. It shows the way of undertaking ex-post project evaluation that was adopted by the EBRD’s Board during that period, against the background of a region that experienced severe ups and downs as a result of different financial crises. It describes how the EBRD’s theory-based evaluation system, anchored in a comprehensive evaluation policy, evolved over time, being reviewed and amended approximately every five years. At the heart of this evolving system was a progressively more independent evaluation function that followed the good practice standards of the Evaluation Cooperation Group (ECG), the working group for cooperation among multilateral development bank (MDB) evaluators. The article pictures the dual objective of evaluation through concentrating on generating lessons and being a Board accountability tool. It poses the question, ‘who evaluates the evaluators?’ and shows the importance of applying an established ECG peer-review system of evaluation functions in MDBs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article documents how evaluation evolved in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) until the end of 2010 against the background of a region that experienced severe ups and downs as a result of different financial crises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1356389012472267">1</xref></sup> The EBRD was established in 1991 in London,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1356389012472267">2</xref></sup> to help move the former communist countries towards fully functioning market economies. The institution mirrored regional multilateral development banks (MDBs).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1356389012472267">3</xref></sup> It had, like these MDBs, shareholders from the regions in which it would be working (Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asian countries, and the Russian Federation) and from most of the OECD countries. Since being established, the EBRD has become a mature development finance institution fully equipped to foster private-sector development in all its countries of operation. Recently, Turkey and some Middle Eastern and Northern African countries have been added as countries of operation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1356389012472267">4</xref></sup> By the end of 2010 its balance sheet total had reached €39.3 billion and, although some financing was directed at the public sector, at least 85 per cent of its operations was with private-sector partners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1356389012472267">5</xref></sup> Business volume in 2010 amounted to an investment total of €9 billion.</p>
<p>In one important aspect, the EBRD differs from the other regional development banks. The EBRD, according to its Articles of Establishment, must concentrate its activities on development of the private sector, including the privatization of state-owned companies.</p>
<p>To assess the institution’s operations and to help the Executive Board in its accountability function towards its shareholders and the general public, the founding fathers of the EBRD created an evaluation function right from the start of operational activities. It reported to Management via a separate Vice President for Evaluation. By 2010 the Evaluation Department had completed close to 450 project evaluations, carried out more than 40 special studies, created over 3000 lessons learned and comprised 17 staff positions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1356389012472267">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The story told here does not present the only way in which private-sector evaluation can be conducted; rather, it shows the way of undertaking evaluation that was adopted by the EBRD’s Board of Directors during a period of close to 20 years. Throughout those years, the focus was on direct evaluation, whereby applying good practice standards to private-sector evaluation of the Evaluation Cooperation Group (ECG) was at the heart of the evaluation methodology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1356389012472267">7</xref></sup> This article describes how the EBRD’s theory-based<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1356389012472267">8</xref></sup> evaluation system evolved over time being reviewed and amended approximately every five years. For example, improvements to the evaluation system included changes in evaluation coverage ratios of projects ready for evaluation, introducing improved transition impact performance indicators. At the heart of this evolving system was a progressively more independent evaluation function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1356389012472267">
<title>The importance of evaluation</title>
<p>One of the reasons why, so early in the life of the EBRD, so much emphasis was put on creating an evaluation function relates to the way in which the EBRD is financed. Although 30 per cent of its funding is provided through paid-in capital, the remainder has to be obtained through the international capital market backed up by the ‘callable’ capital of the EBRD shareholders. This means that, in case of default of the institution, these shareholders will have to provide cash to repay its obligations. This support from EBRD shareholders in fact secures its AAA status and allows the institution to borrow at or sometimes even below LIBOR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1356389012472267">9</xref></sup> This callable capital arrangement shows that in fact all EBRD funding, as is the case with the other MDBs, depends on sovereign obligations for which EBRD’s shareholders are accountable to their taxpayers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1356389012472267">10</xref></sup> Therefore, it is not surprising that a strong evaluation function was thought desirable in all MDBs, and therefore also in the EBRD.</p>
<p>The EBRD’s founders intended that the evaluation function would concentrate on identifying lessons-learned so that staff involved in project preparation would draw on past experience to enhance the quality of their projects. For the EBRD, in 1991 a young institution among the other mature MDBs, this learning ability had even more meaning. In concentrating on private-sector financing and in the absence of sovereign guarantees, its private-sector investments were at risk just like those of any commercial bank.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1356389012472267">11</xref></sup> The EBRD had to build a thorough system of due diligence and establish a strong credit department to scrutinize project quality ex ante at entry. Project Evaluation on the other hand would focus on evaluation of projects ex post, concentrating on EBRD mandate compliance and enhancing the operational quality of projects through the use of lessons learned gathered from evaluated operations. This dual focus on <italic>mandate compliance</italic> and <italic>lessons learned</italic> by the independent Evaluation Department was considered essential for the Board of Directors in fulfilling its accountability obligation toward the shareholders and the general public.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1356389012472267">
<title>Establishing the evaluation department and the evaluation policy</title>
<p>In the first years of the EBRD’s existence, the newly created Evaluation Department could only concentrate on establishing an evaluation policy and built up an evaluation team in anticipation of projects that were ready for evaluation, which were then still being developed. Building up an institution such as the EBRD from scratch was a challenging task, especially in the wake of the collapse of communism, with the aim to help move its countries of operation to fully functioning market economies. In view of this huge task there was a notion of urgency in getting on stream fast<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1356389012472267">12</xref></sup> and in enabling the institution and its staff to learn from its experience. It was therefore not surprising that the evaluation policy stipulated that the evaluation department should evaluate projects early on (i.e. one year and a half after the last disbursement of a loan and two years after the last disbursement of an equity participation).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1356389012472267">13</xref></sup> In the early days, it was also felt that the evaluation function had to cooperate closely with Management. It was expected that this would speed up the establishment of the evaluation function, stimulate the lessons-learned dissemination and uptake. Therefore, at the start, the Director of Evaluation (the head of the Evaluation Department) reported to the Vice President of Project Evaluation, who reported to the President of the EBRD (also Chair of the Board).</p>
<p>The accountability function to the shareholders and the general public was secured through a close relationship of the evaluation function with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. This Committee had an evaluation oversight role and reviewed evaluation reports prepared by the Evaluation Department, as well as its annual work programme and budget. To secure independence of the function from Management, the Board of Directors was ultimately responsible for approving its work programme and budget, and evaluation policy. The initial system described above still provided Management with considerable influence over the evaluation function, as the Director of Evaluation needed to present all evaluation reports for Board consideration, first to Management’s Executive Committee, before they could be sent to the EBRD’s Board of Directors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1356389012472267">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Compared to the standards of today in respect of independence of evaluation functions in MDBs, the early evaluation system in the EBRD lacked independence of the evaluation function from Management; this was corrected in later years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1356389012472267">15</xref></sup> (This is discussed further below.)</p>
<p>In 1992, the EBRD’s Board approved the first Evaluation Policy. This policy incorporated the objectives of evaluation and described the evaluation process, the evaluation methodology, and in particular the way in which evaluation of investment projects, themes and Bank programmes should be carried out.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1356389012472267">16</xref></sup> It also described how the selection of projects for evaluation would take place and how the process of dissemination of lessons learned would work. The evaluation methodology did not make a distinction between the evaluation of private- and public-sector projects as public-sector projects were expected to be primarily corporates in the process of being privatized, such as utility and telecommunication companies. However, when evaluating public-sector projects there would be a focus on elements such as institutional development, policy frameworks and functioning of independent regulators, which would have less relevance for private-sector projects.</p>
<p>As it was considered important to use evaluation to support the EBRD as an institution that needed to learn lessons early in its life, priority was given to evaluating projects directly. In ‘direct evaluation’, a sample of individual projects is evaluated in detail during field visits so that the project performance lessons are gathered and, if warranted, evaluation recommendations can be formulated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1356389012472267">17</xref></sup> The evaluation policy also argued that lessons should be generated from a broad perspective within the institution to ensure that all sectors were adequately covered. Sampling and randomization of projects was designed to achieve such a broad perspective. From 1992 onwards the evaluation department was tasked with implementing the Evaluation Policy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1356389012472267">
<title>Self-evaluation as an important contribution from Management to support the evaluation process</title>
<p>Good evaluation starts with good monitoring data, which in the EBRD’s case was gathered by operational staff who prepared monitoring reports on an annual or semi-annual basis. In addition, once in the life of a project, at the time of evaluation, a self-evaluation document,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1356389012472267">18</xref></sup> called the expanded monitoring review (XMR), was prepared. The project team responsible for initiating the project prepared this XMR at the time of evaluation, at least one and a half to two years after the last disbursement on an EBRD investment. As this is still early in the life of a project, most of the operational staff responsible for developing the project would still be around to share their experience on the project and to help contribute to the preparation of the XMR and eventually the evaluation report. During the evaluation process, intense interaction between the operational staff who had developed the projects and the staff of the evaluation department was essential to understand what happened in a project and to judge project performance. A disadvantage of evaluating early in the life of a project was that project impacts would not have materialized fully by the time of evaluation. However, the evaluation methodology took this issue into account by looking at the transition impact still to be realized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1356389012472267">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The findings of a comprehensive self-evaluation process have to be verified. This requires cooperation between an independent voice such as an independent evaluation department and management at both senior and operational levels. The aim is to learn from past experience, enhance project quality and maintain a constructive atmosphere between operational staff and evaluation during the process. There can also be an accountability element to evaluating relatively early in the life of a project, insofar as operational staff still associated with the project can be held accountable for the projects they initiated. This can have a positive influence on project ‘quality at entry’. If an evaluation takes place several years after project completion, project staff may have moved on and might not be available to contribute. Institutions like the IFC and the EBRD have developed Management-steered monitoring systems<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1356389012472267">20</xref></sup> so that the influence of the institution at the project level could be measured throughout a project’s life-cycle. Such systems ultimately show how an institution is performing against targets, and provide data for Management to include in annual reports. This was seen as the justification for an evaluation department periodically evaluating project monitoring and self-evaluation systems to assess the quality of their outputs. Indeed, the ECG’s good practice standards require relevant evaluation departments to report on the quality of the self-evaluation system in their annual evaluation synthesis reports.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1356389012472267">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>The evolution of evaluation products</title>
<sec id="section6-1356389012472267">
<title>Performance evaluation reports on projects</title>
<p>The new team of evaluators started gaining experience in evaluating projects in the period 1993−94, when the first EBRD projects were judged evaluation-ready. The main product of project evaluation in the EBRD from the beginning was the operation performance evaluation review (OPER) report. An OPER contained a detailed evaluation of the project based on studies of all relevant documentation, a field visit and extensive contact with the client, its accountant and, where possible, other relevant stakeholders such as branch organizations, key competitors and local-government representatives involved with the sector. Each OPER exercise, following a logic model, would gather information on the performance of the project and assess whether the objectives of the project had been fulfilled. Lessons would be gathered and often recommendations that required specific follow-up actions by Management would be formulated.</p>
<p>Early in the life of the EBRD, when the number of projects ready for evaluation was relatively small, no project sampling was needed as OPER exercises could be carried out on all projects ready for evaluation. However, by 1996 the number of projects had grown to such an extent that evaluating 100 per cent directly through OPER exercises was too time consuming. The Board of Directors decided that the Evaluation Department should evaluate part of the operations through indirect evaluation (i.e. assessing and validating the expanded monitoring reports and preparing an XMR Assessment [XMRA]).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1356389012472267">22</xref></sup> The Work Programme of Evaluation for 1996 proposed that the evaluation population would be composed of a purposive sample<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1356389012472267">23</xref></sup> to prepare at least 15 OPER reports and the remaining 21 projects that were ready for evaluation would be evaluated through carrying out XMRAs. The evaluation system therefore combined direct and indirect evaluation.</p>
<p>While OPER reports could require three to four weeks of staff time, including field visits, XMRAs only take two to three days to complete and are primarily based on deskwork. In the years 1996/1997, in the face of an increase in the number of projects ready for evaluation, there were further capacity constraints. A new evaluation product, the XMR Review, was added. This involved only a short desk review of half a day’s work, in which evaluation staff would judge the quality of the XMR without validating self-evaluation findings. In an updated Evaluation Policy, at least 60 per cent of operations ready for evaluation were to be evaluated through OPERs and XMRAs, and the remaining 40 per cent through XMR Reviews ensuring coverage of all projects ready for evaluation.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, further changes were made and a structured sampling approach<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1356389012472267">24</xref></sup> was introduced. It was felt that this structured sampling approach would bring adequate randomness to the evaluation system, although not yet in full. Only in 2009 did the selection of projects for performance evaluation of the EBRD become fully random with success rates at the 95 per cent confidence level, thereby following the good practice standards for private-sector evaluation developed by the ECG. Randomness in the project sample ensured that the sample was representative of the EBRD’s portfolio as a whole and it also ensured that the lessons learned gathered in this way covered a broad range of sectors for optimal learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1356389012472267">
<title>Generating lessons</title>
<p>Apart from evaluating projects and assigning performance ratings, an important product of the evaluation process is generating lessons.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, ensuring that lessons were both learned and used was already considered important in the first evaluation policy in 1992. This involved responding to requests for lessons-learned material from operational staff during project preparation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1356389012472267">25</xref></sup> and helping them to write better ‘lessons learned’ sections in their self-evaluation reports, so that the use of such lessons would be an integral part of the operational process.</p>
<p>The evaluation department organized ‘lessons-learned workshops’ to strengthen uptake. From the late 1990s each project report sent to the Board for approval would include a section on ‘lessons from past experience’. In this section, the operational staff would present lessons learned from previously evaluated projects relevant for new projects and how these were utilized. This also allowed the Board of Directors to assess whether the ‘lessons-learned process’ was working in the EBRD. To quality assure this process, the Evaluation Department was actively involved in reviewing the quality of these aspects of Board reports.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1356389012472267">26</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1356389012472267">
<title>Evaluation special studies</title>
<p>An important product of evaluation in all MDBs and also in the EBRD is the preparation of special studies, which can be theme- or sector-related. Examples of thematic special studies are an assessment of energy efficiency in EBRD’s projects and a review of EBRD’s environmental policy. Over the years all sectors in which the EBRD was involved were evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1356389012472267">27</xref></sup> Sometimes sector and thematic approaches were combined through evaluating a specific product as, for instance, was the case when evaluating the EBRD’s micro-finance activities and its trade facilitation programme. The evaluation department, EBRD Management, or the Board of Directors could propose evaluation special studies. They would generally be on issues of relevance for the institution at a specific time. A good example of this is the study on lessons to be learned from the Russian financial crisis in 1999, which severely affected EBRD operations.</p>
<p>From 2004, the evaluation policy required that before a new sector strategy was presented to the Board of Directors, an evaluation of the existing sector strategy be carried out.</p>
<p>The objective of evaluation special studies was to generate lessons in specific areas or sectors, and to assess whether the implementation of sector strategies, policies and programmes were conducted in a satisfactory way. The Evaluation Department also formulated recommendations to help management with the preparation of new strategies and to enhance programmes thus assisting the Board of Directors fulfill its accountability functions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1356389012472267">
<title>Other evaluation products and activities</title>
<p>When the Evaluation Department in the EBRD started operations in 1992/93, the only operations that could be evaluated were <italic>technical cooperation (TC) operations</italic>. Projects are judged based on eight TC-related evaluation criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1356389012472267">28</xref></sup> In 1995 the Evaluation Department prepared its first three technical cooperation OPERs. In view of the importance of donor-funded TC, the annual number of TC evaluations was gradually increased. From 2002 onwards a total of six OPERs on TC operations were carried out each year. They cover project-preparation-oriented TC as well as TC focusing on securing adequate management of an EBRD project, often in the municipal and environmental infrastructure sector.</p>
<p>To reach each year the 50 per cent evaluation-coverage rate of TC activities, in addition to the six OPERs, the Evaluation Department reviewed 20 project completion reports (PCRs) prepared by operational staff on technical cooperation operations. A special study covered these project completion reports focusing on performance as well as on lessons learned and presented recommendations where possible. The selection of TC operations for evaluation was not random, but concentrated on sectors where there was great demand for technical cooperation. In this way the chance that the lessons learned would be of relevance in designing future TC operations was maximized. However, the absence of random sampling at this stage meant that no overall conclusions could be reached on the performance of the wider population of such operations and the performance outcomes had therefore to be judged with care. Management operated the TC Review Committee that reviewed and approved the EBRD’s TC operations and helped the Evaluation Department disseminate TC lessons.</p>
<p>From the mid-1990s, the EBRD’s Evaluation Department prepared a synthesis of its evaluation findings in the <italic>Annual Evaluation Overview Report (AEOR)</italic>. These presented trends on transition impact and on the overall performance of the EBRD’s projects, grouped by sectors and country groups. The report dealt with key themes of interest to the EBRD’s stakeholders and made judgements on the quality of the evaluation system and the process of follow-up by management of evaluation recommendations. The Chief Evaluator could, based on findings and recommendations presented in evaluation reports of the previous year, also make specific recommendations to the Board that required Management attention. Judgement on EBRD’s performance in respect of transition impact is at the center of the AEOR. Each AEOR was published in full on the EBRD’s website.</p>
<p>The evaluation department maintained a <italic>lesson-learned database</italic> on the EBRD’s intranet and maintained pages that contained all evaluation reports that were available to operational staff to enhance project quality at entry and help operational staff prepare better projects.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Department also reviewed the <italic>follow-up by Management of evaluation recommendations.</italic> The Evaluation Department and Management presented the findings in a joint report to the Board whereby the Evaluation Department’s review of the follow-up of recommendations was commented on by Management. In the AEOR, the Evaluation Department made a judgement on the functioning of this system. This way of reporting provided a good indicator of the accountability process in respect of the degree to which Management was responding to evaluation recommendations. It constituted another tool to demonstrate that the Board of Directors was fulfilling its accountability function.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section10-1356389012472267">
<title>Judging project performance<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1356389012472267">29</xref></sup></title>
<p>A central part of the Evaluation Policy was judging the performance of projects. This performance system followed a logic model whereby the investments of the EBRD were reviewed to make a judgement on the expected outcomes based on key components of the EBRD’s mandate, <italic>transition impact, sound banking</italic> and <italic>additionality</italic>. The other performance categories adopted by the EBRD’s Board were: the <italic>environment</italic>; EBRD’s <italic>investment performance</italic>; and <italic>Bank handling of the project</italic>. They were all reflected in the evaluation rating categories.</p>
<p>Working in the EBRD’s countries of operation, where transition towards a market economy is key, it was a priority to define transition-related rating categories for project appraisal <italic>ex ante</italic> and project evaluation <italic>ex post</italic>. The other MDBs who concentrate mainly on public-sector financing have evaluation systems whereby the OECD rating categories <italic>relevance, effectiveness, efficiency</italic> and <italic>sustainability</italic> are used. The six rating categories for judging performance of EBRD projects, although showing some similarities, were different from the above OECD rating categories. However, as the system was primarily based on assessing the fulfillment of a set of project objectives for the different performance categories, also for transition impact, the system mostly assessed <italic>effectiveness</italic> in delivering on its mandate.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the AEOR presented the trends of all these performance categories and each year the Chief Evaluator made an independent judgement on how the EBRD was performing based on the outputs of the evaluation system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1356389012472267">
<title>Independence of evaluation in the EBRD evolving over time</title>
<p>As mentioned above, during the early days of the EBRD’s existence, the Director of Evaluation reported to the Vice President of Evaluation, who reported to the President of the EBRD. It was argued that the reason for this closeness to Management was the importance of uptake of lessons learned by the operational department. It was felt at the time that this process would work better if there was proximity of evaluation to Management.</p>
<p>This situation lasted until 2003 when the Board of Directors decided that the Director of Evaluation should report to the President directly and not through a Vice President.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1356389012472267">30</xref></sup> In 2005, in line with the ECG good practice standards on independence of evaluation functions in MDBs, the Board of Directors of the EBRD decided to make the evaluation department fully independent of Management and from then onwards the head of evaluation, the Chief Evaluator, would report directly to the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee of the Board continued overviewing the evaluation function while the work programme of evaluation and the budget of the evaluation department remained fully dependent on a decision by the Board of Directors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1356389012472267">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Until 2005, the views of Management on reports prepared by the Evaluation Department (such as its work programme, its budget and evaluation reports) had been channeled through the EBRD’s Executive Committee, at which the respective Vice-President and the Director of Evaluation presented evaluation findings. Until this point, the evaluation function was part of Management: the reports were prepared taking into account Management’s views, although the Director of Evaluation had the final say in respect of the content of evaluation reports presented to the Board. This system left the Board with some questions over the independence of evaluation. The process of preparation of Management’s Comments changed after the evaluation function became fully independent from Management in mid-2005. From then onwards the process involved more intense and more frequent interaction between the operations department and evaluation, to discuss differences of opinion and review specific wording in evaluation reports to make those differences clear. The final wording remained the responsibility of the Chief Evaluator.</p>
<p>Another issue that the Board of Directors in the EBRD always considered very important was ensuring that the <italic>independent judgement on performance of projects was based on a representative sample of projects</italic> ready for evaluation and that the sample size was sufficiently large and in line with the good practice standards of the ECG.

<title>Evolution of staffing in EBRD’s evaluation department</title>
<p>As described earlier, the EBRD’s evaluation department started as a small unit of about nine team members composed mainly of senior and principal evaluators. Over time the group of evaluators has almost doubled in size. This included the recruitment of new specialist staff: a senior environmental evaluator was recruited in 2001 and a senior economist in 2003. Such recruitments allowed for more intense interaction by the evaluation department with other operational departments. For example, the newly recruited senior economist became involved in a pilot exercise on country-strategy evaluation. This resulted in the development of country-level evaluations within EBRD, generally focusing on priority sectors in the countries selected. Country-level evaluation was integrated into the EBRD’s evaluation policy in 2009.</p>
<p>When the Evaluation Department became fully independent from Management in 2005, the evaluation capacity had to be further strengthened with several evaluation analysts with private-sector experience. As the EBRD’s portfolio showed an increasing number of complex projects ready for evaluation, more in-depth analysis of these projects had to be carried out and a more investigative approach could be intensified with the new recruits.</p>
<p>By 2010 the evaluation Department comprised a team of 17 staff members. In view of the development of the business volume of the EBRD, this was a modest growth.</p>

<title>Learning from good practice elsewhere</title>
<p>The experience of EBRD evaluation presented above is just one example of how private-sector evaluation can be conducted and gives the reader an idea about the issues that had to be addressed when building up an evaluation department in a new development finance institution. The EBRD was always looking more broadly at what comparable institutions were doing in respect of evaluation, to learn from good practice examples. The desire to exchange experiences and learn from each other was the motivation of the members of the ECG to develop good practice standards in respect of key areas of MDB interest, such as: public-sector evaluation, private-sector evaluation, evaluation of policy-based lending, and country strategy evaluation. However, there are some basic principles that should be at the heart of any evaluation system. These basic principles are presented in ECG’s good practice standards (GPS) on independence of international financial institutions’ central evaluation departments and can be considered as the umbrella GPS and be the starting point for any evaluation department.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1356389012472267">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>If evaluation departments are so important in the functioning of the MDBs and so crucial to ensure accountability to their shareholders and the general public, how sure can one be that the evaluation functions deliver value for money? Even if one applies good practice standards to a considerable degree, how sure can one be that the quality of the evaluation outputs are acceptable? And the next logical question would be, ‘who evaluates the evaluators?’ The ECG has regularly discussed this question and, in 2008, it has developed and adopted a peer-review system to allow the MDB evaluators to peer review the evaluation functions of their members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1356389012472267">34</xref></sup> It is too early to judge whether this peer-review system contributes to a better insight into the functioning of the evaluation departments in MDBs. In 2009/2010, a first ECG-commissioned Peer Review took place of the evaluation function of the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), at the time an observer in the ECG and since end 2010 a full member. The findings of ECG’s Peer Review have been presented on IFAD’s website. It is expected that new Peer Reviews of evaluation functions of ECG members would enhance the transparency of evaluation functions in MDBs and help institutions such as EBRD answer the value for money question in respect of the functioning of evaluation departments. As long as Peer Reviews or other independent reviews of evaluation departments are not carried out among the MDBs on a regular basis, questions will continue to be asked by outsiders about the independence of evaluation functions and the accountability of the institutions and their Boards and whether it would not be better to make evaluation units even more independent from the Boards of these institutions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1356389012472267">35</xref></sup> or even locate them outside these institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1356389012472267">36</xref></sup></p>

<p>In a private sector oriented development finance institution with strong management fostering a private sector culture, it was good to formulate an Evaluation Policy that was comprehensive and detailed so that over time Management would not challenge evaluation procedures and practices. It helped preserving a rigorous evaluation process in the EBRD that supported the accountability function of the Board.</p></fn>

<p>The opposite of direct evaluation is indirect evaluation whereby projects are evaluated through a validation process of self-evaluation reports on projects developed by operation staff. Another form of indirect evaluation is when projects are evaluated as a group when they belong to a certain sector or when projects are grouped together in the context of evaluating a specific theme.</p></fn>

<p>For an evaluation system, it is very important that it is based on a thorough management-supported self-evaluation process in which operational staff prepare expanded monitoring reports (XMR) on projects ready for evaluation before an official evaluation takes place. The XMR is based on the project monitoring reports from previous years and the quality of the monitoring system therefore defines, to a large extent, the quality of the self-evaluation system.</p></fn>

<p>The evaluation methodology of the EBRD tries to mitigate this issue by measuring the realized transition effects, as well as the transition potential the project might still have. The combination of the realized transition impact and the transition potential at the time of evaluation is summarized in an overall transition impact rating.

<p>A purposive sample is a sample not selected randomly but purposefully. Projects are selected with a purpose in mind, such as lessons-learned potential, problem projects, but also projects that are doing very well so that positive lessons can be generated. Also projects in certain sectors or countries can be selected so that there is specific emphasis on learning sector oriented lessons or gaining experience in certain countries or regions.</p></fn>

<p>The purposive sample of 20 projects in 1998 was amended with a random sample of 30 XMRAs to complete the 60 per cent sample size. The two strata of the sample of which one would have 100 per cent coverage and the other stratum would have a lower than 100 per cent coverage would be combined based on the weights of each stratum in the total sample. The projects selected through a purposive sample would be important from a lessons-learned perspective and would be of great importance and relevance to the EBRD (from a priority sector, with high risk or a high profile project, etc.). For details of the performance rating system see Appendix 8 of the EBRD’s 2010 Annual Evaluation Overview Report (AEOR), which is presented on the EBRD’s website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebrd.com">http://www.ebrd.com</ext-link>.</p></fn>

<p>Staff of the Evaluation Department judge the quality of the past experience sections in Board reports.

<p>When, over time, the Evaluation Vice Presidency had assumed responsibility for areas such as environment, procurement, consultant contracts and nuclear safety, in fact, the evaluation department had lost some of its key focus in the institution. When the Evaluation Vice President also assumed responsibility for Risk Management in 2003 the Evaluation Department could not continue under the current vice-presidency.

<p>Without an effective ECG that ensures joint standards and enforces peer reviews (self-regulation), public pressure to regulate MDBs’ evaluation functions through a central body will inevitably rise. However, there is the need that MDB Boards accept ECG Peer Review authority, as the Board of IFAD did with the first ECG Peer Review exercise in 2009/2010.</p>
