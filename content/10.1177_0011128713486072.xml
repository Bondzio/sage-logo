<abstract>
<p>This study uses a developmental perspective and focuses on examining whether the impact of adolescent dating is age-sensitive. Dating at earlier ages is hypothesized to have a stronger effect on adolescent criminal behavior or substance use, but the effect would be weaker as one ages. The data obtained from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 are used to investigate this research question. The age-sensitive effect is measured by the interaction term between dating and age in the fixed effects modeling. The results show that when an adolescent changes from nondating to dating, the probability of committing criminal activities or using substances increases, but the influence of adolescent dating decreases as one ages. In addition, the dating effect decreases more rapidly among female adolescents than male adolescents.</p>

<p>Developing romantic relationships is of particular importance to adolescent development and is often viewed as a normative process in a developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128713486072">Florsheim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128713486072">Furman, 2002</xref>). Romantic partners become major figures who can offer “the attachment, caregiving, affiliative, and sexual reproduction behavioral systems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128713486072">Furman &amp; Wehner, 1994</xref>, p. 177). Of course, it may be a different matter entirely for worrying parents of teenage daughters who want to have the freedom to make their own dating decisions. There may be negative consequences of teen dating. Prior research indicates that teen dating experience may lead to delinquent behavior or substance use, emotional and behavioral problems, conflicts with parents or other family members, and poor academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128713486072">Dowdy &amp; Kliewer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128713486072">Fidler, West, Jarvis, &amp; Wardle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128713486072">Natsuaki, Biehl, &amp; Ge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128713486072">Neeman, Hubbard, &amp; Masten, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128713486072">Thomas &amp; Hsiu, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The implications of teen dating are far-reaching. Yet, the current scholarship has not fully explored these intricacies of romantic relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128713486072">McCarthy and Casey (2008)</xref> claimed that it is not just the dating activities but the characteristics and qualities of adolescent romantic relationships that influence one’s participation in delinquent activities. A similar notion is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128713486072">Davies and Windle (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128713486072">Giordano, Lonardo, Manning, and Longmore (2010)</xref>. These studies have significantly advanced our understanding by acknowledging that adolescent romantic relationships can be extensively complicated as one understands the dynamics of the relationship.</p>
<p>The current study further elucidates the cognitive and behavioral intricacies of adolescent dating experience by analyzing the relationship between adolescent dating experience and delinquent behavior from a developmental perspective. In particular, I propose that the effect of dating on one’s behavior is age-sensitive. At later ages, dating activities are considered as rather normative and common behavior, and romantic relationships may provide informal social control that might suppress participating in delinquent activities. Therefore, one may assume that the strength of the adolescent dating experience on the propensity to engage in delinquent activities would decrease as adolescent’s age increases. I use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) and use fixed effects methods to examine the hypothesis. The age-sensitive effect of dating experience would manifest itself in the interaction terms in fixed effects models.</p>

<title>Adolescent Dating and Delinquency</title>
<p>Adolescent dating relationships differ from adult dating relationships in many respects. It is therefore important to address the characteristics of adolescent dating behavior that may be related to deviant behavior. First, adolescent dating may be merely reflecting an adolescent response to their physical development. In other words, adolescent dating may be a way of overcoming a gap between an adolescent’s physical and social maturity and showing their independence from adults. Although adolescents are biologically mature, they are still socially and financially dependent on their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128713486072">Moffitt, 1993</xref>). To match their biological stage of maturity, physically mature adolescents may adopt adult-like behavior such as dating. Also, dating or sexual activities can be a way of responding to their physical/hormonal urges as adolescents go through pubertal development.</p>
<p>Second, building a romantic relationship is new to adolescents. Prior to adolescence, the primary peer group tends to be gender-segregated. In middle or late adolescence, casual socialization with the opposite sex increases substantially, and opposite-sex peers become more important than in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128713486072">Collins &amp; Sroufe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128713486072">Kuttler, Greca, &amp; Prinstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128713486072">Pawlby, Mills, &amp; Quinton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128713486072">Warr, 2002</xref>). As dating experience provides adolescents with opportunities to play a new social role, particularly with relation to the opposite sex, adolescents in romantic relationships experience different behavioral patterns and may experience changes in their priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128713486072">Dowdy &amp; Kliewer, 1998</xref>). Young adolescents are not accustomed to managing this new type of relationship, and the relationship would not be as stable as an older adolescent’s relationship might be. Unlike most adult romantic relationships where marital or long-term partners are central, attachment and caregiving are not key elements of adolescent romantic relationships. In contrast to adult romantic relationships, adolescent romantic relationships are less exclusive and intimate, transitory, superficial, and often lack depth and commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128713486072">Collins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128713486072">Furman &amp; Shaffer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128713486072">Furman &amp; Wehner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128713486072">Laursen &amp; Jensen-Campbell, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Adolescent romance may reflect some attributes of attachment such as proximity seeking (staying close or making contacts with partners) or separation protest (resisting separation from partners), but adolescents would not be as concerned as adults about preventing separation or keeping the relationship secure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128713486072">Hazan &amp; Zeifman, 1994</xref>). At any age, development of a romantic relationship may begin in the context of physical proximity and contact. Mutual support and caregiving can become more important at later stages, and reciprocal attachment can be formed in the relationship of 2 or more years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128713486072">Hazan &amp; Zeifman, 1994</xref>). Thus, it is less than likely that young adolescent short-lived or newly formed romantic relationships would have a strong attachment component. Also, the primary source of attachment and caregiving is still the parents, and romantic partners in adolescence would not provide as much care or a sense of attachment as parents do until they develop long-term relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128713486072">Furman &amp; Simon, 1999</xref>). Attachment and caregiving become fundamental features in romantic relationships only after individuals acquire basic abilities to function effectively in socializing with the opposite sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128713486072">Furman &amp; Wehner, 1997</xref>). Young individuals who are inexperienced in romantic relationships are less likely to expect positive functions from their partners than the older who acquire more experience in various romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128713486072">Furman &amp; Wehner, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to the nature of dating activities in adolescence, adolescent dating relationships tend to be less stable than adult dating relationships and may not provide adolescents with the same level of benefits as a stable romantic relationship (in adulthood) does. Also, deviant partners could be more popular than law-abiding ones during adolescence because deviants, who are breaking expected social norms, would appear to have been freed from the behavioral limitations normally placed on adolescents. Therefore, adolescent dating experience would increase association with delinquents, thereby providing a path toward delinquent behavior. When dating a delinquent partner, adolescents are directly influenced by their deviant partners and participate in delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128713486072">Haynie, Giordano, Manning, &amp; Longmore, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0011128713486072">
<title>Different Perspectives on Adolescent Dating</title>
<p>While studies have found that adolescent dating experience has a negative relationship with one’s behavior, recent studies also show that the result can be different when the characteristics of dating or romantic relationships are considered. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128713486072">Davies and Windle (2000)</xref> studied 701 adolescents and found that adolescents who had a romantic relationship reported participation in delinquency, alcohol use, and sexual activities more often and had more friends who drank than those who did not have a romantic relationship. As involvement in adolescent dating increased, problem behavior such as alcohol use and minor delinquency consistently increased. The study also found that adolescents who had casual relationships with multiple partners showed the most significant increase in delinquency and alcohol use. However, those who had steady relationships exhibited a decrease in problematic behavior. Steady dating relationships were related to positive emotional adjustment (i.e., a decrease in depression) and competence. By using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128713486072">Moffitt’s (1993)</xref> notion, they accounted for why adolescents with steady dating relationships are less delinquent than those with multiple unstable relationships. Adolescents who can maintain steady relationships are, in essence, “maturing-out” of deviant activities. They can develop the positive emotional adjustment and finally show a decrease in problematic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128713486072">Davies &amp; Windle, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128713486072">Davies and Windle (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128713486072">McCarthy and Casey (2008)</xref> found a positive effect of having a romantic relationship on one’s behavior. They tested how the characteristics of adolescent romantic relationships are related to offending. Although adolescent dating is often found to be related to negative outcomes such as violence and conflicts with parents, the authors argued that the attachment created by romantic relationships would discourage offending behavior. They proposed that strong romantic love would provide attachment to their partners, and reduce adolescent involvement in antisocial activities. Meanwhile, sexual activities without emotional closeness would increase criminal involvement because sexual activities may increase the level of strain when there is no romantic connection. By analyzing the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128713486072">McCarthy and Casey (2008)</xref> found that the results were consistent with their hypotheses. Romantic love reduced the probability of participation in criminal acts, while sexual activities increased the probability. They also further tested whether the context of sexual intimacy mattered. The data analysis showed that when sexual activities are absent, a romantic relationship increased participation in crime and substance use, whereas having sexual intercourse in a romantic relationship was not significantly associated with crime or substance use. The authors concluded that future research should be able to elaborate on various characteristics of a romantic relationship and partner attributes to understand how a romantic relationship influences offending behavior across life-course.</p>
<p>Although these studies did not distinguish between the characteristics of dating activities at earlier ages and those at later ages, it seems reasonable to expect that romantic relationships become more stable as age increases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128713486072">Neeman et al. (1995)</xref> studied age differences in the romantic relationships. They argued that dating activities would have negative influences on adolescent behavior and academic and job competence in early ages, but it would become a normative developmental task in later ages. They interviewed 177 boys and girls for three different rounds and used longitudinal path analysis. Their findings showed a modest and reciprocal relationship between conduct problems and the romantic involvement in late childhood and middle adolescence but not in late adolescence. Also, romantic involvement in late childhood predicted an increase in rule/law-breaking conduct in middle adolescence. Rule/law-breaking conduct also recursively predicted an increase in romantic relationships. From middle to late adolescence, however, neither conduct problems nor romantic involvement was found to influence each other.</p>
<p>In summary, existing studies show that dating experience is an important factor that influences one’s behavioral development. While it is suggested that adolescent dating activities are related to one’s deviant behavior, the link between dating and delinquency may be much more complicated if one takes into consideration the quality or type of romantic relationships that they have. Moreover, the characteristics of dating activities seem to change through the developmental process. Those who begin dating in early adolescence can be rather significantly related to the development of deviant behavior, certainly more so than those who begin dating at a later point in adolescence. In addition, existing research suggests that when the romantic relationship is stable and involves intimacy, it can operate as a desisting factor for criminal behavior. As explained earlier, romantic or dating relationships become more stable and provide more positive aspects such as attachment and caregiving at later ages. Older adolescents report a higher proportion of persistent relationships than younger adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128713486072">Collins, 2003</xref>). Also, perceptions of intimacy in opposite-sex relationships increase with age. Consequently, it can be assumed that dating may influence one’s behavior differently throughout adolescence. In this study, I investigate whether the influence changes over time. In particular, I examine whether the dating effect on criminal activities and substance use is moderated by age.</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to test the effect of adolescent dating experience on participation in criminal activities and substance use, and to explore the possibility that there are age-related changes in this effect. Based on the results reported in prior research, this study develops and tests two primary hypotheses regarding adolescent dating activities. First, I hypothesize that the effect of the dating experience on delinquency would be moderated by one’s age. Although more adolescents get involved in dating relationships as they get older, delinquency rates do not correspondingly increase. This may suggest that dating would have a stronger influence on an individual’s deviant behavior at earlier ages than it does at later ages. Second, I hypothesize that the age-sensitive effect varies across gender. The literature shows that females mature earlier than males. This early maturation would be related to the effect of dating on delinquent behavior.</p>
<sec id="section4-0011128713486072">
<title>Hypothesis 1: Age-Sensitive Effect of Dating</title>
<p>This study is designed to test whether the adolescent dating experience is related to criminal activities and substance use and whether the effect of dating on these activities decreases with an increase in age. This is based on the idea that the nature of dating changes as one gets older. Because adolescent romantic relationships are newer and less well established compared with other adolescent relationships such as friendships and familial relationships, adolescent romantic relationships are relatively unstable, and for the most part, do not last long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128713486072">Furman &amp; Simon, 1999</xref>). During this period, parents rather than romantic partners are still the primary attachment figures, and only sexual processes tend to be a central element in their romantic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128713486072">Furman &amp; Simon, 1999</xref>). Therefore, having a romantic relationship during adolescence, especially in the early stage, would not be likely to result in the strengthening of a social bond that could decrease engagement in delinquent/criminal behavior. Instead, it would have a negative influence on one’s behavior due to the nature of dating at early ages. As one gets older, however, dating would not have much negative influence on one’s behavior. If dating has only a negative impact on one’s behavior throughout adolescence, the delinquency rate would increase correspondently. However, the delinquency rate peaks about age 17 and decreases thereafter, while the rate of engaging in dating activities gradually increases throughout adolescence. Hence, it is expected that the negative effect of dating on one’s behavior would get weaker as age increases. Finally, I apply this hypothesis to general delinquency (criminal activities), violent crime, property crime, and substance use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011128713486072">
<title>Hypothesis 2: Gender Difference in Age-Sensitive Effect of Dating</title>
<p>I further examine whether the age-sensitive effect differs across gender. Female adolescents experience physical, psychological, and personality maturation at earlier ages than do male adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128713486072">Klimstra, Hale, Raaijmakers, Branje, &amp; Meeus, 2009</xref>). Also, girls progress earlier toward their intimacy in opposite-sex relationships than do boys. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128713486072">Sharabany, Gershoni, and Hofman (1981)</xref> examined gender differences in the increase of intimacy with age in the relationship with the opposite sex. At earlier ages, the level of intimacy in the opposite-sex friendship is similarly low for boys and girls. By the 10th grade, however, girls show that their intimacy toward boys matches intimacy perceived in the same sex friendships, whereas boys still show higher intimacy toward the same sex friends than the opposite sex. Yet, the overall discrepancy between same- and opposite-sex friendships is reduced by the 11th grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128713486072">Sharabany et al., 1981</xref>). In a similar manner, one may assume that as female adolescents grow older, they develop intimacy in a dating relationship more rapidly than male adolescents, and thus dating effect on one’s behavior might not be so negative as it was at earlier ages. Therefore, I expect the negative effect of dating on one’s behavior would decline more rapidly as female adolescents get older than male adolescents as they get older. In other words, the age-sensitive effect of dating on delinquency would be stronger for females than for males.</p>

<title>Data and Sample</title>
<p>The NLSY97 is used for my analyses. These data include labor market behavior, educational experience, family background, Armed Service Vocational Aptitude Battery, high school information, government program participation, family life, health issues, and assets and income. In the first round of data collection that occurred during calendar year 1997, a total of 8,984 youths who were 12 to 16 years old as of December 31, 1996, were interviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128713486072">U.S. Department of Labor, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To conduct the current study, those individuals who remained through the third round, and have no missing dependent variables were selected as the final sample. After excluding those who did not provide criminal activities information at all three waves, the eligible sample size reduces to 7,943. In addition, I excluded those who were married at the time of interview. This is because the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of adolescent dating behavior, which is expected to differ from adults’ romantic relationship or marriage. Finally, I selected three younger birth cohorts for the analysis because most of the two oldest birth cohorts become 18 years old or older at Wave 3 and do not show much within-person variation between waves in terms of dating experience. Hence, I restricted the analysis to the adolescents who were 12 to 14 years old as of December 31, 1996. This results in 4,897 respondents eligible for the analysis on general criminal activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011128713486072">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Measurement</title>
<sec id="section8-0011128713486072">
<title>Criminal Activities and Substance Use</title>
<p>Adolescent criminal activities have been measured for each round of the survey and capture rather serious delinquent and criminal behavior in NLSY97. At Round 1, respondents were asked whether they had been involved in various criminal activities in the past 12 months.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011128713486072">2</xref></sup> At Rounds 2 and 3, respondents were asked whether they had been involved in such activities “since the last interview date” instead of “in the last 12 months.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011128713486072">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>General delinquency (or criminal activities) is dichotomized. Those involved in one or more of the listed criminal/delinquent activities are coded one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011128713486072">4</xref></sup> This will allow measuring the effect of dating on participation in criminal behavior in general. This study also examines whether dating influences vary for different types of criminal activities (violent crimes and property crimes). One might assume that male adolescents who are dating may get involved in violent activities more often than nondaters because they might use violence as a means of impressing their partners. For violence, those who were involved in any violent activities such as carrying a handgun, belonging to a gang, or attacking others are coded one, and all others are coded zero.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011128713486072">5</xref></sup> Similarly, for property crimes, those who damaged property, stole something, or committed any property crime are coded one, and all others are coded zero.</p>
<p>Another outcome variable is substance use. Because adolescent dating itself involves unsupervised social outings, daters would have more chances to use substances compared with nondaters. The substance use is measured by marijuana use, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking. Those who used one or more substances during the past 30 days are coded one, and those who did not use are coded zero.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0011128713486072">
<title>Dating Experience (Dating Involvement)</title>
<p>In the NLSY97, dating involvement is measured by the frequency of dating over the past year. Respondents were asked how often they have had a date or gone out with someone of the opposite sex in an unsupervised social outing over the past year. The involvement in dating relationships in this analysis is a dichotomized variable; those who have never dated or did not date over the past year are coded zero, and those who dated over the past year are coded one. Those who answered that they were currently married are excluded from analysis.</p>

<title>Control Variables</title>
<sec id="section11-0011128713486072">
<title>Family Structure</title>
<p>Family structure is controlled in this study. At each wave, youths were asked two separate questions of whether they lived with a biological mother and whether they lived with a biological father. Preliminary analysis indicated that the number of biological parents did not seem to matter regarding the protective influence on delinquency. Instead, whether they were living with both biological parents showed a significant effect on delinquency. Also, a recent study using the NLSY97 indicates that adolescents living with both biological parents reported lower behavioral and emotional problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128713486072">Holmes, Jones-Sanpei, &amp; Day, 2009</xref>). Hence, the variable is dichotomized. Those living with both biological parents are coded one, and others are coded zero.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0011128713486072">
<title>Parental Variables</title>
<p>I include a control for parental strictness in setting and enforcing of boundaries for the respondents’ behavior. Respondents were asked at each wave if their mother was permissive or strict about making sure respondents did what they were supposed to do. The same question was asked about their father’s or father figure’s strictness. Parental strictness is dichotomized. Respondents whose parents were strict are coded one, and others are coded zero. Similarly, I include a variable of the parental support for respondents. Respondents were asked if their mother or mother figure was supportive. The same question was asked about their fathers or their father figure. Youths answered on a 3-point scale of <italic>very supportive, somewhat supportive</italic>, and <italic>not very supportive</italic>. Preliminary analysis indicated that having very supportive parents seemed to have the protective influence on respondents’ delinquent behavior. Youths who answered that mother and father were very supportive are coded one and others zero.</p>

<sec id="section13-0011128713486072">
<title>Perceived Risk of Arrest</title>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that when one anticipates receiving punishment as a consequence of their behavior, they would be less likely to participate in criminal activities. Therefore, I control for perceived risk of arrest as measured at each wave by respondents’ report of the percentage of chance they would be arrested if they stole a car. This measure is an indirect proxy measure of the definition in this study.</p>

<p>I include two indirect measures of school performance. The first is school suspension. Individuals with a high level of academic achievement would get fewer school suspensions than those with a low level of academic achievement. I calculated the number of suspension days during the grade of school for Round 1 and the number since the last interview for Rounds 2 and 3. Another school-related variable is school dropout. Those adolescents who expect to go to college would be less likely to drop out of school, and this educational aspiration would be expected to decrease the probability of being delinquent. Respondents who reported that they were not enrolled in school and did not receive a regular high school diploma are coded one. Those who were enrolled in regular school and those who were not enrolled but received a high school diploma are coded zero.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0011128713486072">
<title>At-Risk Time</title>
<p>Time between interviews is controlled. The first round survey was conducted during two different time periods to recruit additional respondents. Hence, some respondents have substantially lower between-interview time than others. The average time between the first and the second round of the survey is 596 days, and the elapsed time between Round 2 and Round 3 is 352 days on average. Also, the questions regarding criminal activities are slightly different between the first interview and later interviews. At Round 1, respondents were asked if they had been involved in various criminal activities “in the past 12 months.” At the second and third round of the survey, they were asked if they had been involved in such activities “since the last interview date.” As the elapsed time for each person is different, the at-risk time also varies. In other words, some people had more time to be exposed to the risk than others. Therefore, I control the at-risk time. For Round 1, it is set to 365 days, and for Rounds 2 and 3, differences between the current interview date and the last interview date are measured.</p>

<sec id="section16-0011128713486072">
<title>Body Mass Index (BMI)</title>
<p>The NLSY97 provides information of respondents’ weight and height at each wave of the survey. Based on this information, the BMI can be calculated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0011128713486072">6</xref></sup> It allows a measure of weight status. Adolescents who are overweight or underweight are presumed to be less attractive to the opposite sex and may not be confident about their body and self-image. These individuals may be less likely to get involved in dating activities than those who are normal weight (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128713486072">Cawley, Joyner, &amp; Sobal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128713486072">Halpern &amp; Udry, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0011128713486072">
<title>Age</title>
<p>The age at each wave of the survey was calculated based on the date of the interview and respondents’ birthday. The average age was 13.4 at Round 1, 15.0 at Round 2, and 16.0 at Round 3.</p>

<sec id="section18-0011128713486072" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>I used the first three waves of the NLSY97 and fixed effects logistic models to examine the age-sensitive effect of dating experience. Panel data such as NLSY97 contain variables that are measured at multiple points in time for the same individuals. Because of repeated observations of the same person, the variables can be highly correlated. Using conventional statistical methods would likely result in low estimated standard errors that lead to high test statistics and low <italic>p</italic> values. Among various methods that can correct for the statistical dependence, I use fixed effects models for my data analyses.</p>
<sec id="section19-0011128713486072">
<title>Meeting the Requirements of the Fixed Effects Model</title>
<p>To use fixed effects methods, a dependent and independent variable should be measured for each individual on at least two occasions. The data analyzed in this study contain three time points. In addition, measurements for each variable should be consistently measured and comparable over time, but the values of the variables need to vary over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128713486072">Allison, 2009</xref>). Fixed effects methods reduce bias but may have larger standard errors than random effects models because they disregard between-individual variation and only use within-individual variation to estimate the coefficients. Therefore, if there is very little variation within individuals but large variation between individuals, fixed effects methods would not produce reliable estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128713486072">Allison, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The main variables tested in this study are related to an individual’s behavior. Delinquency and dating activities are not time-stable variables. One may engage in delinquent behavior this year but not next year. Similarly, one may not have dated anyone the previous year but dated this year. This satisfies the basic conditions for fixed effects models. Also, the fixed effects models control for any unobserved time-stable variables that may cause a spurious relationship between dating and delinquency. Because the purpose of this study is to see whether the effect of dating gets moderated “as one gets older” and fixed effects models take within-individual variation into consideration, these models seem suitable for examining the age-sensitive effect of dating experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0011128713486072">
<title>Fixed Effect Logistic Models With Interaction Terms</title>
<p>Because the dependent variables are dichotomous, I use fixed effects logistic models, where the time-invariant fixed effect can be handled by including a set of dummy variables for each individual or by using the mean deviation method.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0011128713486072">7</xref></sup> However, logistic models would produce biased estimates by including dummy variables, and there is no similar method to the mean deviation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128713486072">Allison, 2009</xref>). The preferable method for dichotomous dependent variable is a “conditional likelihood” method, which conditions the time-invariant fixed effect out of the likelihood function. For example, if the value of delinquency at each time point is consistent, meaning all zeros or all ones, this individual is eliminated from the analysis. The conditional maximum likelihood only works for the logistic regression model not for other similar functions such as probit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128713486072">Allison, 2009</xref>). The result of this analysis will show whether there is an association between adolescent dating experience and participation in delinquency.</p>
<p>The age-sensitive effect of dating on delinquency can be measured by adding an interaction term between age and the dating variable. A basic model that tests the effect of dating on delinquency is presented below.</p>

<p>I can also measure the gender difference by including an interaction term for gender by dating. Although the classic fixed effects model does not produce estimates for time-invariant predictors such as gender, the effect can be measured when they are interacted with time-varying variables. The gender difference in the age-sensitive effect of dating is measured by a three-way interaction term for dating by age by gender. The model below shows that a vector of time-invariant variables (<italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) has been included.</p>

<title>Delinquency (General Criminal Activities)</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128713486072">Table 3</xref> shows the result of a fixed effects logistic regression. The first set of columns show the result without any interaction effects. As expected, dating is significantly related to delinquency. When an individual changes from not being in a dating relationship to being in a dating relationship, his or her odds of participating in criminal activities are multiplied by 1.648. The second set of columns shows the result including interaction effects of dating by age and gender. The dating effect is significant and moderated by age. A 1-year increase in age decreases the dating versus nondating odds ratio (OR) by 11.5%. This means that although dating increases the likelihood of participating in delinquency, the effect weakens as one ages.</p>

<p>I also tested whether the age-sensitive effect of dating experience on participation in delinquency is different across gender. The three-way interaction term for dating by age by gender and the interaction effect between dating and gender are significant. This indicates that although the dating effect on delinquency is greater for female adolescents than for male adolescents, dating effects decrease more rapidly as female adolescents get older compared with male adolescents. For each increase in age, the odds is multiplied by 0.885 (11.5% decrease) for males and by 0.786 (21.4% decrease) for females. The interaction effects were also tested in fixed effects Poisson models using a variety score of delinquency. The result indicated the similar results that the interaction effects were statistically significant.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011128713486072">Figure 1</xref> presents changes in probability of participating in delinquency by age and gender. The probability shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011128713486072">Figure 1</xref> is based on the dating effect only. The slope of female adolescents shows a sharper decline than the slope of male adolescents. Female adolescents are more strongly influenced by being in a dating relationship than male adolescents until the age of 15, and the effect gets stronger for males thereafter. In other words, when female adolescents change from nondating to dating, they tend to participate in delinquency more than males at earlier ages. However, the size of the effect reverses after age 15. When adolescents are 16 years old or older, male adolescents are more likely than female adolescents to participate in delinquent activities when they are in dating relationships.</p>

</fig>
<p>Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011128713486072">Figure 1</xref> shows that the probability becomes less than .5 around age 17 for females. This means that when females become 17 years old, adolescent dating experience would not have strong influence on participating in delinquency. Through dating or romantic relationships, female adolescents may develop intimate relationships, emotional maturity, and social skills earlier than male adolescents. These positive aspects of romantic relationships may work as a protective factor against antisocial behavior. For male adolescents, the probability is still a little more than .5 at age 18. The difference in age indicates that female adolescents adopt positive aspects that dating experience offers approximately 1 or 2 years earlier than males. In other words, female adolescents mature out of the negative effects of dating earlier than male adolescents.</p>

<title>Violence and Property Crime</title>
<p>Next, I examined the age-sensitive effect for violent and property crime using fixed effects logistic regression models. The violent crime model is presented first (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0011128713486072">Table 4</xref>). Similar to the general delinquency model, being in dating relationships increases the odds of participating in violent criminal activities, and this dating effect is moderated by age. Each year increase in age decreases the dating versus nondating odds ratio by 17.2%. I also tested whether the age-sensitive effect of dating experience on violent crime is moderated by gender. The result of the three-way interaction term of dating by age by sex indicates that the age-sensitive effect of dating does not differ across gender. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0011128713486072">Table 4</xref> also shows whether the dating effect differs across gender. Unlike the result in the general delinquency model, the dating effect is not moderated by gender. While the dating effect is larger for females in the general delinquency model, the effect is not different between male and female adolescents in the violence model.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0011128713486072">Figure 2</xref> shows changes in the probability of committing a violent crime by age and gender. This is based on the dating effect only. Although being in dating relationships increases the likelihood of involvement in violence, the effect gets weaker as one gets older. At age 12, the increase in the probability of committing violent crime is .700. The probability of committing violent crime becomes less than .5 at age 17. At age 17 or after, being in a dating relationship does not seem to be influential in terms of committing violent crime. This may be because adolescents may build more stable dating relationships at later ages.</p>

<p>Next, I present the results of the property crime model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0011128713486072">Table 5</xref>. The results are similar to the results of the general delinquency model. The property crime model shows the odds of committing property crime is multiplied by 13.986 times when an adolescent is in a dating relationship. Dating adolescents would have greater financial needs than nondaters; they would want to purchase clothes to be more appealing to their dating partners or pay on dates. Because they are still financially dependent on their parents and cannot afford everything they want to purchase, they would steal money or other goods they need. Or, they simply steal something or destroy property to impress their dating partners.</p>

<p>Although being in dating relationships increases the likelihood of committing property crime, the effect decreases with age. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0011128713486072">Table 5</xref> shows that the interaction effect between dating and age on property crime is significant. A 1-year increase in age decreases the dating versus nondating OR by 13.4%. Again, this may be because, dating would no longer be a strong criminogenic factor at later ages when dating becomes more prevalent. This age-sensitive effect is also tested across gender. For females, the OR of age-sensitive effect decreases by 12.9% compared with that of males. This indicates that the dating influence decreases more rapidly as female adolescents get older compared with male adolescents.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0011128713486072">Figure 3</xref> shows changes in the probability of committing property crime by age and gender. The dating effect on property crime is stronger for female adolescents than it is for male adolescents at earlier ages. However, as the effect declines more rapidly for female adolescents than for male adolescents, the dating effect becomes larger for males at age 14. In addition, the graph shows that the probability of committing property crime becomes less than .5 around age 17 for female adolescents, whereas it is more than .5 for males. This may indicate that even though being in dating relationships is related to the increase in committing property crime, female adolescents mature out of this negative effect faster than male adolescents.</p>

<p>Finally, I examined an age-sensitive effect for substance use. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0011128713486072">Table 6</xref>. Similar to the results of other types of criminal activities, dating shows a statistically significant relationship with substance use. When an adolescent changes from nondating to dating, the odds of using substances increases by 8.690 times. Yet, the effect is moderated by age. Each year increases the dating versus nondating odds by 10%. Also, the dating effect is moderated by gender. When female adolescents are in dating relationships, they are more likely to use substances than when male adolescents are in dating relationships. This may be because substances are supplied by their male partners. However, the result of the three-way interaction term for dating by age by gender shows that although the dating effect is stronger for female adolescents, it decreases with age more rapidly for female adolescents than it does for male adolescents.</p>

The slope of probability for male adolescents is not as sharp as for female adolescents. Although the dating effect gets weaker as one gets old, the change in males is not as significant as in females. Before age 16, female adolescents are more strongly influenced by dating in terms of substance use. After the age of 16, however, the effect stays stronger for male adolescents.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The forgoing analyses tested whether the dating effect on delinquency was moderated by age based on the ideas that (a) dating activities become common at later ages and (b) if dating persistently has a negative influence on one’s behavior, then the delinquency rate would keep increasing throughout adolescence. Hence, one can expect that dating at later ages would not be as criminogenic as dating at earlier ages. Using fixed effects regression models, I first examined whether being in dating relationships was related to the increase in the probability of general delinquency/criminal activities and whether the effect was moderated by age. Young adolescents who are in dating relationships would have more opportunities to get involved in deviant activities in the absence of parental supervision. However, the effect would get weaker as they get older. The result suggests that the effect of dating on delinquency is age-sensitive. Having dating relationships increases the likelihood of participating in delinquency, but the effect decreases as one gets older. In other words, dating has stronger influence on one’s participation in delinquency at earlier ages than at later ages. In addition, this age-sensitive effect of dating seems to differ across gender. It is stronger for females than males. The effect of dating on delinquency gets much weaker when female adolescents get older than when male adolescents get older. This may indicate that females are more quickly maturing-out of delinquent activities than their male counterparts, and thus, the negative effect of dating decreases more rapidly for females than for males. Until the middle period of adolescence, the dating effect on participating in delinquency or criminal activities is stronger among female adolescents than male adolescents. However, the trend reverses after the middle adolescence (around age 15); the dating influence becomes stronger for male adolescents than for female adolescents. Eventually, the difference between dating and nondating becomes almost zero around age 17 for females and around age 18 for males.</p>
<p>I then examined whether the results would be consistent for violent and property crime. Similar to the result of the general delinquency model, the interaction effect of dating by age was significant for violent and property crime. The dating effect gets weaker as one ages. Being in dating relationships is not so great of a problem at later ages as it is at earlier ages. Regarding the gender difference, the results were different between the two criminal activities. While the results of the property crime model were similar to the results of general delinquency, the violent crime model showed no gender difference either in dating effect itself or age-sensitive effect of dating.</p>
<p>Finally, I analyzed the age-sensitive effect of adolescent dating on substance use. Adolescents in dating relationships would likely go out with other couples and, therefore, have more chances to have parties where smoking, drinking, and using social drugs are prevalent. Being in dating relationships was significantly related to the increase in substance use. The dating effect was moderated by age, and the moderating effect was stronger for female adolescents than for male adolescents. Similar to general delinquency and property crime, the dating effect was stronger for females than for males at earlier ages. After age 16, however, it is weaker for females than for males.</p>
<p>Overall, the results seem to support the hypothesis that the dating effect is age-sensitive. This indicates that dating becomes less influential on delinquent behavior at later ages than at earlier ages. Except for substance use, the dating effect on all other types of criminal activities became zero by the late teens. This would be because as adolescents become familiar with the new type of interpersonal relationship with the opposite sex, they can learn basic abilities to function effectively in building stable relationships and developing more intimate, mutually supportive relationships with their dating partners. As they become more capable of maintaining stable relationships, they would tend to mature out of criminal/delinquent activities. Also, as they get older and mature, the deviant would be less popular as dating partners. Hence, they would be less likely to get negative influence from dating partners.</p>
<p>This study attempted to provide a developmental perspective for explaining the relationship between adolescent dating experience and delinquency/substance use. While this effort was successful, there are some limitations to the study that need to be articulated. First, this study is based on a limited set of covariates because of data availability. For example, a delinquent peer association is often suggested as a main criminogenic factor. Fixed effects models that use longitudinal data sets require time-variant variables to be measured throughout the data collection process. Unfortunately, items on delinquent peers are measured only at Round 1 and hence could not be included in the model.</p>
<p>Second, more diverse aspects of adolescent dating relationships need to be considered to distinguish between adolescent and adult dating relationships. This study tested the age-sensitive effect of adolescent dating relationships. The hypothesis is based on the assumption that adolescent dating relationships at earlier ages are characterized by inexperience and instability compared with the relationships at later ages. At the same time, dating activities may often include sexual activities. Dating experience with sexual activities could be another way of measuring different characteristics of dating relationship. Risky sexual behavior by adolescents would have negative impacts on their behavior. At the first round of the NLSY97, sexual activities were measured only among older birth cohorts, and they were also measured when respondents turned 14 years old or older at the time of the interview. Also, the questions about sexual activities, such as whether the respondents had sex and how old they were when they had their first sexual experience, were not necessarily related to dating activities, possibly because these dimensions were tapped by a separate set of questions. In addition, it was unknown how respondents interpreted the meaning of “sex.” Diverse approaches to measure different types of adolescent dating relationships would lead other interesting findings.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study did make important inroads with regard to the relationship between adolescent dating experience and delinquency. It illustrates the importance of a multifaceted approach to the particular relationship. Also, this study has provided a model that can be used to guide future research on the adolescent dating and delinquency relationship. The next step for research on adolescent and criminal behavior may well focus on how characteristics of dating change as one ages and whether the changes are related to the decrease in the effect of dating on delinquent behavior. Of particular interest would be whether the age-sensitive effect of adolescent dating experience is related to the changes in the intimacy and stability aspects of dating relationships.</p>

<p>The sample size is different for each type of criminal activity or substance use. This is because each analysis is based on one specific type of criminal activity.
