<abstract>
<p>Previous research showed that the functional monomer 10-methacryloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP) ionically bonds to hydroxyapatite (HAp) and forms a nano- layered structure at the interface with HAp-based substrates. Such hydrophobic nano-layering is considered to contribute to the long-term durability of the bond to tooth tissue. However, dental adhesives are complex mixtures usually containing different monomers. This study investigated the effect of the monomer 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) on the chemical interaction of MDP with HAp by x-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). We examined the chemical interaction of 5 experimental MDP solutions with increasing concentrations of HEMA. XRD revealed that addition of HEMA inhibits nano-layering at the interface, while NMR confirmed that MDP remained adsorbed onto the HAp surface. QCM confirmed this adsorption of MDP to HAp, as well as revealed that the demineralization rate of HAp by MDP was reduced by HEMA. It was concluded that even though the adsorption of MDP to HAp was not hindered, addition of HEMA inhibited interfacial nano-layering. Potential consequences with regard to bond durability necessitate further research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>‘Mild’ self-etch adhesives typically create submicron hybrid layers, in which hydroxyapatite (HAp) remains around collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512460396">Van Meerbeek <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Their bonding mechanism to enamel/dentin relies on micro-mechanical retention and chemical bonding of the functional monomer with residual HAp. According to the ‘Adhesion-Decalcification’ concept, a functional monomer can ionically interact through a carboxylic/phosphoric/ phosphonic group with Ca of HAp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512460396">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512460396">2004</xref>). Such primary chemical bonding contributes to the long-term bond durability of self-etch adhesives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512460396">Inoue <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Among 3 functional monomers (10-methacryloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate, MDP; 4-methacryloyloxyethyl-trimellitic acid, 4-MET; 2- methacryloxyethyl phenyl hydrogen phosphate, Phenyl-P), MDP ionically bonded most effectively to HAp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512460396">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). This was ascribed to MDP-Ca salt deposition and the self-assembly of a nano-layered structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512460396">Yoshihara <italic>et al</italic>., 2011a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512460396">b</xref>). The strong hydrophobicity of such nano-layering is thought to contribute to the interfacial stability, thereby protecting the hybrid layer against hydrolytic bond-degradation processes.</p>
<p>The co-monomer HEMA (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) is frequently added to adhesives. This water-soluble monomer with its hydroxyl group cannot interact ionically with HAp. Nevertheless, HEMA is often added to improve dentin wetting and increase bond strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512460396">Van Landuyt <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). HEMA prevents phase-separation by homogenizing hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512460396">Van Landuyt <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). As a drawback, HEMA promotes water uptake and thus hydrolysis at the adhesive interface, thereby affecting the durability of the bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512460396">Breschi <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512460396">Van Landuyt <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In a continuation of previous research, having characterized the molecular interaction of solely the functional monomer MDP with HAp, we now aimed to study the effect of HEMA on the chemical bonding efficiency of MDP to HAp. The null-hypothesis tested was that HEMA would not affect the interaction of MDP with HAp.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<p>Details regarding the origin of the materials used, the protocol for preparation of the monomer-coated HAp particles, and the actual conditions for the 3 chemical analyses can be found in the Appendix.</p>
<p>Five different ‘MDP-x%HEMA’ and 1 MDP-free formulations were prepared (Appendix Table). The solutions were allowed to interact with HAp particles for 5 min (‘MDP-x%HEMA_5min’; short term) and 30 min (‘MDP-x%HEMA_30min’; long term), respectively. The exposure times were longer than typical clinically, but were required for the investigation of mechanisms when HAp powder was used instead of actual dentin. The relevance of this approach was supported by evidence showing the layering effect on enamel and dentin with clinically relevant application times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512460396">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). We used x-ray diffraction (XRD) to identify the crystal phases of the monomer-coated HAp samples. Using Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) and Cross polarization (CP) MAS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance [(CP-)MAS NMR], we analyzed the adsorption of MDP onto HAp. In addition, <sup>1</sup>H MAS NMR spectra enabled us to analyze the local structure around the H atoms of MDP, HEMA, and HAp. For comparison, <sup>1</sup>H→<sup>31</sup>P CP-MAS and <sup>1</sup>H MAS NMR spectra of HAp and the MDP-free ‘no-MDP-8%HEMA’ formulation were also acquired. Finally, quartz crystal micro-balance with dissipation (QCM-D) was used to characterize, in real time, the potential interference of HEMA on the interaction of MDP with HAp. Only the experimental ‘MDP-0/8/15%HEMA’ formulations were tested with QCM-D, since higher HEMA concentrations revealed unstable data.</p>

<p>XRD revealed that HEMA influenced the MDP-Ca salt formation (nano-layering). All formulations showed diffraction peaks representing HAp (range of 2θ = 10.7°-66.3°; only small peaks at 2θ = 10.7°/16.7°/21.7° are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512460396">Figs. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512460396">1b</xref>, asterisks).

Only a very weak peak in the range of 2θ = 4.6°, attributed to nano-layering, was observed for ‘MDP-8%HEMA_5min’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512460396">Fig. 1a</xref>: arrow). With increasing HEMA concentrations (‘MDP-15/23/30%HEMA_5min’), peaks representing MDP-Ca salts were no longer distinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512460396">Fig. 1a</xref>). All ‘MDP-x% HEMA_30min’ formulations revealed diffraction peaks, with the peaks at 2θ = 2.2°/4.56°/6.9° representing nano-layering. The latter peak intensities decreased with increasing HEMA concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512460396">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>

<p>For the HEMA-free ‘MDP-0%HEMA_5min’ formulation, <sup>1</sup>H→<sup>31</sup>P CP-MAS NMR revealed, in addition to the 2.81-ppm peak (HAp), a peak at -1.96 ppm that should be assigned to MDP-Ca salts (nano- layering) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512460396">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512460396">Fukegawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).

The shoulder peaks can represent a few chemical species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512460396">Yoshihara <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), such as adsorbed anionic MDP (proton-dissociated MDP or ‘MHP’) and/or hydrogen-phosphate anions (HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>; 0.8 ppm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512460396">Jarlbring <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), as possible precursors of nano-layering and/or DCPD.

<p>Representative time evolutions showed the frequency shift ‘Δf’ of the HAp-sensor for the 3 ‘MDP-0/8/15%HEMA’ formulations tested. When the MDP solutions were injected after 1 min, the frequency of the HAp-sensor dropped significantly to reach a stable frequency after about 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512460396">Fig. 3</xref>). Since the viscosity of the adhesive formulations increases with the HEMA concentration, the highest drop was measured for ‘MDP-15%HEMA’. The slope of the frequency shift within the next 4-minute period was calculated by the least-squares method as 2.14 Hz/min for ‘MDP-0%HEMA’, 1.40 Hz/min for ‘MDP-8%HEMA’, and 0.58 Hz/min for ‘MDP-15%HEMA’. This slope of the frequency shift should be attributed to gradual dissolution of HAp by MDP, clearly most intense in the absence of HEMA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previously, we studied the chemical bonding capacity of solely the functional monomer to HAp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512460396">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, adhesives are complex mixtures, containing several different functional and cross- linking monomers, and other ingredients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512460396">Van Landuyt <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). To better understand the molecular interplay of these compounds, and in particular their effects on the chemical interaction of MDP with HAp, we aimed to investigate the effect of HEMA on the chemical bonding capacity of the most effective functional monomer MDP.</p>
<p>The chemical interaction of MDP with HAp was shown to involve different phases: (1) MDP ionically binds to Ca of HAp; (2) simultaneously, MDP superficially extracts Ca from HAp, forming MDP-Ca salts that self-assemble into nano-layering, while other MDPs remain attached to HAp, and, finally (3), DCPD (CaHPO<sub>4</sub>•2H<sub>2</sub>O) since more soluble calcium-phosphate salts are formed through reaction of Ca with phosphate (HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup>) ions released from HAp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512460396">Fukegawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Regarding the last phase, it should be stated that when the acidic functional monomer MDP reacts with HAp, the latter is dissolved and DCPD formed at the initial low pH. This occurs since, at pH values lower than 4.0, DCPD is more stable than HAp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512460396">Johnsson and Nancollas, 1992</xref>). However, following HAp dissolution, the pH rises, by which DCPD becomes less stable than HAp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512460396">Fukegawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512460396">Yoshihara <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). We hence hypothesized that the production of DCPD proves that HAp was demineralized. Moreover, the dissolution ratio of MDP-Ca salts [6.8 mg/L; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512460396">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) is lower than that of DCPD [320 mg/L; technical information from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), thereby explaining that the formation of MDP-Ca salts occurs faster than that of DCPD. Further in-depth analysis of DCPD formation is needed.</p>
<p>This study revealed that HEMA significantly affected the chemical interaction of MDP with HAp. Although MDP remained adsorbed to HAp, nano-layering was already hampered for HEMA added in the lowest 8% concentration. Our null hypothesis must thus be rejected.</p>
<p>XRD confirmed our previous research, in which MDP was found to simultaneously adsorb to and decalcify HAp; it resulted in a MDP-Ca salt-layered structure through the reaction of the proton-dissociated MDP (MHP) with Ca. However, when HEMA was added, MDP-Ca salt formation was remarkably restrained, and the 3 peaks ascribed to the crystalline phase (nano-layering) were no longer observed. Since XRD can detect only crystalline structures, we also used NMR to investigate the chemical interaction of MDP with HAp, to unravel the mechanisms of how HEMA inhibits nano-layering.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>H→ <sup>31</sup>P CP-MAS NMR revealed a distinct shoulder peak for all experimental formulations when allowed to interact for 30 min (long term). The higher the HEMA concentration, the lower the peak intensity, indicating that HEMA clearly interfered with the interaction of MDP with HAp. When allowed to interact with HAp for only 5 min, a distinct shoulder peak was detected for the HEMA-free MDP formulation, with only very weak shoulder peaks for the HEMA-containing formulations; the intensity of the latter shoulder peaks did not depend on the molar HEMA-to-EtOH ratio. These shoulder peaks represent MDP adsorbed onto HAp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512460396">Fukegawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The relatively broad width of the 1.8-ppm peak measured for the HEMA-free (‘MDP-0%HEMA’) sample, as compared with the narrowing width measured with the higher concentration of HEMA, confirms the immobility of the MDP molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512460396">Schachter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Moreover, the line shape of a <sup>1</sup>H solid-state NMR spectrum is very sensitive to molecular motion, since rotational molecular motion can effectively reduce the proton–proton nuclear spin dipolar couplings that dominate the <sup>1</sup>H solid-state NMR line shape. A decrease in the line width is indicative of increased molecular motion. This means that MDP molecules of the ‘MDP-0%HEMA’ sample produced nano-layering, and thus immobilized the MDP molecules involved. However, with increasing HEMA concentration, HEMA molecules also adsorbed more onto HAp. As the XRD and NMR samples were washed with EtOH, the HEMA molecules were removed from HAp, resulting in a less dense population of MDP absorbed to HAp (the lower the MDP absorption, the higher the HEMA concentration). This was confirmed by analysis of the 5-minute XRD data that did not disclose nano-layering for the HEMA-containing formulations.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>H MAS NMR revealed, for all experimental formulations, the presence of H, theoretically to be assigned to either HEMA or MDP. However, this must be ascribed to the adsorption of MDP, since it could not be observed for the MDP-free formulation (‘noMDP-8%HEMA’).</p>
<p>Both the <sup>1</sup>H→<sup>31</sup>P and <sup>1</sup>H MAS NMR spectra thus proved that HEMA did not prevent the adsorption of MDP onto HAp, yet inhibited MDP-Ca salt formation (nano-layering). A plausible explanation for this nano-layering inhibitory effect of HEMA may be the suppression of nucleation and growth of MDP-Ca salts by intermolecular interactions between HEMA and MDP.</p>
<p>QCM is a highly sensitive analysis tool for real-time measurements of adsorption of macromolecules to surfaces, here HAp, and for analysis of their conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512460396">Höök <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512460396">Monkawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). To our knowledge, QCM has not been used before to monitor, in real time, the adsorption/demineralization behavior of monomers at HAp. We used relatively highly concentrated monomer solutions, and therefore could not analyze dissipation shifts. The drop in oscillating frequency was directly related to the solution viscosity, which increased with a higher concentration of HEMA. After 2 min, a steadily increasing frequency shift was recorded for all 3 monomer solutions, but remained clearly less pronounced when more HEMA was present. This increase in frequency should be attributed to the interaction of MDP, gradually demineralizing HAp, a process that is counteracted by HEMA.</p>
<p>Correlating all the XRD/NMR/QCM data enabled us to develop a model that explains the mechanisms of interfacial interaction of MDP and HEMA with HAp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512460396">Fig. 4</xref>). The MDP-only formulation resulted, in the short term, in strong adsorption of MDP to HAp that subsequently demineralized HAp (release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions) and produced MDP-Ca salts (nano- layering) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512460396">Fig. 4a</xref>). Over the long term, this effect was intensified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512460396">Fig. 4a</xref>). When washed with EtOH, MDP remained adsorbed to HAp because it bonded ionically. A less dense population of MDP adhered to HAp was recorded for the combined MDP-HEMA solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512460396">Fig. 4b</xref>). This should be ascribed to the HEMA that also adsorbed to HAp, hindering MDP from interacting and thus from demineralizing HAp in the short term. Hence, in the short term, MDP adsorbed to HAp (less intensively), but did not produce nano-layering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512460396">Fig. 4b</xref>). However, since HEMA did not adsorb strongly to HAp, it did not resist EtOH-washing. Consequently, over the long term, HEMA did not remain adsorbed to HAp so that MDP could demineralize HAp more and produce nano-layering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512460396">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>

<p>An alternative explanation may be that water in the composition of the tested ‘MDP-x% HEMA’ formulations is essential for the chemical interaction of MDP with HAp. Analysis of previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512460396">Fukegawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) indeed showed that MDP-coated HAp without water in the composition did not form nano-layering of MDP-Ca salts. Since HEMA is very hydrophilic, it may have bound the water in the composition (Appendix Table) and render the latter less readily available for MDP to demineralize the HAp.</p>
<p>Additional chemical bonding to HAp by functional monomers like MDP has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to improve the resistance of the bond to aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512460396">Inoue <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Clinically, a self-etch adhesive/primer is not washed with water/ethanol, so HEMA remains and is expected to interfere with the interaction of MDP with HAp. Also, since a separate primer (as part of a two-step self-etch adhesive) has a higher concentration of functional monomers like MDP, it should result in a better chemical bonding potential than a one-step self-etch adhesive, in which all ingredients are mixed into one solution. Furthermore, so-called ‘HEMA-free/poor’ one-step adhesives should theoretically also possess a higher chemical bonding potential than ‘HEMA-rich’ one-step adhesives. Since they do not contain HEMA, they are also less sensitive to water sorption through osmosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512460396">Tay <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), this also is due to the direct benefit of long-term bond stability.</p>
<p>To conclude, HEMA significantly reduced nano-layering, because it reduced the HAp-demineralization rate, a prerequisite to the formation of MDP-Ca salts. HEMA does interfere but does not completely inhibit MDP from interacting chemically with HAp. The correlative use of the 3 investigation methods proved that MDP still adhered to HAp. More research is warranted to investigate the clinical impact of these mechanistic findings on the interfacial interaction of monomers at HAp.</p>
