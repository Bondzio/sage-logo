<p>This book edited by Farnsworth and Irving is an informative contribution to the understanding of the implications of the recent economic crisis on national social policy systems. Its main message is that in order to fully comprehend the nature of the post-2007 policy shifts we have to unpack the international crisis into a series of national variations that depend on the historical record of each country and the way in which national actors chose to defend their economies. The extent of the welfare state transformation is thus conditioned both by the objective reality of the international system and by its political interpretation at the national level. Welfare reforms are possible, but their logic and motivation are likely to differ from one context to another.</p>
<p>The book is structured in two parts. The first part provides an introduction to the political and economic consequences of the recent crisis. In chapter two, Michael Hill asks whether the crisis provoked a paradigm shift in economic policy and argues that at least until now we are not witnessing one. The chapter also exposes the limits of a ‘paradigm shift’ type of analysis that requires interpretation after the event and makes it difficult to understand present changes through such a lens. In chapter three, Ian Gough argues that the economic crash has provoked a fiscal crisis of the state that has significant consequences for the welfare sector. The next chapter, by Adrian Sinfield, explores the social costs linked with a growth model based on financial markets and deregulation. The following two chapters describe the international dynamics of the crisis in terms of ideas (Bob Deacon) and the north–south divide (Armado Barrientons). The former makes a strong case for careful consideration of social assistance programmes in developing countries. While the crisis is likely to spark a series of short-term emergency responses through the expansion of some social assistance programmes, there are concerns that these will not address the protracted causes of poverty.</p>
<p>The second part is an unsystematic selection of national accounts that seek to probe the diversity welfare responses in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Chapters seven and eight analyse the social policy responses in South Korea and China, respectively. While chapter seven concentrates more on the changes produced by the 1997 Asian financial crisis on South Korea’s welfare policies, in chapter eight we are brought back to present and confronted with a map of social policy changes in China since 2007. Chapters nine to eleven cover the cases of Germany, Ireland and Iceland, respectively. From the German case we learn that welfare changes began well before the current economic crisis, while evidence from the Irish case suggests that the crisis reinforced pre-existent economic thinking based on neo-liberal globalization and welfare retrenchment. In line with previous studies on small economies, the chapter on Iceland reveals that ‘size matters in the development of the welfare state’. The contribution by Pekka Kosonen in chapter eleven contrasts the ‘homemade’ crisis of the 1990s in Denmark, Finland and Sweden with the recent global downturn. His contribution underlines that the welfare responses to the previous crises conditioned how these countries reacted to the present one. The two final country chapters explore the politics of crisis in US, Canada and the UK. The comparison between the US and Canada reveals that the crisis had a much deeper impact on the latter’s electoral politics. At the same time, some parametric welfare reforms took place in Canada where the government temporarily extended the duration of unemployment benefits. Scrutinizing the policy responses in the UK, Kevin Farnsworth argues that they entail a massive reduction in the size of the state and are ideologically rather than rationally motivated. The concluding chapter, by Farnsworth and Irving, restates the complexity of the effects of the crisis on national systems and emphasizes the fluidity of the present economic context.</p>
<p>The strength of the book lies in its very diverse set of cases, which are well documented and intelligently placed together by the introductory and concluding chapters. However, this is also the book’s Achilles’ heel: the chapters are uneven in their theoretical and empirical approach, affecting the coherence of the book and making it sometimes difficult for the reader to follow. This also limits the comparative lessons that can be derived; from reading the book we are left to wonder if there is anything beyond the trivial ‘it depends’. Nonetheless, the book is a useful collection of social policy analyses and a stimulating reflection on the politics of the recent economic crisis. It offers a point of departure for a more focused and theoretically grounded research agenda aimed at explaining the effects of the recent economic crisis on the social policy sector.</p>
