<abstract>
<p>Persons with disabilities have been underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields for many years. Reasons for this include low expectations for students with disabilities, limited exposure to prerequisite courses, lack of role models, and lack of access to individualized supports. This article identifies the issues related to the participation of students with learning disabilities and emotional and behavioral disorders in STEM college programs and provides transition planning strategies for assisting and encouraging students as they prepare for and succeed in STEM programs. A case study of a student with a disability who had a goal of pursuing a STEM career illustrates the issues commonly faced by students with disabilities. Research-based planning strategies addressing these issues that help ensure student success are provided.</p>

<p>The fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) make substantial contributions to our global leadership and play an important role in an array of issues from health care to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212443151">Nagle, Marder, &amp; Schiller, 2009</xref>). STEM fields are diverse and include such areas as computer sciences, chemistry, chemical engineering, agricultural sciences, forestry, psychology, and ecology. Graduates of STEM programs can find jobs as researchers, teachers, health care practitioners, high-level managers in the government or private sector, engineers, and even writers or artists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212443151">Hasse, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the employment outlook for the STEM fields is good. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projected a 22% increase in STEM occupations from 2004 through 2014. Even though it is acknowledged that the STEM fields hold great promise as a career choice for secondary students, several groups are underrepresented in the STEM areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212443151">Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering, 2006</xref>). One of these underrepresented groups is individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>Barriers to STEM careers for persons with disabilities include factors related to educational experiences and preparation (e.g., less time in structured math and science) as well as employment issues (e.g., lack of understanding of disabilities and their implications for employment). Obstacles faced vary depending on disability type (A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212443151">Lee, 2011</xref>). Common barriers to accessing STEM education for all students with disabilities include (a) lack of STEM role models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212443151">Hasse, 2011</xref>; A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212443151">Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053451212443151">Napper, Hale, &amp; Puckett, 2002</xref>); (b) parent and teacher misperceptions that students with disabilities cannot be successful in STEM, resulting in lack of encouragement to take courses in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212443151">Alston &amp; Hampton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053451212443151">National Science Foundation, 2002</xref>); (c) lack of appropriate information and counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212443151">Alston, Bell, &amp; Hampton, 2002</xref>); (d) teacher lack of knowledge and skill regarding how to include students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053451212443151">Rule, Stefanich, Hadelhuhn, &amp; Peiffer, 2009</xref>); (e) technical barriers to science education (e.g., inaccessible labs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212443151">Hasse, 2011</xref>); and (f) lower participation rates in structured and unstructured STEM-related activities (e.g., math, science; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212443151">Eriksson, Welander, &amp; Granlund, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Students with <italic>hidden disabilities</italic>, such as learning disabilities (LD), emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), encounter additional obstacles at both the secondary and postsecondary levels. For example, many people do not view hidden disabilities as authentic and perceive individuals with invisible disabilities as lazy, trying to use their disability to get out of work, or incapable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212443151">Denhart, 2008</xref>; A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212443151">Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1053451212443151">Wolanin &amp; Steele, 2004</xref>). Consequently, they are not encouraged to consider and prepare for careers in the STEM areas. These obstacles are not insurmountable, but they do require that students, teachers, parents, and counselors be deliberate in the transition counseling and preparation process. This article identifies evidence-based strategies that will assist students with high-incidence disabilities to pursue a STEM career. A case study illustrates issues commonly encountered by students with high-incidence disabilities as well as highlights potential suggestions. The information and strategies provided should help guide teachers as they work with students with high-incidence disabilities and their families to develop transition plans focused on students’ expressed interests and goals.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451212443151">
<title>Tim: A Case Study</title>
<p>Tim is a student with an LD and a health condition (other health impairment) who has struggled throughout his years in public school (see <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1053451212443151">Note 1</xref>). Although he is quite intelligent, bouts with his health problems have caused him to be absent from school for days at a time, resulting in an ongoing struggle to make up his work. Because of his LD, Tim has short-term and working memory problems. A typical progress report for Tim would include a smattering of zero percentages mixed in with percentages of 80s and 90s. This <italic>yo-yo</italic> effect would result in a vicious cycle of catching up, just to fall behind again, leading to feelings of helplessness and frustration. Tim has been included in general education classes, and as he entered high school the focus of his individualized education program (IEP) meetings has been on completing his academic coursework with limited attention to transition issues.</p>
<p>Before beginning 11th grade, Tim and his parents met with his school counselor to discuss his course schedule. As they discussed his course options for the upcoming year, Tim expressed a desire to take algebra II with trigonometry, which his parents supported. This class was particularly relevant given his career interest in building sciences, which was fostered by earlier experiences with a Youth Experiences in Science summer camp during middle school and the previous year’s career technical education mechanical engineering class. Despite this background and interest, the school counselor suggested an applied math class. Tim had taken geometry with Mr. Yates, who was scheduled to teach the upcoming class in question. Mr. Yates was consulted and stated, “I have the same expectations for any student in my classroom. If he needs extra time, I understand and will accommodate those needs.” He also suggested that Tim be assigned as his teacher’s aide for the algebra I class scheduled earlier in the day. Tim was pleased that Mr. Yates wanted him to serve in this capacity, and his parents thought this was a good idea. The counselor registered Tim for teacher’s aide for second period and algebra II with trigonometry for fourth period.</p>

<sec id="section2-1053451212443151">
<title>Barriers to STEM Fields</title>
<p>As Tim experienced too often, other people have low expectations of the capability of students with disabilities in STEM content. These low expectations and the lack of adequate accommodations are key barriers that impede the success of persons with disabilities in STEM curricula and fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212443151">AccessSTEM, 2007</xref>). These two barriers are particularly important for teachers to consider because they have complete control to decide if these barriers exist or not. Teachers should be willing to examine and raise their own expectations and also be willing to make accommodations; they can make a difference in the access to STEM areas that students with disabilities will have.</p>
<sec id="section3-1053451212443151">
<title>Low Expectations</title>
<p>Teacher expectations of students in their classrooms have long been a topic of study in educational literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212443151">Brophy &amp; Good, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053451212443151">Rosenthal &amp; Jacobson, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053451212443151">Rubie-Davies, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1053451212443151">Weinstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1053451212443151">Weinstein, Marshall, Sharp, &amp; Botkin, 1987</xref>). In general, this body of research has found that teachers have differential expectations for students in their classrooms. Although the impact of teacher expectations has been well documented, it has also been found that during the early secondary years, the effects of teachers’ expectation bias may be partly dissipated; however, the bias remains stable over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212443151">de Boer, Bosker, &amp; vander Werf, 2010</xref>). Teachers need to be aware of the potential impact their expectations may have on their students, particularly in the influential early secondary years. This is the time when persistence in STEM education can be nurtured and interest in careers in these areas cultivated, or tragically discouraged and, even worse, dismissed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1053451212443151">
<title>Inability to Access Content</title>
<p>In addition to the barrier of low expectations, students with disabilities often face other issues associated with gaining access to content. Many students with disabilities need nontraditional ways of learning and an array of teaching methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1053451212443151">Sternberg &amp; Grigorenko, 2002</xref>). For example, many teachers lack the knowledge and skills to meaningfully include students with disabilities in math and science courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053451212443151">Rule et al., 2009</xref>). That is, they do not know how to adapt instruction and materials so that content is easier to understand and remember (e.g., use of graphic organizers, multiple means of presenting material) and do not know how to provide appropriate accommodations (e.g., progress updates, taking exams in smaller units).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212443151">Table 1</xref> provides strategies and examples for encouraging involvement and preparation for STEM based on Tim’s experiences. These and additional strategies are described in more detail in the remainder of this article.</p>

<title>Strategies for Success in STEM Fields</title>
<p>A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212443151">Lee (2011)</xref> suggested that to ensure a larger proportion of high school students are prepared for STEM majors, individually designed learning experiences must be provided. These experiences must include not only academics but also experiences outside the traditional classroom. These academic and extracurricular experiences should promote students’ (a) interest and motivation in STEM; (b) deep understanding of mathematics, science, and other content and ways to apply knowledge and skill creatively in problem-solving situations; and (c) understanding that persons with disabilities can indeed be successful in STEM careers. As such, transition planning must consider the strategies and interventions that address the building of both competence and confidence in STEM. This can be accomplished by considering the following in laying the foundation for postsecondary education in STEM: students’ (a) personal development, (b) access to content, (c) experiential development, and (d) postsecondary connecting activities.</p>
<sec id="section6-1053451212443151">
<title>Students’ Personal Development</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1053451212443151">Summers (2008)</xref> identified one of the key predictors of persistence in STEM programs as the ability to communicate needs and identify appropriate accommodations. The importance of understanding one’s abilities and needs and being able to communicate them to others was underscored in a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1053451212443151">U.S. Office of Civil Rights (2011)</xref> report that identified attitude and self-advocacy skills of students with disabilities as possibly two of “the most important factors in determining their success or failure in postsecondary education” (Keys to Success section, para. 1). Many of these skills are considered components of self-determination that have been found to be related to positive postschool outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1053451212443151">Wehmeyer &amp; Schwartz, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-determination has been defined as “a combination of skills, knowledge, and beliefs that enable a person to engage in goal-directed, self-regulated, autonomous behavior. An understanding of one’s strengths and limitations, together with a belief of oneself as capable and effective are essential to self-determination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212443151">Field, Martin, Miller, Ward, &amp; Wehmeyer, 1998</xref>, p. 2). Many of the skills associated with self-determination, such as acknowledging, understanding, and accepting one’s disability; knowing one’s strengths, weaknesses, and needs; and self-advocating to ensure proper accommodations are provided, have been linked to students with disabilities’ persistence and success in STEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212443151">Cooper &amp; Pruitt, 2005</xref>; A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212443151">Lee, 2011</xref>). Students with hidden disabilities may lack these skills, however, and may face unique and challenging barriers to achieving self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212443151">Cooper &amp; Pruitt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212443151">Denhart, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212443151">Field, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Students with disabilities must be able to identify their disability and understand the functional limitations of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1053451212443151">U.S. Office of Civil Rights, 2011</xref>). They need to know their abilities, strengths, weaknesses, and individual accommodation needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212443151">Brinckerhoff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1053451212443151">Thoma, Bartholomew, &amp; Scott, 2009</xref>). For students with LD, understanding their particular disability and the conditions in which they experience difficulty, knowing their strengths and skills, and knowing how to compensate for their specific disability are particularly important considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212443151">Kochhar-Bryant, Bassett, &amp; Webb, 2009</xref>). For students with ADHD, the assessment of skills and identification of needs in executive functioning (e.g., planning, paying attention, decision making, time management) and the identification of stressors and strategies to decrease stress are key (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212443151">Kochhar-Bryant et al., 2009</xref>). Students with EBD in particular need to learn how to recognize symptoms that might signal emotional episodes of disability and build a history of accommodations and their justification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212443151">Kochhar-Bryant et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Students must develop self-advocacy skills before entering postsecondary education (A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212443151">Lee, 2011</xref>). This can be accomplished by using curricula and materials focused on understanding one’s disabilities and legal rights and responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053451212443151">Price, Gerber, &amp; Mulligan, 2007</xref>) and using instructional strategies and environmental considerations, such as modeling, cooperative learning, opportunities for choice, coaching, attribution retraining, and behavioral strategies, to encourage self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212443151">Field, 2008</xref>). As well, students should be encouraged to explain their disabilities and services needs to teachers and be active participants in IEP or Section 504 meetings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1053451212443151">
<title>Access to Content</title>
<p>Students with LD, ADHD, and EBD need school-based supports, including access to the curriculum and encouragement from teachers and related personnel. These supports during the middle and high school years provide students with a foundation to further their postsecondary education in STEM fields. Students need to take more than the minimum number of math and science requirements for graduation. The level of courses is also important. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1053451212443151">Tyson, Lee, Borman, and Hanson (2007)</xref> found that successful completion of a high school physics class has a direct connection to students receiving bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields. In addition, in a study of rigorous high schools, American College Testing (ACT) underscored the importance of students taking algebra II (over and above the more common algebra I and geometry) and chemistry (over and above the more common biology) to meeting or exceeding ACT College Readiness Benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212443151">ACT, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Universal design, technology, and accommodations have been found to be beneficial for participation in STEM curricula by students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212443151">AccessSTEM, 2007</xref>). Universal design for learning (UDL) targets the concept of access toward learning through flexible curricula and instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212443151">Bernacchio &amp; Mullen, 2007</xref>) and provides many opportunities for students who take courses in STEM. Instructors can apply UDL in their courses by considering such elements as the use of lectures, discussions, videos, printed materials, technology, and field work. Instead of focusing on adapting materials for students, an accessible product can be initially created to benefit everyone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053451212443151">Scott, McGuire, &amp; Shaw, 2003</xref>). Although UDL principles benefit all students, they do not eliminate the need for specific accommodations for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212443151">Burgstahler, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Using technology has been recognized as an effective practice to increase students with disabilities’ participation in STEM areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212443151">AccessSTEM, 2007</xref>). Computers, assistive technology (AT), and network resources can link the communication and accessibility for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212443151">Burgstahler, 1994</xref>). Among the many available technologies are variable speech-control tape recorders, reading machines, listening aids, voice output systems that read back text displayed on the computer screen, speech-recognition systems, data managers, and talking calculators.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the use of AT has often been considered for only those students with severe physical disabilities (H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451212443151">Lee &amp; Templeton, 2008</xref>). AT devices, for example, now help “support students with memory, organization, problem solving, reading, writing, and math” (H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451212443151">Lee &amp; Templeton, 2008</xref>, p. 214). Assistance in these areas is especially relevant to students with high-incidence disabilities because often these students have deficits in these areas.</p>
<p>Technology can also be used to augment students’ learning. For example, digital games and simulations are increasingly being used to raise achievement and prepare students for future technology challenges. One such game, among many, is the Global Challenge World Game, which uses the Microsoft ESP visual simulation platform. The purpose is to offer precollege students opportunities for self-directed learning in STEM. Students participate in an intensive, three-dimensional experience that utilizes computational science, simulation, and telecommunication tools that help them develop an “understanding of the complex nature of global systems that are involved in meeting such challenges as climate change and the future of energy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451212443151">Gibson &amp; Grasso, 2008</xref>, Synopsis section, para. 1).</p>
<p>The use of accommodations for students with disabilities has continued to draw skepticism and concerns in that some people think that it gives these students an unfair advantage over their peers without disabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212443151">Brinckerhoff and Banerjee (2007)</xref> suggested that persons with disabilities build a case for requesting accommodations. They warned against basing the need for accommodations on a single source of information, whether from a subtest or the individual with the disability himself or herself. This is especially important because too often people do not consider hidden disabilities as legitimate and or in need of accommodations. Taking these suggestions into consideration, the use of appropriate accommodations can be beneficial to students with disabilities.</p>

<title>Experiential Development</title>
<p>An important consideration in preparing students for STEM fields is to supplement their academic programs with applied experiences, including after-school programs, extracurricular activities, mentors, and special programs. These authentic experiences can occur in person or virtually through online exchanges (e.g., blogs, wikis, tweets). In either case, they enhance students’ skills and attitudes toward the STEM areas. Hands-on instruction and applied experiences are acknowledged as effective strategies for increasing the diversity of the STEM field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212443151">Liston, Peterson, &amp; Ragan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212443151">Malian, 2007</xref>). Not only do they increase content knowledge and learning, but they also contribute to increased self-confidence and career knowledge, motivation, and access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212443151">Lam, Doverspike, Zhao, Zhe, &amp; Menzemer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212443151">Malian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053451212443151">Mastropieri &amp; Scruggs, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Research suggests that these experiences must begin early, no later than middle school, because early learning experiences play a critical role in career development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212443151">Lam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212443151">Malian, 2007</xref>). Early experiences “shape self-efficacy, beliefs, and outcome expectations, which in turn affect the formation of vocational interests, which subsequently influence occupational goals, choice actions and performance attainments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212443151">Lam et al., 2008</xref>, p. 22).</p>
<p>Hands-on instruction and experiences can be formal or informal, occurring during the traditional school day or outside of school in a variety of ways. After-school programs are “safe spaces that support healthy social and educational development, teach crucial 21st century skills and promote academic success” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053451212443151">National Partnership for After School Education, n.d</xref>., What Is Afterschool? section, para. 1). Growing rapidly, after-school programs have the potential to provide opportunities to cultivate academic, vocational, and social-behavioral success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212443151">Fancsali, 2002</xref>). These programs can be supplementary to the school curriculum (i.e., aligned with school content) or complementary (i.e., more of a focus on exploration and development of inquiry skills; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053451212443151">National Partnership for After School Education, n.d</xref>.).</p>
<p>Extracurricular activities are another avenue for helping students get involved in and learn more about STEM fields. They provide opportunities for students to engage in extensions of academic activities, explore career paths, develop confidence in their abilities, and develop a network of other students with similar interests and goals as well as earn recognition for skills through awards and scholarships. These activities can range from school clubs to international competitions and projects. School clubs related to math and science can include astronomy, chess, computer programming, robotics, and ecology. Examples of competitions include Science Olympiad, Math National Science Bowl, American Computer Science League, MATHCOUNTS, BEST Robotics, and Real World Design Challenge. Other programs often adopted by schools include the JASON Project and Cogito, which provide students the opportunity to learn about budding young scientists their own age and more experienced scientists, cutting-edge research, and how the researchers managed to get where they are.</p>

<sec id="section9-1053451212443151">
<title>Mentors</title>
<p>Mentors and role models can serve as educational partners and possess both the practical knowledge and personal experience that can be “pivotal in breaking down barriers and encouraging students to persevere in their chosen disciplines” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212443151">American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2002</xref>, p. 2). Mentoring can occur in many ways, such as one-on-one or in small groups and through personal meetings, e-mail exchanges, telephone conversations, or other forms of correspondence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053451212443151">Sword &amp; Hill, 2002</xref>). In a review of evidence-based practices in mentoring students with disabilities in STEM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1053451212443151">Stumbo et al. (2010–2011)</xref> identified the following as important in the development of programs: (a) opportunities for interaction, relationship building, and social role development via direct contact or the Internet; (b) flexibility in approach related to individuals’ preferences, styles, and needs; and (c) mentor training. They also noted that in effective programs, mentoring is just one component of an overall program that provides “multiple-exposure opportunities” (p. 50) to STEM, such as campus tours, summer camps, community events, newsletters, and online social networking. If formal mentoring programs are not locally available, there are a number of online mentoring programs, including AccessComputing, AccessSTEM, and DO-IT Pals. Mentors can also be friends or family.</p>
<p>Special programs aimed at exploring career paths and developing skills in STEM for middle and high school students are available at the local, regional, national, and international levels. STEM schools are popping up across the country. They include public magnet schools, charter schools, and private schools. An increasing number of these programs target underrepresented groups. Precollege STEM bridge programs offered at many universities provide secondary students with experiences in math, science, engineering, health care, and technology, as well as an orientation to the college environment. Some programs are for students with and without disabilities, whereas others are specifically for students from various underrepresented groups, including students with disabilities. The National Science Foundation’s Research in Disability Education Program funds Alliance projects that broaden the participation of people with disabilities in STEM. A common activity of many of the Alliance programs is summer, after-school, weekend, and residential programs specifically for students with disabilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1053451212443151">
<title>Postsecondary Connecting Activities</title>
<p>Another planning consideration is helping students connect with supports and services found at institutions of higher education that are either generally available to all students or specific for students with disabilities before they begin their postsecondary education. Examples of these include disability service and mentoring programs, internships, as well as self-advocacy and advocacy groups. All of these activities have been identified as strategies that affect success for students with disabilities in STEM fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1053451212443151">Summers, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Disability service programs provide resources such as technology labs, proctored exams, accommodation process assistance, tutoring referrals, and priority registration. Internships are extended practical opportunities in which students can gain experience in STEM fields. These experiences have been linked to increasing students’ confidence and self-efficacy as well as changing employers’ attitudes toward hiring persons with disabilities. Entry Points is an example of an internship program designed for students with disabilities in STEM, in which these students are placed at IBM, NASA, Google, and other partner companies and agencies. Students receive guidance from mentors as they develop and prepare for work.</p>
<p>Also, establishing relationships with others, either individually or through organized groups, including faculty mentor and peers, has been associated with persistence in STEM areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1053451212443151">Summers, 2008</xref>). Connecting with mentors and participating in mentoring programs at institutes of higher education encourage and support students to progress in their STEM development.</p>

<sec id="section11-1053451212443151">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Transition planning teams must consider how they can ensure high school students with disabilities who are interested in STEM have the requisite courses and experiences needed to develop their skills and attitudes critical for success in STEM college programs. Strategies for encouraging students with disabilities to engage in STEM include facilitating students’ personal development skills, such as teaching and providing them with opportunities to practice self-determination and self-advocacy; providing access to content by providing universal design, technology, and accommodations, as needed; encouraging students’ participation in experiential programs and activities that provide authentic experiences in the STEM areas; and connecting with postsecondary sources of supports, services, and experiences while still in high school. Implementing these and other approaches should help better prepare and transition students with disabilities into postsecondary STEM studies and eventually the workforce.</p>
