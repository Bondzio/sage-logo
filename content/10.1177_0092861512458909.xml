<abstract>
<p>The quality of a clinical trial can be assessed by whether the trial meets the needs of its various customers, as well as by its freedom from critical deficiencies or errors. In order to ensure the quality of a clinical trial, it is therefore important to conduct quality planning in parallel with the process to design and prior to the conduct of the trial. Quality planning consists of prospectively establishing quality goals and developing the products and processes required to deliver a quality trial. This article describes the quality planning process conducted by a pharmaceutical sponsor for a clinical trial and the pilot review of the resulting integrated quality management plan by the FDA. This pilot demonstrates the usefulness of this process to enable alignment between sponsors and regulators concerning quality in clinical trials.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past several years, a number of articles have characterized and promoted various approaches to quality assurance for clinical trials.<sup>

</sup> Much of this literature has focused on the monitoring process or source document verification and on the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6, which provides guidance on the monitoring of clinical trials.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512458909">7</xref>
</sup> To our knowledge, there has been a paucity of articles discussing an overall quality framework or Quality by Design (QbD) principles applied to clinical research or clinical trials. Recently, both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency have published draft guidance documents that make recommendations regarding risk-based monitoring and quality risk management in clinical trials.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Juran is often credited with introducing the concepts underlying QbD. The Juran Trilogy consists of three activities: quality planning, quality control, and quality improvement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512458909">10</xref>
</sup> “Quality planning is the activity of (a) establishing quality goals and (b) developing the products and processes required to meet those goals.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512458909">10</xref>
</sup> Specific methodology, skills, and tools have been developed to enable quality planning. Quality control is the process of evaluating actual performance against quality goals and taking corrective action where necessary. Quality improvement is “the means of raising quality performance to unprecedented levels.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512458909">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI; http://www.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/) is a public-private partnership between the FDA and Duke University, with a diverse membership from academia, clinical research organizations (CROs), biopharmaceutical and device companies, patient and consumer representatives, professional societies, government researchers, and other government agencies whose mission is to identify practices that through broad adoption will increase the quality and efficiency of clinical trials. In response to CTTI’s efforts to characterize and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of monitoring,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512458909">11</xref>
</sup> we undertook a pilot applying QbD tools and methodologies to a clinical trial for a novel potential therapeutic for the treatment of a neurological disease. Consistent with the approach taken in developing QbD approaches for drug products,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512458909">12</xref>
</sup> Pfizer sought FDA review and feedback on both the QbD approach and the specific parameters defined for the clinical trial. This manuscript specifically summarizes the quality planning methodology and output and does not discuss the quality control or quality improvement aspects of the Juran Trilogy.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Pfizer and FDA’s Division of Neurology Products (DNP), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and Office of Scientific Investigations (OSI), Office of Compliance agreed to undertake a pilot to test one model for prospectively designing quality into clinical trials. The pilot involved a development program scheduled to start pivotal studies. A first submission of the outline of a pilot Integrated Quality Management Plan (IQMP) was made to the FDA in September 2010. This was followed by a combined meeting between Pfizer and both the DNP and OSI in November 2010. Following on further refinement of the initial proposal, feedback from the FDA, and completion of the IQMP planning process, Pfizer submitted a second iteration in March 2011. FDA provided feedback on this second submission to Pfizer in June 2011.</p>
<p>The quality planning methods applied by Pfizer in the pilot with FDA were collectively described in the IQMP. The IQMP-based approach to quality was founded on three main principles:</p>

<title>Quality Objectives</title>
<p>The following are generally recognized as the common objectives of quality management in clinical trials:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>patient safety and rights,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>data quality and trial integrity,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>compliance with the investigational plan.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Pfizer identified critical-to-quality (CTQ) requirements for the clinical trials based on these common objectives. For example, whether or not all subjects randomized meet inclusion/exclusion criteria set out in the investigational plan may impact data quality and study integrity (ie, was the intended population enrolled) and subject safety (ie, were subjects enrolled for whom participation may not be advised). For each CTQ, one or more metrics were identified to facilitate the measurement and monitoring of quality performance during the conduct of the clinical trials. For each metric, target (nominal) values and upper or lower specification limits (action thresholds) were determined. A metric crossing the action threshold would require Pfizer to conduct an investigation, which might include a root cause analysis to address the issue. Examples of CTQs and their associated metrics are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512458909">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>CDER Integrated Quality Management Plan Review</title>
<p>OSI reviewers began with an evaluation of the study design and protocols to determine which data and processes might be critical to evaluating trial results and to protecting participants. For example, a critical clinical trial process might be a clinical assessment generating primary endpoint data. OSI reviewers considered risks to the successful conduct of these processes and collection of these data. For example, significant inconsistency across clinical sites in carrying out an assessment for the primary endpoint might impede analysis. Finally, the reviewers determined what aspects of the protocol design might prevent or mitigate critical risks. For example, the protocol could require specific training for those carrying out the primary endpoint assessment or describe planned, ongoing review of primary endpoint data to identify unexpected variability within or across sites to permit follow-up and retraining of investigators, as necessary.</p>
<p>With this upfront understanding, OSI reviewers then considered (1) what the sponsor considered to be critical to quality data and processes, (2) how the sponsor prospectively identified risks, and (3) how the sponsor planned to manage important and likely risks to the trial. Feedback provided to the sponsor centered on ensuring that all important risks to trial integrity and subject safety were appropriately managed. For example, OSI recommended that the sponsor consider additional measures to ensure the timeliness of a vendor’s completing and reporting the results of an analysis important to determining subject eligibility and to ongoing safety monitoring. OSI staff closely evaluated the sponsor’s risk prioritization, recommending that the sponsor consider whether efforts devoted to lower risk activities with minimal impact on subject safety and/or data integrity might be reduced or eliminated. In particular, OSI sought to identify areas for greater alignment between planned oversight activities and the requirements of FDA regulations or recommendations in guidance. OSI also provided feedback on processes, such as audits, in place to identify risks unanticipated at the time of IQMP development. Finally, OSI evaluated whether the planned critical to quality measures were reasonably likely to ensure effective, ongoing monitoring of risks to study quality.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section12-0092861512458909">
<title>Pfizer Perspective</title>
<p>The Pfizer team that participated in the IQMP pilot included individuals from all relevant clinical trial execution functions, including clinical, statistics, clinical pharmacology, quality assurance, clinical safety, clinical project management, study management, data management, pharmaceutical sciences, and regulatory.</p>
<p>The process enabled an integrated, cross-functional approach to building quality into the clinical trials. This was, in some cases, the first time the team had considered an integrated approach to mitigation of risks to quality across functional lines. As a consequence, the team collectively developed a wider appreciation for factors that were critical to quality, what risks were most likely to impact quality during study conduct and reporting, what could be done to mitigate these risks, and how quality issues in one functional area could result in quality risks in another. For example, when the study team considered the risks related to the study Drug Administration Instructions (DAI), the risk that instructions might be misunderstood or incorrectly implemented were identified. Mitigation of these risks required a collaboration between pharmaceutical sciences, study management, data management, and clinical. This collaboration resulted in the rewriting of the DAI document from a QbD perspective, resulting in more clarity in the written description of the process and instructions regarding study drug administration. Before deployment, the team tested the clarity and comprehension of the revised document with site pharmacists. The cross-functional approach to quality provided more formal opportunities for the team to systematically discuss, assess, and measure quality. The heightened awareness of risks allowed the team to take greater ownership of quality in the clinical trial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0092861512458909">
<title>CDER Perspective</title>
<p>Traditionally, sponsors have relied on intensive on-site monitoring and audit programs focused on clinical investigators to ensure the quality of their clinical trials. FDA and its stakeholders share a concern that this model may be unsustainable in a global, complex clinical trial environment. Existing practices are generally reactive and resource intensive, not risk adapted. Moreover, they may be poorly suited to preventing or mitigating all critical risks, in particular the risk of systemic error introduced during trial design and planning.</p>
<p>Modernizing clinical trial oversight is a key initiative of the FDA. Approaches, such as that undertaken in the present pilot, that build quality into clinical trial design and incorporate principles of risk management may enhance the quality and efficiency of clinical trials. Such approaches facilitate sponsors in identifying and analyzing risks to trial quality and subject safety and in focusing their resources on addressing the most significant risks. Importantly, they also free sponsors from the perceived need to mitigate every risk, particularly those risks that would be expected to have no or minimal impact on data integrity and subject safety.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This IQMP pilot lays a promising foundation for overseeing clinical trials and provides one example of a range of feasible approaches to adopting QbD and risk-based oversight in clinical trial execution. FDA and Pfizer plan to continue piloting this process into the Do-Check-Act cycle. We anticipate that we will continue to gather important data and lessons learned through this real-time testing that will permit Pfizer to further refine the IQMP model and FDA to continue to evaluate the feasibility, including the processes and resource requirements, of undertaking routine review of such prospective submissions. We believe that engaging in prospective dialogue about quality risk management in trials can enhance quality without unduly stifling study conduct.</p>
