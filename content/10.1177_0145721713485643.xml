<p>This article focuses on a new approach to educating diabetes educators. Historically, those wishing to become diabetes educators have worked within a type of apprenticeship model, a method in which trainees learn a craft by hands-on experience while being mentored by a skilled worker. To obtain certification, a diabetes educator must be employed as an educator a prescribed number of hours in addition to taking continuing education courses and pursuing self-study. In this case, however, the “apprentice” may or not be paired with a skilled worker. Tenderich<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721713485643">1</xref></sup> has noted that currently the preparation for becoming a certified diabetes educator is “backwards.” You have to be an employed diabetes educator for 1000 hours before you can get certified as one. Tenderich has pointed out that this is a major obstacle to recruiting more educators.</p>
<p>Although all certified diabetes educators have been required to have specific clinical training in a health discipline, graduate programs in diabetes education are relatively rare. The purpose of this article is to describe the development of a different approach to educating diabetes educators: an interdisciplinary graduate degree in diabetes education and management offered at Teachers College Columbia University. The article also provides a discussion of the current need for diabetes education, the efforts of the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) to improve patients’ access to diabetes education, other graduate programs, and the future needs of the field.</p>
<sec id="section3-0145721713485643">
<title>Need for More Diabetes Educators</title>
<p>No diabetes educator needs to be reminded of the epidemic of diabetes. Currently, 25.8 million Americans or 8.3% of the population have diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721713485643">2</xref></sup> In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721713485643">2</xref></sup> estimates that another 79 million people have prediabetes, a condition that puts people at increased risk for diabetes, suggesting that diabetes incidence and prevalence rates will continue to soar. Self-management is central to living successfully with any chronic disease, and diabetes is no exception. Educating people with diabetes about how to prevent complications through lifestyle interventions began when Elliott P. Joslin, MD, hypothesized that amputations from gangrenous infection were preventable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713485643">3</xref></sup> Decades later, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721713485643">4</xref></sup> which used an interdisciplinary approach to diabetes education, provided scientific evidence that every 1% reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin is associated with an almost 30% reduction in microvascular disease. Unfortunately, not all patients with diabetes have access to vital education services that can help reduce complications.</p>
<p>To illustrate the need for diabetes educators, in 2010, in New York state, there were approximately 1.6 million people or 8.4% of the population with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713485643">5</xref></sup> As of 2012, there were 1123 certified diabetes educators (CDEs) in New York state, or approximately 1425 persons with diabetes per CDE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713485643">6</xref></sup> In the United States, there are a total of 17 441 CDEs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713485643">6</xref></sup> According to the AADE’s workforce report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713485643">7</xref></sup> it is estimated that there are currently 30 000 diabetes educators, including those with and without certification. The report also indicated that by 2025, there will be a need for 54 000 diabetes educators, and that if diabetes self-management training became a covered benefit for prediabetes, the number of educators needed would nearly double.</p>
<p>The AADE has responded to this need in several ways. It has developed a sustainable model consisting of 5 levels of differentiated practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713485643">8</xref></sup> from lay health workers to advanced diabetes managers. Level 1 is considered nonclinical instruction. At this level, diabetes educators who are not health care professionals collaborate with clinically prepared diabetes educators and other providers to augment diabetes education, care, and prevention. An example of the level 1 provider is the community health worker. Level 2 represents diabetes educators who are health care professionals with experience in the health care system. At this level, clinical education is aimed at the individual’s diabetes knowledge level. The AADE has created a certificate program to provide level 1 and level 2 providers with diabetes backgrounds appropriate to their role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713485643">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Level 3 comprises noncredentialed diabetes educators who provide clinical education. Level 3 includes clinically trained professionals who are eligible to become CDEs. Level 4 and Level 5 providers conduct diabetes education and often assume a supervisory role. Level 4 providers are CDEs, whereas level 5 providers, such as those who are board certified in advanced diabetes management (BC-ADM), follow protocols and in some states have prescriptive authority.</p>
<sec id="section4-0145721713485643">
<title>A Call for Increased Leadership in Diabetes Education</title>
<p>In 2010, the AADE assumed responsibility from the American Nurses Credentialing Center for certifying advanced diabetes managers through the BC-ADM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721713485643">9</xref></sup> credential. The organization has also encouraged the professionalization of the field, including the development of master’s-level education. The AADE expanded the eligibility for the BC-ADM credential by including physicians and physician assistants and by accepting master’s degrees (or higher) in education, nutrition, gerontology, and advanced diabetes management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713485643">10</xref></sup> Although it is impossible to predict what the future of health care and reimbursement will look like, it is clear that diabetes is not going away. Even if our health care system increases the use of level 1 and 2—or even unpaid—diabetes educators, there will still be a need for educated and qualified people to develop and manage programs, oversee care, and teach the educators.</p>

<sec id="section5-0145721713485643">
<title>What Academic Programs Exist?</title>
<p>Academic programs in diabetes education and management have existed for a number of years. Australia, England, and Argentina have the most widely known programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713485643">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721713485643"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713485643">13</xref></sup> Some of these programs lead to a “certificate,” whereas others confer a graduate degree; some target interdisciplinary professionals and some only nurses. The first article to document outcomes of a formal academic program in diabetes reported on a program in Argentina that demonstrated that guidelines for educating diabetes educators, put forth by professional organizations, can be successfully implemented into academic curricula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713485643">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the United States, at least 4 graduate programs have been identified. Three of these programs are or were part of nursing graduate programs. Wichita State University has an online graduate-level didactic diabetes course and additional practicum courses. These are often used as elective course work for professionals of various disciplines who are specializing in diabetes (D. Hinnen, APRN, written communication, January 2013). Yale University School of Nursing piloted its Diabetes Care Concentration in 1989.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721713485643">14</xref></sup> The program officially began in 1990, with its first graduating class in 1991 (G. Melkus, EdD, C-NP, written communication, February 2013). Yale’s program includes diabetes-specific courses and a clinical component.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713485643">15</xref></sup> Capella University began offering a Diabetes Nursing Specialty for students in their Master of Science in Nursing program in 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713485643">16</xref></sup> Teachers College began a Master of Science in Diabetes Education and Management in 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713485643">17</xref></sup> This is the only program that is offered to clinicians of all health disciplines eligible for certification as a diabetes educator.</p>
<p>In addition to these 4 graduate programs, some universities are offering continuing education certificates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721713485643">18</xref></sup> and an undergraduate diabetes certificate will be offered starting in fall of 2013.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713485643">19</xref></sup> It is likely that more and more schools will offer similar programs in years to come.</p>

<title>Graduate Program at Teachers College</title>
<p>A diabetes nurse educator originated the idea of a master’s program in diabetes education when she was a doctoral student at Teachers College Columbia University. She suggested to her adviser that Teachers College, with its rich history of starting nursing education and nutrition education programs, was the perfect place to create a program in diabetes education. In 2005, an advisory committee was formed to discuss a proposal for a new master’s degree. The committee included leadership staff, a board member, and several members of the AADE; a leader from the American Diabetes Association; and an expert in diabetes behavioral research. Because the AADE is a multidisciplinary organization, AADE representatives strongly suggested that the program be offered to all disciplines and not just to nurses. Although such a program would pose challenges in many university systems, Teachers College has a history of interdisciplinary departments and seemed the perfect fit for such a program. With the support of the AADE, a needs assessment of 1700 of the organization’s members and 2 focus groups were conducted in 2006. These assessments revealed that many diabetes educators were in favor of such a program. Some respondents indicated that they were reluctant to pursue graduate education in their disciplines because they wanted a graduate program that focused on diabetes education per se. The needs assessment also supported online delivery of such a program.</p>
<p>New graduate programs are not an easy sell in established universities. Faculty and administrators of Teachers College—a graduate school of education, psychology, and select health programs of Columbia University—were appropriately skeptical about launching a new program with its attendant costs. However, the college did agree that a master’s degree in diabetes education was an idea whose time had come and that Teachers College could quite naturally accommodate such a program. Therefore, the college awarded a grant to support the development of the proposed program’s curriculum and core course syllabi. The proposal for the master’s program in diabetes education and management, including the detailed curriculum and course syllabi, was reviewed and approved by the Advisory Group of Diabetes Educators, the faculty of the department of Health and Behavior Studies (where the program resides), the Faculty Executive Committee of the College, the registrar, the finance department, and the provost. After these internal approvals, the proposal for the new program was submitted to the New York State Education Department and to the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, which oversees programs at Teachers College.</p>
<p>In 2010, the program was fully approved, and a search for a program coordinator was launched. Because the needs assessment suggested that an online program would best serve our prospective students, it was important to hire a coordinator for the program who was an expert in both diabetes education and online learning. In March 2011, a program coordinator and faculty member was hired who met all the qualifications. Several courses already offered at Teachers College—some online and others in person—addressed competencies in the curriculum. Professors of the in-person courses were asked to offer at least 1 online section so that program students could enroll in them. In the ensuing 6 months, the existing in-person courses were redesigned and implemented in an online format, the program was advertised, applications were reviewed, applicants were interviewed, and program faculty met to discuss and share online learning practices. Finally, in the fall of 2011, Teachers College welcomed the first cohort of students into the Master of Science Program in Diabetes Education and Management.</p>
<sec id="section7-0145721713485643">
<title>Conceptual Basis for the Program</title>
<p>The conceptual basis for this new, interprofessional program is adult learning principles:</p>
<list id="list1-0145721713485643" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Adults need to know why they are learning something; they must believe it is relevant.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adults have life experience that should be tapped into/built upon.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adults learn best from hands-on, problem-solving approaches.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adults expect to apply new knowledge/skills immediately.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713485643">20</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A solely online delivery was chosen not only because diabetes educators requested it but also because it ties directly to these principles of adult learning. Online students take responsibility for their learning. Online faculty are facilitators rather than instructors, and students learn by building on their experience in a discussion-based curriculum. The program at Teachers College is asynchronous, whereby students and faculty log on when it is convenient for them, and there are no required meeting times. As a result, the program can be accessed anywhere, any time, and it makes sense for those who are currently working. Students can take what they learn in class and immediately apply it in practice.</p>

<title>Program Content</title>
<p>Although the broad outlines of the program were laid out in early discussions with the advisory committee, the task of fully developing the curriculum was undertaken by a consulting registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator with a doctorate in education from Teachers College, in collaboration with a professor of nursing education. The consultant assembled the competencies for diabetes educators that have been promulgated by the AADE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721713485643">21</xref></sup> and the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators (NCBDE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721713485643">22</xref></sup> These organizations had outlined skills and competencies for achievement of the CDE credential and BC-ADM credential that fall into 7 broad categories: pathogenesis and physiology; treatment/intervention; the context in which diabetes is diagnosed, treated, and managed; assessment and goal setting; facilitating behavior change; diabetes education programs; and advocacy. These skills and competencies were itemized, summarized, and synthesized to determine which could be met in existing course offerings at Teachers College and which courses needed to be created.</p>
<p>Several courses offered in the Health and Behavior Studies Department at Teachers College were identified as meeting some of the competencies. In addition, existing courses could serve to develop critical thinking skills; teach students how to retrieve, read, understand, and describe research and compare research designs; and develop competence in serving multicultural populations. Five new courses had to be created to meet diabetes education and management-specific skills and competencies. These courses were (1) assessment, (2) pathophysiology of diabetes and its complications, (3) interventions, (4) behavior change strategies specific to diabetes, and (5) diabetes self-management education programs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721713485643">Table 1</xref>). As part of the proposal for the new program, a course/competency grid was developed to ensure that skills for every competency were addressed—through required readings, discussions, and/or assignments—in at least 1 course.</p>

<p>This 36-credit program also includes required courses in research methods, determinants of health behavior, and multicultural competency. Electives in nutrition and exercise science provide a well-rounded course package for program students who do not have a strong background in these topics. Students choose their remaining elective courses from among those offered at Teachers College. These include courses in education, psychology, technology, health education, leadership, and more. Leadership is also addressed at least indirectly in all graduate courses. The business and management aspects of diabetes education programs are addressed in the Diabetes Self-Management Education Programs course.</p>
<p>In addition to coursework, there are several noncourse requirements. Students in the Master of Science in Diabetes Education and Management Program at Teachers College enhance their web and social media skills as well as their ability to conduct literature searches using library databases. Students compile a portfolio with major assignments completed throughout the program. Students contribute to a wiki created by program participants and faculty. The wiki is an interactive, web-based resource that will eventually be available to diabetes educators around the world and will be maintained by current students with continued input from program alums. Finally, students complete an Integrative Project, which is the culmination of all they have learned and assimilated during the program.</p>
<p>A clinical component was not included in the original design of the program because, at the time, these hours would not have counted toward the CDE practice requirement. Currently, up to 400 volunteer hours do count toward the CDE (the other 600 hours must be carried out as a diabetes educator in an employment setting). Therefore, a supervised clinical practicum, using NCBDE’s mentorship program,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721713485643">23</xref></sup> is currently planned for those who need it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145721713485643">
<title>Why an Academic Route to Becoming a Diabetes Educator?</title>
<p>The NCBDE, which establishes the policies and procedures for granting certification for diabetes educators, has served the field well. Its ongoing evaluation of diabetes educators through testing and its willingness to certify a broad array of health care professionals have done much to standardize the field and widen its scope. Although its requirement that persons applying for certification have a minimum number of hours of <italic>employment</italic> as educators is a barrier that is hard to scale for some, all educators and practitioners recognize the need for hands-on experience in clinical settings. However, the existing approach to attracting qualified educators into the field has drawbacks. Although continuing education can be an effective way to stay current, this approach has disadvantages in preparing novices. People may do the least they have to do to meet the requirement, and they may focus only on courses in restricted topic areas or ones that are offered locally. At this time, there does not appear to be a mechanism in place to ensure that diabetes educators take a variety of courses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721713485643">24</xref></sup> Moreover, continuing education programs do not typically use any type of assessment of whether the students learned the material. Similarly, the professional practice requirement does not specify that the practice be supervised by persons with expertise in diabetes education. Although some undoubtedly obtain their hours working with expert educators, others may obtain their hours working by themselves unsupervised.</p>
<p>An academic route to diabetes education includes several critical elements. An academic program provides a defined course of study offered in an orderly progression that builds the learner’s knowledge base. Thus, academic preparation offers a coherent structure for the education of diabetes educators, rather than a piecemeal approach. Moreover, academic preparation includes periodic evaluation using a variety of assessments, including evaluations of teaching skills and content delivery. Well-planned academic programs increase the learners’ diabetes content knowledge, theory base, and skills in critical thinking, writing, and organizing information. In addition, academic programs offer students practice in designing and making presentations in a variety of media for culturally diverse groups of patients and professionals.</p>
<p>In addition to preparing more diabetes educators, a graduate degree encourages existing diabetes educators to expand their area of expertise and their leadership skills. Indeed, most applicants to the Teachers College Diabetes Education and Management Program are already CDEs. Such applicants realize that diabetes education is complex, and they welcome the opportunity to add to their knowledge of the field. Diabetes educators have a vast knowledge and skill base, but many report they do not receive respect from their colleagues. Perhaps having an advanced degree in their specialty will change this. Graduate education provides an environment where students learn or improve critical thinking skills, which can increase their level of confidence. Formalizing the education of diabetes educators also provides the necessary leadership skills for program development, management, and sustainability, under an evolving health care structure. Diabetes educators need to be familiar with evidence-based models of self-management education, how to apply models in sustainable ways, and how to translate research in culturally heterogeneous communities.</p>
<p>The much-needed foundations for using evidence-based practice are typically obtained in graduate programs. Examples of evidence-based interventions may be widely available in the literature, but mechanisms to translate them into practice and to culturally diverse populations require advanced understanding. Graduates of comprehensive academic diabetes education programs are prepared to contribute to policy; program development, implementation, and evaluation; publication; advocacy; and teaching. All of these competencies contribute to a diabetes education workforce that is better equipped to handle the needs of people with diabetes and a changing health care system.</p>
<p>The AADE’s sustainable model for improving access to self-management services makes the argument for graduate education even more compelling. Under this model, community health workers are supervised by CDEs and/or BC-ADMs. Preparation is required to ensure that diabetes educators have the necessary skills to develop, implement, manage, and evaluate programs while supervising lower-level diabetes educators.</p>
<p>Diabetes education is a multidisciplinary health care specialty. While patients benefit from working with a team of clinicians representing a variety of disciplines, clinicians benefit from learning in a multidisciplinary environment as well. In addition to course materials, sharing knowledge, perspectives, and experiences from practice enhances their education by contributing to rich class discussions. There is currently a trend toward interprofessional education, and research has shown patient-perceived benefits of being cared for by health professionals who participated in interprofessional education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721713485643">25</xref></sup> Teachers College is unique in that it has a long history of interprofessional education, whereas most schools are discipline specific.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145721713485643">
<title>Who Can Apply for the Program?</title>
<p>One way of selecting students for graduate programs would be to use criteria specified by certification bodies. This approach ensures that those who pursue a graduate degree in diabetes education and management have some basic skills provided by clinical training. Because the original intent of the Teachers College program was to prepare students completing the program to become certified diabetes educators, the Teachers College program accepts only those students who have a clinical degree in one of the disciplines accepted by the NCBDE. On the other hand, this approach limits those who would otherwise be interested in expanding their knowledge base. Many people provide diabetes education in less traditional ways. Some examples include diabetes patient education writers, editors, publishers, marketers, and even those in the pharmaceutical industry. Don’t we want these types of professionals to have a more solid preparation? A formal, academic diabetes education and management program would benefit such individuals because the program delivers evidence-based content. This type of program also provides necessary background in cultural competence and theoretical foundations for diabetes education and management in diverse populations.</p>
<p>The argument against admitting those without clinical preparation is that they lack the basic knowledge in anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and nutrition to be safe providers of services. There is nothing to prevent graduates who are without clinical backgrounds from hanging out their shingle as a diabetes educator even though they would not be qualified to sit for the CDE or BC-ADM exams. However, at the present time, nothing prevents individuals who are neither CDEs nor BC-ADMs from hanging out such a shingle regardless of their preparation. This is a turf protection argument like that seen between the medical profession and the nurse practitioner movement. Perhaps new and creative programs could be developed for those interested in diabetes education but who lack clinical preparation. Perhaps something similar could also be developed for those with professional degrees who want advanced knowledge of diabetes. The most important point is that people with diabetes get their education needs met by qualified providers. Organizations such as the NCBDE routinely analyze who is providing diabetes education services, where, and how, and they make necessary adjustments to the eligibility requirements based on their findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721713485643">26</xref></sup></p>

<title>Challenges and Demographics</title>
<p>Mounting a new program is not easy; there are several challenges to moving courses online, developing curriculum, and achieving approval at the university, state, and/or national level. Hiring remote faculty is a new concept for traditional, campus-based schools. Funding is another challenge, for both infrastructure and scholarships. The cost of graduate study is challenging for most students, and scholarship funds are greatly needed. Because these programs are new, corporate funders that provide assistance with the cost of continuing education for health professionals have not yet considered providing academic scholarships. Nonprofit funders have not yet stepped up to fund such cutting-edge programs.</p>
<p>To date, the Diabetes Education and Management Program at Teachers College has students representing nursing, nutrition, optometry, pharmacy, and exercise physiology. Students are located in 2 countries and 13 states and span an age continuum from the late 20s to 70 years. Some students recently earned their undergraduate degree, and others have been out of school for up to 40 years. For some students, this will be a second graduate degree. Program evaluation is being conducted through student surveys each semester. Graduates will be asked for feedback on job placement, career advancement, satisfaction, and other factors.</p>

<title>Won’t a Graduate Degree Limit Diabetes Education?</title>
<p>If there is a shortage of diabetes educators, doesn’t the requirement of a graduate education make it harder to become one? The requirement of an advanced degree in diabetes education is not new. An advanced degree is required to become a BC-ADM, although that degree might not include diabetes-specific content. At the present time, a graduate degree in diabetes education is not proposed as a requirement for certification. Graduates from such programs would not replace those who have taken other routes to certification. But a graduate degree in the specialty does offer a route into diabetes education for those who are not currently in the field as well as a method for current diabetes educators to increase their expertise and their potential for leadership. Few leaders in health care are without advanced degrees. One of the aims of the Teachers College Columbia University program is to produce leaders in diabetes education and management. Such leadership includes active advocacy for diabetes education in the health care environment to ensure that diabetes education is included in any reimbursement plan and advocacy for other issues that affect people with diabetes, including measures that enhance prevention. The time has come to raise the professional standard for diabetes education by providing an academic preparation for diabetes educators.</p>
