<p>This will be the first issue of <italic>WFR</italic> to be produced and distributed by SAGE Publications in California, while we at the World Future Society continue to seek out, evaluate, and edit the articles, abstracts, and other short items that make up the contents.</p>
<p>The added pressure of working with unfamiliar software, new layout, and new procedures for reviewing and formatting has meant that all the texts for this issue were actually written and submitted for typesetting <italic>before</italic> we had finished preparing the content of our issue for Winter 2012—the last produced entirely in house at WFS.</p>
<p>As a result, some of the abstracts and mini-abstracts in this issue cover books published longer ago than are usually found in our pages. However, we think you will find the contents overall both timely and interestingly presented—here and from now on.</p>
<p>Included in this issue are articles by Shing-Ko Liang on how traditional Chinese classics and innovative content are being combined to offer an undergraduate major, as well as graduate-level courses, in futures studies at Fo Guang University in Taiwan; another by James M. Higgins on the declining long-term outlook for jobs in the U.S. economy; and Michael Marien on <italic>Three Paths Forward</italic>—comparing prospects for Earth’s future as envisioned by Jorgen Randers, Ervin Laszlo, and the January 2012 Report of the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability.</p>
<p>Our featured futurist interview this time is with professor Mark Katz of George Mason who offers his assessment of volatile conditions in the Middle East drawn from his research for his latest book: <italic>Leaving Without Losing: The War on Terror After Iraq and Afghanistan</italic>.</p>
<p>Rounding out this issue are a new selection of mini abstracts of recent and forthcoming books prepared by Michael Marien.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget that our Summer 2013 issue will once again be extra-long and feature essays related to our annual conference, to be held this year July 19-21 in Chicago. Its guiding theme will be the 22nd Century: Exploring the Next Horizon.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there.</p>
