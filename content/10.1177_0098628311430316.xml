<abstract>
<p>A total of 35 psychology department members from 21 universities assessed the relevance and efficacy of the <italic>New School Psychology Bulletin</italic> (NSPB), a graduate student journal, to training in psychology. Overall, a small sample of psychology department members viewed <italic>NSPB</italic> as an effective vehicle for student training. Perceptions among faculty were less favorable than previous research demonstrated with a student sample. The majority of respondents reported that students in their programs learn about manuscript preparation but noted that 50% or fewer students actually publish in peer-reviewed journals during graduate school. This suggests that although faculty members perceive that their students are adequately trained in this domain, a large number of students are not putting these skills into practice by submitting manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals.</p>

<p>Peer reviewing, publishing, and participating in journal editorial boards are central parts of academically oriented careers in psychology. Although select students serve on editorial boards, assist mentors with reviews, and publish in peer-reviewed journals during graduate school, no studies have examined the extent to which students are involved in the different aspects of publishing or the various ways students may gain access to such experiences. Lengthy review processes, high rejection rates, differences in faculty mentoring styles, and editorial boards preferring well-established experts as reviewers limit opportunities for graduate students to participate in the publishing process, raising concerns about the training for psychology students in editing and peer reviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628311430316">Mischel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0098628311430316">Roediger, 2007</xref>). A better understanding of how psychology department faculty view participation in editorial activities during graduate school may offer valuable data on the extent to which graduate students are involved in the various aspects of publishing and may help to inform teaching and training strategies for providing students with opportunities in manuscript preparation and peer reviewing during graduate school.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of empirical data on graduate student publishing and peer reviewing, a few graduate student peer-reviewed journals exist, which provide students with additional opportunities for publishing and participating in editorial activities. One such effort is the <italic>New School Psychology Bulletin</italic> (<italic>NSPB</italic>). <italic>NSPB</italic> aims to serve as a publication outlet in which graduate students are directly involved in the process of publishing to strengthen their skills in scientific writing, editing, and peer reviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628311430316">Antonius, Brown, Todman, &amp; Safran, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430316">Brown, Antonius, and Hirst (2009)</xref> found that a majority of graduate students perceived <italic>NSPB</italic> as aiding in the development of manuscript publication and editing skills. Regardless of career goals (clinical vs. nonclinical), most perceived the journal as effective and relevant for training, with 75.5% to 84.4% of individuals responding that the journal was somewhat to very effective. Furthermore, the majority of graduate students perceived <italic>NSPB</italic> as effective in cultivating interest in research, increasing communication between faculty and students, and enhancing students’ overall academic experiences.</p>
<p>Although perceptions among graduate students suggest that peer-reviewed journals may possess a number of benefits for training, studies have yet to examine the perceptions held among faculty and other department members. Such perceptions are valuable, as these individuals are involved in the development of curriculum and training goals, and at times in the hiring of recent graduates for internships and postgraduate positions. Although students may view student-initiated journals such as <italic>NSPB</italic> as relevant and effective, some of these benefits may be diminished if views among faculty differ. This concern is particularly important as prior research examining the perceived relevance of undergraduate journals found that graduate student program directors were largely unfamiliar with undergraduate journals and the benefits of publishing in an undergraduate journal would not necessarily improve one’s chances of admission to graduate school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628311430316">Ferrari &amp; Hemovich, 2004</xref>). However, respondents recommended some undergraduate journals more than others, and familiarity with the journal presurvey appeared to positively affect the respondents’ perception of the journal.</p>
<p>Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the perceptions of <italic>NSPB</italic> among graduate school faculty and training directors. We hypothesized that despite the mixed perceptions of undergraduate journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0098628311430316">Ferrari &amp; Davis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628311430316">Ferrari &amp; Hemovich, 2004</xref>), graduate school faculty and department members would view a graduate student journal as relevant to training and effective for providing opportunities to develop skills and knowledge about peer-review publishing.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0098628311430316">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 38 psychology department members from 21 American universities. One participant was excluded because of affiliation with the New School for Social Research. In addition, the two student advisers were excluded as the focus was on faculty and training directors. Thus, 35 participants remained for further analyses. Responders included program training directors (37.1%) and tenured full or associate professors (62.9%). The majority of participants were male (65.7%) and Caucasian (77.1%). Several participants chose not to report their ethnicity (14.3%), and the remaining participants were Asian (5.7%) or Hispanic or Latino (2.9%). Participants characterized their institutions as research universities (51.4%) or as combined clinical training and research universities (25.7%). Programs were characterized as adhering to the scientist–practitioner model (60.0%), the scholar–practitioner model (14.3%), or “other” (14.3%), or there was no response (11.4%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0098628311430316">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>A 29-item questionnaire was designed for this study to assess knowledge and perceptions of graduate school journals such as <italic>NSPB</italic>. Questions alternated between Likert-type scale and open-ended responses, and they inquired about features of the surveyed graduate training programs, attitudes toward student publishing in general, and specific perceptions of <italic>NSPB</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0098628311430316">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The survey was created and hosted at an online survey website. For the sample, we selected the top 100 graduate-level psychology programs identified in a 2004 survey that assessed publication and citation frequency among full-time faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628311430316">Matson et al., 2005</xref>). We sent an email to the department contacts, requesting that they circulate among their core faculty the link to the survey and a participation request that briefly introduced <italic>NSPB</italic> and included the purpose of the study: to assess faculty perceptions of graduate student journals. We cannot discern how many initial contacts adhered to this request, so the exact response rate for the survey is unknown, but 21% of the contacted universities yielded at least one survey respondent in the final sample. Several universities in our sample yielded multiple respondents, indicating that our request had been circulated at these schools.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section5-0098628311430316">
<title>Results</title>
<p>To assess overall training in publishing and peer review, we asked respondents whether students learn about the preparation of manuscripts, publishing, and peer reviewing during graduate school. A majority of respondents reported that students learn how to prepare manuscripts (96.3%), learn about the publishing process in general (96.4%), and learn how to peer review (69.2%). We also asked respondents to estimate the number of students who publish in a peer-reviewed journal during graduate school. Using a Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>0–25%</italic>, 4 = <italic>76–100%</italic>), 57.1% of respondents reported that less than or equal to 50% of the graduate students in their program publish in a peer-reviewed journal during graduate school. Taken together, these findings suggest that although the vast majority of students learn about publishing and the preparation of manuscripts, many students do not end up publishing during their training.</p>
<p>Our second set of analyses focused primarily on examining the perceived relevance and efficacy of a graduate student peer-reviewed journal for training. Respondents were asked to rate on a Likert-type scale the perceived impact that a publication in a graduate school journal would have on obtaining an internship or postdoctoral fellowship (1 = <italic>very negatively</italic>, 5 = <italic>very positively</italic>), the relevance of submitting to a journal to graduate students (1 = <italic>very irrelevant</italic>, 5 = <italic>very relevant</italic>), the efficacy of a graduate student journal for training (1 = <italic>very ineffective</italic>, 5 = <italic>very effective</italic>), and the ability of a graduate student journal to facilitate interest in research (1 = <italic>very poorly</italic>, 5 = <italic>extremely well</italic>). Our findings suggest that overall, training directors and faculty view submitting to a graduate student journal as somewhat relevant and effective for student training (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628311430316">Table 1</xref>
 for the frequency and percentage of responses). For example, 45.7% viewed a publication in the journal as somewhat positive to very positive for obtaining postgraduate school positions, 65.7% viewed a graduate school journal as somewhat to very effective for graduate student training, and 42.8% viewed a graduate school journal as an aid to facilitate graduate student interest in research. Only one third of respondents viewed submitting to a graduate school journal as somewhat to very relevant to training psychology students.</p>

<p>We conducted a series of independent <italic>t</italic> tests to examine whether measures of perceived relevance and efficacy differed as a function of occupation type (training director vs. non–training director; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0098628311430316">Table 2</xref>
) and program focus (clinical vs. nonclinical or research; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0098628311430316">Table 3</xref>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of the current study was to examine faculty perceptions regarding graduate student participation in manuscript preparation and peer reviewing and the extent to which they view submitting an article to a graduate student journal as a relevant and effective method for teaching skills in the various aspects of publishing. We focused specifically on <italic>NSPB</italic>, as graduate students previously reported that they perceived this journal as potentially relevant and effective for their training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430316">Brown et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of publishing and editorial activity among graduate students, we found that a majority of faculty and training directors believe that their students learn skills in manuscript preparation, whereas a smaller majority of respondents believe that their graduates learn how to peer review during training. It is interesting that despite the perception that students receive in manuscript preparation, our sample reported that about half or fewer of the students in their program publish during graduate school. Although our sample size is small, these preliminary results suggest that many graduate students do not implement publication skills, such as preparing manuscripts for publication and submitting them to journals, during training. This also suggests that faculty members and students may have divergent perspectives on what students are learning in the course of their training. Although the current study shows that faculty members believe students in the programs receive training in publication skills, past research on student perceptions has shown that students do not feel they receive adequate training in these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628311430316">Merlo, Collins, &amp; Bernstein, 2008</xref>). The relationship between perception of training and publication success is unknown and would be an interesting avenue for future research.</p>
<p>Although the majority of respondents reported that their students would benefit from participating in the publication process, only one third believed that submitting an article to a graduate journal would be at least somewhat relevant to graduate student training. Approximately half of respondents believed that publishing in a student journal would have a positive impact on postdoctoral positions and general research interest. Our results suggested that training directors and faculty members from clinically focused programs held more favorable perceptions of <italic>NSPB</italic> than research-oriented faculty members.</p>
<p>The current study is constrained by its small sample size, which limits the generalizability of our findings. Respondents represented only 21% of the contacted universities, which makes it difficult to discern if our findings are representative of psychology universities at large. In addition, it would have been helpful to collect qualitative data on why or why not faculty members and training directors would endorse a student journal such as <italic>NSPB</italic> and to evaluate the reasons for any ambivalence about such projects.</p>
<p>Our findings generally support the positive perceptions of <italic>NSPB</italic> held by graduate students, though they suggest perceptions are more favorable among students than among faculty. Submitting to a graduate student journal may offer a valuable training experience for students to participate in the peer-review and publication process, but more research is needed to further investigate its utility. In particular, it would be interesting to examine if an experience with a journal such as <italic>NSPB</italic> increases students’ likelihood of publishing in professional journals in the future. The fact that faculty perceptions of student journals were somewhat mixed suggests that there may be a stigma surrounding such projects. Given this, additional studies should move toward examining the efficacy of <italic>NSPB</italic> and other student journals to evaluate their impact and effectiveness.</p>
<p>For authors, it may be the case that the true value of experience with a student journal such as <italic>NSPB</italic> lies in the submission process rather than an actual publication credit from the journal. A primary motivation for graduate student journals is to provide students with training experiences missing from their programs to better prepare them to publish their work in the future. Graduate student journals such as <italic>NSPB</italic> follow a stepping stone model: offering a constructive environment to learn and practice critical skills, a place to receive detailed feedback and guidance pertaining to each step in the editorial process, and an opportunity to gain insight into the publication world, so that students are more prepared and able to publish their work in larger journals in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628311430316">Dingfelder, 2010</xref>). Regardless of a publication outcome, supportive early experiences may encourage and benefit students in subsequent academic endeavors. Future research should examine if faculty perceptions differ based on this distinction and if they perceive submitting to or reviewing for a student journal as more valuable than an article publication.</p>
<p>Finally, the current study did not tease out perceptions of the value of working for a student journal as a submitting author or as a peer reviewer, which may be an interesting avenue for future research. Research shows that there is a large demand for reviewing experiences among graduate students and that students are not getting as much training as they need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628311430316">Doran, Somerville, &amp; Harlem-Siegel, 2011</xref>). In 2010, <italic>NSPB</italic> was able to accept only one third of applicants to its Editorial Board, suggesting that alternative outlets for gaining such experience are needed. It is our hope that with additional research on the efficacy of graduate student journals, faculty will consider recommending such journals during training or integrating similar opportunities into their curriculum.</p>
