<title>The Problem</title>
<p>Strategic HRD contributes to creating an environment in which objectives and improved performance can be realized through leadership development (LD). Despite considerable investment in LD by public and private sector organizations in North America and Europe, these efforts often fail to produce significant changes in leaders’ behaviors, organizational culture, or organizational performance. As a result, too often leadership development programs (LDPs) are “one size fits all” or a prepackaged competency model without paying attention to individual and contextual differences. A more collaborative approach in the design and delivery of LD has been advocated; however, to date little research has documented or evaluated this at the pre-LDP or needs assessment stage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1523422312466221">
<title>The Solution</title>
<p>This research argues that LD should be a collaborative process involving all stakeholders and that such a partnership approach starts at the needs assessment phase. The research documents and evaluates a three-phase LD needs assessment process in a health care setting. Adopting a case study methodology, it draws primarily upon qualitative data collected from focus groups, written submissions, and interviews with senior and middle managers employed in a provincial health authority, Horizon Health Network, located in Atlantic Canada.</p>

<title>The Stakeholders</title>
<p>HRD researchers and practitioners in health care responsible for designing, delivering, and evaluating LDPs will find the approach described here insightful and practical. Middle and senior managers working in health care settings who seek to find practical and effective means of addressing leadership gaps and building and sustaining leadership competence across organizations under the pressures of persistent and complex change will also find this research relevant and valuable.</p>

<p>Health care providers across Canada confront a diverse range of challenges from economic, structural, political, geographic, and demographic sources. Considerable scrutiny from the public (e.g., waiting times, lack of physicians) and escalating costs mean federal and provincial governments are constantly looking for ways to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of health care systems; however, Canada’s federated system of governance has produced a patchwork of provincial and territorial health services systems that undermines efforts at overall efficiency and effectiveness on a national scale. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312466221">Dickson (2009)</xref> contended that although the functions of management and administration have always been recognized aspects of organized health care in Canada, it has only been in the past decade that “leadership” has surfaced as an integral component of the problems of and solutions to the health crisis.</p>
<p>Several leadership competency frameworks designed for health care in Canada have emerged (e.g., LEADS framework, Pan Canadian Health Systems Leadership Capabilities Framework). Similar models have also emerged in the United Kingdom (e.g., National Health Service Leadership Qualities Framework). The most recent in Canada, LEADS in a Caring Environment, is promoted by the Canadian Health Leadership Network (CHLNet) as one that “aligns and consolidates the competency frameworks and leadership strategies that are found in Canada’s health sector and other progressive organizations” and is “comparable to the top leadership competency frameworks in the private, public and health services around the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422312466221">Canadian Health Leadership Network, 2012</xref>). Despite these investments in competency frameworks designed specifically for health care leaders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312466221">Edmonstone (2011)</xref> drew attention to several criticisms of such frameworks. Of particular interest to us is that competency frameworks are criticized for undermining the importance of context because it is assumed that such competencies are the ideal qualities for all leaders at all levels and in all professions of health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312466221">Edmonstone, 2011</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466221">Boaden (2006)</xref> concluded that there is a gap between aspiration and achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312466221">Alimo-Metcalfe &amp; Lawler, 2001</xref>) because of the “political” working environment that participants of a leadership development program (LDP; in the National Health Service in the United Kingdom) face in trying to implement newly acquired skills and knowledge. As a result, we too contend that local context is critical in the design, development, implementation, and evaluation of LDPs, specifically in health care in Canada. Moreover, we follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312466221">Conger and Ready (2003)</xref>, who argued that the responsibility of leadership development (LD) should be shared. “It becomes clear that accountability for leadership development must be the interconnected responsibility of the CEO and top team, senior line managers, HR specialists, and the high potential individuals themselves” (p. 7). We extend this line of thinking to advocate for a partnership model of LD that starts with a collaborative approach to evaluating LD needs. This research employs a case study approach to better understand how to design and develop a relevant, practical, and effective means of addressing the leadership gap in an organization under the pressures of persistent and complex change. Adopting a partnership approach, the overall purpose of the project was to elicit the perspectives of managers regarding the organizational climate at the case study site and their LD needs and to work collaboratively with these managers in the development of a strategy for a future LDP.</p>
<p>It has been argued that LDP activities can serve “as triggers of reflective practice in terms of activating the managers knowing-in practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1523422312466221">Watkins, Lyso, &amp; deMarrais, 2011</xref>, p. 212) and as such a learning community of practitioners may emerge. Unfortunately, in general the relationship between training and learning can be weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312466221">Antonacopoulou, 2001</xref>). Transfer of learning from training is influenced by events prior to and after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422312466221">Bates, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1523422312466221">Watkins et al., 2011</xref>). In their research on best practices, processes, and systems in LD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1523422312466221">Leskiw and Singh (2007)</xref> identified six key areas of LD, namely a thorough needs assessment, appropriate audience selection, supporting infrastructure in place, development of a learning system, evaluation of effectiveness, and ongoing recognition of success and constant improvement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1523422312466221">Weindling (2003)</xref> argued that needs assessment is a critical but often overlooked aspect of LD. As that which occurs prior to “training,” we contend that LD needs assessment may be a trigger opportunity for learning if a collaborative approach is employed and if those who are intended to be participants in the program are involved in the identification of needs and program design. We take our lead from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422312466221">Gorman et al. (2003)</xref> and argue for a customized needs assessment that engages various stakeholders, in particular future participants, to increase the relevance of the LDP and buy-in throughout the organization. Our intent here is to document and evaluate a partnership approach to LD needs assessment in a health care provider, namely, Horizon Health Network (Horizon), located on the east coast of Canada in New Brunswick. In doing so, we provide an opportunity for health care practitioners to reflect on, compare, and evaluate the design and delivery of their own LD processes to make them more relevant and increase the likelihood of transfer of learning through LD.</p>
<p>The guiding objectives of this project include the following: to evaluate the LD processes and programs employed at the organization, to identify the LD needs of middle and senior managers through active consultation with members of the organization’s Leadership Advisory Council (LAC), to collaboratively articulate needs and develop research priorities in the area of LD, and to actively engage decision makers at Horizon with researchers at a local university in the planning and development of an action learning agenda for LD.</p>

<title>The Need for a Partnership Approach to Leadership Development</title>
<p>Leadership is understood here to be a relational process of building and maintaining strong local dialogue, relationships, and networks, establishing trust with others, demonstrating empathy, coping with change, motivating and inspiring others, fusing operational and strategic foci and deploying resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312466221">Balkundi &amp; Kilduff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312466221">Edmonstone, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1523422312466221">McCallum &amp; O’Connell, 2009</xref>). LD involves the processes and content of building relational capacity or social capital within an organization to facilitate commitment, trust, and respect among internal and external constituents with the aim of improving individual, group, and organizational performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422312466221">Day, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312466221">Edmonstone, 2011</xref>). Drawing upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1523422312466221">Rodgers, Frearson, Holden and Gold’s (2003)</xref> work, Bolton advocated for a “collective leadership development” approach, which views LD as a collective process rather than an individual property. Such an approach is less prescriptive than traditional approaches to LD and comprises of a program that is “living,” flexible, reflective, and responsive to the emergent needs of participants and the organization. It aims to develop social capital and “an inclusive culture of shared leadership within our organisations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312466221">Bolton, 2005</xref>, p. 7).</p>
<p>It has been documented that two factors significantly limiting the effectiveness of LD in health care include a lack of consideration of context (social, cultural, political, economic) and a focus on <italic>leader</italic> development (individual behaviors, skills, knowledge) at the expense of <italic>leadership development</italic> (relational, interpersonal, social awareness, social skills) in the design and delivery of LDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312466221">Edmonstone, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422312466221">Edmonstone &amp; Western, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422312466221">Hamlin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1523422312466221">Hewison &amp; Griffiths, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1523422312466221">Sutherland &amp; Dodd, 2008</xref>). The lack of attention given to context is not isolated to the health care setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312466221">Conger and Ready (2003)</xref> noted that too many organizations jump from one LD initiative to the next and it is not so much that there is a problem with any one of the approaches; rather the “misuse,” as they refer to it, is in the “form of rush-to-action training packages” (p. 7) that do not adequately take into account the local context of the organization. As a result, it leads to disappointment, resentment, and unmet objectives. Day and Harrison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466221">Gosling and Mintzberg (2004)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312466221">Raelin (2004)</xref> all argued that LD should take into account the individual, group (or relational), and organizational climate and culture. “Taking into account the second and third levels becomes critical to sustaining leadership development over time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312466221">Day &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>, p. 363). We respond to these concerns and follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312466221">Ford, Wynne, Rice and Grogan’s (2008)</xref> “whole systems approach” so that various stakeholders are engaged in all phases of LD, from needs assessment to ongoing evaluations of delivered LDPs. Ford et al. viewed health care organizations as complex adaptive systems that require a whole systems approach to change.</p>
<p>Drawing upon the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1523422312466221">Loan-Clarke (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1523422312466221">Hotho and Dowling (2010)</xref> contended that LD needs are usually identified by senior management without active consultation with those intended to participate in LDPs. As a result, the participant is positioned as “a recipient rather than co-actor of a training program” (p.612). Hotho and Dowling advocated for cocreation among various stakeholders so that LD is understood as a collaborative process. They acknowledged that there is some evidence of creative pedagogical approaches adopted in LDPs but that these programs are not the result of a partnership approach and, therefore, do not go far enough in making space for individual and contextual differences (e.g., styles of learning, career stages, organizational culture). This criticism, however, does not mean that senior management should not be involved in the LD process. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1523422312466221">Walmsley and Miller’s (2008)</xref> review of the U.K.’s Health Foundation’s eight LD schemes (2003-2007) designed to improve the quality of health care through a focus on leadership, they concluded that <italic>real</italic> support and involvement from senior management are critically important to ensure participant engagement with LDPs and the integration of new found skills and knowledge in practice. “‘Organizational support’ needs to be regarded as a dynamic process and shared responsibility” (p. 38).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312466221">Edmonstone (2011)</xref> promoted LDPs that are grounded in a “degree of shared agreement about the reality of the local situation for program participants between participants themselves, key local organizational stakeholders and coaches/facilitators working with those individuals and organizations” (p. 13). We take seriously such a call for a more collaborative approach to the design, delivery, and evaluation of LD and argue that this must begin at the needs assessment phase because it is often overlooked in LD design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1523422312466221">Weindling, 2003</xref>). To do so we draw upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422312466221">Gorman et al.’s (2003)</xref> work on strategic HR training in a municipal government in Los Angeles and adopt what they referred to as a “grounded theory approach to needs assessment.” They argued that such an approach involves a customized needs assessment for the organization under study because every organization is unique and its people and goals should be the driving forces for any training designed for and delivered in the organization. A customized needs assessment will likely result in training that will be more relevant and, in turn, will be better received by participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422312466221">Gorman et al., 2003</xref>). The needs assessment becomes an opportunity for employees to begin the engagement process as it involves “a great degree of open discussion . . . and a great degree of suspicion is thereby eliminated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422312466221">Gorman et al., 2003</xref>, p. 490). They suggested that such a customized approach to needs assessment is fitting in organization that has undergone significant changes in their strategic planning environment. Given recent strategic changes at the organization under study, Horizon we contend that rather than adopting a preexisting LD competency framework, a customized needs assessment offers an opportunity to design and deliver LD that is better suited to the environment under which middle and senior managers at Horizon operate, as well as provides an opportunity to engage with various stakeholders. This facilitates the cocreation of an LD and should result in increased buy-in at various levels. Here we document and evaluate a partnership approach to LD needs assessment, and in doing so, we illustrate how such an approach illuminates particularities about the local context, as experienced by various stakeholders (e.g., senior management, future participants), that need to be incorporated into the design of an LDP.</p>

<title>Context</title>
<p>The core principle underpinning health care in Canada is universal coverage for medically necessary health care services for those in need, rather than for those with an ability to pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422312466221">Health Canada, 2011</xref>). The provincial and territorial governments bear most of the responsibility for the planning and delivery of health care in Canada. The federal government is responsible for the delivery of health services to some groups (e.g., Royal Mounted Police, First Nations’ people living on reserves) and is also responsible for setting principles and ensuring the administration of Canada’s Health Act, as well as providing financial support to the provinces and territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422312466221">Health Canada, 2011</xref>). Health Canada describes Canada’s publicly funded health care system as “an interlocking set of ten provincial and three territorial health systems.” Canada’s health care system faces many challenges not the least of which are the increasing calls for more effective leadership at all levels of the system with particular need for greater accountability, sustainability, and the use of evidence in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312466221">Block &amp; Manning, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1523422312466221">Sullivan, Orchard, &amp; Umoquit, 2011</xref>). The pressures on health systems’ managers are particularly intense.</p>
<p>Like its provincial and territorial counterparts, the Province of New Brunswick (NB) has had to respond to the pressures for strategic and transformational change. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312466221">2008</xref>, the Government of NB announced <italic>The Provincial Health Plan 2008–2012, Transforming NB’s Healthcare</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312466221">Government of NB, 2008</xref>). Health services in NB were consolidated to reduce duplication of services (and expenses) and to achieve parity in the access and delivery of health care across the province. Four of these regions were amalgamated into one authority and rebranded as Horizon Health Network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.horizonnb.ca/home.php">http://www.horizonnb.ca/home.php</ext-link>). From a management perspective, this restructuring of services has meant the integration of different organizational structures, operational processes, and unique subcultures across the four regional authorities, requiring leadership and management across a geographically dispersed organization.</p>
<p>With a $1 billion budget and 12,900 employees distributed across 102 facilities, the scale of change has been extensive and the impact significant. Similar to other health systems across the country, Horizon continues to experience change and development in a complex political environment with a diverse range of internal and external stakeholder pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312466221">Block &amp; Manning, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312466221">Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2009</xref>). In a largely rural environment that covers two thirds of the province, Horizon serves a population of 700,000. Horizon’s stated vision and mission are (respectively) “leading for a healthy tomorrow” and “care for people, educate, innovate and foster research.”</p>
<p>Senior leadership at Horizon identified a number of issues that require focus, including employee engagement, organizational culture, workplace health and safety, and LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422312466221">Accreditation Canada, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312466221">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1523422312466221">Province of New Brunswick, 2008</xref>). Our research findings reveal that many of these issues are interconnected; however, our starting point is a focus on LD needs with the intent of developing an LDP to match the needs and context of Horizon’s middle and senior managers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1523422312466221">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>The benefits of a qualitative, interpretivist approach to LD, and LD evaluation (needs assessment, during, postprogram) have been documented in numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312466221">Boaden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422312466221">Foster, Angus, &amp; Rahinel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1523422312466221">Hotho &amp; Dowling, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1523422312466221">Polsfuss &amp; Ardichvili, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1523422312466221">Watkins et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1523422312466221">Watkins et al. (2011)</xref> claim that qualitative evaluation methods combined with a case study approach are appropriate for organizations where there is a high level of complexity, and this is indeed the situation with health care organizations. They also argue that such an approach provides an opportunity to assess learning at each stage of the process from participants’ own words, thereby providing a “grounded understanding” of the experiences. Following this work we adopted a qualitative case study methodology for this research. This case study explores in depth a particular phenomenon, specifically LD needs, with the intent to identify patterns and themes to be compared with other cases in future research. As a result, this case study can be considered an instrumental case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422312466221">Grandy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1523422312466221">Stake, 1995</xref>). Although an instrumental case study does not allow generalization in a statistical sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422312466221">Grandy, 2009</xref>), it does provide an opportunity to access unique insights often inaccessible through other, more quantitative approaches. To increase the “trustworthiness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312466221">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>) of this research we draw upon multiple sources of data and perspectives in one case and triangulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1523422312466221">Stake, 2000</xref>) the findings.</p>
<p>The research design incorporated three phases with a number of elements over a 1-year period (2010-2011; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1523422312466221">Table 1</xref>). A description of these phases, data analysis, and key findings will be discussed in the sections that follow. The overall process involved engagement with both middle and senior managers, with most primary data collected from members of Horizon’s LAC. The LAC was established in 2008 following the amalgamation and it is a group comprised of approximately 150 middle and senior managers from all 4 geographic regions of the health authority (Moncton, Saint John, Miramichi, Fredericton). This group meets face to face 3 or 4 times annually.</p>

<title>Needs Assessment Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Phase 1 of the needs assessment involved collaborative meetings with two members of the Executive Management Team (EMT), as well as focus groups, written reflections, and one-on-one interviews with a total of 74 LAC members. The intention was to reach as many LAC members as possible to better understand individual and collective experiences and expectations of LD at Horizon from those who would be potential participants in a future LDP designed for middle and senior managers. It was also intended to gauge the organizational climate considerations (e.g., amalgamation opportunities and challenges, structure, leadership style of EMT). Data collection and analysis were an iterative process thereby allowing the researchers the flexibility to integrate unanticipated findings into subsequent data collection for further investigation. Specific to the amalgamation a number of challenges and opportunities surfaced from the data (<italic>The Journey to Date</italic>), including the realities of “living” as a network organization, the growing pains of change, navigating cultural complexities, and celebrating achievements to date. Furthermore, a number of other climate considerations surfaced from the analysis around the need for fine-tuning the systems of Horizon (<italic>Fine Tuning the Systems</italic>), including a lack of consistency and integration, the absence of management orientation, inadequate assessment and strategic planning of training and leadership needs, and an inner dialogue of (un)healthy leaders operating in an (un)healthy workplace. Finally, in regards to LD needs several themes were evident (<italic>Leadership Development</italic>), including making space to develop leaders, building on the LAC, the ideal leadership type for Horizon, growing leaders in partnership, and the need for mentoring and coaching.</p>
<sec id="section8-1523422312466221">
<title>The Journey to Date</title>
<p>The integration of the four zones was more than a simple restructuring or amalgamation of services. The idea was to re-vision health care across the province as a network of services with the goal of bringing both enhanced organizational efficiencies and effectiveness and improving the overall health of New Brunswick’s population. Seeing the organization as a province-wide network enables a sense of systems thinking where managers can “understand how one stream impacts another stream . . . we’re able to cross those streams and cross process” (Participant 22). Participants expressed excitement about the potential to embrace that collaboration and extend it beyond acute care to public health, mental health, and extra-mural services. Two years following the amalgamation, Horizon’s structure was still emerging, but the organization functions within this provisional framework; health care managers are accustomed to change and to living with tentative organizing. The local context, that is, the culture, communication, and technology, and external pressures, all present opportunities and challenges that need to be considered in designing an LDP that will meet the needs of leaders at Horizon.</p>
<sec id="section9-1523422312466221">
<title>Culture</title>
<p>Managers describe the Horizon culture as performance focused, busy, and bottom line. They firmly believe that the EMT has responsibility for modeling the desired organizational culture: “. . . it signals a level of importance to the organization. If the EMT are talking it and walking it; if they aren’t, it signals that it’s you know it’s just not that important. But I do believe that . . . that kind of modeling and . . . creating that kind of culture absolutely needs to stem from how the EMT . . . communicates—how they communicate as a group to the rest of the folks reporting to them” (Participant 24). Managers are often perplexed by what they perceive to be “mixed signals” in this regard. Although several express feeling supported, respected, and valued and acknowledge the fiscal constraints and time-pressured environment within which the EMT must attempt to move the organization forward, they quietly resent the unexpressed but implied “24/7” expectations and cultural norms that condone “many hours of overtime”(Participant 2) that are paradoxical in relation to the organization’s espoused values.</p>
<p>Corporate mergers invariably entail some organizational confusion and frequently a clash of cultures. Horizon’s creation forced the amalgamation of four regionalized zones, each with its own distinct culture. Staff across the newly created organization faced the challenges of both letting go of familiar and often comfortable relationships and practices and of adjusting to new ways of organizing, working, and reporting. Cultural differences across the zones were clearly evident to managers, especially those whose new roles required them to move from a zone-centric focus to a regional focus; differences become engrained in stereotyping: “. . . you have one zone that’s considered by other zones to be sort of coddling and you have another zone that’s considered to be too business-like and too formal and not soft enough and you have another zone that’s such and such and every zone will rate the other zones different depending on which zone you’re from” (Participant 22).</p>
<p>Cultural practices are deeply embedded in day-to-day operations requiring more than “logic” if they are to be displaced. Amalgamation disrupts comfortable and often cherished relationships and social networks. Within zones, physical infrastructure, management styles, and professional practices foster distinct subcultures. As one manager commented, “I’m still struggling big time with staff in different zones that you can treat exactly the same and every one of them has a completely different interpretation of what you did and said” (Participant 22). Making sense of the need to change will frequently give rise to feelings of resentment, latent power struggles, and charges of favoritism. Those from smaller zones, in particular, express a loss of autonomy and personal connectedness; they feel pressure to conform to what they perceive to be imposed norms that they experience as inflexible and bureaucratic. The coexistence of an organizational culture and subcultures is something that needs to be recognized and fostered where appropriate. “Sometimes I think that perhaps that’s what the problem is—is thinking that we are going to be one organization when in fact perhaps we need to be just different segments of the main organization” (Participant 8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1523422312466221">
<title>Communication and technology</title>
<p>Both formal and informal communications play a critical role in fostering the relational capital at the heart of organizational trust. Face-time with counterparts and EMT is crucial to developing the important relational capital that will anchor new ways of working together and mitigate a sense of isolation through the transitional period. “What I’m finding is that people need to have the opportunity to sit with you and know who you are; really understand your integrity, know that they can actually trust you before we can actually . . . begin a working relationship” (Participant 30). Such opportunities, however, entail extensive time and travel commitments with commensurate cost implications. Horizon has undertaken to incorporate various virtual technologies across its operations; everything from the ubiquitous “Blackberry” and email to teleconferencing, videoconferencing, webinars, NetMeeting, e-learning, and telemedicine capabilities. Although the ease of virtual communications technologies does facilitate information sharing and broad-based consultation, the sheer volume of calls and messages received can quickly undermine the apparent benefits adding another stressor to the manager’s day. There is also a latent frustration in having to “short-change” meeting face to face, especially when working to establish new relationships across the organization: “It’s tough enough to have a new huge organization without trying to have people just meeting either by video-conference—video-conference is not bad but it’s not perfect” (Participant 26).</p>
<p>Although Horizon has made concerted efforts to utilize virtual technologies as a substitute for “being there” managers worry that “. . . things get lost in translation” (Participant 25). Given the geographic scope of Horizon and the obvious limitations to technology, travel is an essential aspect of all Horizon managers, with the amount of travel varying with roles and scope of responsibilities. Time on the road is time away from the office; some view this as an opportunity to reflect and plan but always necessitating delegation or catch-up on return. Perhaps more significantly, however, time on the road travelling through rural New Brunswick brings with it a range of potential hazards that must be anticipated and addressed—unpredictable weather conditions, early morning departures and late evening returns, poor road maintenance, encounters with wildlife, and vehicle breakdowns and accidents. Although the more serious hazards are fortunately rare, they are ever present and a further source of stress. Travel also takes managers away from their own locations, giving rise to staff perceptions of absentee management. Feedback suggests that frontline staff note a lack of management visibility across the organization.</p>
<p>Managers do speak enthusiastically about the opportunities the amalgamation has provided to connect with others doing similar work across the organization, including creation of successful clinical networks and professional practice councils and proactively creating networking opportunities for their own staff. While they speak of support from EMT to facilitate these connections, it is less evident that Horizon’s model of governance and management has shifted from a traditional command-and-control style.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1523422312466221">
<title>External pressures</title>
<p>Finally, there are as well the external pressures over which the organization has little or no control—the H1N1 crisis in 2009, changes in government, economic downturn, and the resulting fiscal restraint have all added pressure to an already pressured health system. As one manager expressed, “. . . we have had some progress with our regional network but everything has been tossed up into the air again quite quickly and what is stressing all of us is what’s going to happen in our current fiscal environment” (Participant 28). Another manager commented, “You have a mandate that the province dictates and the laws dictate that you have to do; you need to be creative to figure out how you’re gonna get there . . .” (Participant 17).</p>

<sec id="section12-1523422312466221">
<title>Fine-Tuning the Systems</title>
<p>Before LD can be effective, managers need to have the skills and knowledge to perform a variety of management tasks (e.g., budgeting, conflict resolution, progression discipline, attendance management, project management, effective communication, technology, system support). Not surprisingly, the amalgamation process has revealed that there are a number of inconsistent practices and policies across the zones specific to management and LD. Some of these inconsistencies are evident in the processes surrounding performance appraisals, assessment of LD needs, promotion, succession planning, management orientation, mentoring/coaching, and human resource advising.</p>
<p>Horizon’s human resources function has faced considerable challenges in regards to roles changing, turnover, and new hires. Some managers feel they are well supported by their HR advisors. For others, however, these changes have meant that managers feel unsupported in their roles because they do not know who to contact about particular issues or that some of the new HR staff do not understand well enough the complexity of the issues at Horizon to provide managers with the specialized advice they require. Further inconsistencies were evident in the processes of hiring, promotion, succession planning, and orientation for new managers.</p>
<p>Appraising performance should be an ongoing activity of effective leaders; however, often managers at Horizon do not or are unable to devote adequate time to ongoing assessment for a variety of reasons. As a result, the formal performance appraisal process becomes “a catch-all for ‘Now I’m going to address your issue’’’ (Participant 11). Some managers do not fully understand the importance of ongoing assessment for developmental reasons or they may be inadequately equipped with the skills and knowledge to use the appraisal tool to manage developmental and performance issues. Other managers do exert considerable efforts on an ongoing basis to ensure high-quality feedback. They speak of using the “performance appraisal as a check-in and a fifty-fifty exchange between a manager and an employee and really talk where you really want to grow and develop in the next six months or a year” (Participant 11).</p>
<p>To date, Horizon does not have an organization-wide management orientation program or agenda. There are pockets throughout the organization that have implemented some sort of orientation for new managers, albeit this is usually on an informal basis. Unfortunately, in some of the departments or zones where good practices around orientation were in place before the amalgamation these have mostly dissipated since amalgamation.</p>
<p>Without an organization-wide agenda on management orientation, even in those pockets where orientation processes were encouraged and supported, senior managers were not usually held accountable for ensuring that new managers reporting to them had completed orientation training. Moreover, some senior managers did not “buy into” the need for such training, and as a result, management orientation was not used as consistently and effectively as it should have been. “In this zone we did have a semi-structured kind of management program but it wasn’t always successful . . . it wasn’t respected by all managers as being necessary” (Participant 22).</p>
<p>This lack of orientation causes much unnecessary anxiety for new managers and undoubtedly affects the quality of their work. “I remember being a new manager and having to submit a budget and I remember pacing around my office eight o’clock at night just almost hyperventilating because no one had shown me and I thought, ‘Well how I’m gonna do this?’. There was no one to go to and I mean you know it’s those kind of defining moments, ‘I’m never gonna let this happen to anybody again’ because you know sometimes there was—there’s just no—you’re just thrown into something and you just sort of set people up to fail when that happens” (Participant 24).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for the most part needs assessment or developmental plans are not systematically used by management, nor is there much effort dedicated to systematically evaluating the usefulness, relevance, or “use in practice” of the training opportunities offered throughout the organization. “I think a follow-up kind of thing sometimes would be useful for some of the courses because it is easy to go to a course and say, ‘Oh yeah that’s great.’ It sounds all good but to actually put it into practice” (Participant 4). There was some evidence of sharing knowledge and evaluating training; however, these accounts were rare. This does not mean that the investment in training provided by Horizon has not been worthwhile. It does mean, however, that without adequate needs assessment on an individual basis and without an organization-wide agenda on training and LD competencies, it is impossible to track with evidence the effectiveness of such investment. The training and LD efforts should be clearly linked to strategic priorities and this should feed into individual and departmental reviews.</p>
<p>Modeling expected behaviors and practices is a core responsibility of good leadership. Although individual VPs may inspire, the predominant mode from EMT appears to be one of 24/7 “go, go, go.” Inconsistent approaches can unintentionally send mixed messages in everything from Blackberry protocols to valuing work–life balance. “Unhealthy” practices that consciously and subconsciously blur the lines between work and home include: “covert catch-ups” such as arriving at the office an hour early to check voicemail, email, and sign papers; using off-hours to catch up on email and heading in to the office over the weekend; perpetually checking the Blackberry during off-hours; taking work home each night; continuing to “spin” with thoughts of work while being physically present at home; and waking through the night to check for messages.</p>
<p>Emphasis on workplace wellness appears to be tied to organizational culture with some of the previous health zones having placed a higher priority than others; what appears to be missing is a regional—Horizon-wide—ethos and approach, and, as such, at the individual level, good intentions are frequently sidelined by work pressures: Without a clear organizational commitment and performance expectation for workplace wellness in action, managers quietly acknowledge failed efforts and rationalize the same as a “no choice” trade-off at their level and the level above: “I think they [EMT] are struggling on what they can do and I appreciate that. The senior leadership team [is] under a huge amount of pressure to—not just with money but with the quality of services that we provide, with all this new organization” (Participant 28).</p>

<title>Leadership Development</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1523422312466221">Table 2</xref> summarizes the key findings specific to leadership development (LD). In this section we provide an overview of some of those insights. Middle managers struggle with balancing management responsibilities and taking time to reflect on how all the parts and people fit together. “It’s that competition between the leadership and getting the work done” (Participant 22). This has been exacerbated by the amalgamation and the need for integration and “survival” as expressed by Participant 26. “We have been probably more focused on management—survival. I mean you’re taking four cultures so trying to survive and development things and I think we are just starting now to sit back and say, ‘Oh it’s time to change the focus a little bit here’” (Participant 26).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>LD should be a strategic priority with accountability and responsibility of it shared among the CEO and top management team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1523422312466221">Leskiw &amp; Singh, 2007</xref>). In times of crisis, it is leaders who are able to think creatively and produce innovative solutions. Horizon’s efforts need to be intentional, visible, and championed from the senior management. The LAC provides evidence that such a commitment does exist at Horizon. Others indicated that the partnership with the researchers conducting the needs assessment “sends a message . . . that it [<italic>leadership development</italic>] is important” (Participant 24). This comment by Participant 24 indicates that the collaborative or partnership approach to needs assessment can indeed serve as a trigger for learning and building commitment for LD.</p>
<p>Horizon has made great strides in building internal networks across the organization through its directors’ councils and LAC. The findings indicate that Horizon needs to build on these networks as a platform for establishing its LD agenda. It was noted by numerous participants that through organization-directed initiatives or self-organizing initiatives, social support was essential in creating a culture conducive for experimentation and learning.</p>
<p>There was some evidence of self-organizing “communities of practice” within the system that inspired and motivated individuals to learn. “In the [<italic>name of region</italic>] we have a voluntary group that came together and we call ourselves ‘Management Link’. It wasn’t formed by Horizon, it didn’t come from a VP but a group of managers decided that it would be a combination support group for continuing education and social. So we pay three dollars from our pay cheques” (Participant 2). This suggests that the desire for comprehensive LD is already in the system and it just needs to be fostered in a deliberate way.</p>

<sec id="section14-1523422312466221">
<title>Phases 2 and 3: Knowledge Exchange and Formalization of Research Partnership</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1523422312466221">Table 1</xref> highlights the purposes of Phases 2 and 3 as knowledge exchange of the key findings from the needs assessment, as well as continued collaborative development of an action learning LDP specific to the needs of Horizon’s middle and senior managers. The researchers believe this is critical to ensuring buy-in from the EMT and future participants of the program. First, by directly “reporting” back the findings to members of the LAC it reinforces the importance of their voices in the design and rolling-out of an LD agenda. Furthermore, collaboratively working with members of the EMT and the regional director of organizational effectiveness means that any future LDP can be integrated into other organizational development initiatives, and that Horizon middle and senior managers will begin to see the interdependence across training and other learning and development efforts. The partnership approach employed here also entailed reaching out to external health bodies such as the New Brunswick Health Research Foundation and the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation. We believe that by including representatives from these organizations it enhances the credibility of the process and provides additional feedback and support for the future LDP. It also establishes a network through which learning and resource sharing can occur across health care organizations within the province.</p>
<p>Part way through this process the research team was informed that the regional director of organizational effectiveness had decided to adopt the LEADS in a Caring Environment Framework as the overall framework to link all organizational development initiatives (e.g., management orientation, management training, LD). Although the researchers were (and are still somewhat) wary of the adoption of a competency framework because it does not take into account the specific contextual considerations facing Horizon and its leaders, the regional director has expressed and demonstrated flexibility in how Horizon will implement such an approach. She sees it as a guiding philosophy or underpinning framework and not necessarily as a rigid method through which to design and implement initiatives. She has also worked collaboratively with the researchers to identify and match the components that would be integrated into a future LDP (based on the needs assessment findings) to specific competencies of the framework. Fortunately, this framework does take into account both leader and LD considerations, as well as building capacity for compassion and a focus on service of the system. For example, within the LEADS in a Caring Environment framework, the human (leader development) components include building capacity for self-awareness, self-management, and character, whereas the social capital (LD) components include building capacity for engaging others, achieving results, developing coalitions and partnerships, and transforming systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422312466221">Dickson, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section15-1523422312466221">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Enacting the espoused vision of “healthy leaders” or “leading for a healthy tomorrow” can indeed be an ambitious goal for any organization in today’s often turbulent fiscal, political, and regulatory environment. It is, however, a goal worthy of achievement for the long-term health and sustainability of both the public and private sectors of our economy and society at large. Such values are easy to acknowledge and support but frequently a much greater challenge in practice where established procedures and routines are unconsciously maintained despite their undermining impact on espoused organizational intention. Articulating specific, measurable outcomes—at both the individual and organizational level—will enable Horizon to measure progress over time, to identify areas for further attention, to justify the organization’s investment in fostering a healthy LDP, and to promote its model of success to other organizations seeking to address similar challenges. In addition to the LEADs framework, indicators at the organizational level could include levels of absenteeism, job satisfaction, recruitment and retention, organizational climate, incidences of health and safety violations, labor relations climate, and so on. At the individual level, performance assessments, as well as indicators of both physiological and mental health and well-being, could be established and monitored over time.</p>
<p>It is also evident through this research that LDPs need to consider culture, both organizational and “mini” or subcultures, especially in a geographically dispersed organization. Given the uncertainty and complexity of the demands of health care and the possibility of extensive traveling time for Horizon workers, the LDP needs to be flexible and its requirements reasonable. Designing an LDP that is flexible enough to incorporate emergent individual and collective needs and learning styles is also critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312466221">Bolton, 2005</xref>). Individuals should be able to weave their own experiences into the development process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312466221">Gosling &amp; Mintzberg, 2004</xref>). Moreover, top management support is essential and we advocate that members of the senior management team should be encouraged to enroll in the program. Such visible support of the program will send strong signals to the rest of the organization as to the importance and relevance of the LDP. It also extends the partnership model that we advocate for at the LD needs assessment stage to other stages of LD.</p>
<p>Indeed, it has to be acknowledged that a partnership approach to LD needs assessment can be time consuming, but the time and money is well spent if the LDP is fitting to the needs of the organization and its people. The partnership approach here adopted did not occur without challenges. It involved extensive travel in order to connect face to face with members of the LAC for interviewing, a process the researchers felt was important to build rapport and trust with future participants. A change in provincial government and constant scrutiny by government also meant the EMT faced a lot of uncertainty about the future structure and operations of Horizon. In turn, this meant that although the researchers’ contacts within the EMT were supportive and available to meet often, they were under a lot of pressure to find ways to increase efficiency and improve effectiveness throughout the organization. At times, the researchers sensed that LD was espoused as important to the present and future of the organization but not always at the top of the priority list in what needed to be addressed on a daily basis. As the organization moves forward it will be critical that espoused and enacted commitment to LD align at the EMT level and throughout the organization. Though challenging to implement, it is argued here that the benefits of a partnership approach to LD, especially at the needs assessment stage, cannot be overstated. A whole systems approach facilitates organizational support for the participants, it drives strategic alignment between group and organization levels, and it enables communication about the process, impact, and outcomes to facilitate the “spread and sustainability of good practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312466221">Ford et al., 2008</xref>, p. 162). “The process of leadership development serves many purposes beyond simply developing talent . . . it can be an effective retention strategy that helps drive the motivation, enthusiasm and commitment of participants; it can serve as a reward; and can also help in teambuilding and engendering a sense of shared purpose” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312466221">Bolton, 2005</xref>, p. 15).</p>

<title>Implications for Research</title>
<p>The partnership approach to LD needs assessment detailed in this article is a critical aspect of adopting a whole systems approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312466221">Ford et al., 2008</xref>) to LD. At the same time, it is only the starting point. Future research should further examine the impact of a partnership approach to needs assessment on participants’ and senior management’s buy-in throughout the LDP process. In addition, the impact of a partnership model and collective/emergent approach at the delivery and evaluation stages of LDP is also worthy of further study.</p>
<p>Stressful work environments create strain, a sense of poor well-being in employees, and contribute to absenteeism, disease, injury, and lowered productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312466221">De Lange, Taris, Kompier, Houtman, &amp; Bongers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1523422312466221">Stein, 2001</xref>). The fact that many of the work stressors experienced by middle and senior managers in health care organizations are beyond their control simply adds to the sense of overwhelming experienced and further hinders their ability to mentally “switch off” from work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422312466221">Sonnentag &amp; Bayer, 2005</xref>). Research suggests, however, that recovery experiences can be enhanced through training interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422312466221">Sonnentag &amp; Bayer, 2005</xref>). The need for coaching and mentoring surfaced as a key need for LDP at Horizon and we suggest that future research should extend current work on mindfulness and coaching to better understand how through such interventions it facilitates managers’ ability to integrate healthy leadership practices within their daily routines and enabling them to coach and mentor others in the organization to do the same. By fostering practices of self-awareness and reflection through mindfulness meditation and coaching, it is posited that managers can develop both confidence and humility in the decisions they make while also creating a culture that fosters distributed leadership. Building on the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312466221">Luthans and Peterson (2002)</xref>, it is expected that such practices will positively affect job satisfaction and organizational commitment of supervisors and subordinates.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This research set out to document and evaluate a partnership approach to LD needs assessment in a health care setting. We take our lead from those who argue that a lack of consideration of context and involvement of those who are participants in LDPs negatively affect the outcomes of LD initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312466221">Edmonstone, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422312466221">Gorman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1523422312466221">Walmsley &amp; Miller, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, we believe that focusing on the needs assessment phase of LD to start such a partnership approach will serve as a trigger for learning and engagement for participants even before formal LD begins. In turn, we believe this will improve the transfer of learning from training into practice. Our future research will evaluate further the impact of such a partnership approach on LD outcomes.</p>
