<abstract>
<p>Müllerian adenosarcomas most commonly arise in the uterine corpus from the eutopic endometrium. Occasionally, they arise in the cervix, vagina, broad and round ligaments, and ovaries and rarely in extragenital sites, usually in association with endometriosis. The authors report a rare case of extraendometrial, intramural adenosarcoma of low grade arising from a subserosal adenomyoma in a 46-year-old woman who presented with vaginal bleeding. No evidence of eutopic endometrial origin was identified; the adenosarcoma showed only limited myometrial invasion and no serosal involvement. Because of its subserosal location, the tumor would be overstaged as IC (deeply myoinvasive) in the new FIGO staging system. Stage IC tumors would normally be considered for adjuvant treatment, which would be inappropriate in this case. To avoid overstaging and inappropriate treatment, it is important to recognize that adenosarcoma can, rarely, arise in adenomyomas (or adenomyosis).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Müllerian adenosarcomas most commonly arise in the uterus and comprise a mixture of benign or mildly atypical glandular epithelial elements and a malignant endometrial stromal component, usually of low grade. Such tumors are considered to be of low malignant potential and may recur locally but only rarely metastasize. In a recent population-based study in Norway, adenosarcomas accounted for 5.5% of uterine sarcomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912453852">1</xref></sup> These tumors occur in women with a median age of 58 years; the age range is 14 to 89 years. Patients usually present with vaginal bleeding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912453852">2</xref></sup> but other nonspecific symptoms such as pelvic pain and vaginal discharge are also described.</p>
<p>Adenosarcomas usually arise from the eutopic endometrium in the uterine corpus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912453852">3</xref></sup> but may rarely occur at other sites in the female genital tract including the cervix, vagina, broad and round ligaments, and ovaries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912453852">4</xref></sup> Extragenital adenosarcoma has also been reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912453852">5</xref></sup> particularly in association with endometriosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912453852">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912453852"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912453852">8</xref></sup> Some studies have shown that extrauterine and extragenital adenosarcomas may be associated with more aggressive clinical behavior,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912453852">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912453852">10</xref></sup> probably because of their greater propensity for peritoneal spread. However, extraendometrial uterine adenosarcoma, that is, tumor that has not originated in the eutopic endometrium but in adenomyosis or an adenomyoma, is rare,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912453852">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912453852">11</xref></sup> and no specific staging guidelines for such tumors are provided in the new FIGO staging system for uterine sarcomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912453852">12</xref></sup> We report a case of Müllerian adenosarcoma arising in a subserosal uterine adenomyoma without eutopic endometrial involvement.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<sec id="section3-1066896912453852">
<title>Clinical Findings</title>
<p>A 46-year-old woman, para 1, presented with vaginal bleeding. Pelvic ultrasonography showed multiple leiomyomata for which she underwent a laparoscopic myomectomy. Laparoscopic examination revealed a suspicious-looking, pedunculated, subserosal mass arising from the posterior surface of the uterus. The mass was not attached to the pelvic sidewall. There was no evidence of endometriosis, and no other peritoneal lesions were identified.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066896912453852">
<title>Pathological Findings</title>
<p>Two specimens were submitted for histological examination. The larger comprised 4 fibroids, 7 to 12 mm in diameter with an unremarkable macroscopic appearance (these were all confirmed histologically to be benign). The second, smaller specimen was from the suspicious-looking subserosal mass and comprised multiple fragments of white, rubbery tissue weighing 54 g. Some contained small foci of hemorrhage. Microscopy showed features of an adenomyoma: myometrial smooth muscle fibers with a fascicular architecture, admixed with benign endometrial glandular and stromal elements. The fascicular arrangement of the smooth muscle fibers and the identification of a circumscribed edge to the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912453852">Figure 1A</xref>) were against a diagnosis of deep adenomyosis. However, in some fragments, the endometrial stroma predominated; in these fragments, benign endometrial glands appeared to be mildly dilated and were surrounded by a cuff of endometrial stromal cells, representing a cambium layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912453852">Figure 1B</xref>). A few of the glands had small polypoid stromal protrusions into their lumina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912453852">Figure 1C</xref>). The endometrial stromal cells in the periglandular cuffs showed mild and focal moderate cytological atypia with sparse mitotic figures, including an occasional atypical form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912453852">Figure 1D</xref>). Ki67 immunostaining highlighted a mildly increased proliferation index in the periglandular zone of stromal cells. These appearances suggested transformation to a low-grade Müllerian adenosarcoma. There was no sarcomatous overgrowth and heterologous or sex-cord element, and no lymphovascular invasion was identified. Some of the submitted tumor fragments had a peritoneal covering, which confirmed the adenomyoma (with secondary malignant transformation) to be of subserosal origin. Adenosarcoma was not identified on the serosal surface. The patient subsequently underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. No residual adenosarcoma was identified in the hysterectomy specimen. There was no adenomyosis or serosal endometriosis and no tumor in the eutopic endometrium or extrinsic to the uterus. Also, 13 tumor-free pelvic lymph nodes were recovered. We believe this to be a rare example of low-grade Müllerian adenosarcoma arising in a subserosal adenomyoma.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report a rare example of extraendometrial, intramural adenosarcoma of low grade arising from a subserosal adenomyoma, with no evidence of eutopic endometrial origin, limited myometrial invasion, and no serosal involvement. Only 2 cases of intramural adenosarcoma have previously been reported. Gollard et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912453852">6</xref></sup> reported a case arising in the foci of adenomyosis without involvement of the eutopic endometrium, and Clarke et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912453852">11</xref></sup> reported a case arising in an adenomyoma in the center of the myometrium without eutopic endometrial involvement. The current case is unusual, in that the adenosarcoma originated in a deep, subserosal adenomyoma and appeared clinically to be a pedunculated mass on the posterior surface of the uterus.</p>
<p>Uterine adenomyomas are typically circumscribed and composed of an admixture of smooth muscle and endometrial glandular and stromal elements. The identification of adenomyosis in hysterectomy specimens with adenomyomas supports a histogenetic relationship between adenomyoma and adenomyosis in some cases. The smooth muscle component tends to predominate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912453852">13</xref></sup> and may rarely be cellular or contain occasional bizarre/symplastic nuclei. The endometrial glandular elements are uniformly bland but can show mitotic activity and include tubal-type, mucinous endocervical-type, or rarely squamous epithelium. The volume of the endometrial stromal component is low relative to the volume of smooth muscle, and although mitotic activity may be seen in the endometrial stromal cells, the stromal cells show no significant cytological atypia.</p>
<p>In 1 reported series of adenomyomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912453852">13</xref></sup> of which 14/30 cases were received in consultation, diagnoses of atypical polypoid adenomyoma, adenocarcinoma, adenofibroma, and adenosarcoma were considered by the referring pathologists in 8 cases. The absence of epithelial proliferation, atypia, or squamous metaplasia in the present case excludes atypical polypoid adenomyoma and adenocarcinoma. The stroma in adenofibroma consists of variably cellular fibrous tissue; the smooth muscle and endometrial stromal components of adenomyoma are absent. In adenosarcoma, the endometrial stromal component—not the smooth muscle component—predominates, and the endometrial glands are no longer evenly spaced but more widely separated because of the endometrial stromal expansion. Smooth muscle may rarely be present in the stroma of adenosarcomas but is rarely prominent. Typically, adenomyoma does not show polypoid projections of stroma into the endometrial glands or periglandular stromal condensation, both of which are present in adenosarcomas. Although stromal mitoses have been reported in a small number of adenomyomas, these tumors do not show the stromal atypia of adenosarcomas. Finally, adenosarcoma may infiltrate the myometrium and show vascular invasion.</p>
<p>According to the new FIGO staging system for uterine sarcomas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912453852">12</xref></sup> this case should be staged as FIGO IC because the tumor involves the outer half of the myometrium. However, FIGO staging applies to adenosarcomas, which originate in the endometrium and infiltrate into the outer half of the myometrium. Deep myoinvasion and lymphovascular invasion are much more common in adenosarcomas with sarcomatous overgrowth, but nonetheless, deep myoinvasion implies a biologically more aggressive tumor and is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and metastasis. In view of this, the current adenosarcoma is likely to be overstaged when using a staging system that does not take into account adenosarcomas that arise ab initio within the outer half of the myometrium (and are confined to this layer). The same situation arises when uterine adenocarcinoma arises in endometriosis or adenomyosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912453852">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912453852">15</xref></sup> and there is no evidence of carcinoma in the eutopic endometrium.</p>
<p>Clarke et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912453852">11</xref></sup> identified 2 cases of adenosarcoma in which staging was problematic. The tumor in the first case arose in the eutopic endometrium and involved underlying adenomyosis but did not show myometrial invasion. The second case was similar to our own and originated in an intramural adenomyoma in the absence of a primary tumor in the eutopic endometrium. The authors proposed that these should be designated as adenosarcoma, intramural stage I am1 or am2 (<italic>am</italic> is the suffix used to describe adenomyosis/adenomyoma), depending on whether the involved adenomyosis/adenomyoma was in the inner or outer half of the myometrium. According to this proposal, our case would be FIGO stage I (am2).</p>
<p>The recurrence and survival rates of patients with uterine adenosarcomas depend on many factors, including the grade and mitotic index of the stromal component, the presence of sarcomatous overgrowth, and myometrial invasion. The treatment of choice is hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been used in cases with adverse prognostic features, such as deep myometrial invasion and sarcomatous overgrowth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912453852">16</xref></sup> It is therefore important to ensure that rare cases of adenosarcoma that arise in adenomyomas (or adenomyosis) are not overstaged and inappropriately treated.</p>
