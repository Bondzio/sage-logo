<p>The mass of material published on nineteenth-century Europe ensures that it is difficult to strike an original voice. This is especially so if the chronological scope is, as with this study, a somewhat conventional one. For example, it may be more helpful, in light of the success of counter-revolution in 1813−47, to link that period to the second half of the eighteenth century. Conversely, the 1860s can look forward to another period that closed in the 1940s. Such an approach, however, may not work for textbook series bound to a conventional chronology.</p>
<p>To adopt a more positive note, R. S. Alexander, Professor at the University of Victoria in Canada, and an established specialist in French history, offers an effective account of his period. The thematic range is good. Thus, for example, a discussion of urbanization is seen as a key element of the underpinning of politics. Alexander does justice to both international relations and domestic politics by underlining how closely they were interwoven. He also emphasizes the relationship between the growth of civil society and state formation as a means of tracing the trajectory of European states and societies. There is discussion of economic, social and cultural trends, but it is relatively brief given the space devoted to politics, which leaves the book with a somewhat familiar feel to accompany the praise for its many qualities. I would have preferred a different balance and hope Professor Alexander can be given the challenge anew. More positively, his book offers a good introductory survey for first-year undergraduates, with a clear, relatively comprehensive, political narrative. This will provide students with a platform for more advanced studies and/or reading.</p>
