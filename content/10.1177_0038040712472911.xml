<abstract>
<p>Scholars have not adequately assessed how organizational cultures in schools differentially influence students’ mathematics achievement by race and socioeconomic status (SES). We focus on what we term <italic>collective pedagogical teacher culture</italic>, highlighting the role of professional communities and teacher collaboration in influencing mathematics achievement. Using cross-classified growth models, we analyze data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study and illustrate that schools where teachers perceive the presence of professional communities and teacher collaboration foster greater mathematics achievement throughout elementary school. Furthermore, achievement gaps by race and socioeconomic status are lessened in schools with professional communities and teacher collaboration.</p>

<p>Most studies of educational organizations have focused on structural features of schools, such as classroom size, infrastructure, and resources. Research on schools’ organizational cultures is less widespread. Yet, the organizational cultures of schools can have important implications for teaching practices and student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038040712472911">Gamoran, Secada, and Marrett 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0038040712472911">Lee and Smith 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0038040712472911">Louis and Marks 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0038040712472911">Vescio, Ross, and Adams 2008</xref>). Schools’ organizational cultures include the shared assumptions, rituals, values, climate, and behaviors within organizations. Schools’ organizational cultures are critical because they define how teachers interact with one another and their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0038040712472911">Powers 2009</xref>). Indeed, teachers are equipped with a broad range of teaching tools, but the tools employed are often constrained by the structural and cultural environment of schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0038040712472911">Powers 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Education reformers and practitioners have attempted to alter the cultures of schools through localized reform efforts that foster the development of professional communities among teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038040712472911">Cuban 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038040712472911">Hess 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040712472911">McLaughlin and Talbert 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0038040712472911">Tyack 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0038040712472911">Tyack and Cuban 1995</xref>). Despite these efforts, scholars have not adequately assessed the effect that schools’ organizational cultures have on achievement gaps by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). This is particularly problematic given large and well-documented gaps in math achievement.</p>
<p>Despite localized reform initiatives that promote organizational cultures that value professional community, national reform efforts, notably the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), have undermined schools’ organizational cultures by altering working conditions for teachers, principals, and students. High-stakes testing has created an environment where the negative consequences of student failure have placed immense pressure on teachers, increasing stress and competition among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038040712472911">Crocco and Costigan 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0038040712472911">Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0038040712472911">Nichols and Berliner 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0038040712472911">Valli and Buese 2007</xref>). This competition undermines teachers’ abilities to build collaborative, student-centered lessons, as they must trust one another to do so. In fact, the high-stakes testing environment encouraged by NCLB has changed schools’ organizational cultures by undermining trust and reducing morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0038040712472911">Ravitch 2010</xref>). Given that NCLB alters the organizational cultures of schools, it is imperative that we clarify whether schools’ organizational cultures are a critical piece of the complicated solution to reducing early mathematics achievement gaps by race and SES. Our research focuses on a sample of students that entered kindergarten in 1998, prior to the implementation of NCLB. Yet our results will clarify whether some of the negative consequences of NCLB on the organizational cultures of schools, found in other studies, have implications for student achievement.</p>
<p>This study focuses on mathematics achievement because math is essential to students’ long-term success as they become citizens and workers in the twenty-first century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0038040712472911">Moses and Cobb 2001</xref>). With the expansion of technology, workers across occupational strata must employ mathematical concepts in their everyday lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038040712472911">Burrill 2001</xref>). We study achievement in the elementary years because students who struggle at early ages continue to underachieve in the upper grades. And as years pass, the achievement gaps that existed in the early grades widen, and the need for intervention grows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038040712472911">Lee, Grigg, and Dion 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study is innovative in several respects. Specifically, we assess components of what we term <italic>collective pedagogical teacher culture</italic>—a culture we find in schools where professional community and teacher collaboration are valued. Then, we assess whether collective pedagogical teacher culture influences students’ math trajectories in elementary school. While prior studies have offered important insights into mathematics achievement, they have not presented a clear view of how schools’ organizational cultures alter students’ learning trajectories. Studies that have focused on organizational cultures have limited generalizability as their samples were small or purposively selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038040712472911">Gamoran et al. 2000</xref>). Furthermore, studies have not assessed the extent to which organizational cultures can reduce both racial/ethnic and socioeconomic gaps in achievement; nor have they adequately established whether components of collective pedagogical teacher culture fit together conceptually.</p>
<p>We fill these gaps in the literature by assessing the effects of organizational cultures on elementary school students’ mathematics achievement trajectories, focusing on racial and socioeconomic achievement gaps. We analyze the mathematics achievement of students sampled in the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) through cross-classified growth curve models, a methodologically sophisticated technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038040712472911">Cheadle 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0038040712472911">Ladd and Dinella 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040712472911">Moller et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0038040712472911">Zvoch and Stevens 2006</xref>). The theoretical and methodological advances of our study result in a unique set of findings that clarifies how students’ mathematics achievement trajectories and gaps in these trajectories are conditioned by the perceived culture of schools.</p>
<sec id="section1-0038040712472911">
<title>Schools’ Organizational Cultures</title>
<p>The culture of an organization defines the organization. There are three broad components of organizational culture: <italic>Artifacts</italic> reflect the visible and identifiable structures, processes, and behaviors in an organization; <italic>underlying assumptions</italic> reflect unconscious and taken-for-granted beliefs and values in the organization; <italic>espoused beliefs and values</italic> include values and norms that shape interactions and expectations in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0038040712472911">Schein 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The earliest studies of organizational culture were qualitative, focusing on rich, deep description of cultural evolution, organizational artifacts, and underlying assumptions of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038040712472911">Denison 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0038040712472911">Schein 2010</xref>). More recently, this research tradition has embraced quantitative and comparative approaches. Researchers have increasingly focused on shared values and norms across organizations in that these values and norms are quantifiable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038040712472911">Denison 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0038040712472911">O’Reilly, Chatman, and Caldwell 1991</xref>). Values and norms are essential to organizational identity and internal control systems for organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038040712472911">Black 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0038040712472911">Pedersen and Dobbin 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0038040712472911">Schein 2010</xref>). They undergird the technical core of schools and prevent subcultures from undermining the mission of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0038040712472911">Schein 2010</xref>). Our research focuses on values and norms inside elementary schools, understanding these to be quantifiable manifestations of schools’ organizational cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0038040712472911">Schein 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Teachers are an integral part of generating and diffusing organizational culture within schools. While school administrators and leaders are generally responsible for establishing cultural values within schools, teachers must consent to and promote these values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038040712472911">Kruse and Louis 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0038040712472911">Schein 2010</xref>). In fact, schools’ organizational cultures can only affect student outcomes through teaching practices, and teaching is the core function of schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038040712472911">Gamoran et al. 2000</xref>). This is particularly salient during the elementary years because elementary-age students are more likely to conform to adult values than students in higher grades, who tend to form their own distinctive subcultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038040712472911">Firestone and Louis 1999</xref>). Therefore, we focus on teachers’ cultures as a component of schools’ organizational cultures.</p>
<p>Much of the research that contributes to our understanding of the organizational cultures of schools has focused on professional learning communities. The exact definition of these communities has varied across studies. Generally, they have been referred to as communities where teachers have a shared sense of purpose that is spearheaded by a visionary principal; have a sense of belonging, trust, and spirit; collaborate and reflect on student learning; and are continually developing professionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038040712472911">Gamoran, Gunter, and Williams 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038040712472911">Kruse and Louis 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0038040712472911">Louis and Kruse 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0038040712472911">Louis, Marks, and Kruse 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0038040712472911">Stoll et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We build on the professional learning community literature by positing that schools with collective pedagogical teacher cultures are the most effective at enhancing achievement and reducing achievement gaps for students. We conceptualize collective pedagogical teacher culture as a culture where teachers perceive (1) the presence of strong professional community and (2) a norm of collaboration among teachers where students’ needs are the focus.</p>
<p>While scholarship on professional communities does not always conceptualize these communities as cultures, there is a general understanding that professional communities cultivate organizational culture by creating shared languages, values, and expectations among teachers and administrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040712472911">McLaughlin and Talbert 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0038040712472911">1</xref></sup> Generally, within schools, the principal identifies the organizational mission and communicates the mission to the faculty. The organizational culture is stronger if the faculty agree on the mission. Organizational culture is also more community oriented if teachers feel accepted by each other and if they have a sense of pride or spirit. Prior scholarship has suggested that teachers who are socialized into community-oriented school culture (both professional and collegial) have a sense of belonging, attachment, and pride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038040712472911">Anderson 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0038040712472911">Wynne 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>An important attribute of professional communities within schools is an orientation toward learning. Scholars have suggested that professional communities are most effective when teachers are continually learning and searching for methods to enhance their effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0038040712472911">Little 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040712472911">McLaughlin and Talbert 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0038040712472911">Patchen 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0038040712472911">Smey-Richman 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0038040712472911">Yasumoto, Uekawa, and Bidwell 2001</xref>). Thus, we contend that teachers sense that they are part of professional communities when they perceive that there is an agreed upon mission, school pride, an orientation toward learning, and a sense of belonging.</p>
<p>This leads to the second main component of collective pedagogical teacher culture: a norm of teacher collaboration. Professional learning communities lay the foundation for teachers to learn from each other through collective understanding as opposed to individualized, fragmented understanding and teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040712472911">McLaughlin and Talbert 2006</xref>). Yet, a sense of community among teachers does not necessarily translate into collaborative teaching. Collaboration must be one of the norms guiding the community. Collaboration reflects an environment where teachers build their lessons cooperatively, eliminating redundancy and increasing compatibility across parts of the curriculum and across grades. This allows teachers to take collective responsibility for students, and it permits teachers to interactively develop the best strategies for teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0038040712472911">Lee and Smith 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0038040712472911">Louis and Marks 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040712472911">McLaughlin and Talbert 2006</xref>). Collaboration generates greater trust and helps strengthen ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0038040712472911">Patchen 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, a collaborative, professional community will not adequately serve the needs of students if the community does not focus on students’ needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0038040712472911">Wood 2007</xref>). Here, teachers are more invested in their students’ achievement, thereby increasing students’ opportunities to learn. Students do better in schools where teachers take collective responsibility for students’ learning and collaboratively develop interventions for individual students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038040712472911">Darling-Hammond 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040712472911">McLaughlin and Talbert 2006</xref>). Therefore, collaboration among teachers where the needs of students are prioritized is normative in a collective pedagogical teacher culture.</p>
<p>Many studies incorporate collaboration in the definition of professional learning communities, yet we contend that teachers can perceive that they are part of a community without collaborating on lessons or centralizing individual students’ needs. We test this proposition to assess whether professional community and teacher collaboration are integrally linked together.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0038040712472911">2</xref></sup>

<title>School Culture and Mathematics Achievement</title>
<p>Components of collective pedagogical teacher culture are associated with greater teacher satisfaction, greater accountability for student learning, a more student-oriented environment, a more academically oriented student culture, and ultimately higher achievement among students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038040712472911">Bryk and Driscoll 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038040712472911">Eilers and Carnacho 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038040712472911">Langer 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0038040712472911">Lee and Smith 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0038040712472911">Louis et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0038040712472911">Louis and Marks 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0038040712472911">MacNeil, Prater, and Busch 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0038040712472911">Smey-Richman 1991</xref>). In essence, professional and collaborative communities alter teaching practices, leading to greater learning opportunities for students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0038040712472911">Louis and Marks 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0038040712472911">Newmann, Marks, and Gamoran 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0038040712472911">Strahan 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior research has clarified the importance of schools’ organizational cultures for enhancing students’ academic outcomes, including mathematics achievement. However, these studies were based on small selective samples, limiting their generalizability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040712472911">Comer and Emmons 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038040712472911">Eilers and Carnacho 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0038040712472911">Strahan 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0038040712472911">Supovitz 2002</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038040712472911">Gamoran et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0038040712472911">Vescio et al. 2008</xref>). Two notable exceptions to this were <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038040712472911">Bryk and Driscol’s (1988)</xref> study of high schools in the 1980s and Lee, Smith, and Croninger’s series of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0038040712472911">Lee and Smith 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0038040712472911">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038040712472911">Lee, Smith, and Croninger 1997</xref>), but these studies were also focused on high schools. Prior research has documented that learning trajectories are largely established prior to high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0038040712472911">Moller et al. 2011</xref>). Therefore, we focus on the elementary years as a critical period in which students are potentially propelled toward success.</p>
<p>Finally, we contribute to the literature by examining whether schools with collective pedagogical teacher culture help reduce racial and socioeconomic gaps in achievement. This is an important line of inquiry given the national policy emphasis on achievement gaps and the theoretical importance of establishing how organizational culture can create more equitable learning environments. Indeed, in prior research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0038040712472911">Lee and Smith (1996)</xref> found that professional communities can establish more equitable learning environments as they can help overcome the effect of SES on achievement in high school; yet it remains unclear how professional communities might differentially affect race-specific or race-by-SES–specific achievement trajectories. Our limited knowledge of the impact of professional communities on students’ achievement trajectories is particularly problematic since school reform movements have emphasized the importance of altering professional development and organizational culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038040712472911">Desimone 2002</xref>). To better understand the effect of organizational culture on students’ achievement, we assess how components of collective pedagogical teacher culture interact with students’ race and SES to shape mathematics achievement trajectories.</p>
<p>We study mathematics trajectories for distinct racial/ethnic and class groupings because scholars have convincingly argued that in the modern economy race and class are intertwined. Indeed, there are racial divisions within classes and class divisions within races (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0038040712472911">Reardon and Galindo 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0038040712472911">Wilson 1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0038040712472911">1978b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0038040712472911">2011</xref>). Scholars have debated the extent to which racial divisions within the middle and upper classes have declined in the modern economy. Nevertheless, there is broader agreement that racial divisions persist among lower socioeconomic individuals because they are plagued by both racial and class-based isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038040712472911">Freeman 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0038040712472911">Oliver and Shapiro 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0038040712472911">Wilson 1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0038040712472911">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0038040712472911">2011</xref>). These divisions generate and reflect unique experiences and opportunities across socioeconomic racial groups, experiences that begin in early childhood.</p>
<p>Our research is in part a theoretical test, as prior scholarship has established that components of collective pedagogical teacher culture should augment mathematics achievement. Our research is also descriptive. We explain how this effect varies across socioeconomic and racial/ethnic categories. The extant literature does not generate race- and class-specific hypotheses. One could conjecture that the racial and ethnic groups might have similar responses to exposure to collective pedagogical teacher culture in the middle and upper classes, while responses may be divergent among the lower class.</p>

<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>We analyze data from the Department of Education’s Early Childhood Longitudinal Study. This study began in 1998 with a nationally representative sample of 19,680 kindergarteners. Most students were administered follow-up surveys when they were in the first, third, fifth, and eighth grades. In each wave students were tested and parents, teachers, and school administrators were surveyed, making this an ideal data set to examine students’ achievement trajectories in light of classroom and school characteristics. Students are included in our sample if they participated in the first four waves of data collection; this yields 10,670 students. We exclude the eighth-grade wave because this wave does not include the same measures of organizational culture as the previous waves.</p>
<p>Sample attrition is normal in longitudinal research. In this study, it reflects, in many cases, students changing schools (only 50 percent of students were followed into their new schools), students moving out of the country, and parental refusal to cooperate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0038040712472911">Tourangeau et al. 2009</xref>). Given attrition, nonresponse bias is small but measurable in the ECLS-K data, but it is minimized with the appropriate weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0038040712472911">Tourangeau et al. 2009</xref>); panel weights are applied in all analyses.</p>
<p>Given our research interests, we limit the sample to white, black, and Latino/a students. This narrows our sample to 8,700 students (68 percent white, 12 percent black, and 20 percent Latino/a). We also limit our sample to students who attend public schools because prior research has found that organizational culture is a defining feature of the divergence between Catholic and public schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038040712472911">Bryk, Lee, and Holland 1993</xref>). Dropping private schools from the analysis ensures that our results are not driven by this private school effect. Finally, we limit our sample to students who attend schools where both the teacher and the school administrator complete questionnaires.</p>
<p>Additional missing data are imputed through multiple imputation as this approach is far superior to listwise deletion of missing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038040712472911">Allison 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0038040712472911">Schafer 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0038040712472911">3</xref></sup> Data are imputed within waves to ensure that the efficiency of imputation is not compromised by attrition. To ensure high efficiency, the researchers determined a priori to only impute variables that are missing less than 20 percent of cases within waves. Most of our variables have less than 10 percent missing data and are thus imputed. However, a potential control variable, percentage of students on free and reduced price lunch, has more than 20 percent missing data. This variable is not imputed. Instead, the variable is tested in separate analysis (using a smaller sample) to ensure that the results are robust. Those results are footnoted in the results section. The imputation is more than 93 percent efficient for all imputed variables in all waves.</p>
<p>Our final sample includes 4,490 white, black, and Latino/a students who attended public elementary schools between 1998 and 2003. Comparing this final sample to the initial sample of black, white, and Latino/a students, the students are comparable in race (13 percent black and 17 percent Latino/a), socioeconomic status (30 percent of the final sample are lower SES, compared to 34 percent prior to sample selection, and 32 percent are higher SES in the final sample, compared to 34 percent in the original sample), and math scores (the average kindergarten and fifth-grade scores were 37.5 and 124.7 in the initial sample, and they are 36.4 and 124.2, respectively, in the final sample). As these descriptive statistics indicate, the final sample is not substantially different from the initial sample in terms of race, SES, and achievement.</p>
<sec id="section4-0038040712472911">
<title>Collective Pedagogical Teacher Culture</title>
<p>Before turning to the analysis of mathematics achievement, we will describe dimensions of collective pedagogical teacher culture. We conceptualize collective pedagogical teacher culture as a workplace environment where teachers perceive (1) a strong community orientation and (2) teacher collaboration. A strong professional community is measured with five variables: (1) Teachers have school spirit, (2) leadership has communicated a school mission, (3) teachers agree on a school mission, (4) teachers feel accepted and respected as a colleague, and (5) teachers are constantly engaged in learning. The norm of teacher collaboration is calculated with three variables that measure the extent to which individual teachers perceive that within the school, their colleagues: (1) collaborate on lesson planning, (2) collaborate on curriculum development, and (3) meet to discuss children. Each of these variables is gathered from the teacher questionnaire, and they are described in Appendix A (online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soe.sagepub.com">soe.sagepub.com</ext-link>).
</p>
<p>We measure collective pedagogical teacher culture through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). We use exploratory factor analysis because the extant literature does not clearly articulate the degree to which professional communities are collaborative. There is an assumption in the literature that they flow together, but we test this assumption because community does not necessarily generate collaboration. We test this assumption through maximum likelihood exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0038040712472911">4</xref></sup> Each of these variables is ordinal (Appendix A lists values), and therefore we ran the EFA on a polychoric correlation matrix. Our analysis produced two factors. The first factor represents strong professional learning communities (as the first five measures presented in Appendix A have a moderate to strong loading on this factor), and the second factor represents collaborative, child-oriented planning among teachers (the final three measures have a moderate to strong loading on this factor). We call our factors Professional Community and Teacher Collaboration.</p>
<p>The lack of correspondence between the collaboration variables and the remaining community variables suggests that schools with a professional learning community are not necessarily collaborative. This is an important finding given that prior research suggests that schools must have all of the components of collective pedagogical teacher culture to be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0038040712472911">Wood 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0038040712472911">5</xref></sup>

<title>Mathematics Achievement</title>
<p>Our dependent variable is achievement scores in mathematics between kindergarten and the fifth grade. We use item response theory (IRT) scale scores because these scores permit evaluation of achievement trajectories over time even though the tests changed to reflect age-appropriate measures. The IRT math scores assess the probability of a correct response by estimating the number of correct answers expected if the students had answered all questions for the math test in all waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0038040712472911">Tourangeau et al. 2009</xref>). Using these scores enables us to examine growth over time.</p>

<title>Additional Independent Variables</title>
<sec id="section7-0038040712472911">
<title>Student race and SES</title>
<p>We measure race and SES using kindergarten data. Race/ethnicity is coded as white, black, and Latino/a. SES is coded as low (in the bottom third), middle (in the middle third), and high (in the top third). We chose this coding scheme to allow us to combine race/ethnicity and SES into categories with sufficiently large samples in each time period. SES is a composite of five variables: father’s education and occupation, mother’s education and occupation, and household income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0038040712472911">6</xref></sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0038040712472911">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>In all models, we control for variables correlated with math scores and our primary independent variables (see Appendix B, online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soe.sagepub.com">soe.sagepub.com</ext-link>, for descriptive statistics). Our time-invariant controls include gender, English as a second language in kindergarten, and student’s approach to learning in kindergarten. English language learners clearly face more challenges in the classroom than do other students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040712472911">Gersten and Baker 2000</xref>). A student’s approach to learning has been found to be one of the strongest predictors of mathematics achievement and must be controlled in the models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038040712472911">Bodovski and Farkas 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0038040712472911">Singh, Granville, and Dika 2002</xref>). It is measured as a scale downloaded from the original data set and measures behaviors that affect learning, including child’s attentiveness, task persistence, eagerness to learn, learning independence, flexibility, and organization. This measure is pulled from the kindergarten survey because measures of collective pedagogical teacher culture should have an impact on students’ learning. Thus, we control for kindergarten orientation toward learning to control for students’ orientation when they enter school. Each of these time-invariant variables is interacted with time in the analysis to account for achievement trajectories of students of different genders, English language status, and learning approaches in kindergarten.</p>
<p>We also include time-variant controls, including same race (coded 1 if student and teacher are of the same race or ethnicity), school size (logged), percentage of students in the school who are white, teacher’s highest education (coded 1 for master’s degree, education specialist, or doctorate), teacher enjoys teaching (1 = yes), region (South is excluded), and rural/suburban (urban is excluded). We control for same-race teacher because research shows that same-race teachers are better role models and are a source of academic and socioemotional support—especially for minority students—through their interactions, instructional mechanisms, and time allocation. As a result, these students may flourish in schools, as seen in their course of study or overall achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038040712472911">Dee 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038040712472911">Ehrenberg, Goldhaber, and Brewer 1995</xref>). We control for school size because it influences equitable distributions of learning among students through its effect on class size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0038040712472911">Lee and Smith 1997</xref>). The variable measuring percentage of students in a school who are white helps to capture the effects of diversity in the student body, an important component of student learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0038040712472911">Rumberger and Palardy 2005</xref>). We control for teacher education since it reflects teacher quality, which has been found to affect student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038040712472911">Hanushek and Rivkin 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0038040712472911">Nye, Konstantopoulos, and Hedges 2004</xref>). Finally, we control for teacher satisfaction as it affects teachers’ organizational commitment and student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0038040712472911">Ostroff 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0038040712472911">Park 2005</xref>). Time-varying control variables are centered around their grand means.</p>
<p>Given that students’ achievement trajectories should reflect their cumulative experiences throughout their academic trajectory, teacher- and school-level variables are lagged for each student. While the literature suggests that a lag is necessary because students’ experiences cumulate over time and because school and teacher effects are long-lasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0038040712472911">Krueger and Whitmore 2001</xref>), the degree of the lag necessary continues to spark lively debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0038040712472911">Kane and Staiger 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038040712472911">Konstantopoulos 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0038040712472911">2008</xref>). Therefore, we empirically identify the lag by fitting a series of exponential decay curves to the data:</p>

<p>where τ is the rate of decay and <italic>t</italic> reflects time elapsed. Decay curves are widely used across the physical and social sciences to explain fade-out of a variety of phenomena. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0038040712472911">Kane and Staiger’s (2008)</xref> analysis of teacher effects on student achievement suggests a constant rate of fade-out at 50 percent (or 50 percent at <italic>t</italic> = 1 and 25 percent in <italic>t</italic> = 2). This rate is reflective of a decay curve where the rate of decay is .69. In separate analysis (not shown), we test decay rates ranging from τ = .001 (no decay) to τ = 1. We compare fit statistics across models and find that model fit begins to decline once we reach a decay of τ = .5.</p>
<p>Based on the application of the decay (see Appendix C online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soe.sagepub.com">soe.sagepub.com</ext-link>, for a detailed discussion of the method for applying the decay), our cumulative lag variables are calculated as follows. There is no lag given that kindergarten is the first year—100 percent of the lag variables in kindergarten are based on kindergarten. In the first grade, the lag variables are calculated as 61 percent kindergarten and 39 percent first grade. The third-grade values are calculated as 29 percent third grade, 39 percent first grade, and 32 percent kindergarten. For the fifth grade, the cumulative lag effects are calculated as 26 percent fifth grade, 33 percent third grade, 23 percent first grade, and 18 percent kindergarten. This measurement allows students’ school experiences to accumulate over time. In this way, measures of collective pedagogical teacher culture reflect students’ experiences with teachers, as opposed to the effects of individual teachers. By creating a lag of our key variables, we can better establish a causal link between measures of organizational culture and mathematics achievement.</p>

<title>Analytic Technique</title>
<p>We use cross-classified growth modeling to examine mathematics achievement over four time periods. Cross-classified growth models permit analysis of achievement scores over more than two time periods when the number of time periods is limited, trajectories are nonlinear, and students change schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038040712472911">Goldstein 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0038040712472911">Raudenbush and Bryk 2002</xref>). We are able to predict both initial scores in kindergarten and growth in scores between kindergarten, first, third, and fifth grades. This permits us to examine how professional community, teacher collaboration, and child-centered planning affect achievement in school, controlling for students’ initial scores:</p>

Growth in achievement by race and SES is measured through interactions between race/ethnicity, SES, and time. The effects of professional communities on achievement for each racial/ethnic and SES group is measured through interactions between race/ethnicity, SES, time, and professional community.

<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040712472911">Table 2</xref> suggest that black low-SES students benefit in the first, third, and fifth grades from studying in schools where teachers perceive the existence of a stronger professional community. These results are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0038040712472911">Figure 1</xref>. It is clear from this graph that the mathematics trajectories of black low-SES students who study in schools where teachers report weak professional communities (the gray dotted line) begin to diverge from their peers in the third grade. These students have substantially (and significantly) lower growth in predicted math scores by the fifth grade than any other group (at 67.29), including black low-SES students who study with teachers who perceive there to be strong professional communities in their schools. Yet while studying in schools with strong professional communities clearly boosts the achievement of low-SES black students, their growth by the fifth grade trails that of their Latino/a and white peers. Despite this fact, the graph clearly shows the importance of considering the strength of professional communities when discussing racial gaps in achievement among low-SES students.</p>
<p>Returning to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038040712472911">Table 1</xref>, black low-SES students trail their low-SES peers by approximately 13 points in achievement growth by the fifth grade when collaboration and community are not controlled in the model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0038040712472911">9</xref></sup> However, turning to the darker line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0038040712472911">Figure 1</xref> (from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040712472911">Table 2</xref>), students who spend their elementary years in schools with teachers who consistently sense the presence of a strong professional community only lag behind their peers in growth by 9 points. Indeed, the gap jumps to 18 points for black students who spend their elementary years with teachers who sense the existence of a weak community. Once again, this result highlights the importance of professional community for reducing racial and socioeconomic gaps in achievement, as low-SES black students are the most disadvantaged demographic group in American schools.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040712472911">Table 2</xref> also illustrates that professional community is not a significant determinant of math scores in kindergarten, although middle-SES Latino/a students who begin their education in schools where teachers perceive a stronger community have lower mathematics scores. This is likely not a result of the community, but merely an indication that initial disparities exist given that exposure to professional communities is limited at this early time, and there is no evidence of initial effects for other race-SES groups. In the first and third grades, the effect of Professional Community is negative (in light of the interaction terms, this is the effect for white middle-SES students), but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038040712472911">Figure 2</xref> illustrates that this effect is not substantial. White middle-SES students who study in schools where teachers perceive the existence of a strong professional community (indicated by the dark solid line) are slightly disadvantaged compared to their counterparts who attend schools where teachers perceive there to be a weak professional community (indicated by the gray solid line). However, the point estimates on the graph are not significantly different from each other, and this slight disadvantage subsides by the fifth grade. Indeed, by the fifth grade, racial disparities in achievement growth among middle-SES students are comparable regardless of whether students spend their elementary years with teachers who report strong or weak professional communities: Black middle-SES students are disadvantaged regardless.</p>
<p>In contrast, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040712472911">Table 2</xref> suggest that teachers’ sense of professional community does not influence high-SES students’ math trajectories. Yet when we plot growth in scores (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0038040712472911">Figure 3</xref>), a striking story emerges: High-SES black students who study in schools with teachers who perceive the existence of a weak community face serious obstacles as their predicted math achievement growth between the third and fifth grades is not significantly different from zero. As a result, by the fifth grade, the growth in math achievement of high-SES black students who spend their elementary years with teachers who sense weak communities falls significantly below white students who study with teachers who sense strong professional communities. Another potentially troublesome picture materializes from the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0038040712472911">Figure 3</xref>: Black high-SES students who study in schools with stronger professional community appear to trail their peers in the first and third grades. But these point estimates are not significant (neither are the slopes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040712472911">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize, black low-SES students experience the greatest benefit from studying with teachers who sense the existence of strong professional communities, not because this component of collective pedagogical teacher culture dissolves their disadvantage in mathematics achievement but because it protects them from the deleterious effects of studying in schools where teachers do not sense this community. This finding is in line with prior research. For example, teacher interviews from three elementary schools that were successful in raising achievement for low-SES black students suggested that teachers in those schools developed collaborative, professional communities that helped to enhance student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0038040712472911">Strahan 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Turning to Teacher Collaboration, our findings indicate that the results are not robustly significant over time for any of the lower SES categories, but they are significant for some middle- and higher-SES students. Black lower-SES students face serious challenges by the fifth grade regardless of whether they spend their elementary years with collaborative teachers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040712472911">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0038040712472911">Figure 4</xref>). For middle-SES white students, the effects of teacher collaboration in the third and fifth grade are significantly positive, indicating measurable growth for middle-SES white students. These results are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0038040712472911">Figure 5</xref>. White middle-SES students who study in schools where their teachers engage in collaborative planning (the darker solid line) significantly outperform their counterparts who study in schools where teachers report little time on collaborative planning (the gray solid line). Although white middle-SES students experience 4 points greater growth in achievement by the fifth grade when they study in classrooms where teachers report collaboration, the racial gap in achievement growth among middle-SES students is not significantly higher because all students receive a boost from attending schools where teachers collaborate. The gap between white and black middle-SES students is 12.6 points among those students who spent their elementary years in highly collaborative schools, while it is 15.4 points among those white and black middle-SES students who studied in noncollaborative schools. Teacher collaboration helps white middle-SES students without increasing racial gaps in achievement.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Latino/a middle-SES students who study with teachers who collaborate extensively are disadvantaged in the first and third grades, but this disadvantage dissipates by the fifth grade as their scores approach white middle-SES students. Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0038040712472911">Figure 4</xref> illustrates (in congruence with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038040712472911">Figure 2</xref>) that black middle-SES students dramatically underperform other racial/ethnic groups by the fifth grade regardless of their experience with teachers who collaborate.</p>
<p>Before turning to the results plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0038040712472911">Figure 6</xref>, we return to the results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038040712472911">Table 1</xref>, where community and collaboration are not controlled. This table illustrates that racial and ethnic gaps in achievement among high-SES students are relatively small, and black students only trail white and Latino/a student by 5 points in growth by the fifth grade. Yet, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0038040712472911">Figure 6</xref> (which plots the results from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040712472911">Table 2</xref>) illustrates that examining racial/ethnic effects without consideration of teacher collaboration masks gaps in achievement across schools. Racial disparities in math achievement trajectories are not evident among high-SES students who spend their elementary years with teachers who collaborate (as differences in growth are not significant). Yet, racial disparities are present among high-SES students who study in elementary schools where teachers do not collaborate, as white students outperform black and Latino/a students and black students trail their peers by approximately 15 points (compared to only 5 points when we do not control for collaboration and community, from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038040712472911">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Once again, summarizing the effects for teacher collaboration, Latino/a and black high-SES students and white middle-SES students experience the greatest benefit from teacher collaboration. Notably, the results illustrate that teacher collaboration can reduce racial gaps in achievement while also helping to boost the achievement of some white students. This result is particularly interesting given that prior studies have assumed that collaboration accompanies community. However, the results from this study indicate that the lowest SES students do not necessarily benefit from collaboration.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>There is a scarcity of nationally representative research that examines how the organizational cultures of elementary schools augment mathematics achievement and reduce gaps in achievement by race and SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0038040712472911">Vescio et al. 2008</xref>). Most studies that have linked components of collective pedagogical teacher culture—professional community and teacher collaboration—with student achievement were based on interviews and observational research in a small number of schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038040712472911">Berry, Johnson, and Montgomery 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038040712472911">Hollins et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0038040712472911">Louis and Marks 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0038040712472911">Phillips 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0038040712472911">Strahan 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0038040712472911">Supovitz 2002</xref>). All of these studies found that overall achievement was higher in schools with strong professional communities. Our research builds on these studies by illustrating, with nationally representative data, how achievement gains vary across students of different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>A limited number of quantitative studies also addressed this topic, but those studies focused on middle and high schools, and they did not assess how components of collective pedagogical teacher culture reduced achievement gaps by SES <italic>and</italic> race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038040712472911">Bryk and Driscoll 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0038040712472911">Lee and Smith 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0038040712472911">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0038040712472911">1996</xref>). Our research clarifies how schools’ organizational cultures affect achievement gaps by race, ethnicity, and SES in elementary school. In doing so, our study builds most directly on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0038040712472911">Lee and Smith (1996)</xref>, who found that socioeconomic gaps in achievement were smaller in high schools where teachers took collective responsibility for student learning.</p>
<p>We conceptualize an organizational culture that should—and has been found to—enhance students’ achievement trajectories. This organizational culture, <italic>collective pedagogical teacher culture</italic>, has two main components: (1) a strong community orientation and (2) teacher collaboration. Our findings indicate that community orientation and teacher collaboration do not fit neatly into a single component, and they must be measured separately. Yet, both of these elements of collective pedagogical teacher culture are important for reducing racial and socioeconomic gaps in achievement.</p>
<p>Importantly, the majority of students are not studying in schools with both of these factors. For fifth-grade students in our sample, less than one-fifth spend all of their elementary years in schools where their teachers frequently collaborate with each other, and even fewer students were fortunate enough to spend all of their surveyed elementary years with teachers who sensed that their schools had all of the components of a professional community (a mission, a sense of belonging and respect, continual learning, and spirit for the school). When thinking about this in terms of race, approximately 30 percent of black and Latino/a students and 35 percent of white students studied in schools with relatively strong professional communities (i.e., in the top 20 percent of the distribution) in kindergarten. By fifth grade, 13 percent of black students and 17 percent of Latino/a and white students spent all of their elementary years in these schools with relatively strong professional communities.</p>
<p>In light of our findings, the infrequencies of these important experiences are problematic. We find that math performance can be enhanced and racial and socioeconomic gaps in achievement can be reduced simply by changing the organizational culture of schools. Specifically, a professional community helps to reduce the extensive disadvantage faced by black students. Indeed, lower- and higher-SES black students are less disadvantaged by the fifth grade when they have studied with teachers who sense a professional community. Teacher collaboration is also beneficial for higher-SES black students, net of the community effect, because it reduces achievement gaps. Interestingly, middle-SES black students’ achievement trajectories are not significantly altered by the measures of collective pedagogical teacher culture.</p>
<p>Consistent with findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0038040712472911">Reardon and Galindo (2009)</xref>, results from this study show that within socioeconomic categories Latino/a students perform at levels that are very similar to those of white students. The predicted math trajectories for white and Latino/a low-, middle-, and high-SES students, irrespective of teachers’ perceptions of professional community, are almost identical, while the predicted math trajectories for black students appear to be considerably lower across all socioeconomic categories. This is an important area for further investigation.</p>
<p>However, Latino/a students are differentially affected by teacher collaboration. High-SES Latino/a students benefit from spending their elementary years in schools with teachers who sense a norm of collaboration while low-SES Latino/a students are temporarily harmed. While their deceleration in achievement rebounds by the fifth grade, it is important to better understand the source of this deceleration in an effort to help all Latino/a students achieve their fullest potential. Perhaps in the late 1990s many teachers had not been trained to understand the unique cultural heritage of Latino/a students or their predispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0038040712472911">Valenzuela 1999</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038040712472911">Espinosa (1995)</xref>, “Educators need to develop a greater understanding of the features of the Latino/a culture that influence parents’ childrearing and socialization practices, communication styles, and orientation toward formal education.” As such, teachers are not always adequately aware of the pedagogical approach best suited to Latino/a students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038040712472911">De Gaetano 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0038040712472911">Valenzuela 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0038040712472911">Zea, Quezada, and Belgrave 1994</xref>). This is an area for future investigation.</p>
<p>A key question that researchers must better understand is why a collective pedagogical teacher culture boosts student achievement and reduces gaps in achievement. As Gamoran and others have argued, the primary mechanisms for this to occur must be teaching practices. In a separate analysis, not shown, we find that teachers who report collaborative child-centered planning and teachers who sense the presence of professional communities in their schools are more likely to assist individual children. Indeed, in kindergarten, first, and third grades, around two-thirds of teachers who fall in the top 25 percent of the teacher collaboration or professional community measures offer students extra assistance at least three times a week, compared to approximately 50 percent of teachers who report very little collaboration or professional community. Therefore, components of collective pedagogical teacher culture influence students’ mathematics achievement through teaching practices due to the fact that teachers who perceive stronger collective pedagogical teacher cultures spend more time assisting individual children. In separate research, we are further exploring the extent to which collective pedagogical teacher culture influences peer culture, curriculum, and students’ orientation toward learning.</p>
<p>The policy implications of our findings are important. Schools can improve math performance and reduce achievement gaps by altering the organizational culture of schools. While teachers and leaders can work toward developing child-centered professional learning communities, there are numerous challenges that they will need to overcome. First, district and school leadership must be supportive of this approach and put structures in place that foster collaborative planning, such as materials, time, and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038040712472911">Gilrane, Roberts, and Russell 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0038040712472911">Levine and Marcus 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0038040712472911">MacIver and Epstein 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0038040712472911">Wood 2007</xref>). Second, the development of professional communities does not necessarily create a collaborative environment among teachers, either because teachers have not been adequately professionalized as collaborative and cooperative team players or because they do not appreciate forced “community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0038040712472911">Pomson 2005</xref>). Thus, it is important to include teachers in the process of defining goals and professional development needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038040712472911">Gilrane et al. 2008</xref>). Third, the results for Latino/a students suggest that collaboration will only be effective for the greatest number of students if planning is preceded by diversity training and cultural understanding. This would serve to enhance trust between families and schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038040712472911">De Gaetano 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0038040712472911">Nicolau and Ramos 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0038040712472911">Ream 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that politicians and bureaucrats must consider the implications of educational reform on the organizational culture of schools, asking whether reforms enhance schools’ cultures, thereby making them more accessible to a diverse group of students. Educational reform should be based on the premise that educators have multiple types of resources to use when teaching their students; schools’ organizational cultures is one such resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038040712472911">Grubb 2008</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0038040712472911">Charles Payne (2008)</xref> has argued that educational reforms have failed to produce consistently positive results, in part because reformers have overlooked the extent of “collective depression” in schools. This includes demoralized school cultures. Indeed, the No Child Left Behind Act makes it difficult for schools to develop collective pedagogical teacher cultures because it increases competition among teachers while simultaneously reducing trust and morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038040712472911">Crocco and Costigan 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0038040712472911">Lankford et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0038040712472911">Ravitch 2010</xref>). This is incompatible with the development of collective pedagogical teacher cultures. Reformers must address this issue to more effectively reduce achievement gaps.</p>
<p>The final implication of this study concerns the value of organizational sociology for research in the sociology of education. As noted earlier, studies of educational organizations rarely focus on schools’ organizational cultures. We illustrate that the organizational cultures of schools have important implications for student outcomes. In the spirit of the organizational research tradition, future quantitative research on values and norms should be accompanied by qualitative research that highlights detailed processes and behaviors and other organizational artifacts. This would more fully elucidate values and norms and how these norms are developed, maintained, and diffused within elementary schools. Indeed, while our research shows unequivocally the importance of collective pedagogical teacher culture to reducing racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic mathematics achievement gaps, one must turn to the qualitative literature to understand the processes underlying these trends. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038040712472911">Berry et al. (2005)</xref> clarified in a rural elementary school <italic>how</italic> teachers collaborated to promote student achievement; this included taking systematic notes on their teaching to share with colleagues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0038040712472911">Phillips (2003)</xref> also illustrated the process of collaboration through interview research in a middle school, finding that teachers collaborated through study circles, friends groups, and classroom observations. A multimethod approach would help us further understand the processes through which schools with collective pedagogical teacher cultures reduce racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic achievement gaps. Ideally, future quantitative research will also include more nuanced measures of teaching practices and student-oriented teaching techniques and values to determine exactly how collective pedagogical teacher culture generates greater achievement. In the meantime, this study provides important support for the theoretical claims that the organizational cultures of schools are essential elements of successful reform efforts that augment mathematics achievement for students across diverse racial/ethnic and social class backgrounds.</p>

<p>A visionary leader is important for professional communities because he or she permits a centralized set of goals. This leader, typically the principal, can change or bolster the organizational culture of his or her school by working with teachers to instill values, trust, and expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038040712472911">Bizar and Barr 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038040712472911">Bryk and Schneider 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040712472911">McLaughlin and Talbert 2006</xref>).

<p>It is important to note that our description of collective pedagogical teacher culture assumes that culture has developed dynamically (following the important theoretical work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038040712472911">Gamoran, Secada, and Marrett 2000</xref>).

<p>We also tested the two-factor solution through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for each grade. We fit models with goodness of fit and Comparative Fit Index indices above .98 and root mean square error of approximation below .06 in each time period. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and CFA factor scores are correlated above .97 in each time period for the first factor, and they are correlated above .9 for the second factor. This suggests that the factor scores created from the EFA represent constructs that fit the data well.</p>

<p>Data on socioeconomic status (SES) are asked of parents in each wave, permitting us to model change in SES over time. Less than 10 percent of the sample has a substantial, lasting change in socioeconomic status over time.
