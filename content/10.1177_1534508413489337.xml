<abstract>
<p>The use of Curriculum-Based Measures is rapidly expanding to the middle school level, where maze passages are frequently used to monitor progress in reading. At secondary grade levels, the focus of reading is on reading to learn, especially in the content areas. Therefore, we were interested in developing maze passages based on grade-level science texts to determine whether maze passages constructed from expository texts would have sufficient reliability and validity to serve as reading and science benchmarking tools. Participants included 367 seventh-grade students from three states. Students completed eight maze passages over three testing periods, a reading measure at two testing periods, and 182 students completed a science state assessment. Alternate form reliability of the science maze passages ranged from .56 to .80. Concurrent and predictive correlation coefficients with other measures ranged from .63 to .67. Implications for practice and research are discussed.</p>

<p>The transition from elementary to middle school presents a significant challenge for many students, especially those who do not leave elementary school with strong performance in reading. In general, reading performance has been divided into two broad stages: (a) <italic>learning to read</italic> in the elementary schools and (b) <italic>reading to learn</italic> in secondary schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508413489337">Chall, 1996</xref>). Students who enter secondary school unable to read grade-level text proficiently will need not only reading intervention but also instruction and support from their content area teachers because they are less able to acquire critical conceptual and factual knowledge from their texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534508413489337">Torgesen et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, recent estimates indicate that as many as 70% of students in Grades 4 to 12 lack the skills to read and write proficiently in academic content areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508413489337">National Center for Education Statistics, 2011</xref>). With the increased emphasis of the Common Core State Standards on informational texts, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress’ (NAEP) focus on informational reading in secondary grades, it is important that students develop strong academic literacy, and that teachers have a way to identify those students who may require support to become proficient content area readers.</p>
<p>Of the content areas, science is emerging as a particularly important discipline for a variety of reasons. Of the 50 states, 11 are currently integrating science achievement results into accountability calculations, with more states indicating they plan to include science performance in the near future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508413489337">Judson, 2012</xref>). In addition, projections of 21st century careers focus heavily on the need for strong science, technology, and math skills, suggesting that all students will require science proficiency to achieve successful postschool outcomes. The emphasis of science in accountability requirements as well as the emphasis more generally means that <italic>all</italic> students, including those at risk for and with learning disabilities (LD) will be required to meet minimum academic standards, including passing state assessments in science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534508413489337">Seifert &amp; Espin, 2012</xref>). Low achievement in science is a significant problem nationally however, with recent National Assessment of Educational Progress science scores for 2009 indicating that less than one third of students in eighth grade scored at or above proficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508413489337">National Center for Education Statistics, 2011</xref>). Students with disabilities tend to score significantly lower than students without disabilities, in large part due to language challenges in reading and writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534508413489337">Therrien, Taylor, Hosp, Kaldenberg, &amp; Gorsh, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Students who struggle in reading also tend to struggle in their content area classes in which the reading demands are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534508413489337">Seifert &amp; Espin, 2012</xref>). It has been estimated that up to 40% of students in general have difficulty acquiring relevant information from science textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508413489337">Hock &amp; Deshler, 2003</xref>), which is problematic as textbooks continue to be a major source of instruction at the secondary school level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508413489337">Moin, Magiera, &amp; Zigmond, 2009</xref>). A number of reviews have documented the complexity of science textbooks and this complexity is even more challenging for students with reading challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508413489337">Armbruster, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534508413489337">Mastropieri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508413489337">Scruggs &amp; Mastropieri, 2007</xref>). Science texts often include densely worded paragraphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534508413489337">Yager, 1983</xref>) containing unfamiliar, multisyllabic, and technical vocabulary words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534508413489337">Yovanoff, Duesbery, Alonzo, &amp; Tindal, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The mismatch between the abilities of struggling adolescent readers and the reading requirements of content area classes has led to calls for increased reading instruction in the content areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508413489337">Biancarosa &amp; Snow, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508413489337">Biancarosa and Snow (2006)</xref> argued that reading instruction within the content areas is necessary because skills learned in a separate reading program will not transfer automatically to the reading of content area text. Despite these calls, however, current practices in middle schools often do not reflect strong content area literacy instruction, or a movement toward providing support to students who struggle with the reading demands of the content area classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508413489337">Prewett et al., 2012</xref>). To support student needs in content area reading, content area teachers will need to integrate reading interventions specifically designed to support the needs of students who struggle with reading textbooks.</p>
<p>Several researchers have studied the impact of comprehension strategies to support comprehension, with varying degrees of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508413489337">De La Paz &amp; MacArthur, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508413489337">Mastropieri &amp; Scruggs, 1992</xref>; Vaughn et al., 2008). More recent investigations have focused on other aspects of reading such as word recognition and reading fluency. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534508413489337">Seifert and Espin (2012)</xref> reported that student performance was enhanced when reading interventions of vocabulary learning and repeated readings, targeted in the content, was provided to struggling readers in the content areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534508413489337">Seifert &amp; Espin, 2012</xref>). This type of intervention is consistent with the focus on tiered instructional delivery systems that emphasize the use of targeted intervention as secondary prevention to support student learning within the general education setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508413489337">Johnson &amp; Mellard, in press</xref>). However, to effectively design and implement such intervention, students most at risk for poor academic outcomes must be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508413489337">Johnson, Mellard, Fuchs, &amp; McKnight, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures to Identify Struggling Readers</title>
<p>One of the most effective means of identifying students at risk for poor reading outcomes is the use of a data-driven, tiered instructional delivery system that relies on the use of screening measures that are accurate, efficient, and highly predictive of the outcome of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508413489337">Mellard &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534508413489337">Wayman, Wallace, Wiley, Ticha, &amp; Espin, 2007</xref>). For middle and high school students, the use of a maze measure has been found to be highly predictive of reading performance on more general measures of reading, and in some recent studies has been found to produce more valid measures of student growth in reading than oral reading fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508413489337">Allison &amp; Johnson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508413489337">Espin &amp; Foegen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508413489337">Espin, Wallace, Lembke, Campbell, &amp; Long, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508413489337">Tolar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534508413489337">Vaughn &amp; Fletcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534508413489337">Wayman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534508413489337">Wiley &amp; Deno, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the development and study of maze measures to predict performance of secondary students, a more limited research base has examined the development of Curriculum-Based Measures (CBM) in the content areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508413489337">Deno &amp; Espin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508413489337">Espin &amp; Foegen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508413489337">Espin, Shin, &amp; Busch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534508413489337">Vannest, Parker, &amp; Dyer, 2011</xref>). These studies have investigated a variety of measures including reading aloud from text, maze selection, and vocabulary matching. Vocabulary matching has been reported to correlate moderately with criterion tests in social studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508413489337">Espin et al., 2005</xref>) and science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534508413489337">Vannest et al., 2011</xref>), demonstrating promise as a content area progress monitoring tool for the content areas.</p>
<p>Despite the promising results reported for the use of vocabulary matching, for the present study, we explored the use of maze measures for a variety of reasons. First, a recent review of middle school responsiveness to intervention (RTI) implementation conducted by the National Center on Response to Intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508413489337">Prewett et al., 2012</xref>) indicated that whereas 100% of participating middle schools were using benchmarking procedures in reading to provide intervention, no school reported using measures or interventions to provide student support in the content areas. This suggests that middle school staff may already have the proficiency in administering, scoring, and interpreting maze data, but simply lack the available tools to monitor reading progress in the content areas. Because maze measures tend to rely on narrative texts or expository texts that are not directly related to content area learning, middle school staff may not generalize a student’s reading ability to inform content area intervention decisions. A maze passage derived directly from content area course material might support instructional strategies that promote stronger content literacy.</p>
<p>Our main rationale for revisiting the use of maze tasks, however, comes from the well-documented finding that different texts require different reading skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508413489337">Alvermann, 2001</xref>). This means that assessing student reading performance across different texts might be necessary to provide a more accurate gauge of student reading ability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534508413489337">Torgesen et al. (2007)</xref> identified six essential areas that contribute to academic literacy in content areas in the secondary grades, including (a) reading fluency, (b) vocabulary knowledge, (c) content knowledge, (d) higher level reasoning skills, (e) cognitive strategies for reading comprehension, and (f) engagement. Students who do not possess these skills cannot keep pace with the increasing demands that content area texts place on prior knowledge, and will fall further and further behind in their ability to construct the meaning of the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534508413489337">Torgesen et al., 2007</xref>). To keep pace with the volume of reading, students must continue to meet grade-level expectations for reading fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534508413489337">Torgesen &amp; Hudson, 2006</xref>). In addition, there is strong evidence that knowledge related to the content of text being read leads to better reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508413489337">Kintsch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534508413489337">McNamara &amp; Kintsch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534508413489337">Wolfe et al., 1998</xref>). Maze selection tasks were developed to serve as general outcome measures of these specific reading areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508413489337">Fuchs, Fuchs, Hosp, &amp; Jenkins, 2001</xref>) and have been found across numerous studies to be highly predictive of criterion tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508413489337">Tolar et al., 2012</xref>). As a result of this review of literature, we theorized that the creation of a familiar task (i.e., maze) that can (a) yield multiple data points to identify students at risk, (b) chart growth across the school year, and (c) be administered in a group format to provide teachers with a means of assessing the reading proficiency of their entire class within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534508413489337">Wayman et al., 2007</xref>) would be more appealing to schools working to develop schoolwide tiered delivery systems than a novel task that would be more difficult to construct, such as vocabulary matching.</p>

<title>Constructing Science Content Maze Passages</title>
<p>In a maze selection measure, every seventh word of a passage is deleted and replaced with a multiple-choice item consisting of the correct word plus two distractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508413489337">Espin &amp; Foegen, 1996</xref>). Students read through the text and choose the correct word for each multiple-choice item. As a progress monitoring tool, the maze task is a standardized, longitudinal assessment of reading abilities. The same methods are used with equivalent but unique passages (i.e., alternate forms) that are administered across measurement points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534508413489337">Reschly, Busch, Betts, Deno, &amp; Long, 2009</xref>). This system of assessment assumes that alternate forms function as parallel probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508413489337">Jenkins, Zumeta, Dupree, &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>). In addition, over time, maze scores should reflect changes in students’ true reading levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508413489337">Francis et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the variability of readability levels of science texts, as well as the challenges of equating passages with varying content focus, the assumptions required for adequate CBM tools present unique challenges to the development of a set of measures that can be used to benchmark and monitor growth in science content area reading. Although a recent review and study investigating the technical adequacy of maze tasks for middle schools reported that maze passages were reliable and valid indicators of students’ reading performance and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508413489337">Tolar et al., 2012</xref>), the authors also noted significant variance (between 6% and 13%) due to passage effects, with raw score differences in maze performance ranging from 10 to 13 correct selections based on passage effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508413489337">Tolar et al., 2012</xref>). Performance on specific content passages may result in even higher passage effects for maze measures constructed from science textbooks. Although statistical procedures can be used over time to correct such variability (e.g., equating scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508413489337">Tolar et al., 2012</xref>], and/or constructing confidence intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508413489337">Christ &amp; Ardoin, 2009</xref>]), if raw scores vary drastically during initial development and use, it is likely that the maze passages will not have high face validity among practitioners, and therefore not be implemented.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508413489337">Fuchs and Fuchs (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508413489337">Espin and Foegen (1996)</xref> provided guidance on how to develop maze passages from existing text. Maze passages should meet the following criteria: (a) The first sentence is left intact; (b) beginning with the second sentence, every seventh word is deleted from the text and replaced with a multiple-choice item; (c) if the word to be replaced is a proper noun or an article, the next appropriate word should be selected to be replaced with a multiple-choice item; (d) each multiple-choice item should consist of the correct choice and two distracters; (e) distracters should be designed so that they are not semantically correct, do not rhyme or sound similar to the correct answer, and are not visually similar to the correct choice; and (f) distracters should be no more than two letters longer or shorter than the correct choice. Online maze passage generators such as those found on Intervention Central (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.interventioncentral.org">http://www.interventioncentral.org</ext-link>) permit a user to enter text and have a maze passage automatically generated. While these online tools meet several of the criteria outlined by Fuchs and Fuchs and Espin and Foegen, the automatically generated passages do not provide word choices that meet the specifics as outlined by these researchers. Drawing from the science text in use across several of the participating seventh-grade classrooms, we followed the procedures described by Espin and Foegen to develop a set of maze passages for use in the present study.</p>
<p>Once maze passages are created, they must proceed through a series of development studies examining their technical properties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508413489337">Fuchs (2004)</xref> outlined three stages of CBM research that together constitute a standard protocol for the development and validation of CBMs for use within tiered service delivery models. The first stage includes establishing the psychometric properties of static scores, the second stage examines the reliability and validity of growth rates, and the third stage investigates the subsequent impact on instructional decision making. As described by Fuchs, the stages are sequential—The technical features of scores, then of the resulting slope, must be established prior to examinations of instructional utility.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to collect evidence for the technical features of the score (Stage 1 CBM research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508413489337">Fuchs, 2004</xref>) for maze passages constructed from a science textbook for seventh graders.

<title>Test of Silent Reading Efficiency and Comprehension (TOSREC)</title>
<p>Because data were collected from three different states, all three of which use different state reading assessments, we collected data about student reading performance using a consistent measure across sites. The TOSREC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534508413489337">Wagner, Torgesen, Rashotte, &amp; Pearson, 2010</xref>) is a group-administered measure of silent reading fluency and comprehension that can be used as a screening tool to identify poor readers, as a progress monitoring tool, and as a brief measure of silent reading for comprehension by clinicians and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534508413489337">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>). Students are given 3 min to read sentences and indicate whether the sentence makes sense or can be true. Scores are computed by counting the correct items and subtracting the number of incorrect items from the total. Incorrect items are scored as a −1 to correct for guessing. The TOSREC yields Raw Scores, Index Scores, and Percentile Ranks. The index on the TOSREC includes standard scores that have been derived from a distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>) of 15. The alternate forms reliability coefficients exceed .85 across all forms and grade levels, and reported reliability coefficients with other reading measures (e.g., Woodcock Johnson III [WJIII], Group Reading Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation [GRADE]) exceeding .70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534508413489337">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Idaho Student Achievement Test, Science (ISAT)</title>
<p>The ISAT is a state assessment intended to determine whether students have met state performance standards in science in Grades 5, 7, and 10. It is a computerized, 40-item multiple-choice test with goals and objectives for each grade distributed between two reporting categories: Concepts and Processes and General Science. The ISAT reports scale scores using a Rasch model to allow for cross-grade comparisons. The internal consistency of the seventh-grade science subtest was reported as .84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534508413489337">Data Recognition Corporation, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Science maze passages</title>
<p>We created maze passages from the McGraw-Hill Life Science textbook for seventh grade, which was the textbook adopted by the participating sites. First, to ensure adequate representation of the curricular concepts to be assessed we selected only those chapters covering concepts that would be taught during the school year at each site. To determine the concepts to be taught during that school year, we consulted the seventh-grade science curriculum guides developed by each of the three schools, and chose only those concepts that were included across all three sites. Then, we randomly selected three passages from each concept of between 350 and 400 words in length and entered them into the maze passage generator available on the Intervention Central website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.interventioncentral.org">www.interventioncentral.org</ext-link>). Prior to generating the maze, we requested readability estimates, which are also produced by the online maze passage generator. We only retained passages that fell within a seventh-grade Flesch–Kincaid readability level. After this process, we had a total of seven passages of approximately 350 words with readability levels within the seventh-grade level reflecting seven different topics of the seventh-grade life science curriculum.</p>
<p>The initial seven maze passages generated by the online Intervention Central computerized tool violated some of the procedures for developing maze passages outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508413489337">Fuchs and Fuchs (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508413489337">Espin and Foegen (1996)</xref>. Therefore, we reviewed each maze passage to ensure that it met the criteria outlined by Espin and Foegen and described earlier in this manuscript. To determine the number of multiple-choice items (blanks) for each passage, we consulted the performance standards reported on AIMSweb for maze performance on narrative passages, and then ensured that the maze passages we created had an additional 10% items to avoid ceiling effects. This resulted in having each passage containing between 47 and 50 multiple-choice items to complete.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Data collection for this project took place over three testing periods: fall, winter, and spring. Prior to data collection, we randomly selected one maze passage to serve as an anchor passage that all students would complete across each of the three testing periods. The remaining passages were divided into groups of two and then labeled as fall, winter, or spring. In October (fall), participating students completed three maze passages (the anchor and Maze Passages 2 and 3) presented in random order to control for order effect. Students also completed Form A of the TOSREC in fall. In January (winter), students completed three maze passages (the anchor and Maze Passages 4 and 5), presented in random order to control for order effect. Finally, in April (spring), students completed three maze passages (the anchor and Maze Passages 6 and 7), in random order to control for order effect. Students also completed Form C of the TOSREC. Students from the school in the Northwest (<italic>n</italic> = 187) also completed the science ISAT subtest. All reading tests were administered by trained research assistants. The science test was administered by the students’ teachers in accordance with state and district policy for state assessment administration.</p>
<p>A random selection of 20% of the maze passages (approximately 200 each testing period) was double-scored to determine interscorer reliability. For all passages, interscorer reliability was 100%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534508413489337">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To investigate the alternate forms reliability of the passages, we ran correlational analyses within each testing period. Across testing periods, we also included an anchor passage that all students completed at each testing period, and conducted correlational analyses to collect initial test/retest reliability data. Next, we were interested in examining the concurrent validity of the measures with other indicators of reading. Correlational analyses of student performance on TOSREC in the fall with fall median maze scores, as well as correlational analyses of student performance in reading in the spring with spring median maze scores were conducted. To examine the concurrent validity of the measures with science performance, we conducted correlational analyses with performance on a science state assessment for the student participants in Idaho—Participants from other states did not participate in high-stakes science assessments. Last, we examined the predictive validity of the fall and winter measures to predict spring performance in reading and in science using correlational analyses and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534508413489337">Zhou, Obuchowski, &amp; Obuchowski, 2002</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section11-1534508413489337">
<title>Determining at-risk status</title>
<p>Although the initial alternate forms reliability was the focus of this study, we were also interested in determining whether the maze passages would be helpful in identifying students at risk for poor science outcomes because of reading challenges. To determine cut points for identifying students at risk for poor science outcomes on the state assessment, binary classification analyses were run. Performance on the state assessment was coded as a dichotomous variable based on whether the student met the published cut score for proficiency. A logistic regression was then conducted to determine whether the science maze probes could accurately predict performance in the pass/fail category. Winter and fall median maze scores were entered to determine whether winter would serve as a more accurate predictor of spring science performance. Then, a ROC curve analysis was conducted to identify the cut score that predicted the group of students who were at risk for not meeting state proficiency standards. ROC analysis provides a measure of how well a screening measure correctly sorts students as at-risk or not-at-risk by plotting the range of sensitivity and specificity levels across all possible scores of the screening tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534508413489337">Zhou et al., 2002</xref>). A ROC analysis produces a plot of sensitivity and specificity levels and reports the area under the curve (AUC) as a way to determine the utility of the screening measure. AUC values closer to 1 indicate the screening measure reliably distinguishes among students with satisfactory and unsatisfactory science performance, whereas values at .50 indicate the predictor is no better than chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534508413489337">Zhou et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the AUC, ROC analysis also produces a table of scores on the screening measure along with the associated sensitivity and specificity levels. Sensitivity represents the proportion of truly at-risk students in a screened population who are identified as being at risk by the screen. It is calculated by dividing the number of truly at-risk students identified by the screen by the total number of students who are truly at risk (e.g., true positives / [true positives + false negatives]). Specificity is the proportion of not-at-risk students who are so identified by the screening test. It is calculated by dividing the number of truly not-at-risk students identified by the screen by the total number of students who are truly not at risk (e.g., true negatives / [true negatives + false positives]). In most screening procedures, practitioners are interested in identifying all or nearly all of the students who are at risk while minimizing the overidentification of students who are not at risk. Thus, we examined cut scores that maximized sensitivity and specificity levels. Next, we created a two-by-two table based on these cut scores to determine the overall classification accuracy. These analyses were considered exploratory in nature to help determine the predictive validity evidence for the maze.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534508413489337">Table 3</xref> presents the correlation of variables to determine the concurrent and predictive validity evidence of the maze passages. Concurrent validity coefficients indicate that the median of the maze passages in fall and spring were moderately and significantly correlated with fall and spring TOSREC at .63 and .67, respectively. In addition, spring maze median was moderately and significantly correlated with science achievement, at .65. This provides strong concurrent validity evidence for the maze passages with both standardized measures of reading and science. The predictive validity coefficients, although still statistically significant and in the moderate range, were lower, with .58 correlation of fall maze to spring TOSREC and .46 of fall maze to spring science.</p>

<p>The median score of the winter maze was a significant predictor of later performance on the state science assessment. The results of the logistic regression indicated that the classification accuracy improved from 73% with no predictors (i.e., assuming all students would pass) to 79% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534508413489337">Table 4</xref>). Logistic regression provides an overall indication of a measure’s potential use as an effective screener, but it does not inform potential cut scores. The ROC curve analysis indicated an AUC of .757, which is considered a “good” predictor. The associated cut score to optimize classification accuracy was 26, which would result in missing 31 of 47 students who were not successful in science. Some researchers have argued that as the primary goal of administering CBM benchmarks is to identify students at risk for not meeting outcomes, cut scores that identify 90% or more of students at risk should be set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508413489337">Johnson, Jenkins, Petscher, &amp; Catts, 2009</xref>). However, when cut scores were set to optimize identification of students who did not pass science (i.e., sensitivity of 90%), the resulting cut score of 37 items was higher than the mean performance, and overidentified as at-risk 76 of 135 students who passed the science exam. Optimizing specificity and sensitivity at .70 for each resulted in a 69% classification accuracy rate.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sufficient evidence on struggling adolescent readers suggests that even if reading instruction and intervention at the elementary level are implemented with fidelity, a large number of students will still be at risk for poor outcomes in their content area classes on entering middle school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534508413489337">Torgesen &amp; Miller, 2009</xref>). To address this issue, many state educational agencies are implementing tiered instructional models that focus on early identification and intervention, though most of the efforts implemented in middle school focus on reading only and not on supporting performance in the content areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508413489337">Prewett et al., 2012</xref>). With science performance becoming a more routine component of accountability systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508413489337">Judson, 2012</xref>), and with the increased focus on science in postsecondary settings, it is important that middle schools identify students at risk for poor outcomes in this content area. CBM hold the most promise for serving as reliable and valid indicators of academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534508413489337">Stecker, Fuchs, &amp; Fuchs, 2005</xref>), but there are no readily available resources within the content areas. Although reading maze tasks provide a general indicator of students’ reading proficiency levels, middle school content teachers may not be able to generalize from reading measures to reading performance in the content areas, as different types of text require different types of reading skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508413489337">Alvermann, 2001</xref>). Maze tasks demonstrate significant promise as reliable and valid indicators of student reading performance, and tap several of the essential areas identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534508413489337">Torgesen et al. (2007)</xref> needed for academic literacy. Therefore, our purpose in this study was to develop and pilot a set of maze passages constructed from science textbooks to determine their potential use as benchmark and progress monitoring tools.</p>
<p>This study focused on examining the alternate forms reliability and criterion validity evidence of the science maze passages developed from science textbooks, which is consistent with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508413489337">Fuchs (2004)</xref> termed <italic>Stage 1 CBM research</italic>. The findings of this study suggest that the science maze passages we created demonstrate similar levels of alternate forms reliability as other maze passages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508413489337">Tolar et al., 2012</xref>), and that the median score of three maze probes was significantly and moderately correlated with standardized measures of reading and science. The correlation coefficients were moderate in both concurrent and predictive analyses, suggesting that the CBMs provide useful information about middle school students’ reading and science performance. The practical consideration that maze can be group administered in less than 5 min is also beneficial in providing schools useful data without sacrificing an inordinate amount of instructional time.</p>
<p>The consistency of the measures across passages was encouraging given that a range of topics were included across the passages, and that passages were not administered to align with the current instructional focus in the classroom. The lower alternate forms reliability for the spring administration of the anchor passage is consistent with other research indicating a practice effect when students are exposed to the same passage multiple times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508413489337">Tolar et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The ROC analyses, though exploratory, suggest that performance on the science maze may be helpful in identifying students who are at risk for poor reading and science outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section14-1534508413489337">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study reflects initial development work on the creation of a set of content area maze passages to serve as general outcome measures of student performance in reading in the content areas. As an exploratory study, our findings are promising; however, results should be interpreted with caution given the limitations of our study. First, we constructed maze passages from one textbook that was in use across the three schools participating in this research, being careful to equate the passages in terms of length, number of multiple-choice items, and readability levels. Passages constructed from other texts and other topic areas may yield different results. Next, although our sample was drawn from across three geographical areas across the United States, the demographics of the final sample differ from national demographics. Future studies that include a more diverse sample of students will be needed to reflect the student population more generally. Last, our examination of the maze passages’ concurrent and predictive validity with science achievement is limited to one state’s standardized assessment. Future studies that examine the ability of the measures to predict performance on other science measures will be needed to determine generalizability of results.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice and Research</title>
<p>As students enter middle school, the academic demands of their school experience shift from learning to read to reading to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508413489337">Chall, 1996</xref>). This shift requires students to apply a variety of reading and thinking skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534508413489337">Torgesen et al., 2007</xref>) to derive meaning from content area texts. However, sufficient evidence suggests that a significant number of students will need support as they enter middle school. Current reports of middle school models of RTI to support student needs suggest that little to no support within the content areas is provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508413489337">Prewett et al., 2012</xref>). One reason why schools may not implement interventions within the content areas is because there currently are no benchmark tools to identify students who require such supports. Content area reading tasks have the potential to serve as indicators of student performance in the content areas and to inform which students are in need of support to achieve in the content areas.</p>
<p>The need to efficiently identify students at risk for poor outcomes in middle school is great, yet there are very few tools that specifically address academic literacy. This study provides initial evidence that the construction of maze passages from content area textbooks presents one promising approach to the early identification and intervention for students who will struggle with the academic demands of the content area classroom. The results of the present study suggest that the seventh-grade maze measures are moderately correlated with measures of reading and science performance. Future research should follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508413489337">Fuchs’s (2004)</xref> stages of CBM research and focus on the measures’ ability to monitor growth, and ultimately to inform instructional decision making.</p>
