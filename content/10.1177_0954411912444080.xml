<abstract>
<p>The relationship between hemodynamics and thrombus deposition in abdominal aortic aneurysm is investigated for three patients (A, B and C), each with mature fusiform aneurysms. Our methodology utilises initial and follow-up computerised tomography scans for each patient to identify regions of mural thrombus growth and to provide patient-specific models for hemodynamic analysis using computational fluid dynamics. The intervals between scans for patients A, B and C were 17, 15 and 3 months, respectively. The simulations were performed using physiologically realistic boundary conditions. The hemodynamic features of the flow considered include the velocity field, the shear strain rate field, the time averaged wall shear stress and the oscillatory shear index. The parameter that showed best correlation with the location of thrombus growth was the oscillatory shear index. In particular, in the case of patient C where the interval between scans was the shortest, thrombus growth was observed at regions of low oscillatory shear index (OSI &lt; 0.1).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is most often accompanied by intraluminal thrombus (ILT). Platelets are the pre-eminent cell in pathological thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912444080">1</xref></sup> Central to the formation of ILT in AAA is the activation of blood platelets and the subsequent convection and diffusion towards the lumen wall.</p>
<p>The precise role that hemodynamics plays in the formation of ILT within AAA has been the subject of limited investigation. Bluestein et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912444080">2</xref></sup> correlated platelet deposition (measured by Schoephoerster et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912444080">3</xref></sup>) with streamline patterns and wall shear stress (WSS) in an idealised symmetric model of AAA under steady inflow over a range of Reynolds numbers. In each case a recirculating zone was identified that separated proximally in the aneurysm. For laminar flow (Re = 300, 900 and 1800) the vortex reattached distally, whereas for turbulent flow (Re = 3600) the separation zone was confined proximally within the aneurysm. WSS decreased to zero at the separation point, was low and negative within the separation zone, was again zero at the reattachment point and then peaked downstream of the reattachment point. For laminar flow, platelet deposition was seen to increase almost linearly along the aneurysm length, peaking just downstream of the reattachment point. For turbulent flow, platelet deposition was more evenly distributed along the aneurysm length, again peaking local to the reattachment point. For laminar flow it was proposed that platelets were activated along the high shear region separating the core flow and the recirculating zone. These activated platelets were transported by convection towards the reattachment point on the aneurysm wall. The concentration of activated platelets was, therefore, highest just downstream of the reattachment point, correlating with the peak in deposition. The reversed flow within the separation zone transported an ever-decreasing number of activated platelets upstream, hence the decrease in deposition rate in this direction. Low levels of WSS within the separation zone were seen to facilitate deposition. For turbulent flow it was suggested that turbulent fluctuations within the separation zone are responsible for increased platelet collision, activation and adhesion, hence becoming the dominant mechanism for deposition.</p>
<p>Salsac et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912444080">4</xref></sup> using particle image velocimetry, measured the flow field within both symmetric and asymmetric idealised models of AAA with physiologically realistic inflow conditions. Within all of the symmetric models the flow developed as follows. During early to peak systole the flow remained laminar and fully attached to the wall throughout the aneurysm. As the flow decelerated after peak systole, a large ring vortex developed proximal in the aneurysm. During late systole the vortex moved distal in the aneurysm. During early diastole the vortex was seen to break down and a turbulent state developed inside the entire aneurysm. During mid- to late systole the flow relaminarised, turbulence having been dissipated by viscosity. Within the asymmetric models the only notable difference in this flow pattern was the occurrence of stagnation points (stasis) at the distal end of the aneurysm. It was suggested that platelet activation would occur in regions of high shear stress surrounding the core flow at the onset of systole. These activated platelets were transported to regions of low shear stress and stasis near the wall. The increased residence time of platelets in regions at or near stasis would encourage the growth of an ILT allowing a retravelled lumen to develop. The process was referred to as the ‘shear-stasis clotting mechanism’.</p>
<p>Bluestein et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912444080">5</xref></sup> using uncoupled fluid structure interaction (FSI), predicted and compared flow patterns within two patient-based models of AAA with and without thrombus under steady inflow conditions representative of peak systole. It was recognised that, owing to complex recirculating flow trajectories, a large amount of particles possessed long residence times within both aneurysms. It was suggested that such flows were consistent with the mechanism set out previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912444080">2</xref></sup> for the formation and growth of ILT.</p>
<p>Biasetti et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912444080">6</xref></sup> on using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to examine the hemodynamics (velocity and WSS) of normal aortas, fusiform and saccular aneurysms, suggested a two-stage mechanism for thrombus formation: (a) platelet activation inside a proximal recirculation zone, where reasonably high shear stresses act long enough to activate and aggregate platelets, and (b) convection of activated and aggregated platelets towards the wall, where they adhere at sites of low WSS.</p>
<p>Suh et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912444080">7</xref></sup> using CFD, computed particle residence time and particle half-life within eight models of AAA under resting conditions. Significant differences in particle residence time were observed within the aneurysm, strongly influenced by local geometry and the strength of infrarenal flow. It was observed that particles within the bulbous portions of the saccular aneurysms, and those within the curvilinear portions of the fusiform aneurysms, exhibited the longest residence times.</p>
<p>Likewise, Basciano et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912444080">8</xref></sup> predicted fluid and particle residence time within a single model of AAA. Results supported the previous proposed mechanism for thrombus formation:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912444080">6</xref></sup> increased particle residence time increasing the potential for shear activated blood platelets and white blood cells to be exposed to the aneurysm wall. A near wall particle residence time <italic>t</italic><sub>r</sub><sup>OSI</sup> (proposed by Himburg et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912444080">9</xref></sup>) was determined. <italic>t</italic><sub>r</sub><sup>OSI</sup> is inversely proportional to the oscillatory shear index (OSI) and the time-averaged WSS (TAWSS). Regions of maximum <italic>t</italic><sub>r</sub><sup>OSI</sup> were suggested to correlate with locations of maximum predicted particle depositions within the aneurysm.</p>
<p>Of interest herein are two CFD studies by Rayz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912444080">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912444080">11</xref></sup> into thrombus deposition in cerebral aneurysm. In the first study thrombus was observed to coincide with the location of slow, recirculating flow and regions of low shear stress. In the follow-up study particle residence time was also calculated and shown to coincide with regions where thrombus deposition occurred.</p>
<p>This article examines the role that hemodynamics play in the growth of thrombus in AAA. Our methodology is as follows: Lumen shape change and regions of thrombus growth are identified within the aneurysms of three patients by comparing initial and follow-up computerised tomography (CT) scans. CFD is then utilised to predict the flow field within each aneurysm at the time of the initial CT scan. An analysis of the predicted flow field to include the velocity field, the shear strain rate field, TAWSS and OSI was undertaken to determine how hemodynamics may influence thrombus growth between scans. Results suggest that regions of thrombus growth may coincide with regions of low OSI (OSI &lt; 0.1).</p>

<p>The CT scans of the patients utilised in this study, hereafter referred to as patients A, B and C, were provided by Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Centre. Secured release was obtained from the patients involved. Each aneurysm was measured and the CT scans made available in DICOM format in a series of overlapping transverse slices of 0.0025 m thickness. A three-dimensional (3D) model of each aneurysm was generated through a process of segmentation using RAZZ software supplied courtesy of Medical Metrx Solutions Inc., Lebanon, NH. During the process, the volumes occupied by the aneurysm lumen, surrounding thrombus and calcified plaque were identified and each extracted as a surface mesh in stereolithography (STL) format.</p>

<title>Shape change and thrombus growth for patient A</title>
<p>Using the data obtained from the initial CT scan, the aneurysm inlet and outlet for patient A were determined at transverse locations x = 0.065 m and x = 0.132 m, respectively. The datum x = 0.000 m was taken as an anatomical landmark on the aorta upstream of the aneurysm. Shape change and thrombus growth within the aneurysm of patient A were determined as follows. The cross-sectional area of the lumen and the cross-sectional area of the lumen and thrombus combined were determined on transverse slices taken at intervals of 0.005 m along the length of the aneurysm. An equivalent diameter for each cross-sectional area was then calculated as the diameter of a circle of equal area. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912444080">Figure 2(a)</xref> presents the equivalent diameters of the lumen for both the initial and follow-up scans of patient A. It is seen that in the interval between the scans, the lumen equivalent diameter increased proximal in the aneurysm (on average by approximately 0.003 m) and decreased distal in the aneurysm (by as much as 0.005 m at x = 0.115 m). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912444080">Figure 2(b)</xref> presents the equivalent diameter of the lumen and thrombus combined for both scans. It is clear that the aneurysm expanded everywhere during the interval between the scans. Using the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912444080">Figure 2(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912444080">(b)</xref>, a circumferentially averaged change in the thickness of thrombus was determined, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912444080">Figure 2(c)</xref>. The thrombus is seen to increase in thickness along the length of the aneurysm but more substantially in the distal half of the aneurysm with a maximum thrombus growth of just under 0.006 m, observed at an axial location x = 0.115 m.</p>

<p>Right to left and anterior to posterior views of the surfaces of the lumen, thrombus and arterial wall of patient A at the time of each scan are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912444080">Figure 3(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912444080">(b)</xref>, respectively. A visual comparison of the two geometries shows that the lumen in the distal half of the aneurysm narrowed considerably during the 17 month period between the scans. It is also seen that the most significant thrombus growth occurred in this region. To gain a better understanding of how shape change and thrombus growth varies as a function of circumferential location a selection of five transverse slices are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912444080">Figure 3(c)</xref> at locations x = 0.065 m, 0.080 m, 0.095 m, 0.110 m and 0.125 m. The location of these slices are clearly indicated by the black horizontal lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912444080">Figure 3(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912444080">(b)</xref>, respectively. The clearest difference between the scans is observed distal in the aneurysm, where the lumen narrowed considerably as fresh thrombus formed. Thrombus growth is evident along the anterior, left and right walls in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912444080">Figure 3(c)</xref>, slices 4 and 5). This was identified as the main area of thrombus growth. In addition to this, there was also some slight thrombus growth along the anterior, left and right walls at the proximal end of the aneurysm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912444080">Figure 3(c)</xref>, slices 2 and 3).

Shape change is evident between the two sets of geometries. The transition from the inlet aorta to the aneurysm is much more abrupt in the follow-up scan and it is also clear that the lumen has narrowed along the anterior wall at the distal end of the aneurysm, in the interval since the initial scan was taken. As before, a selection of five transverse slices are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912444080">Figure 5(c)</xref> at locations x = 0.050 m, 0.070 m, 0.085 m, 0.100 m and 0.120 m.

<p>The aneurysm inlet and outlet for patient C were determined from the initial scan at transverse locations x = 0.055 m and x = 0.119 m, respectively. Shape change and thrombus growth were examined as for patients A and B above. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912444080">Figure 6(a)</xref> shows the equivalent diameters of the lumen for both the initial and follow-up scans.

In contrast, from the middle to distal in the aneurysm the lumen is seen to narrow considerably. It is noticeable from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912444080">Figure 6(b)</xref> that the equivalent diameters of the lumen and thrombus combined changed little in the interval between the scans, the aneurysm, therefore, showing little growth. Considering the circumferentially averaged thrombus growth, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912444080">Figure 6(c)</xref>, it is seen that significant thrombus growth has occurred in the middle and distal in the aneurysm. It may be summarised that, in the relatively short interval between the initial and follow-up scans, the overall diameter of the aneurysm has hardly changed but substantial thrombus growth in the distal half of the aneurysm has considerably narrowed the lumen.</p>

Once again, shape change is evident and the lumen is seen to have narrowed in the middle to distal part of the aneurysm, with fresh thrombus growth occurring in this region. A selection of five transverse slices are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912444080">Figure 7(c)</xref> at locations x = 0.055 m, 0.070 m, 0.085 m, 0.100 m and 0.115 m. Again, these locations are clearly indicated by the black horizontal lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912444080">Figure 7(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912444080">(b)</xref>. Substantial narrowing of the lumen is observed particularly around the middle part of the aneurysm. At x = 0.085 m thrombus growth is observed on right, anterior and posterior walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912444080">Figure 7(c)</xref>, slice 3). At x = 0.100 m thrombus growth is observed on all of the walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912444080">Figure 7(c)</xref>, slice 4). Clearly, in comparison to patients A and B where thrombus growth was localised, for patient C thrombus growth is more widespread over the wall of the aneurysm in the middle and distal parts of the aneurysm.</p>

<p>Gambit was utilised for geometry and mesh creation. ANSYS Fluent 12.0.16 was used in all of the numerical simulations described herein.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0954411912444080">
<title>Geometry and mesh creation</title>
<p>For each patient, the geometry of the lumen, as determined from the initial scan, was imported into Gambit in STL format. The region considered extended 0.050 m proximal of the renal bifurcation and 0.050 m distal of the iliac bifurcation. All branch arteries were truncated at a length of 0.015 m during the segmentation process. To facilitate the application of an inlet boundary condition a circular surface was created upstream and smoothly merged to the patient-based geometry. Two outlet surfaces were also created. Thereafter a control volume was created, stitching together the surfaces representing the lumen wall, the inlet and the outlet surfaces.</p>
<p>The surface of the control volume was meshed using triangular elements with a maximum edge length of 0.0015 m. The internal volume was then meshed with tetrahedral elements with maximum edge lengths of 0.0015 m. Typically the number of elements per model was of the order of 350,000.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0954411912444080">
<title>Flow physics and boundary conditions</title>
<p>The meshes generated within Gambit were imported into Fluent 12.0.16. All simulations were undertaken assuming unsteady, incompressible, laminar flow. The fluid density <italic>ρ</italic> = 1133 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and the fluid viscosity µ = 1.835 × 10<sup>−3</sup> Ns/m<sup>2</sup>. These values represented the properties of a working fluid used in experimental and numerical studies undertaken to validate the numerical model.</p>
<p>At the inlet a ‘velocity inlet’ type boundary condition was specified using a user-defined function (UDF). The LDV measurements acquired upstream of the aneurysm model were used to provide the velocity profile at the current simulation time as follows. At each measured radial location in the inlet plane fast Fourier transforms (FFT) were fitted to the LDV data, describing the local variation in velocity as a function of time. During a call to the UDF at the current simulation time, these FFTs were used to determine the velocity at each measured radial location, thus describing the velocity profile at the current simulation time. To transfer this profile to the nodes on the inlet surface mesh, within the UDF a FFT was then developed to describe this velocity profile and the FFT was subsequently used to determine the velocity at the location of the nodes on the inlet surface of the mesh.</p>
<p>At each outlet a ‘pressure outlet’ type boundary condition was specified. The static pressure was set to a value of 0 Pa on both the left and right femoral arteries. This reflected the practice in the experimental facility. The arterial wall was designated as a ‘no-slip wall’ type boundary condition.</p>

Pressure velocity coupling used the PISO scheme with skewness and neighbourhood correction factors of 1. The under-relaxation factors for pressure and momentum were varied, depending on the solver performance, and those for density and body forces were set at 1.</p>

<p>The dominant features of the transient flow field within each patient will be discussed in this section. For patients A and B, the passage curvature predominantly turns the direction of flow in the anterior–posterior direction. However, patient C is geometrically the most complex of the aneurysms studied, the flow, while passing through the aneurysm, being turned in both the right to left and the anterior–posterior directions. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411912444080">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954411912444080">10</xref> are on selected sagittal and coronal planes viewed from the right and anterior directions, respectively. The locations of these planes have been selected to best illustrate the main hemodynamic features of the flow, and coincide with planes on which flow visualisation images are available from previous experimental studies within polyurethane models subjected to the same boundary conditions used for the numerical model herein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912444080">14</xref></sup> The methodology used to obtain the images has been reported in detail previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912444080">12</xref></sup> However, in the interest of completeness, the technique is briefly summarised as follows. Neutrally buoyant 50 µm particles were introduced to the flow and illuminated by a laser light sheet generated from a 100 mW argon ion laser. Images were captured using a Canon Eos 1D mkII digital camera at a rate of 8.5 fps on selected sagittal and coronal planes within the aneurysm models. Comparison between these flow visualisation images will be made with the predicted velocity field herein.</p>

The core flow was observed to impinge on the anterior wall just distal of its mid-point and deflect towards the outlets of the aneurysm.

As the core decelerated, the vortex continued to increase in size. By the end of systole the vortex had moved away from the posterior wall, becoming the dominant flow feature occupying the centre of the aneurysm. During diastole, the vortex moved progressively closer to the anterior wall and diminished in size.

By mid-systole, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411912444080">Figure 9(g)</xref>, a core flow and a number of small vortices are identifiable, the most significant being located proximal on the anterior wall and proximal on the posterior wall.

<title>Shear strain rate</title>
<p>Among others, Biasetti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912444080">6</xref></sup> have postulated that recirculation zones, proximal within the aneurysm, may be responsible for prolonged exposure of platelets to elevated shear stress, hence, leading to platelet activation and agglomeration. An examination of the shear strain rate is, therefore, of interest within the aneurysms of each of the patients considered herein. In each of the cases presented, a prolonged elevated shear strain rate occurs proximal in each aneurysm, consistent with the conditions postulated for activation and agglomeration of platelets.</p>

Elevated shear strain rate is observed proximal within the aneurysm and also as expected in the near-wall region throughout the aneurysm. During early systole, the most intense regions of elevated rate of shear are observed to develop within the neck of the aneurysm in the vicinity of the wall and surrounding the core flow as it advances into the aneurysm. By mid-systole, it may be seen that the developing vortex on the posterior wall is accompanied by an elevated shear strain rate, and by late systole an elevated shear strain rate is observed to extend across much of the proximal region of the aneurysm as the vortex moves towards the aneurysm centre.</p>

Looking first on the sagittal plane, it is noticeable that and elevated shear strain rate extends throughout the proximal region during both early and mid-systole, but by late systole it has extended throughout a large portion of the aneurysm. The ring-shaped contours observed just downstream of the aneurysm neck is where the core flow moves out of plane, the ring, therefore, representing the elevated shear strain rate along the perimeter of the core flow. In the coronal view, the core flow is distinct throughout systole, an elevated shear strain rate being observable along its perimeter and within the large vortex located in the aneurysm centre.</p>

Regions of thrombus growth were smaller in comparison to patients A and C, the most obvious location being on the distal, anterior wall. TAWSS was again low in this region, as was the OSI.

In general TAWSS values remained low, but were noticeably higher than predicted for patients A and B. There was no direct correlation between regions of thrombus growth and the value of TAWSS, with significant thrombus growth observed in regions of relatively high and low TAWSS. OSI, however, provided a much more significant correlation with thrombus growth, regions of significant thrombus growth being consistent with regions of low OSI (<inline-formula id="inline-formula7-0954411912444080"><mml:math display="inline" id="math14-0954411912444080"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> 0.1) and regions of little or no thrombus growth being consistent with regions of high OSI.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Prediction of the hemodynamics within the three patient-based models present herein reveal a number of common characteristics. During early systole the flow is observed to accelerate, and antegrade (forward moving) flow is quickly observed throughout the aneurysm. Shortly after peak systole, as the flow decelerates, vortical structures are observed to develop within the aneurysm. The location, extent and strength of these vortices depend on the local geometry, but tend to occur at points of inflection on the lumen wall. Generally the most significant vortical development occurs just downstream of the aneurysm inlet, where the cross-sectional area of the lumen widens and the aneurysm begins to develop. From mid- to late systole, the flow within the aneurysm consists of a core jet with localised vortices. During early diastole, slow moving retrograde (backward moving) flow is observed in the aneurysm, consistent with the specified boundary conditions. From mid- to late diastole, the flow within the aneurysm is generally slow moving, disturbed and turbulent. Regions at or near stasis may be observed. The vortical structures developed during mid- to late systole are dissipated during diastole.</p>
<p>Regions of elevated shear strain rate (and hence shear stress) are observed in the near-wall region throughout the cycle. However, during systole, at both the aneurysm inlet and within the vortical structures developed proximal in the aneurysm, the shear strain rate is further enhanced. Here the condition may exist for activation of platelets that are later transported to regions at or near stasis within the aneurysm.</p>
<p>To gain some insight into the mean flow field within the aneurysm, streamline plots of the time-averaged velocity field are presented for each patient in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954411912444080">Figure 14</xref>. The time-averaged velocity field is obtained from the predicted velocity field using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-0954411912444080">equation (7)</xref>. The streamlines presented are introduced at the aneurysm inlet. It may be assumed that regions where no streamlines are present are most likely at or close to stasis. It may be seen that, over the cycle, the flow velocity remains relatively high along the path followed by the core flow. The initial path followed by the core flow is dictated by the angle of the inlet into the aneurysm, but later it is turned within the aneurysm by the anterior wall towards the outlet. Large regions of low velocity flow may be observed, particularly in the vicinity of the posterior wall. Initial studies of neutrally buoyant particle transport through the aneurysm (not presented herein) indicate that significant numbers of particles introduced during a particular cycle may reside within the aneurysm for a number of cycles thereafter, predominantly within regions of low velocity. Where these particles were seen to represent platelets, our results would support the aforementioned mechanism for thrombus deposition; platelet activation proximal in the aneurysm, followed by transportation to regions at or near stasis where platelet residence time remained high.</p>

<p>For patient A, the significant region of thrombus deposition occurred on the distal anterior wall of the aneurysm. Here the TAWSS and OSI were relatively low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954411912444080">Figure 11(b)</xref>), and the lack of streamlines in the vicinity of the wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954411912444080">Figure 14(a)</xref>) indicates that the flow remains relatively low during the cycle. For patient B, the significant region of thrombus growth was, again, on the distal anterior wall. Again, both TAWSS and OSI were relatively low. Despite the relatively short interval between the scans for patient C, thrombus growth was relatively high and was more widespread over the aneurysm wall. The lumen was seen to narrow considerably at the mid-point of the aneurysm, in particular, on the anterior, right and posterior walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912444080">Figure 7(c)</xref>, Plane 3). The streamline pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954411912444080">Figure 14(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954411912444080">(d)</xref>) indicated that, in this region, the average flow velocity was low through the cycle, as was the TAWSS and the OSI. These results tend to suggest the following; that thrombus deposition occurs where the average near-wall velocity is low, where TAWSS is low and where OSI is low. In contrast, however, little or no thrombus growth was observed where the average near-wall velocity is low, where TAWSS is low, but where OSI exceeds a value of 0.1.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A hemodynamic analysis of thrombus deposition within three patient-based models of AAA has been undertaken to investigate possible mechanisms of thrombus deposition. Results suggest that proximal within the aneurysm, platelet activation may occur in regions of elevated shear stress. Transportation of activated platelets to regions of relatively low or stagnant flow within the aneurysm may support thrombus growth on the lumen when both TAWSS and OSI are low.</p>
