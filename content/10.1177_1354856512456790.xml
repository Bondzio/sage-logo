            <p>While the project of game preservation is still in its infancy, it is already clear that its practitioners find themselves facing a number of serious contradictions and predicaments. This article focuses on the challenges and opportunities presented by videogame emulation software and (illegally) ripped game code (‘ROMs’). The use of ROMs within communities of players gives rise to creative practices and performances that constitute a key part of the culture of gaming, yet which heritage organisations find problematic to hold given the (il)legality of origination. Moreover, while many game preservation practitioners and scholars see emulation as the only viable solution for ensuring the long-term playability of games, few practical concessions or legal defences are presently available to support its use. The article begins by briefly exploring the videogame industry’s attitudes and position in relation to practices of copying, ripping and software piracy. It moves on to consider how this stance impacts on the efficacy of the project of game preservation in terms of collecting policies, preservation and exhibition practice. Finally, the article concludes with a call for greater collaboration between preservationists, games industry partners and communities of players, in order that long-term access to games might be assured – or at least debated.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Over the past decade, videogames have not only continued to grow in cultural, political and economic significance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354856512456790">Livingstone and Hope, 2011</xref>, for example), but have also emerged as legitimate objects of academic enquiry. However, while studies of games thrive and diversify, attending to casual, online and serious modes of play (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856512456790">Juul, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36a-1354856512456790">Taylor, 2006</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856512456790">Bogost, 2007</xref> respectively) and even to specific platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354856512456790">Montfort and Bogost, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354856512456790">Jones and Thiruvathukal, 2012</xref> on the Nintendo Wii), it is only comparatively recently that some scholars have turned their attentions to considerations of the long-term preservation of these archetypal new media forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354856512456790">Lowood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512456790">McDonough et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512456790">Newman, 2012a</xref>). While the project of game preservation remains very much in its infancy, it is already clear that its practitioners find themselves facing a number of serious contradictions and predicaments. It is these issues to which I wish to turn attention in this article, especially as they relate to the aberrant, illegal, yet often mainstream, practices of consumption and distribution that are the subject and sometimes the object of game preservation. I begin by briefly exploring the videogame industry’s attitudes and position in relation to practices of copying, ripping and software piracy, before moving to consider how the stance taken impacts upon the efficacy of the project of game preservation. In particular, I wish to focus on three distinct but related issues each emanating from the practices, practicalities and permissibility of extracting, duplicating, and altering commercial game code.</p>
         <p>First, I wish to draw attention to the legally problematic nature of current game preservation practice, and, in fact, digital media preservation more broadly. As we shall see, the simple fact is that the same strictures that marginalise, criminalise and technologically guard against both the individual and industrial-scale copying that is unilaterally and uncomplicatedly designated as ‘software piracy’ by the game industry similarly limit, in principle at least, the scope and actions of games archives and museum collections. Second, and continuing the exploration of legal and technological restrictions on extraction and duplication, I will examine how the imperative to document the diverse and creative, but clearly not unproblematic, cultures of gaming that surround and extend gameplay inevitably brings preservation practitioners into close contact with illegal practices such as the ripping and hacking of commercial game code. Finally, and perhaps most controversially, I wish to offer a reconsideration of the pervasive and organised illegal game copying and distribution that is readily encountered on countless filesharing networks, and even on the open web, and which the global games industry flatly vilifies as illegal. Given the nascent state of formal game preservation as a discipline and in light of its own presently intractable legal complications and entanglements, the resolutely and sometimes unapologetically illegal undertakings of code rippers and filesharers give rise to some of the most highly advanced, sophisticated and well-organised archival collections of videogames currently available. Encouraging the (re)consideration of how and whether such practices and extant collections might intersect with formal game preservation is at least one of the objectives of this article.</p>

         <title>Videogames and software piracy</title>
         <p>There will be few gamers who have not come into contact with software piracy in some form or other. Warnings about the severity of the punishment meted out to those making illegal copies of games festoon boxes, end user license agreements (EULAs) and even the introductory sequences of animation that precede gameplay (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512456790">Festinger, 2005</xref>). Such proclamations reflect the seriousness with which the global industry treats software piracy. In contextualising their position, the US and UK trade organisations paint a bleak picture. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) observes that ‘Global piracy is estimated to have cost the U.S. entertainment software industry over $3.0 billion in 2007, not including losses attributable to Internet piracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856512456790">Entertainment Software Association, 2011</xref>). For its part, the United Kingdom Interactive Entertainment Association (UKIE) operates an IP Crime Unit with a 24-hour telephone hotline dedicated to reporting incidences of software piracy.</p>
         <p>None of this is new, of course, though corporate interests have not always been at the centre of the story. Early anti-piracy campaigns such as the (in)famous US ‘Don’t copy that floppy’ television spot, discursively constructed the legally paying consumer as the true victim. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856512456790">Coleman and Dyer-Witherford (2007</xref>: 939) suggest, while it may be that the erosion of profits is the ultimate issue at stake, the message is typically oriented around the way in which legitimate purchasers effectively subsidise the activities of pirates or are denied the high quality games they might otherwise enjoy as development budgets are reduced. Bruce Everiss, former Director of Imagine software, adds weight to the notion, recounting how some publishers were put out of business or forced into mergers to ensure their survival.</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>The first mass-market game machine in the UK was the Sinclair Spectrum. Software was loaded via a tape interface so games were sold on audio compact cassettes. These were very easy to copy from a technical point of view, especially when dual cassette players proliferated and became cheaper. Schoolyard and club copying proliferated on a massive scale and badly hurt game publishers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856512456790">Everiss, 2010</xref>).</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>As Everiss observes, the ease with which 1980s home computer games (and software in general) distributed on compact cassette could be duplicated using readily available domestic tools made piracy a comparatively trivial technical proposition. In response, while some publishers dabbled with variable pricing to dissuade unauthorised duplication (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856512456790">Everiss, 2007</xref>), most adopted the technological copy protection measures that have become commonplace since. As Gillespie notes, technology here acts as the ‘perfect chaperone, only permitting users to behave appropriately’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856512456790">2006</xref>: 653). As Gillespie conceives it, the growing dominance of technological measures of protection marks the shift from the ‘code’ of law to the ‘code’ of software. In this way, the strategy of videogame publishers broadly mirrors those employed in the film and music industries. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856512456790">Coleman and Dyer-Witherford (2007)</xref> note, the videogame industry and its players grew up with these technological protection systems from the earliest stages of the medium’s history.</p>
         <p>Although the focus of campaigns such as ‘Don’t copy that floppy’ and the public-facing guidance on publishers’ and trade organisation sites naturally falls on the actions of individuals, there is more to game copying than casual schoolyard duplication and sharing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856512456790">Consalvo (2007</xref>: 68) rightly points to the emergence of an industry dedicated to aiding copying or at least the modification of consoles and PCs to render them conducive to running copied code. This industry trades in ‘modchips’, peripherals that allow the operation of ‘ripped’ rather than originally purchased games, and systems ostensibly designed for ‘cheating’, but which have other affordances that apparently support ‘software piracy’. Consalvo’s discussion of the Datel ‘FreeLoader’ disc for the Nintendo GameCube console is illustrative:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>The name Free Loader is itself interesting, as it embodies some of the contradictions at play in the realm of technological cheat devices. While the disc allows all games to load freely on a GameCube, the name also alludes to people who contribute nothing, yet take their fair share or more. While consumers must pay for the Free Loader disc, the producers are indirectly referring to either someone who uses the disc to load pirated games (which have been illegally copied) or games that have not (perhaps yet) been released for a particular region. In either case, the players are freeing themselves from the rules of the game distribution industry, which are codified in the hardware of the console. The Free Loader embodies values—but values that challenge those dominant in the console business. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856512456790">Consalvo, 2007</xref>: 65)</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>As numerous industry commentators and scholars have noted (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856512456790">Barton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354856512456790">Boyd, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856512456790">Gooding and Terras, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22a-1354856512456790">Kline et al., 2003</xref>) the response of the videogame industry has been to expend considerable resources protecting itself against piracy through aggressive patenting and copy protection systems, thereby encoding capitalist and individualist conceptions of property, creativity and rights (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354856512456790">Yar, 2008</xref>: 605). As such, unauthorised copying, distribution, attempts to execute illegally obtained code, or circumvent technical measures of protection are coded as acts of software piracy. With distribution on compact cassette consigned to a previous generation of gaming hardware, most recently, the issue has come to focus on the ripping of ROMs suitable for execution on videogame emulators.</p>
         <p>In essence, an emulator is a piece of software that allows one platform (e.g. a PC) to run the program code and potentially deal with inputs and outputs through various peripheral devices (e.g. joysticks and pads) of another platform (e.g. a Nintendo console).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354856512456790">1</xref>
            </sup> The aspiration, if not always the reality given the magnitude of the technical challenge, is ‘replicating the exact operation of another hardware and software environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856512456790">Monnens, 2009</xref>: 6). Setting aside questions about the accuracy and experiential authenticity of the emulated experience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512456790">McDonough et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354856512456790">Newman, 2012b</xref>), there are more immediate issues at stake. In principle, the creation of emulation software is perfectly permissible as an act of investigation and analysis. However, the acquisition of system boot ROMs or executable code very often involves practices that most charitably can be described as existing in a legally grey area (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856512456790">Conley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354856512456790">Libby, 2003</xref>), but which the videogame industry unequivocally positions as piracy. At the time of writing, Nintendo’s (US) corporate website summarises the position succinctly:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>The introduction of emulators created to play illegally copied Nintendo software represents the greatest threat to date to the intellectual property rights of video game developers. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354856512456790">Nintendo Legal Information, n.d.</xref>)</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Recognising that emulation may be the most viable, possibly only, means of accessing commercially unavailable titles (thereby adding weight to preservationist’s claims about the efficacy of emulation strategies), the ESA offers a sympathetic but ultimately equally strict line on the matter in its piracy FAQ:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Q: Isn’t it OK to copy games that are no longer distributed in the stores or commercially exploited?</p>
            <p>A: No, the current availability of a game in stores is irrelevant to its copyright status. Copyrights do not enter the public domain just because the works or products they protect are no longer commercially exploited or widely available. Therefore, the copyrights of games are valid even if the games are not found on store shelves, and copying or distributing those games is a copyright infringement. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856512456790">Entertainment Software Association, 2011</xref>)</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Presently, just like other forms of copying that have preceded it, the creation, acquisition or use of ROMs is unambiguously coded by the videogame industry as an act of software piracy. Prima facie, this might seem reasonable. Certainly, if we follow Everiss’ persuasive case, illicit copying in all its potential forms has serious impacts on the business of videogame development and publishing. Every copied game, it seems, is a lost sale. However, this dominant image of software pirates motivated by commercial gain, or at least the avoidance of financial outlay, encourages us to overlook a host of other practices that rely on precisely the same processes of copying and ripping but which, by contrast, are dedicated to celebrating and lengthening the life of games. Most obvious is the work of game preservationists who work to ensure the long-term availability of games to future generations of scholars, developers and public audiences. Less visible, but equally significant, are the myriad creative acts of play and performance that operate within specific player communities and which are dependent on the use and reworking of ripped code.</p>

         <title>Game preservation</title>
         <p>In an age in which videogames appear to be more present and pervasive than ever, it comes as something of a surprise to learn that they are disappearing. And yet, despite the emergence of new platforms such as Apple’s iOS and Facebook to complement consoles, PCs and handhelds, the brute fact remains that videogames are remarkably vulnerable:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Every year, thousands of games move one step closer to oblivion as a result of the same threats to longevity that affect all digital media: bit rot and obsolescence. Digital media have a shockingly short lifespan due to the natural decay of the original materials and the rapid obsolescence of older media forms, as well as the failure and obsolescence of the hardware necessary to run them. Many digital games that are only a few decades old are already at-risk and require immediate preservation attention. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856512456790">Monnens, 2009</xref>: 3)</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>In fact, the physical deterioration of storage media and the disappearance of data are far from the only issues. The games industry is essentially founded upon business models and discursive practices that effectively ‘wear out’ its past and present in order to sell the innovations and revolutions of the future. These range from the use of proprietary software distribution formats that are tied to specific iterations of hardware through carefully managed regimes of backwards (in)compatibility; through the ‘retiring’ of online activation servers that allow/deny the operation of gameplay; to the fixation of consumer gaze on the ‘next generation’ of games and gaming platforms whose performance and functionality are typically benchmarked against the current generation. Where they are not simply superseded by their replacements, old games and old gaming systems are typically recovered in marketing discourse as yardsticks by which to measure the inevitable technological improvements of the always coming soon (four times faster, twice as many levels, etc.). Where they are re-released for current hardware platforms, even valorised games are either ‘updated’ to take advantage of new, improved facilities unavailable at the time of their original release (<italic>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D; Ico</italic> and <italic>Shadow of the Colossus</italic> ‘Classics HD’ remasters), and are sold as ‘retro’ or ‘classic’ games for just a fraction of the price of current titles or in bundles of many tens of games (2009’s <italic>Sega MegaDrive Ultimate Collection</italic> contains more than 40 titles originally released throughout the 1990s yet still retailed at launch for under half the price of a new release).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354856512456790">2</xref>
            </sup> The ways in which the global games industry forgets, selectively remembers and systematically devalues its past creates a challenging context for game preservation practice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512456790">Newman, 2012a</xref> for more on the concerted practices of exhausting the longevity of games). Here, however, our focus falls less on ways of tackling or intervening in the production of obsolescence, and more on the ways in which game preservation can – and cannot – proceed given current attitudes towards accessing and using code.</p>
         <p>The inevitable material and digital deterioration of games systems and storage media means that emulation is presently considered by many to be the most viable, or even only, long-term preservation strategy for ensuring playability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354856512456790">Guttenbrunner et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856512456790">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856512456790">Monnens, 2009</xref>). The Keeping Emulation Environments Portable (KEEP) project is at the forefront of this research and is dedicated to developing emulation services that provide access to complex digital objects including videogames.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354856512456790">3</xref>
            </sup> Setting aside questions regarding the authenticity of the emulated vs original experience and aesthetics of play (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512456790">McDonough et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512456790">Newman, 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354856512456790">b</xref>), the implementation of a preservation strategy based around emulation is far from straightforward. With no specific provision or defence covering the use of ROMs and emulation, game preservation practitioners potentially find themselves engaged in software piracy. Describing the US situation, the authors of the Preserving Virtual Worlds report, which is to date the most comprehensive research project on the practicalities of game preservation, note that:</p>

            <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s prohibition on defeating technological protection measures makes it impossible for a library to create a preservation copy of games employing digital rights management (DRM) and anti-copying measures. While obtaining the permission of the rights owner to make a preservation copy offers a potential path around this obstacle, securing these permissions is complicated by the existence of a large number of ‘orphan works’ in the field of computer games, and the great difficulties encountered in trying to track intellectual property rights ownership in an industry as volatile as the game software industry. Intellectual property laws also may pose impediments to the development of emulation technology necessary for continuing access to some games.

         <p>The state of current legal frameworks and the restrictions on circumventing technical measures of protection such as password-protection or more complex DRM systems are so onerous that even if a developer wished to permit preservation of its intellectual property, the systems, procedures and protocols for doing so do not presently exist in an unambiguous manner, thereby continuing to hamstring practitioners and industry partners alike. Moreover, there is little standardisation in practice internationally (see Anderson, 2011: 6–8 on the considerable variations across Europe, for instance).<sup>

(2010)</xref> note, the uncertainty of the exceptions or defences against IP infringement, as well as the difficulty of tracking down rights holders where games may have been commercially abandoned, ‘translates into libraries risking fines of $200–150,000 per game were they to migrate their collection of classic software from 3.5" floppy disks to images stored on hard drives, an act comparable to rebinding a book or creating an access copy of a manuscript’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512456790">McDonough et al., 2010</xref>: 52). What is most striking about this situation is that while emulation might seem like the saviour of games in the long-term, it is videogames hardware and software manufacturers and publishers that have been at the vanguard of those calling for legal measures against emulation and ROM acquisition and distribution: see Sony’s action against Connectix (SCE, 2000a) and Bleem! (SCE, 2000b), and Nintendo’s corporate position (Nintendo Legal Information, 2011), for instance.</p>
         <p>In an interview with Vanessa Zainzinger, Andreas Lange, curator of the Computerspielemuseum in Berlin, documents the frustration:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>‘The problem is that the legal situation in Europe does not allow us to save our collection from decay. That’s because of copyright laws that have been added to games a long time ago to prevent pirate copies. After all, emulation is a copy process: we need to transfer code from the original data carrier to another. Copyright laws are in place to prevent exactly that,’ Andreas explains. ‘So, we essentially have to stand there watching day after day as our collection, one of the most significant collections [of video game culture] worldwide, demagnetizes.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354856512456790">Zainzinger, 2012</xref>)</p>

         <p>It has become a common trope within game preservation scholarship to call for greater collaboration with the games industry (Donahue, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354856512456790">Lowood et al., 2009</xref>) and it is clear that seeking solutions to the uses of emulation for preservation purposes is a key driver. It comes as little surprise to find that lobbying to redress the often draconian laws that restrict museums and archives in making copies of game code is a key point of priority for many projects and a central tenet of organisations such as the European Federation of Game Preservation projects (EFGAMP).</p>
         <p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856512456790">Conley et al. (2004</xref>: 9) note, ‘Console manufacturers claim that emulation is outright theft, whereas the emulation community considers it a programming feat to be admired. At the center of this controversy is a struggle between fair use and monopoly rights.’ What is most interesting, however, is that this debate plays out not only in relation to the ways in which games – as hardware and software objects and systems – might be archived but also in relation to the kinds of practices that give life to these games and which constitute the cultures of play that equally comprise the subject of game preservation.</p>

         <title>Playing with ROMs</title>
         <p>While preserving games as complex objects comprising software and hardware elements raises a multitude of legal problems emanating from emulation and the acquisition of code, it is attempts to account for the practices and performances of gameplay that truly adds complexity. We will not here trouble ourselves with debates over whether long-term playability should be the primary goal of game preservation or whether documentary approaches that seek to record the game at play, potentially capturing a multiplicity of alternate playings, should be central (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354856512456790">Newman, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512456790">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354856512456790">b</xref> for more on the relative merits of these approaches). Rather, whether or not we think that capturing footage of the game in play represents a core aim of preservation or is part of the contextualisation, we must surely agree that documenting the richness of gaming culture and practice is a key objective. Unfortunately, much of this practice involves us again coming into contact with activity that is itself coded as software piracy or that relies upon the availability and use of the products of illegal copying, ripping and distribution.</p>
         <p>As recent game studies scholarship has demonstrated, our understanding of videogames is severely limited if we consider only the moment of interaction with the game or the contours, structures and systems of the game as ‘text’. Videogame play is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856512456790">Jenkins (2006)</xref> and others have noted, socially situated. Play is shaped and framed by talk and discussion both online and offline in forums, playgrounds and offices. Prefigurative materials, such as textual and video walkthroughs including the increasingly popular ‘Let’s Play’ videos that see players narrating their journeys through gameplay,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354856512456790">5</xref>
            </sup> each suggest new ways of playing (sometimes resistant or even deliberately deviant as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856512456790">Consalvo, 2007</xref> notes) and firmly locate even the most solitary, single player experience within a complex network of other players and playings. In order to fully appreciate what a given game is, it is essential that we document the ways in which it is played and played with and not only the code of the game or the developer’s codification of ‘legitimate’ or intended play. In many cases, however, these practices that shed new light on games and that reveal the richness, complexity and creativity of players’ engagements and interactions with games – far beyond the expectations and intentions of their designers – involve practices of consumption and distribution that sail close to, and sometimes come into collision with, the games industry’s legal stance.</p>
         <p>Here we will focus on just two such player practices – tool-assisted speedrunning and translation hacking. Both rely on the use of (ripped) ROMs yet both are manifestly motivated not by a desire to pirate software for financial gain or to deny publishers and rights-holders their ability to commercially or creatively exploit their property, but rather by the desire to explore the boundaries and possibilities of cherished games. Indeed, much of what motivates these practices might be better understood as a desire to make them available to players otherwise unable to access them precisely because of the industry and marketplace’s inability or unwillingness to sustain their commercial release. In this, we recall Thomas’ (2002: 89) study of peer to peer filesharers that noted a ‘constant and specific disavowal of financial motivation’.</p>
         <sec id="section5-1354856512456790">
            <title>Tool-assisted speedruns: Beyond human ability</title>
            <p>Tool-assisted speedruns (TAS) belong to a category of gameplay performance called ‘superplay’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354856512456790">Newman, 2008</xref>). Superplay can take a variety of forms, but typically involves tackling gameplay in an ostentatiously skilful manner usually by superimposing a set of additional restrictions such as a strict time limit or the (in)ability to utilise certain techniques, tactics or strategies. As such, superplayers may attempt to play through shooting games without shooting (often known as ‘pacifist’ play) or even control both sides of a two-player game simultaneously. The most commonly encountered form of superplay, however, is the speedrun, which sees players attempt to traverse the game’s levels as quickly as possible.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354856512456790">6</xref>
               </sup> There are many variants that reveal something of the tension between exploring and policing the boundaries of gameplay that is at the heart of much player practice and that reflect the malleability of games as systems. Speedrunners may race though the game attempting to get to the conclusion of the narrative (e.g. racing through Super Mario 64 in just a few minutes and defeating the final Boss while eschewing most of the collectible items that typically mark out successful play, or even skipping whole segments and sequences of gameplay) or may choose to meticulously collect every item within the shortest possible time. In recent years, the practice of speedrunning has moved from a peripheral practice engaged in by expert players to become part of the mainstream vocabulary of gameplay. Nintendo’s Super Mario Galaxy, for instance, presents the replay of already completed levels and sequences in a speedrunning mode as part of its standard challenge.</p>
            <p>TAS bears much in common with more standard practices of speedrunning, but there are some critical differences. Where the gamer performing a standard speedrun plays in real-time, entering inputs like any other gamer and differing only in the techniques, strategies and tactics they deploy, the TAS gamer does not play ‘live’. TAS are built up, in super slow motion and often frame-by-frame, in an almost unbelievably long-winded process that apparently bears more in common with stop frame animation than videogame play. As such, while the intention is to create the perfect speedrun, the TAS gamer’s painstaking attention to detail means that, somewhat perversely, they work at an extraordinarily slow pace.</p>
            <p>What is crucial for our purposes here is to understand how TAS videos are constructed and the technical affordances that emulation in particular offer the player/performer. TAS is made possible by a complex of technical systems that allow fine-grained control over the inputs into the game system. Where standard speedruns are performed on original hardware such as consoles or handheld devices, TAS make use of ‘emulation’ software that runs on general purpose PCs or Macs and that can mimic the operation of a specific gaming device. Although it is the accuracy of their recreations of hardware and software that is usually of most importance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512456790">McDonough et al., 2010</xref> for more on variations between videogame emulators and their role in game preservation practice), it is self-evident that emulators offer many functional and operational differences over the original gaming device. Most obviously, they afford a greater degree of control over input and output systems allowing gamers to slow down the operation of the game. In addition, and most critically, where the game played under original conditions may have offered only a limited, or perhaps even no mechanism for saving progress, emulators allow the gamer to save their game at any moment. Thus, where the original game may have required the player to complete an entire level or a particular sequence before progress could be saved, with the game running under emulation saving can be undertaken at will. This is because the emulator software effectively pauses the running of the program, thereby saving or freezing the state of all variables. As such, the built-in save system of the game is essentially bypassed. The free availability of ‘savestates’ is a critical affordance of the emulator as players can tackle the game in extremely small sections, which can be returned to if a subsequent error is made. The emulator ‘savestate’ is the equivalent of a productivity application’s ‘undo’ feature and effectively renders the performance non-committal, as steps can be easily undone and the performance rewound. By offering means of varying the tempo of gameplay and breaking the original software’s regimes of saving, emulators make possible entirely new ways of playing videogames.</p>
            <p>The authorship of TAS involves much careful planning and countless replayed sequences. The game is played at slow speed (the emulator slows the game down), tackling small segments at a time and optimising them, rewinding and replaying to achieve perfection (or, to be more precise, to achieve what is understood as perfection at the point in time given the continued exposition of technique and opportunity). The finished (and unfinished) product is reviewed numerous times, at full speed and in slow motion, in order that potential for improvement or the execution of new techniques might be revealed.</p>

               <p>Creating such a movie is very timeconsuming [sic]. You can easily elapse 4 hours for a 10 minute sequence – and that’s only for the first revision. For some games, planning can need lots of time. Creating a releasable movie can take anything from 4 hours to 6 months, depending on how much free time you have, how complex the game is, how careful you are and how skillful you are. Many improved movies are also based on observations from previous movies, so it’s actually difficult to estimate how much time goes into producing a good gameplay movie.

            <p>TAS videos and their creation illustrate the transformative properties of emulation. By releasing the code from what becomes recast as the restrictive environment of its original hardware platform, emulation offers new ways of engaging with and apprehending the game. As a result of this, the instance of the code that becomes playable within the emulated environment is reconstituted as an altogether more malleable set of resources. By allowing different kinds of input and facilitating the most minutely detailed interrogation of each frame of the rendered game, retracing steps where perfection is not reached, emulation may give rise to new forms of expression, and reveal new patterns and dimensions to these games. Through TAS, new possibilities emerge and the malleability of the game as a set of resources to be played with come to the fore. Importantly, it is the affordances and uses of the emulator, a software application more readily associated with piracy and illegality rather than its ability to operate as a cyborg-like extension that gives rise to these creative playings and explorations.</p>

         <title>Translation hacking</title>
         <p>If creating TAS performances is motivated by a desire to reveal hidden dimensions in the game and open up new ways of playing, the practice of translation hacking has an altogether more fundamental interest in making games playable at all. In this age of the global videogame business, it is easy to forget that videogame titles usually enjoy staggered releases in different territories rather than being released simultaneously across all markets. Indeed, many titles, and even some hardware platforms, never see release outside their home territory. For players wishing to play the latest releases, or to play titles that have no scheduled release in their market, the options are somewhat limited. In years gone by, a vibrant ‘grey import’ retail business existed that allowed consumers to purchase such games and systems. However, videogame publishers and platform holders sought to close down this trafficking of goods across territories and deployed measures that sought to criminalise such activity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13a-1354856512456790">Gibson, 2006</xref> on the closure of retailer Lik-Sang, for instance). Of course, there is more to accessing the gameplay in these titles than simply owning the game disc or cartridge. Technical measures to enforce region-specificity, ranging from physical differences in the size and shape of cartridges to DVD/Blu-Ray style region-coding that prohibits the playing of software on hardware from a different territory, are the most obvious barriers. However, as Consalvo notes in her discussion of the FreeLoader peripheral, such systems can be defeated:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>The ‘Free Loader’ is a minidisc that temporarily rewrites some game addresses and values, fooling a region-locked game console into running games from any region. That way, I could try out the Japanese version of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles before the North American one was released. Unfortunately, getting the Japanese game to run was easier than trying to figure out the spoken and written Japanese in a text-heavy game. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856512456790">Consalvo, 2007</xref>: 65)</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Wherein we run into the next problem. Impersonating a Japanese console is one thing. Making sense of the reams of Japanese text that subsequently fill the screen is quite another. The magnitude, complexity and economies of the task of translating or ‘localizing’ videogames is at least one reason why certain games, and even genres (most notably the Japanese role playing game (RPG)) have often not seen global release. Given the structure of the RPG with its multiple story branches, complex characterisations, and narrative and game design interdependencies, the scale of the undertaking adds a considerable financial implication that may not be considered viable given the likely consumer demand. We should note also, as Giordano does (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354856512456790">Sterling, 2011</xref>), that many games undergo not only language translation as part of the localisation process, but also a reworking of specific cultural reference points that may, in fact, alter the tone of the game thereby making the original more desirable or at least different. So, while unpicking the technical challenge of running Japanese code on a non-Japanese console becomes a comparatively trivial activity, if questionable from the game publisher’s perspective, making sense of the game itself remains. In a manner similar to that noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856512456790">Jenkins (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354856512456790">Tulloch and Jenkins (1995)</xref> in relation to cancelled TV series, dedicated gamers engage in letter-writing campaigns to publishers and developers pleading for the localisation of specific titles with varying degrees of success (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354856512456790">Newman, 2008</xref> on players’ interactions with Nintendo/Square over the localisation of titles in the <italic>Earthbound/Mother</italic> series).</p>
         <p>For some players, where official localisation is not, for whatever reason, forthcoming more radical solutions are at hand. Rather than accepting their position as disadvantaged consumers at the mercy of the economics of global publishing, some fans take localisation into their own hands. The ‘Mother 3 Fan Translation’ project is a case in point and was dedicated to producing an English language translation of the Japanese GameBoy Advance title (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354856512456790">The (Unified) Mother 3 Fan Translation (n.d.)</xref>). Here, then, we note players not merely seeking to plead their case to publishers and developers in order that the commercial viability of translations and localisations might be reconsidered but rather concertedly working to give life to these otherwise unreleased (and commercially unexploited) games. Websites such as ‘romhacking dot net’ provide a hub for such activity offering advice on graphics hacking, binary and hexadecimal maths, and giving a sense of the complexity and extent of the practice.</p>
         <p>There are clear parallels between the practices of videogame ‘fanslation’ or translation hacking and the ‘fansubbing’ in which television or film texts are translated and subtitled by fans for distribution among a wider audience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856512456790">Jenkins 2006</xref>: 158 for instance). However, there are important differences between the practices of fansubbing anime (or any televisual or film text, for that matter) and ‘translation hacking’ videogames. The scope of the undertaking is perhaps the most obvious difference with games designed to offer many tens of hours of play, the sheer number of lines of dialogue is orders of magnitude greater than all but the longest running of anime series. Moreover, the non-linearity of game structure ensures that multiple routes, detours, sidequests and overlapping scenes all add to the scale, complexity and interdependencies of the work.</p>
         <p>Like the TAS performances we saw above, translation hacking relies on the availability and transformative affordances of emulators and the virtual platform independence of ripped ROMs in order to engage with games and their resources in non-standard ways. However, it is clear that the uses to which the same tools are put is rather different. Where TAS makes use of emulated code so as to circumvent the tempo and ‘savestate’ logic of game design, translation hackers require access to the very content of the code contained within the ROM so that changes to dialogue, the display of menus and so on might be effected. The need to exact unauthorised modifications to the code rather than just gain access to it for playback is something that clearly adds a layer of concern for translation hackers. As such, translation hackers take advantage of further affordances of emulation software, so that they do not need to directly modify the ROM but can instead allow the emulator application to ‘inject’ their modifications into the code as it runs. Rather than releasing a modified ROM, fan translations are distributed as ‘sidecar’ files or ‘patches’.</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>A patch in the context of this site is a file that contains a list of changes that an author has made to a game. This change can be a language translation, graphical, musical, or any other kind of alteration of the game. This file is essentially a list that says ‘change this byte to that byte’ repeatedly. What ROM hackers do is take their altered ROM, and use a patching program to compare it with the original ROM. The program then makes a patch that you can use on an original ROM to produce the same results of the hacked ROM the ROM hacker has. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354856512456790">Romhacking dot net (n.d.)</xref>)</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Importantly, while they require the ROM in order to run, the patches may be distributed without the ROM, thereby sidestepping the need to directly make available illegally obtained code and herein we begin to get a sense of the incompatibility of much of the creative, productive work of dedicated players and the implementation of restrictions on duplicating and accessing code.</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>You may be wondering why we don’t just distribute the modified ROM and not deal with the hassle of patches. We don’t do this for a few reasons. First, it is illegal. We cannot distribute copyrighted material. All non-public domain ROMs contain intellectual property owned by their creators. Nintendo, Sega, Square, Acclaim, Capcom, etc. own the characters, game data, and code contained in a ROM …. We also do this out of respect for the patch authors. Archiving patches allows authors to get credit for the work they have done and provides the ability to keep track of versions. In addition, many patch authors do not want their work distributed in illegal packages. We don’t wish to get patch authors in trouble due to independent actions we take on this site against their will. Distributing a patch is perfectly legal. A patch contains nothing more than a list of changes to achieve the same results the patch author did. Obtaining or making (you can backup your own games using a backup device) the original ROM is your responsibility and we will not provide them here.

         <title>Reconsidering ROMs</title>
         <p>We are well used to thinking of ROMs, the ripped data from game cartridges and discs, in terms of their illegality. Certainly, videogame publishers, developers and industry trade organisations go to great lengths to point to the criminality of illegal ROM creation and use. However, we have seen also that while the majority of discussion relating to ROMs and emulation relates to illicit copying and the putatively lost sales and income, there is much creative work and play that circulates and exists precisely because of the transformative freedoms that arise from encountering games under emulation. Moreover, in the work of translation hackers, we see an intensity of work and labour that is motivated by a desire to plug the gaps created by a publishing business either unable or unwilling to offer commercial release to games. The great irony of this position is that closing down grey import routes to ownership of games and systems makes the use of translation hacks all the more desirable. Moreover, we note that the current legal position within which the formal game preservation sector finds itself offers no more reassurance or support for circumventing the kinds of technical measures of protection that presently protect the majority of commercially available titles.</p>
         <p>Of course, not all collectors are quite so conscientious when it comes to respecting intellectual property or bypassing digital rights management systems, and it would be remiss to focus only on certain creative interventions at the expense of opening our eyes to the reality of commercially motivated software piracy. It takes little effort scouring filesharing services and even the open Web to find vast collections of ROMs for a host of console and arcade systems, many of which are years, even decades, out of production. There can be no doubt about it, these collections are precisely those to which Nintendo, the ESA, the UKIE and others refer when they talk about copying and ripping as software piracy. However, it is interesting, if a little unusual, to consider ROM acquisition and, in particular, the distribution of (illegal) ROMs from a different perspective. If we delve into these sites or these collections of bundles of ROMs compressed into comprehensive RAR archives, we find something rather surprising. These collections are far from haphazardly arranged. Each ROM is organised and categorised with proprietary numbering systems (which are usually transferrable across sites) and come replete with structured filenaming/metadata schemas that allow potential downloaders to identify critical information such as the platform, release territory, revision and technical/ technological dependencies (e.g. expansion packs, console version, etc.). Given that one of the challenges identified by game preservation scholars relates to what Giordano has referred to as the ‘extreme fragmentation’ of games that are routinely patched, updated, ported to different systems, and modified for release in different territories, this level of detail in identifying the provenance of the specific ROM set is potentially invaluable.</p>
         <p>Examining websites such as worldofspectrum.org, whose creators, it should be noted, go to considerable lengths in attempting to secure the permission of rights-holders to distribute materials via their portal (see the revealing distribution permissions lists at World of Spectrum, 2011a, b), we find authenticated ROMs alongside copious documentation and documentary material, including scans of contemporaneous reviews, hints and strategy guides, as well as scans of covers, inlays and even the cassette cases themselves. One thing that is particularly striking about the cataloguing systems and documentation schemas we see in these projects is not merely the meticulousness of their design, but also the widespread nature of their implementation across apparently unrelated sites and services.</p>
         <p>Perhaps a little more reassuring, the detail and rigour of archival efforts such as world of spectrum.org (or the High Voltage SID Collection dedicated to Commodore 64 music files), as well as many sites and hacking groups who produce illegally ripped and distributed ROMs with no attempt to seek permission, demonstrates the existence of a vast knowledge among fans and players. These databases and the knowledges they contain constitute an invaluable source that distinguishes and documents the variations between versions of games. Most importantly, the data and metadata that document the specifics of the ROM version in question not only contribute to the much-needed database of instances of games, but also communicate much about the compatibility of specific versions of hardware and software, and the variation in game design and gameplay opportunity. And so, while the motivation of certain projects and groups might be resolutely illegal, the data and metadata sets they generate, as well the informal distributed archiving of the ROMs themselves across filesharing networks, websites and Usenet groups, represent some of the most complete that we currently have at our disposal. A change in the law to accommodate such activity is neither likely nor warranted but, just as Donahue (2009) and others call for greater collaboration between game preservationists and the games industry, it is inconceivable that archives, galleries and museums should not seek to harness the knowledge of these communities of game specialists and, albeit perhaps unwitting, amateur archivists.</p>

         <p>Although their discipline remains in its infancy, game preservation practitioners find themselves in a difficult situation. The objects of their archival and curatorial attention, their strategies for long-term preservation, as well as the practices and performances they seek to document and record, often centre around, or implicitly rely upon, the availability and use of game code in forms and formats that are the products of what is presently understood to constitute ‘software piracy’. Along with the emerging literature on game preservation, this article aims to make the case for a more nuanced approach to the definition of software piracy that is sensitive to the variety of uses to which, for example, ROMs are put. In an interview with <italic>Rolling Stone</italic> magazine in 2003, Steve Jobs defended his company’s use of the phrase ‘Rip. Mix. Burn.’ in its campaign to publicise iTunes. As Jobs put it:</p>

            <p>The person who assailed us over it was Michael Eisner. But he didn’t have any teenage kids living at home, and he didn’t have any teenage kids working at Disney whom he talked to, so he thought ‘rip’ meant ‘rip off’. And when somebody actually clued him in to what it meant, he did apologize. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856512456790">Goodell, 2003</xref>)</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>A decade on, we perhaps find ourselves in a similar situation in relation to games. The ripped ROM, transferred from one medium to another and accessed by new tools with different affordances, facilitates new forms of play and interactions just as the ripping of music from CDs brought new ways of listening to and using music. The bluntness of the simple connection between ripping/copying/ROM use and putatively lost sales potentially closes down access to some of the most creatively rich practices within contemporary gaming culture, as institutional policy in the heritage sector likely makes holding such materials problematic. In order to address the issue of understanding and defining ripping and software piracy and the multitude of creative and illegal acts that are performed within gaming culture, collaboration must be a priority. It is essential that game preservationists, videogame industry trade bodies, publishers, developers and platform holders, as well as the various gameplay communities that give rise to the encyclopaedic knowledge bases we have seen, work together to ensure that game preservation may proceed. At stake is access to the products and practices of the games industry and gaming culture for future generations of scholars, developers and public audiences.</p>

               <p>In fact, emulation is used extensively in contemporary games development with many ‘retro’ collections and online gaming services such as Nintendo’s Virtual Console, making use of bespoke console and computer emulators. In addition, many emulators are the product of gaming community effort and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512456790">McDonough et al. (2010)</xref> and others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512456790">Newman 2012a</xref>) have noted, these projects are liable to fall into obsolescence themselves as they are no longer actively developed, thereby becoming objects of preservation attention rather than solutions.</p>

               <p>In addition to collections of ‘retro’ titles, individual games drawn from console back catalogues sometimes just a few years old retail for a few pounds per title. Such games are available through numerous digital distribution platforms including Apple’s iTunes App Store, Sony’s PlayStation Network Store, Microsoft’s Xbox Live Arcade and Nintendo’s Virtual Console. Titles are often, though not always, ‘updated’ or ‘enhanced’ to take advantage of the putatively improved processing and audiovisual capabilities of the new host hardware and to harness, or accommodate, differing hardware interfaces (touchscreen, different button layouts and combinations, for instance). As such, they are often best viewed as approximations rather than facsimiles of the original hardware experience.</p>

               <p>The situation regarding legal deposit of games illustrates the scale of the variation. In Germany, games submitted for age-approval rating are passed on so that, in the original release form at least, they may be archived while in France, the Bibliothèque national de France (BNF) holds material copies of French games (though issues of access remain as necessary hardware is not necessarily available). The current situation in the UK sees games (as other digital and software items) covered under voluntary rather than legal deposit, meaning that publishers can but are under no obligation to submit.</p>

               <p>Let’s Play (often simply abbreviated as ‘LP’) are walkthroughs of videogames accompanied by the narration of the player. LPs were initially shared on the Something Awful website’s forums (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=191" xlink:type="simple">http://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=191</ext-link>).

               <p>The practice of speedrunning traces its roots to the communities of <italic>Doom</italic> players, who took that game’s ability to record ‘demos’ of their play and elevated it to a comprehensive and competitive public performance of superplay (see the Compet-N database for example: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi</ext-link>).
