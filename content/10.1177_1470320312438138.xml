<p>The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple cardiovascular and renal diseases. Its blockade generally allows to effectively prevent the development and progression of these diseases, but unfortunately not in all patients. In their study, Pantelis A Sarafidis and Luis M Ruilope remind us of the clinical conditions where RAAS blockers have proven effectiveness, and also point to the limitations of these agents. When employed in the early time course of cardiovascular and renal diseases, they are beneficial. But we must admit that they are not able to prevent the development of complications in all patients. Why? PA Sarafidis and LM Ruilope note the existence of residual risk in presence of RAAS blockade. One reason is the possible persistence of cardiovascular risk factors not, or insufficiently, influenced by this treatment. Indeed, the beneficial effects of RAAS blockers have mainly been shown in patients with high or very high cardiovascular risk, i.e. those presenting with several risk factors and/or end-organ damage and/or diabetes. Chronic RAAS blockade, however complete, does not correct all abnormalities in all cases, or may be instituted too late, at a time when organ damage is no longer entirely reversible. Too complete a blockade may even be deleterious, especially regarding renal function. This must be acknowledged: RAAS blockade is an effective tool, but not the absolute weapon for the preventionof cardiovascular and renal complications. Are there ways,presently, to improve the benefits of this therapeutic approach? Yes, of course; attempting to correct all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and starting treatment early, before vascular, cardiac or renal damage become irreversible. A few years ago, treatment with an angiotensin II antagonist had allowed to delay the development of hypertension in prehypertensive subjects (systolic pressure 130–139 mmHg and diastolic pressure ≤ 89 mmHg, or systolic pressure ≤ 139 mmHg and diastolic pressure 85–89 mmHg).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320312438138">1</xref></sup> Eighty-one per cent of these patients had at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320312438138">2</xref></sup> Why should this study be brought back to mind? Not to advocate systematic treatment of prehypertension with a RAAS blocker, but to illustrate that, at this stage already, global cardiovascular risk is often not negligible, so that an approach exclusively based on RAAS blockade would not result in optimal risk reduction. What conclusions should be drawn from the thoughts expressed by PA Sarafidis and LM Ruilope? That in each particular patient, the prevention of cardiovascular and renal complications entails the earliest possible use of RAAS blockers together with attempts to modify the totality of observed modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.</p>
