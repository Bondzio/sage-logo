<abstract>
<p>As a distinguished scholar over the past 45 years, Michel Hersen has left an indelible mark on the field of behavior therapy and clinical psychology. One of his most enduring legacies is his early research work in the area of social skills assessment and training, with special attention to assertiveness training. His basic analogue and clinical outcome studies have served as essential building blocks for current evidence-based treatments. His long and distinguished career has significantly impacted the lives of colleagues, students, and patients alike.</p>

<body>
<p>The field of behavior therapy dates back more than 50 years, although some trace its historical roots to a 1924 classic report by Mary Cover Jones on the behavioral treatment of a rabbit phobia in a 3-year-old boy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445512440008">Jones, 1924</xref>). While many early pioneers were responsible for the development and nurturance of behavior therapy, none was more prolific or influential than Michel Hersen.</p>
<p>Michel Hersen, PhD, recently retired from his position as professor and dean of the School of Professional Psychology at Pacific University in Oregon, has enjoyed an illustrious career and has been a significant driving force behind the evolution of behavior therapy. His academic interests have been vast and varied, with few behavioral scientists matching his energy and productivity. Michel has been a friend and colleague of mine since the early 1970s, beginning with our early days at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and the Veterans Administration Center in Jackson, Mississippi, an early incubator of behavioral theory and practice. The Mississippi group was responsible for accelerating the development of evidence-based therapeutic methods as applied to a vast array of clinical problems.</p>
<p>Michel’s influence on contemporary behavioral approaches was fostered by his ability to combine astute clinical judgment with dedication to the scientific method in understanding and treating psychopathology. Being an intuitive clinician, he also understood that each patient is a unique, complex individual and that thoughts, emotions, <italic>and</italic> behavior are intricately woven together, contributing to the problem at hand. Even as a rigorous behavioral scientist, he espoused a “cognitive behavioral” philosophy many years prior to the popularity of the term.</p>
<p>Although Michel’s contributions to the field are many, his work on the assessment and treatment of interpersonal skills remains one of his more enduring legacies. Over the years, Michel applied a methodical approach to the definition, assessment, analysis, and treatment of social skills as applied to myriad disorders and patient populations. Although he collaborated with a varied array of colleagues in this endeavor, he was often the driving force behind the conceptualization of the approach.</p>
<sec id="section1-0145445512440008">
<title>Defining and Assessing Social Skills</title>
<p>Social ineffectiveness was first described as a possible contributor to psychiatric symptoms by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445512440008">Zigler and Phillips in 1960</xref>, although research on deficits in social skills did not begin in earnest until the 1970s and beyond.</p>
<p>Since then, until the present day, there have been well over 2,500 scientific publications focusing on this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512440008">Heinrichs, Gerlach, &amp; Hofmann, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, in the earliest studies in this area, there was lack of agreement on exactly what social skills were. An adequate definition of social skills lagged significantly behind the development of treatment techniques to modify these behaviors. Michel was one of the first to recognize the importance of defining specific components of these skills and relating them to clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>Initial definitions in the literature tended to be vague and behaviorally unspecific such as “any behavior that contributes to a person’s effectiveness as part of a larger group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512440008">Argyrisa, 1965</xref>, p. 61) Michel, Alan Bellack, and others defined social skills as those that others perceive as reinforcing or as an individual’s ability to express positive and negative feelings without loss of social reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512440008">Hersen &amp; Bellack, 1977</xref>). Regardless of the working definition, the need existed to empirically describe and define social skills from a behavioral perspective, that is, what did appropriate social skills look like. While the use of role-playing and video recording are commonplace today to assess and treat deficits in social skills, Michel and his early collaborators conducted some of the first studies of these methods to assess behavioral components of social skills. In 1973, Richard Eisler, Michel, and Stewart Agras published an article in <italic>Behavior Therapy</italic> describing the advantages of using “modern videotape equipment” for recording social skills interactions to facilitate precise definitions of behavior. Initially, research in this area focused on the assessment of assertiveness and its verbal (e.g., speech hesitations or disruptions, content appropriate to the situation) and nonverbal (e.g., eye contact, body language) components.</p>
<p>In one of the first studies in this area, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512440008">Eisler, Miller, and Hersen (1973)</xref> developed 14 interpersonal situations requiring assertive responses. Participants (psychiatric inpatients) role-played the scenes with a female research assistant who portrayed the roles of waitress, sales clerk, spouse, and so on, prompting assertive responses. Interactions were videotaped and participants’ performances were rated on verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Based on global clinical judgments of assertiveness, independent of behavioral ratings, participants were divided into low- and high-assertiveness groups. Behaviorally, high-assertiveness participants were rated as having lengthier and more voluminous verbal responses with shorter response latencies and more pronounced affect than low-assertiveness participants. Highly assertive participants also exhibited less compliance and were more likely to request a change in behavior (e.g., “This is not what I ordered. Would you please bring me the correct meal?”).</p>

<sec id="section2-0145445512440008">
<title>Stimulus-Specific Theory of Social Skills</title>
<p>Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512440008">Hersen and Bellack (1977)</xref> postulated a stimulus-specific theory, emphasizing the fact that the adequacy of social skills in bringing about reinforcement varies depending on the specific population and specific situation. Unlike earlier investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512440008">Wolpe, 1970</xref>), their conceptualization focused on the expression of positive (i.e., praise and appreciation) as well as negative assertion (i.e., standing up for one’s rights and making appropriate demands).</p>
<p>This realization that such skills represent a repertoire of situation-specific behaviors had significant treatment implications. For example, in their work on conduct disordered, substance abusing adolescents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512440008">Donohue, Van Hasselt, Hersen, and Perrin (1998)</xref> noted that if a teenager is proficient at initiating conversation and making new friends, but is deficient at refusing the offer of street drugs, treatment should be targeted exclusively toward the latter deficiency. Otherwise, valuable treatment time would be wasted teaching global social skills when the problem at hand was highly specific. In addition, patients may view this more specific training as being more relevant to their needs and therefore be more motivated to engage in the treatment plan. Although this approach may seem self-evident today, this was not the standard of care in the early days.</p>
<p>This stimulus-specific theory of social skills garnered significant research support as far back as the 1970s. A prime example is a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512440008">Eisler, Hersen, Miller, and Blanchard (1975)</xref> examining the effects of social context on assertive behavior. Using role-played assertiveness situations with adult psychiatric patients, findings suggested that assertive behaviors were not consistent across situations and that assertiveness did not appear to be a global trait. For example, an individual who was able to be negatively assertive (i.e., standing up for one’s rights) is not necessarily able to demonstrate positive, complimentary assertiveness and vice versa. In addition, these male patients exhibited greater positive and negative assertiveness toward women than men and were more likely to be positively assertive with unfamiliar (waiter or salesperson) than familiar (friend or spouse) individuals.</p>
<p>Alan Bellack, one of Michel’s closest colleagues and research collaborators in the early days, expanded this concept by emphasizing the importance of an individual’s perceptions and interpretations of social situations in addition to his or her behavioral skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512440008">Bellack, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512440008">Morrison &amp; Bellack, 1981</xref>). Behavioral skills may be necessary but not sufficient for adequate interpersonal responses unless the individual correctly perceives what reaction is required for the situation at hand. The importance of perception as well as behavior has been demonstrated by more recent evidence showing a link between impaired appraisal of interpersonal emotional expressions and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512440008">McClure, Pope, Hoberman, Pine, &amp; Leibenluft, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that an iteration of this notion has developed independently in the business and management fields under the rubric of “emotional intelligence.” Emotional intelligence is “the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512440008">Salovey &amp; Mayer, 1990</xref>, p. 189) Obviously, this model puts more emphasis on the individuals’ perceptions and appraisals of their own feelings as well as those being expressed by others. The concept of emotional intelligence which is strongly associated with a high level of psychological functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512440008">Tsaousis &amp; Nikolaou, 2005</xref>) expands the meaning of social skills even further.</p>
<p>Although the earliest studies of social skills focused on basic verbal and nonverbal behaviors, this research eventually led to a more thorough understanding of the idiosyncratic and complex nature of interpersonal skills and their relationship to psychopathology and psychological distress.</p>

<title>Assertiveness Studies With Alcohol-Dependent Patients</title>
<p>Michel and colleagues did much to develop specific social skills training methods over the years with various patient groups, including (to name a few) chronic schizophrenics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512440008">Hersen &amp; Bellack, 1976</xref>), visually handicapped adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512440008">Van Hasselt, Hersen, &amp; Kazdin, 1985</xref>), alcoholics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512440008">Eisler, Hersen, &amp; Miller, 1974</xref>), highly aggressive children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512440008">Bornstein, Bellack, &amp; Hersen, 1980</xref>), delinquent adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445512440008">Ollendick &amp; Hersen, 1979</xref>), older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512440008">Donohue, Acierno, Van Hasselt, &amp; Hersen, 1995</xref>), depressed adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512440008">Bellack, Hersen, &amp; Himmelhoch, 1983</xref>), and couples experiencing marital problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512440008">Eisler, Miller, Hersen, &amp; Alford, 1974</xref>). A comprehensive discussion of these wide-ranging contributions is not possible in this brief article, so, instead, I will focus on studies with alcohol-dependent patients, a clinical interest that Michel and I (together with Richard Eisler) shared.</p>
<p>Although social skills training is currently commonplace in the cognitive behavioral treatment of alcohol and drug dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512440008">Luty, 2006</xref>), this was not always the case. In a review on social skills training for alcoholics and drug addicts published in 1978, Michel and colleagues noted, “While use of social skills training with these populations <italic>is at an exploratory stage</italic>, preliminary findings suggest the utility of this approach for enhancing interpersonal performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512440008">Van Hasselt, Hersen, &amp; Milliones, 1978</xref>, p. 221, italics added). The exploratory status of this approach seems difficult to fathom given the current state-of-the-art, but it demonstrates how far we have come and how much Michel’s research and that of his colleagues has added to our knowledge.</p>
<p>In the initial stages of this line of research, Michel, Richard Eisler, and I teamed up to investigate the effects of stressful interpersonal interactions on the drinking behavior of alcohol-dependent individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512440008">Miller, Hersen, Eisler, &amp; Hilsman, 1974</xref>). Alcoholics and nonalcoholics (social drinkers) were exposed to stressful and nonstressful role-played situations. During stressful encounters, participants were exposed to interpersonal situations requiring assertive responses (e.g., being unexpectedly overcharged for automobile repairs). The nonstressful encounters involved the participants’ discussing activities that they enjoyed. Drinking was assessed after each condition by means of lever presses to obtain alcohol on an operant console. Alcohol was dispensed into a glass on a fixed ratio (FR 50) reinforcement schedule. (For historical purposes, it might be noted that this operant system for assessing drinking behavior in humans was typical of the time and was originally introduced by Nancy Mello and Jack Mendelson at Harvard in 1965 and used extensively by Peter Nathan at Rutgers as well as our group in Mississippi in the 1970s.) Findings indicated that the assertive encounters were quite stressful for the alcohol-dependent individuals but not for the social drinkers. Alcoholic individuals drank significantly more after the stressful conditions than the nonstressful ones. Experimental manipulations did not affect the operant responding of the social drinkers. Thus, lack of behavioral proficiency in situations calling for assertiveness can serve to trigger drinking behavior in alcoholic patients. Stress that is associated with lack of social skills can also serve as a precursor to the development of the alcohol problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512440008">O’Leary, O’Leary, &amp; Donovan, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512440008">Van Hasselt et al., 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>In follow-up studies, our research group found that this relationship between lack of assertiveness and drinking was “dose dependent” in that the less assertive a patient was, the more alcohol he drank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512440008">Eisler et al., 1975</xref>). In addition, alcoholic patients were more likely than social drinkers to perceive themselves as more assertive than they actually are. This is particularly relevant for clinicians as relying solely on self-reports of alcoholics to determine their treatment needs could lead to a less-than-adequate treatment plan.</p>
<p>Based on such findings, lack of assertiveness became a prime target of intervention in alcoholism treatment. Methods were developed primarily for negative assertiveness only because alcoholics did not show similar deficits in positive assertiveness (e.g., giving compliments; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512440008">Eisler et al., 1975</xref>). Continuing with our laboratory analogue model, our group investigated the utility of instructions, verbal feedback, video feedback, behavioral rehearsal, and modeling on components of assertiveness in social and marital interactions of alcoholics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512440008">Eisler, Hersen, &amp; Agras, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512440008">Eisler, Hersen, et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445512440008">Hersen, Eisler, &amp; Miller, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512440008">Hersen, Eisler, Miller, Johnson, &amp; Pinkston, 1973</xref>). This work was especially instrumental in illustrating the need to program transfer of training to insure generalization of behavior changes from the training setting to a variety of real-life situations (Hersen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512440008">Eisler, Miller, et al., 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>Social skills training with alcoholic patients eventually expanded into Coping and Social Skills Training (CSST) involving strategies to overcome a numerous array of interpersonal, environmental, and individual skill deficits that increase the likelihood of heavy drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512440008">Monti, Rohsenow, Colby, &amp; Abrams, 1995</xref>). Over the past 40 years, this approach has developed from being a narrowly focused exploratory approach to one of the most comprehensive, evidence-based and cost-effective treatments for alcohol use disorders available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512440008">Read &amp; Kahler, 2001</xref>). The early studies of the 1970s seem almost simplistic today, but they were exceptionally instrumental in providing the building blocks for these contemporary treatment methods.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The fields of behavior therapy and clinical psychology in general and the subspecialty of social skills in particular have come a long way. Michel Hersen’s contribution to these fields cannot be overestimated. Probably his greatest contribution was related to his dedication to the question of “what therapeutic methods work and how can we objectively evaluate their efficacy” and not simply to one particular theoretical orientation. Contemporary clinicians and researchers readily acknowledge this pragmatic, empirical philosophy and the importance of finding evidence-based treatments. The current emphasis on evidence-based treatments as those “that have been scientifically tested and subjected to clinical judgment and determined to be appropriate for the treatment of a given individual, population, or problem area” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445512440008">Sorensen, Hettema, &amp; Larios, 2009</xref>, p. 17) is a notion that Michel would have readily espoused early in his career. Especially relevant to Michel’s philosophy as well as his body of work is the idea that the scientific method and perceptive clinical judgment are necessary for an adequate understanding of clinical issues.</p>
<p>Michel has always been a true scientist, always searching, always looking for answers in many branches of clinical psychology. His contributions to the literature are truly ubiquitous, covering a variety of clinical syndromes and appearing in journals covering the spectrum of behavior therapy. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he was not content to focus on one narrow clinical subspecialty. In behavioral science, we need specialists to hammer out the details of specific treatments and disorders but we also need polymaths, that is, those whose expertise spans a significant number of different subject areas. Most ancient scientists were polymaths and perhaps Michel is a throwback to ancient times. He has been and always will be a contemporary Renaissance man, excelling in a variety of arts and sciences. Perhaps only his closest colleagues know that he is a gifted violinist, photographer, art collector, and humanitarian as well as a prominent scientist.</p>
<p>Finally, Michel’s long and distinguished career has not only contributed to our knowledge of improving people’s lives but also stimulated hundreds of students and colleagues to pursue quality research. Michel has been a wise and generous collaborator and mentor and has created and fostered career opportunities for many. His mark on behavior therapy and those who practice it will long endure.</p>
