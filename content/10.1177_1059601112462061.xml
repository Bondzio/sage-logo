<p>Technology and contextual factors may moderate the effects of leadership in virtual teams. We conducted an experiment to study the effect of leadership styles on feedback positivity in small, ad hoc teams performing a decision-making task using a virtual world or instant messaging. We also examined the relationship of feedback positivity to team outcomes, including satisfaction, social presence, cohesion, group efficacy, consensus, decision quality, and task time. Leadership style interacted with communication medium to influence feedback positivity. Relative to transactional leadership, transformational leadership led to greater feedback positivity in the instant messaging condition but had no effect in the virtual world condition. Greater feedback positivity was positively associated with social presence, discussion satisfaction, cohesion, group efficacy, and task time, but was negatively associated with decision quality.</p>

<p>Increasing competition, globalization, and availability of information technology that enables work from any place at any time are leading to greater use of virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112462061">Algesheimer, Dholakia, &amp; Gurău, 2011</xref>). Virtual teams present numerous collaboration challenges created by the lean and delayed nature of electronic communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112462061">Kirkman, Rosen, Gibson, Tesluk, &amp; McPherson, 2002</xref>). These challenges include difficulty in establishing a common purpose and planning the team’s activities, unclear role expectations, and lack of motivation and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112462061">Huang, Kahai, &amp; Jestice, 2010</xref>). Leadership has been found to be vital for overcoming these challenges and improving team performance; effective virtual team leaders monitor and structure team processes, motivate individual members, and attend to the team’s socioemotional aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112462061">Avolio, Kahai, &amp; Dodge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112462061">Joshi, Lazarova, &amp; Liao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601112462061">Kahai, Fjermestad, Zhang, &amp; Avolio, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112462061">Kayworth &amp; Leidner, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Research suggests that variables peculiar to virtual teams may moderate leadership effects in such teams; therefore, virtual team leaders cannot assume that face-to-face leadership knowledge is directly applicable in virtual teams. Differences have been observed in the strength of effects of leadership styles and leader ratings (Puranova &amp; Bono, 2009). Differences have also been found in the effect of inspirational leadership on commitment and trust, with stronger effects associated with increased team dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112462061">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>). Transactional leadership has been found to improve task cohesion and transformational leadership to improve cooperative climate in virtual teams only when media richness perceptions were low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112462061">Huang et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These variations in leadership effects suggest the need for additional research to enhance our limited knowledge of virtual team leadership. This need becomes more acute as new collaboration media become available. Recently, there has been much interest in the use of virtual worlds, with companies such as IBM, Intel, and other Fortune 500 companies adopting them for virtual team collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112462061">Cherbakov, Brunner, Smart, &amp; Lu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112462061">Kahai, Carroll, &amp; Jestice, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112462061">Kahai, Carroll, et al. (2007)</xref>, virtual worlds may moderate the effects of leadership through the digital incarnations of users, also known as avatars. For instance, avatars may increase the salience of individual differences, compared to when communication is pure text-based, as in instant messaging (IM). This increased salience, in turn, might dilute a transformational leader's efforts to foster social identity and teamwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112462061">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>). The possibility of communication media influencing leadership effects gives rise to the following broad research question: How do communication media and leadership interact to influence team processes and outcomes in virtual teams? To begin to address this question, we conducted an experimental study of how leadership style (transformational versus transactional) affects positivity of peer feedback in small, ad hoc groups performing a management decision-making task using either a virtual world or an IM system. Feedback positivity is defined as positivity in the sentiments and attitudes expressed towards the input provided by group members. We also examined the effects of feedback positivity on the following team outcomes: satisfaction, social presence, cohesion, group efficacy, consensus, decision quality, and task time.</p>
<p>Our research contributes to the areas of both leadership and computer-mediated communication. It extends the leadership literature by arguing and demonstrating that leadership effects in virtual teams are not universal but are contingent on communication media. While recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112462061">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112462061">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>) suggests that virtual team context may interact with leadership, it has not examined how leadership effects in virtual teams vary across communication media. This study also contributes to the virtual world literature by demonstrating that the extra visual and audio information being provided by a virtual world may interfere with a transformational leader’s attempts to facilitate teamwork. This is important because that extra visual and audio information is considered by many to be a key selling point for the use of virtual worlds in collaboration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112462061">Cherbakov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112462061">Gartner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601112462061">Owens, Davis, Murphy, Khazanchi, &amp; Zigurs, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Framework</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601112462061">Figure 1</xref> depicts the variables of interest in this study using the input-process-outcomes framework for teams. A key idea of the input-process-outcomes framework is that input variables affect outcome variables via the interaction process within a team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112462061">Hackman, 1987</xref>). In our study, leadership style and communication medium are the input variables that are expected to affect the interaction process among team members, described by the positivity of feedback exchanged within the team. The interaction process, in turn, is viewed as affecting team outcomes, which is made up of various team performance variables.</p>

<sec id="section3-1059601112462061">
<title>Leadership Style</title>
<p>Team leaders play a central role in shaping group mental models and dynamics and facilitating members’ interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112462061">Kahai, Sosik, &amp; Avolio, 1997</xref>; Zaccaro, Rittman, &amp; Marks, 2001). Through their experiences, sense making, and visions, team leaders introduce exogenous influence and input for interactions within the team. A popular way for distinguishing leadership styles is the transformational–transactional styles framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112462061">Burns, 1978</xref>). Transactional leaders influence followers via behaviors that emphasize an exchange between the leader and followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601112462061">Kunhert &amp; Lewis, 1987</xref>). These behaviors consist of clarifying expectations, including reward contingencies, and providing contingent rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112462061">Avolio, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112462061">Bass, 1998</xref>). Transformational leaders influence followers by offering an inspiring vision that transcends short-term goals and immediate self-interests. Through their interactions with team members, transformational leaders encourage followers to identify with higher-level goals, such as those of a group, organization, or society, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601112462061">Kunhert &amp; Lewis, 1987</xref>), and inspire and motivate their achievement-oriented behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1059601112462061">Neufeld, Dong, &amp; Higgins, 2007</xref>). Behaviors that characterize transformational leadership are (a) intellectual stimulation, (b) individualized consideration, (c) inspirational motivation, and (d) idealized influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112462061">Avolio, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Transactional and transformational leadership styles are not mutually exclusive; effective leaders display a mixture of these behaviors. The suitability of either style depends on a variety of factors including the desired processes or outcomes and the setting in which leadership is exercised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112462061">Judge &amp; Piccolo, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1059601112462061">
<title>Communication Medium</title>
<p>By providing the channels that enable messages to flow among group members and control the type of information that can flow, communication media play a critical role in influencing the nature of team interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112462061">Connolly, Jessup, &amp; Valacich, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112462061">Hiltz, Johnson, &amp; Turoff, 1986</xref>). As such, communication media serve as an input factor into a team’s process. Virtual worlds and IM are two media that virtual teams employ. Several Fortune 500 companies have created spaces in various virtual world platforms, such as Second Life, Open Wonderland, and OpenSim, to allow dispersed employees to meet up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601112462061">Bessière, Ellis, &amp; Kellogg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112462061">Cherbakov et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, the use of IM in the workplace to enable collaboration among dispersed employees has been increasing and is even expected to overtake the use of email in the near future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112462061">Montoya, Massey, Hung, &amp; Crisp, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1059601112462061">Robert Half Technology, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Both virtual worlds and IM enable synchronous interactions via text. Virtual worlds also offer an audio channel that communicates ambient sound and a visual channel that shows users’ avatars within a shared, simulated 3-D environment. Virtual world proponents consider these visual and audio channels as important for enhancing collaboration by creating an immersive experience and fostering social presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112462061">Cherbakov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112462061">Gartner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601112462061">Owens et al., 2009</xref>). Though IM lacks the richness of features of virtual worlds, it could alternate for some of the functions of virtual worlds. For instance, IM enables synchronous communication and it may be employed by virtual teams to create an awareness of the presence of others. By comparing a virtual world to IM, we can begin to learn whether and how the additional visual and audio channels offered by virtual worlds make a difference for leadership effects in virtual teams.</p>
<p>We conducted our study using Second Life (SL). SL offers voice capabilities, but in the current study, the audio channel was restricted to ambient sounds and users communicated using text. This was done because many SL users have rejected voice and text continues to be the primary means of communication in SL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601112462061">Wadley, Gibbs, &amp; Duchenaut, 2009</xref>). Also, the use of text is important in virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601112462061">Wadley et al., 2009</xref>). Members of multicultural virtual teams may prefer using text to hide challenges they face when speaking in the team’s chosen language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1059601112462061">Zhang, Koble, Tremaine, &amp; Milewski, 2010</xref>). Text also enables a record of the communication that can be reused to mitigate the potential for misunderstandings. In a large meeting, knowing who is speaking and what order to speak in can be difficult; these issues do not exist with text. Additionally, text may be necessary in virtual teams whose members reside in countries that ban voice-over-internet or restrict SL communication to text only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601112462061">Demangeot &amp; Ramsay, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Team Process</title>
<p>In the input-process-outcomes framework for teams, process refers to the interactions or interpersonal transactions that take place among team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112462061">Hackman, 1987</xref>). Feedback positivity describes this process by indicating the nature of feedback, which is a critical aspect of interaction among members of a team. Feedback cues team members about where and how to allocate their efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112462061">Connolly et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112462061">DeShon, Kozlowski, Schmidt, Milner, &amp; Wiechmann, 2004</xref>), thereby reducing role uncertainty and improving motivation, satisfaction, and team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112462061">Geister, Konradt, &amp; Hertel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112462061">Jaworski &amp; Kohli, 1991</xref>). Feedback also facilitates common understanding and mutual agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601112462061">Dennis &amp; Valacich, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112462061">Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1999)</xref> found that when virtual team members provided substantive feedback on task performance, it helped the team develop and maintain trust.</p>
<p>In virtual teams, electronic media inhibit feedback by restricting nonverbal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112462061">Alavi &amp; Tiwana, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1059601112462061">Straus &amp; McGrath, 1994</xref>) and by requiring users to type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112462061">Chidambaram, 1996</xref>). The dispersion of team members in a virtual team also makes it challenging for a leader to monitor team member performance and provide feedback. The muted occurrence of feedback in virtual teams makes it critical to study what types of interventions are likely to promote feedback, especially peer-feedback rather than that provided directly by the leader. Indeed, virtual team leaders are encouraged to develop their team so that members can monitor the performance of their peers and provide feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112462061">Bell &amp; Kozlowski, 2002</xref>). It is due to these considerations that we examined the effect of different leadership styles on peer feedback in virtual teams.</p>
<p>Feedback may be positive or negative. In the context of a team working together on a task, it is positive when team members approve, appreciate, or compliment others’ contributions, and it is negative when they disapprove, criticize, or dislike them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112462061">Connolly et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112462061">Kahai &amp; Cooper, 2003</xref>). In this study we focus on the overall positivity in peer feedback, which is reflected in higher levels of positive feedback and lower levels of negative feedback.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059601112462061">
<title>Team Outcomes</title>
<p>Team outcomes refer to the products of a team’s process. We employ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112462061">Hackman and Wageman’s (2005)</xref> multidimensional conceptualization of team outcomes, which the authors view as indicators of team performance. The first dimension focuses on team member experience, which encompasses what a team member feels as an outcome of her/his interaction with media and others in the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112462061">Forlizzi &amp; Battarbee, 2004</xref>). We measured two aspects of experience: Satisfaction with discussion and social presence. Discussion satisfaction regulates future activity, with dissatisfaction often leading to change. When team members are dissatisfied, they may avoid working in teams in general or choosing the same communication medium in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601112462061">Hoegl &amp; Gemuenden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112462061">Kahai, Avolio, &amp; Sosik, 1998</xref>). Social presence, defined as “the salience of the other in a mediated communication and the consequent salience of their interpersonal interactions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601112462061">Short, Williams, &amp; Christie, 1976</xref>, p. 65), may be important in and of itself for making technology-mediated team interactions feel more humane.</p>
<p>A second outcome of the interaction among team members is the development of the capability to work together interdependently in the future, which may be indicated by cohesion, group efficacy, and consensus. Group cohesion, which refers to members' attraction to the group and to each other, influences whether team members would like to affiliate with one another in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112462061">Hogg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112462061">Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978</xref>). Group efficacy, or a group's perceived capability to perform a future task, determines its success in future tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601112462061">Gibson, Randel, &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>). Group consensus, or the extent to which team members' decision preferences are similar, determines how well team members are likely to work with each other to implement the team's decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112462061">Kahai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1059601112462061">Watson, DeSanctis, &amp; Poole, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Interaction among members of a team typically leads to some output, such as a product, service, or decision. The third dimension of team outcomes focuses on this productive output and is described by how well the output meets expectations of quality, quantity, and timeliness. Since the teams in the current study worked on a single group decision, this aspect of team outcomes was conceptualized in terms of decision quality and the time spent on the decision-making task.</p>

<title>Leadership-Media Interaction: A Social Identity Based Perspective</title>
<p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601112462061">Figure 1</xref>, we expect leadership style to interact with communication media to influence feedback positivity. We first link transformational and transactional leadership behaviors to feedback positivity to argue that transformational leadership is likely to be more effective than transactional leadership at promoting feedback positivity. We then argue how transformational leadership’s effectiveness relative to transactional leadership is expected to vary across IM and SL.</p>
<p>A transformational leader is generally thought to promote greater teamwork than a transactional leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112462061">Avolio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112462061">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1059601112462061">Wang, Oh, Courtright, &amp; Colbert, 2011</xref>). Researchers have used concepts from social identity theory to suggest that a transformational leader encourages members to engage in teamwork by helping them relate their self-concepts to the social group defined by their team and enhancing their identification with the team. This effect occurs through the four behaviors of transformational leadership.</p>
<p>Inspirational motivation behaviors tie the team’s work to a vision that team members find as intrinsically meaningful. They also emphasize the great outcomes the team can achieve by “working together” and show confidence in the team’s ability to achieve them. Consequently, team members relate their self-concept with the team’s vision and their desire to identify with the team increases; they then go beyond personal goals and find mutual interest in collaborating to achieve the team’s goals. When collaborating, team members are likely to give positive feedback and avoid negative feedback so that others remain motivated to contribute. Through intellectual stimulation behaviors, a transformational leader encourages team members to rethink their ideas, question each other, and be innovative. Through individualized consideration behaviors, the leader also recognizes that each member has something unique and valuable to offer and encourages receptivity to others’ contributions. By creating a team in which members feel valued and safe to participate, these behaviors enhance identification with the team, which, in turn enhances teamwork and feedback positivity. Through idealized influence, team members see the leader displaying admirable qualities and values, as well as a strong conviction in the team’s vision. As a result, they idealize the leader as a role model and adopt the leader’s vision and calls for teamwork. This further enhances their identification with the team and encourages them to be positive in their feedback to help the team succeed.</p>
<p>A transactional leader clarifies expected effort and desirable outcomes it could lead to. This motivates effort by building effort-accomplishment expectations among team members. Contingent rewarding further reinforces the effort-accomplishment expectations. Unlike a transformational leader, a transactional leader does not focus on the means by which team members should accomplish their task. Consequently, a transactional leader is not likely to be as effective as a transformational leader at promoting teamwork and feedback positivity.</p>
<p>The above discussion can be summarized as suggesting that a transformational leader is likely to be more effective than a transactional leader at promoting teamwork and feedback positivity and it does so by highlighting the team’s vision and teamwork and by enabling identification with the team. The Social Identity Model of Deindividuation (SIDE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112462061">Lea &amp; Spears, 1991</xref>) suggests that this effectiveness of transformational leadership relative to transactional leadership is likely to vary across the computer-based communication media employed by the team.</p>
<p>According to SIDE, communication enabled by different computer-based media can be differentiated on the basis of individuating information available to users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112462061">Kahai, 2009</xref>). For instance, SL provides more individuating information than IM. Specifically, the visual channel in SL provides information about the individual via the appearance, movement, body posture, activity, and gestures of that individual’s avatar. Information about an individual’s specific activity is also accentuated by the audio channel and sounds that accompany gestures and movements. SIDE proposes that when greater levels of individuating information are available, interpersonal differences become more salient and team members’ attention shifts increasingly to individual members of the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112462061">Lea &amp; Spears, 1991</xref>). Consequently, team members become less responsive to cues that highlight the group. On the other hand, SIDE suggests that when individuating information is lacking, interpersonal differences are not salient and team members become more responsive to cues that highlight the group and its social identity and behave in accordance with expectations for the group and its norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112462061">Lea &amp; Spears, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Since transformational leaders promote feedback positivity by highlighting the team and enabling identification with it, the above discussion on SIDE suggests that transformational leaders are likely to be more effective in a medium that provides less individuating information. In such a medium, team members are likely to become more sensitive and receptive to a transformational leader’s emphasis on the team’s vision and attempts to facilitate teamwork. Additionally, since IM provides less individuating information than SL, this discussion suggests that a transformational leader would be more effective at promoting feedback positivity in IM than in SL. On the other hand, the level of feedback positivity associated with transactional leadership is not likely to change across IM and SL. This is because transactional leadership motivates effort towards the goal rather than feedback positivity and the use of one communication medium versus another does not do anything to this lack of emphasis on feedback positivity. Thus, when we consider transformational leadership’s effectiveness at promoting feedback positivity relative to transactional leadership’s across communication media, we expect this effectiveness to be greater in IM than in SL.</p>
<p>Evidence from past research supports the idea that the presence or lack of individuating information in computer-mediated communication may influence the effects of transformational leadership. In a study of groups interacting via a Group Support System (GSS) to create a joint report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112462061">Sosik, Avolio, and Kahai (1997)</xref> observed that the lack of individuating information increased the effect of transformational leadership on group potency as compared to that of transactional leadership. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112462061">Kahai, Sosik, and Avolio (2003)</xref> found that the lack of individuating information enhanced the effects of transformational versus transactional leadership on group efficacy in GSS supported teams working on a cognitive conflict task.</p>

<sec id="section10-1059601112462061">
<title>Effects on Team Member Experience</title>
<p>Satisfaction with discussion is an evaluation of one’s experience during the discussion. Positive feedback prompts one to step back from active effort and reflect on and savor the current circumstances and recent successes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112462061">Fredrickson, 1998</xref>). During such reflection, an individual integrates the recent happenings and creates a new sense of self that is “together” with others and the environment around. This increases an individual’s receptivity to others’ contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112462061">Fredrickson, 1998</xref>); such an individual is more likely to evaluate the discussion more positively and be more satisfied with it. Additionally, the mere act of thinking about one’s recent successes during the discussion will make one evaluate the discussion more positively and be more satisfied with it. Negative feedback, on the other hand, is likely to restrict individual members’ attention to their own contributions and to the prevention of recurrence of such feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112462061">Belschak &amp; Den Hartog, 2009</xref>). In these conditions, members will close themselves to others’ contributions and are likely to be less satisfied with the discussion. Furthermore, the feelings of disappointment spawned by critical feedback are likely to make one evaluate the discussion less favorably, and be less satisfied with it.</p>
<p>These expectations about the relationships between feedback and satisfaction are consistent with past findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1059601112462061">Prussia and Kinicki (1996)</xref> reported that positive (negative) feedback provided to teams about their performance predicted higher (lower) levels of satisfaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112462061">Connolly et al. (1990)</xref> found that members of groups working with a confederate providing positive (negative) feedback were more (less) satisfied. We, therefore, hypothesize the following:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>H2</italic>: Feedback positivity will be positively related to discussion satisfaction.</p></list-item></list>
<p>As indicated above, positive feedback may lead the receiver to feel more “together” with others. Feeling “together” with others during mediated communication is a key idea behind experiencing social presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601112462061">Short et al., 1976</xref>). Negative feedback, on the other hand, is likely to restrict the attention of individual members to their own contributions and take attention away from others, thereby reducing social presence.

<title>Effects on Future Teamwork Capability</title>
<p>The impacts on future teamwork capability are likely to occur via positive feedback’s effects on increasing receptivity to others’ contributions and feeling “together” with team members. Due to increased receptivity to others when there is positive feedback, team members see others as making useful contributions and are inclined to associate with them. On the other hand, negative feedback is likely to make team members focus on their own contributions and pay less attention to the contributions of others, thereby reducing their willingness to collaborate with them. Intention to associate with others in the group induces group cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1059601112462061">Souder, 1988</xref>); we, therefore, expect feedback positivity to increase group cohesion. Past research provides support for this expectation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1059601112462061">Roark &amp; Sharah (1989)</xref> found that team members showed greater cohesion when others in the group accepted their contributions.

<list id="list4-1059601112462061" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>H4</italic>: Feedback positivity will be positively related to group cohesion.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Greater receptivity to others’ contributions leads one to see team members as capable of making useful contributions and, thereby, enhances group efficacy. Feeling “together” with others may also increase group efficacy by suggesting a lower potential for conflict within the team. Negative feedback, on the other hand, is likely to reduce group efficacy via its effect of closing team members to the contributions of others and making them see others as less capable. Negative feedback will also increase the focus on one’s viewpoints that others seem to disagree with, and, thus, highlight disharmony within the team. This too can decrease group efficacy. Past research supports the expected feedback positivity-group efficacy relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1059601112462061">Prussia and Kinicki (1996)</xref> found that positive (negative) performance feedback provided to teams predicted higher (lower) levels of group efficacy.

<p>Receptivity to others’ ideas, induced by positive feedback, increases the likelihood of achieving consensus with them. Feeling “together” with others, which too is induced by positive feedback, increases the pressure to come to an agreement with others. Negative feedback, on the other hand, is likely to reduce consensus by making team members closed to others’ contributions and by bringing one’s differences with others into focus, which can increase the pressure to maintain one’s individuality and position on an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112462061">Abrams, Wetherell, Cochrane, Hogg, &amp; Turner, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects on Production Outcomes</title>
<p>Feedback positivity is likely to reduce decision quality. As indicated earlier, positive feedback takes attention away from the focal task; one focuses instead on savoring and integrating recent happenings to create a new sense of oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112462061">Fredrickson, 1998</xref>). This shift in attention inhibits development of task related issues and lowers decision quality. On the other hand, negative feedback may improve decision quality by making an individual focus on what caused the criticism and developing her/his ideas to invalidate the criticism. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112462061">Fredrickson and Losada (2005)</xref>, negative feedback can have such a developmental effect when it is (a) connected to specific circumstances, and (b) time-limited and soluble. Negative feedback during a short-term decision making task, such as the one examined in this study, satisfies these conditions. First, it is tied to a particular contribution of a member. Second, it is soluble in that it can be overcome with a modified contribution. This development of ideas prompted by negative feedback can lead to improved decision quality.</p>
<p>Past findings support the above line of thinking. Several studies have shown that negative (positive) feedback improves (decreases) the quality of a team’s output. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112462061">Connolly et al. (1990)</xref> found that groups working with a confederate who gave positive feedback produced a greater number of original solutions than groups working with a confederate who gave negative feedback. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112462061">Leshed, Hancock, Cosley, Mcleod, and Gay (2007)</xref> found that greater positive feedback led to lower task focus.

<list-item><p><italic>H7</italic>: Feedback positivity will be negatively related to decision quality.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Since refinement and further development takes time, negative feedback can delay task completion. Conversely, while positive feedback can curb refinement and further development of solutions, it can quicken task completion. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Undergraduate business students (<italic>N</italic> = 160; mean age = 20.7; 52% male) from an introductory management information systems course participated for bonus credit. Using students is appropriate in this study since its focus is on mechanisms that underlie some happening rather than drawing conclusions about a specific population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112462061">Griffin &amp; Kacmar, 1991</xref>). It also employed a simple decision making task, where no contextual or technical knowledge was required and personal characteristics (e.g., age and experience) were not moderator variables, thereby reducing the inappropriateness of using students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1059601112462061">Weick, 1967</xref>). In addition, students were from a business school and were likely to soon join the population of organizational decision makers. Therefore the use of business students in this study has face validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112462061">Remus, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Before participating, students filled out a questionnaire that collected demographic information, information about their familiarity with virtual worlds and IM, and information about the five students they knew best in the class. Groups were formed randomly. Once the groups were formed, the lists of well-known persons from the initial survey were checked against the group membership. If group membership overlapped with known persons, then one of the members was randomly switched with someone from another group. Due to attendance and scheduling issues, which occurred randomly, the composition of a few groups had to be altered—some groups operated with fewer members while others saw new members added to them. When new members were added, we checked to make sure that group members did not know each other well. Additionally, due to a technical issue, a group had to be excluded from analysis. We had a final count of 34 groups with sizes ranging from 3 to 7 (mean = 4.71).</p>

<title>Research Design and Experimental Session</title>
<p>The study used a 2 (IM/SL communication medium) × 2 (transactional/transformational leadership) design. Groups completed a decision-making task with a trained confederate group leader. Participants joined their group from a remote location of their choice using any computer that allowed them to run the appropriate software. They were not told who else was in their group. In both IM and SL, participants communicated using text-based chat.</p>
<p>Meetings were conducted in either IM or Second Life. Two male and two female leader identities were created in both IM and SL and their use was balanced to the extent possible to limit possible gender biases in participant perceptions of the leader. Leaders created chat rooms in IM and invited participants to join. For the meeting area in SL, two identical buildings with identical meeting space and furniture were rented. A few days prior to the task session, participants spent over two hours to complete an assignment designed to familiarize them with basic functions and features of SL and to allow them to create their own avatar. Participants also created an AIM account using the same name as their avatar name in SL. This was done so that participants could identify with their alias in both conditions, and to prevent them from accessing their usual buddy lists in either SL or IM. Formal training was not given for IM since preliminary survey data showed that participants had at least basic familiarity with IM.</p>
<p>To create the leadership conditions, trained confederates acted as group leaders and exhibited transactional or transformational leadership through comments at specific intervals during the task discussion. The confederate leaders completed leadership theory training and helped devise semiscripted comments specific to the two leadership styles. Leader comments reflected behaviors consistent with either a transactional or a transformational leader but they did not give the group explicit directions for its decision. Transactional leaders made comments that clarified expectations, including reward contingencies, and provided contingent feedback (e.g., You have come up with several ideas, I’m pleased with your performance so far). Transformational leaders commented to promote intellectual stimulation (e.g., let’s look at this from a bunch of different perspectives so we can make the best decision possible), individualized consideration (e.g., we should make sure to take everyone's ideas into consideration), and inspirational motivation (e.g., Let's try to work together as a team to make the best decision possible.). Transformational leaders did not make comments for idealized influence, which is an attribution of the leader rather than behaviors exhibited by the leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112462061">Avolio, 1999</xref>). Comments were made at 3-min intervals so leaders had up to 10 opportunities to make comments tied to the leadership behaviors they were portraying. The design and use of scripts was similar to past laboratory studies that had manipulated transactional and transformational leadership via appropriate leader comments during computer-based group discussions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112462061">Kahai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112462061">Sosik et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The study session consisted of two phases. Phase I was an ice-breaker exercise, which was facilitated by the leader and lasted approximately 10 min. The ice-breaker allowed participants to answer questions about their likes and dislikes (best restaurant in town, favorite sport, etc.). The same questions were asked in both communication conditions; however in SL, the leader asked participants who answered similarly to make their avatars stand together.</p>
<p>The task, Phase II, began after the ice-breaker. Each group was assigned the same decision-making task that required their group to make a bonus allocation decision. During this phase, participants first filled out an online individual decision form with their initial bonus allocations. After all members of a group filled in their allocations, the group was allotted 30 min for discussion. The leader encouraged the groups to reach a consensus decision in that time. The leader did not direct the way in which the groups should reach this consensus or the exact content of the discussion. The task ended when the group reached a consensus, if they did so within the 30 min. If they did not reach consensus, they were told to end their discussion at 30 min. After the discussion, participants again filled out an online form with their individual bonus allocation decisions. They were told that their final decisions could match or be different from the group's decision. After the final bonus allocation decision forms were filled in, participants were asked to complete a post-treatment survey online.</p>

The contingent rewarding scale represented transactional leadership (6 items; α = .66; sample item: During the bonus allocation DISCUSSION, the leader clarified what we had to do to succeed in our task). Four scales represented the different dimensions of transformational leadership: intellectual stimulation (4 items; α = .87; sample item: During the bonus allocation DISCUSSION, the leader encouraged us to be innovative in our views about the decision situation); individualized consideration (6 items; α = .89; sample item: During the bonus allocation DISCUSSION, the leader sought every member’s views on the issue we discussed); inspirational motivation (6 items; α = .83; sample item: During the bonus allocation DISCUSSION, the leader encouraged teamwork); and idealized influence (3 items; α = .90; sample item: It would make be proud to be associated with the leader).

<title>Feedback Positivity</title>
<p>Feedback positivity was operationalized using two indicators, positive feedback and negative feedback, obtained from discussion transcripts. The inclusion of negative feedback in the operationalization of feedback positivity is akin to the inclusion of oppositely worded items in questionnaires and reverse coding them when the scale of interest is computed. Two trained research assistants parsed and coded the discussion transcripts from the study. They were blind to the study's hypotheses and the conditions to which the transcripts belonged and employed a simplified version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112462061">Jessup, Connolly, and Galagher’s (1990)</xref> coding scheme. Our scheme was simplified to focus on positive and negative feedback and it collapsed other categories in Jessup et al.’s scheme into “Other comments.” Four transcripts, representing 12% of all transcripts, were parsed and coded by both assistants to compute inter-rater agreement, which was 87% and 86% for parsing and coding respectively.</p>
<p>Positive feedback was operationalized as the sum of all simple supportive remarks (e.g., “I agree” or “good idea”) and supportive remarks made with an argument (e.g., “I like that idea. Chip is obviously a hard worker”) divided by the total number of comments within the group, where a comment was defined as a separate but coherent idea. Likewise, negative feedback was operationalized as the sum of all simple critical remarks (e.g., “I don’t like that” or “That’s not a good idea”) and critical remarks made with an argument (e.g., “I don’t like that idea. We wouldn’t want to give Esther so much money if we didn’t know personal information about her”) divided by the total number of comments. The incidence of supportive and critical comments was operationalized in relative terms to adjust for differences in overall participation levels across groups as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112462061">Kahai (2009)</xref>.</p>

<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Perceptual measures of satisfaction, social presence, cohesion, and group efficacy were taken from the post-task survey. The perceptual scores for these items were obtained at the individual level and aggregated to the group level by averaging scores across group members. Aggregation of individual level measures to the group level is justified by r<sub>wg</sub> analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112462061">James, Demaree, &amp; Wolf, 1984</xref>). The mean r<sub>wg</sub> statistic computed for these variables all exceeded the customary cutoff of .7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112462061">LeBreton, Burgess, Kaiser, Atchley, &amp; James, 2003</xref>). Appropriateness of aggregation is also indicated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC(1)) statistic, which is the proportion of total variance in a variable that can be explained by team membership. While there are no definitive guidelines for ICC(1), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112462061">Bliese (2000)</xref> reports that in most studies, ICC(1) values range from 0.05 to 0.30.

Group level aggregated scores for each item were employed as indicators in subsequent data analysis conducted in partial least squares (PLS) in the case of all variables except group cohesion. The group level scores obtained for cohesion items were further aggregated to create two scales (as described below), which were then employed as indicators in PLS.</p>

Belonging concerns whether or not team members feel that they are full members of the team (sample item: I feel that I belong to the group).

This method employs the pre- and post-discussion allocations made by members for each eligible employee to compute pre- and post-discussion consensus using a fuzzy logic algorithm proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112462061">Spillman, Spillman, Bezdek (1980)</xref>. Consensus thus produced ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 implies complete agreement.</p>

<title>Decision quality</title>
<p>Although the assigned task was a decision-making task with no demonstrably right answer, it is the type of task that managers face on a regular basis in organizations. As such, comparing group decisions to the decisions of compensation experts is one way to determine the overall quality of the group decisions. In order to determine the decision quality, three experts with experience in making compensation decisions individually made the allocation decisions. The inter-rater reliability for allocations made by the experts, as indicated by Krippendorff’s alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112462061">Hayes &amp; Krippendorff, 2007</xref>), was 0.80. The three sets of allocations were then averaged to create expert allocation for each eligible employee. To compute the quality of a group's decision, we employed the mean allocation within the group for each eligible employee. This was then compared to the expert allocation for that employee using the following procedure: The absolute value of the difference in allocation was taken, made negative, and divided by the value of the expert allocation. The values obtained for each eligible employee using this procedure were added to create a quality score where a score of 0 would mean a perfect match with the expert opinion and a negative score indicated a difference in quality. The more negative the score, the lower the judged quality of the decision. This procedure was followed using both the pre- and post-discussion allocations to obtain pre- and post-discussion decision quality scores.</p>

<title>Covariates</title>
<p>We included several covariates in our analysis. Group size was controlled for cohesion, group efficacy, and satisfaction, because diversity and social loafing tend to increase with group size, which makes it difficult for cohesion and efficacy to develop and for participants to be satisfied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1059601112462061">Mulvey &amp; Klein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601112462061">Sargent &amp; Sue-Chan, 2001</xref>). Prediscussion consensus was used as a control variable for postdiscussion consensus, feedback positivity, and task time since it can affect these variables via conflict in the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1059601112462061">Poole, Holmes, &amp; DeSanctis, 1991</xref>). Prediscussion decision quality was used as a control for postdecision quality. Furthermore, in Hypotheses 2 to 8, which focus on the effects of feedback positivity on team outcomes, leadership condition and communication condition were employed as controls for the effects of leadership and communication media on team outcomes that are not mediated by feedback positivity. Leadership condition was represented as a dummy variable (0 = transactional, 1 = transformational) as was communication condition (0 = IM, 1 = SL).</p>

<title>Analyses and Results</title>

<title>Manipulations and Other Checks</title>
<p>To check leadership manipulation, individual level perceptions of leadership during the task discussion were analyzed using nested analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the group to which a participant belonged being nested within the leadership condition. Participants in the transactional condition perceived higher levels of contingent rewarding behavior than those in the transformational condition (<italic>M</italic> = 5.74 vs. 5.30; <italic>F</italic>(1,123) = 8.98, <italic>p</italic> = .00). On the other hand, participants in the transformational condition perceived higher levels of the following behaviors than participants in the transactional condition: intellectual stimulation (<italic>M</italic> = 5.81 vs. 4.81; <italic>F</italic>(1,123) = 20.34, <italic>p</italic> = .00), individualized consideration (<italic>M</italic> = 6.15 vs. 5.23; <italic>F</italic>(1,123) = 22.42, <italic>p</italic> = .00), and inspirational motivation (<italic>M</italic> = 5.97 vs. 5.30; <italic>F</italic>(1,123) = 13.49, <italic>p</italic> = .00). Participants in the transformational condition were also more likely to idealize their leader (<italic>M</italic> = 5.54 vs. 5.00; <italic>F</italic>(1,123) = 4.63, <italic>p</italic> = .03). These results indicate successful leadership manipulation.</p>
<p>The leaders in our study were confederates appointed by us. One may ask whether we are studying leadership or appointmentship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112462061">Baruch, 1998</xref>). Appointed leaders often use coercive or reward power rather than referent power. While the leaders in our study were given the title of group leader and were appointed, they did not have any reward or coercive power. The leaders were introduced as facilitators who would guide the group through their task rather than as someone who had a say in the credit that participants received for their participation. The leaders had to resort to referent power in order to influence the participants. The scale that we employed to measure the idealized influence of leaders in the study indicates their referent power. In both the transactional and transformational conditions, the mean levels of idealized influence (<italic>M</italic> = 5.00 and 5.54), were significantly greater than 4 (<italic>t</italic> = 6.85 and 11.01; <italic>p</italic> = .00), the midpoint of the measurement scale which may indicate ambivalence about whether or not the leader had referent power. This alleviates concerns that we may be studying appointmentship rather than leadership.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis about the interaction between leadership style and communication medium (Hypothesis 1) was based on the idea that SL would lead to greater focus on individual characteristics than IM because it provides more individuating information about participants. It was also based on the idea that a transformational leader would highlight the team to a greater extent than a transactional leader. A 7-point item on the post-test questionnaire measured the extent to which participants felt that they could identify others in their groups. Another 7-point item measured the extent to which participants sensed being with other people during their discussion. According to the results of nested ANOVA, members of SL groups reported higher ability to identify others in their group than the members of IM groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .02). Additionally, participants led by a transformational leader reported a greater sense of being with others than those led by a transactional leader (<italic>p</italic> = .05). Thus, it appears that both SL and transformational leadership created some of the precursors expected to lead to the interaction effect described in Hypothesis 1.</p>

<title>Tests of Hypotheses</title>
<p>Hypotheses were tested using PLS implemented in Smart PLS. As is customary when dummy variables are used in regression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112462061">Aiken, West, &amp; Reno, 1991</xref>), the term representing the interaction between leadership and communication medium was created by multiplying the original indicator values rather than the mean centered values. In addition to the hypothesized paths, the PLS model also consisted of paths from leadership style, communication medium, and various covariates to dependent variables as noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601112462061">Figure 2</xref>, which depicts the salient constructs and paths in our model. The study’s sample size satisfies the traditional recommendation, which suggests a sample size that at least equals or exceeds 5 times, or preferably, 10 times the largest number of structural paths leading to a latent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059601112462061">Chin, 1997</xref>). In our model, the greatest number of paths leading to a variable was 4, thereby requiring a sample size of at least 20, or preferably, 40. With a sample size of 34, our PLS analysis exceeds the minimum sample size required and approaches the preferable sample size required. For all multi-indicator construct, their indicators were modeled reflectively. In the case of feedback positivity, the indicator for negative feedback was multiplied by −1 to ensure a positive factor loading and appropriate calculation of composite reliability. To examine path significance, we used bootstrapping with 500 samples.</p>

In addition to the paths depicted above, there are four sets of control paths from (a) communication condition and leadership condition to decision quality, task time, discussion satisfaction, social presence, group cohesion, group efficacy, and consensus, (b) group size to discussion satisfaction, group cohesion, and group efficacy, (c) prediscussion decision quality to postdiscussion decision quality, and (4) prediscussion consensus to postdiscussion consensus and feedback positivity.

<p>Construct validity was determined via the widely used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) method for PLS (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112462061">Agarwal &amp; Karhanna, 2000</xref>). In PLS, indicators are explicitly made to load on the constructs they represent. The correlations between (a) the indicators and the construct they represent (factor loadings) and (b) the indicators and remaining constructs (cross-factor loadings) are then compared to partially confirm the appropriateness of the factor structure. For additional confirmation, the square root of each construct’s AVE is compared to its correlations with other constructs. The factor structure modeled in PLS is considered to be confirmed and showing convergent and discriminant validities if (a) the factor loadings of indicators exceed their cross-factor loadings, and (b) the square root of each construct’s AVE exceeds the magnitude of its correlations with other constructs. In all but one instance in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112462061">Table 2</xref>, we see that the factor loadings of indicators exceed their cross-factor loadings; the exception was indicator 2 of discussion satisfaction—its factor loading (.80) was less than its cross-factor loading on social presence (.82). In addition, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601112462061">Table 1</xref>, the square root of each construct’s AVE was greater than the magnitude of its correlation with other constructs. These assessments suggested sufficient construct validity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601112462061">Figure 2</xref> shows the path coefficients produced by PLS. Hypothesis 1 predicted an interaction effect: transformational leadership condition was expected to be more effective at promoting feedback positivity than transactional leadership in the IM condition than in the SL condition. A significant negative interaction effect of leadership and communication conditions on feedback positivity was observed (β = −.67; <italic>t</italic> = 2.12; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), suggesting that the relative effectiveness of transformational leadership over transactional leadership at promoting feedback positivity deteriorated in the SL condition relative to the IM condition. To study the interaction further, we followed an approach similar to simple effects analyses in ANOVA following a significant interaction effect: We graphed and analyzed the slopes representing the effects of leadership in IM and SL conditions. The graphing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1059601112462061">Figure 3</xref>) and analyses showed that transformational leadership led to greater feedback positivity than transactional leadership in the IM condition (β = .50; <italic>t</italic> = 2.28; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, for groups operating in SL, feedback positivity did not differ across transformational and transactional leadership conditions (β = −.05; <italic>t</italic> = 0.23; <italic>p</italic> = .82). Taken together, these results indicate that transformational leadership was more effective than transactional leadership at promoting feedback positivity in the IM condition than in the SL condition, thereby supporting Hypothesis 1.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601112462061">Figure 2</xref>, feedback positivity was positively related to discussion satisfaction (β = .57; <italic>t =</italic> 4.56; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and social presence (β = .36; <italic>t =</italic> 2.28; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), lending support to Hypotheses 2 and 3. Feedback positivity was also positively related to group cohesion (β = .62; <italic>t =</italic> 5.56; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and group efficacy (β = .49; <italic>t =</italic> 3.97; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), thus showing support for Hypotheses 4 and 5. Hypothesis 6 was not supported as there was no significant effect of feedback positivity on consensus (β = .12; <italic>t =</italic> .55). A significant negative relationship was found between feedback positivity and decision quality (β = −.38; <italic>t =</italic> 2.49; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), lending support for Hypothesis 7. Lastly, Hypothesis 8 received support with feedback positivity having a negative relationship with task time (β = −.31; <italic>t =</italic> 2.33; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>Since perfect balance of leader gender could not be achieved within the final 34 groups that provided the data for analyses, we tested our model again after including a new construct using a dummy indicator to model the gender of the leader (0 = male, 1 = female) and a path from it to feedback positivity. That path was insignificant (β = .12; <italic>t =</italic> .68; <italic>p</italic> = .50) and including it did not affect any other results in the model.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Results supported the expected interaction effect between leadership condition and communication condition on feedback positivity. For groups supported by IM, transformational leadership led to greater feedback positivity than transactional leadership whereas for groups supported by SL, there was little difference in feedback positivity under transactional and transformational leadership. The results suggest that in the IM condition, where cues about individual characteristics were limited, transformational leadership was successful in encouraging positive group interaction.</p>
<p>Results also supported all but one hypothesis about the effects of feedback positivity on team outcomes. Greater feedback positivity was positively associated with social presence, discussion satisfaction, group cohesion, group efficacy, and decision-making speed. It was negatively associated with decision quality. Hypothesis 6, which proposed that feedback positivity would be positively related to consensus, was not supported. We had argued that positivity toward others would promote consensus by promoting the feeling of “togetherness”. Since feeling “together” is reflected in social presence, perhaps the effect of feedback positivity on consensus occurs via its effect on social presence. A significant correlation of .51 between social presence and postdiscussion consensus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601112462061">Table 1</xref>) lends support to this possibility.</p>
<p>Our results extend the leadership literature by suggesting that leadership effects in virtual teams are not universal and are contingent on communication media. Specifically, the effect of transformational leadership on promoting teamwork in virtual teams is more likely to occur in a medium that hides individuating cues. A medium like SL may mute the effect of a transformational leader by highlighting individual differences via the visual channel and de-emphasizing group identity. Thus, our results add to findings of recent research on leadership in virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112462061">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112462061">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601112462061">Purvanova &amp; Bono, 2009</xref>), which suggest that the context in which virtual teams operate may interact with leadership effects, by examining how leadership effects in virtual teams vary across different communication media. The results also add to the virtual worlds literature by highlighting the possibility that the extra visual and audio information available in a virtual world may make individual differences more salient and interfere with transformational leaders’ ability to facilitate teamwork.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that leaders should be cautious with their choice of media. Virtual worlds may be new and exciting, but it does not mean that they will automatically work better for a virtual team. Future research should pay attention to developing further understanding of how the extra visual and audio information provided by a virtual world may influence teamwork. Such an understanding is likely to enable more effective use of virtual worlds.</p>
<p>This study makes a contribution to the positivity literature as well. Much of the existing positivity literature focuses on the consequences of positive communication and interactions in teams, with limited exploration of the antecedents of a positive state (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112462061">Fredrickson &amp; Losada, 2005</xref>). We extend this literature by looking at how leadership, as one of the potential contributing factors, affects positivity. Additionally, our study examined consequences of positivity in peer feedback not reported in past studies, such as social presence, group cohesion, group efficacy, decision quality, and task time.</p>
<p>Our study contributes to the positivity literature also by showing that positivity may not be universally beneficial in the short run. Results demonstrated while feedback positivity positively influenced discussion satisfaction, social presence, group cohesion, group efficacy, and task completion speed, it negatively influenced decision quality. These results are not necessarily inconsistent with the positivity literature and they may be suggestive of the role of time in realizing the benefits of positivity on the quality of a team’s outcomes. Positivity may ultimately benefit quality by first helping the team build its resources—specifically, by building the inclination and the capability of the team to work together and effectively harness what they have to offer.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that feedback positivity matters for team outcomes, including team output (decision quality and task time), future capability (cohesion and group efficacy), and member experience (social presence and discussion satisfaction). Virtual team leaders should, therefore, make efforts to ensure that the virtual team environment is supportive. It is important for team leaders to understand different leadership styles and their interaction with communication media. For a team using SL or a similar virtual world, there is little difference in feedback positivity when a leader is transformational or transactional. However, for a team using IM, transformational leadership should be preferred over transactional leadership for promoting positive communication within a team.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>The conclusions of this study should be tempered with an understanding of the conditions in which this study is conducted. While the use of a laboratory experiment involving students enabled control over key variables, we should be cautious about the contexts to which our results can be generalized. Specifically, the results are likely to apply to teams with members who are not well acquainted with one another and are made to interact synchronously over electronic media for a short-term decision-making task. Besides short-term settings, virtual teams come together for longer periods of time and for multiple interactions in organizations to make decisions. Future research can look at the longitudinal effects of leadership styles in such teams.</p>
<p>The results would also generalize to teams that use icebreakers, which take on a different quality in SL versus IM. People in SL can see each other and can take physical action during icebreakers. Additionally, although the teams employed SL and AIM, voice capabilities offered by these tools were not used. While using these services without the voice capabilities is common, the use of alternate services and/or different features could potentially alter the results that we obtained in this study.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, we believe that this study elucidates how leadership style and communication media interact to influence feedback positivity and team outcomes in computer-mediated contexts. Due to the increasing interest in leadership and use of electronic communication media in organizations around the world, continued research seems timely and warranted.</p>
