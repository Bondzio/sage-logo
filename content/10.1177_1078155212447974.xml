<abstract>
<p>A cost–benefit analysis was carried out to determine the potential economic costs and benefits of pharmaceutical analysis in preventing prescribing errors for full standardized injectable antineoplastic drugs computerized physician order entry, in a pharmaceutical unit (University teaching hospital), compared with theoretical setting with no pharmaceutical analysis. The viewpoint is that of the payer or the French national Public Health Insurance system, and is limited to hospital cost (only direct medical costs related to net cost and net benefit. A decision analysis model was performed to compare two strategies: with pharmaceutical analysis (±pharmacy intervention) and without pharmaceutical analysis. Results are expressed in terms of benefit-to-cost <italic>ratio</italic> and total benefit. The robustness of the results was assessed through a series of one-way sensitivity analyses. Over 1 year, prescribing error incidence was estimated at 1.5% [1.3–1.7], i.e. 218 avoided prescribing errors. Potential avoidance of hospital stay was estimated at 419 days or 1.9 ± 0.3 days per prescribing error. Cost–benefit analysis could estimate a net benefit-to-cost ratio of 33.3 (€17.34/€0.52) and a total benefit at €16.82 per pharmaceutical analysis or €249,844 per year. The sensitivity analysis showed robustness of results. Our study shows a substantial economic benefit of pharmaceutical analysis and intervention in the prevention of prescribing errors. The clinical pharmacist adds both value and economic benefit, making it possible to avoid additional use of expensive antineoplastic drugs and hospitalization. Computerized physician order entry of antineoplastic drugs improves the relevance of clinical pharmacist interventions, expanding pharmaceutical analysis and also the role of the pharmacist.</p>

<p>In the optimal context of CPOE of standardized antineoplastic drugs, a prospective study previously estimated the incidence of prescribing errors (PEs) at 15 errors per 1000 prescribing medication orders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155212447974">26</xref></sup> PE are defined as any abnormality occurring in the prescription process and detected by pharmacists during pharmaceutical analysis and confirmed by clinical pharmacy intervention. In this study, identified PE was considered to have potentially significant/very significant clinical impact in 62.9% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155212447974">26</xref></sup> A potentially fatal event was avoided in 3.7% cases. Pharmaceutical analysis therefore appears to be useful. Although the resulting risk is low, economic considerations should nonetheless be taken into account.</p>
<p>Thus, a cost–benefit analysis was carried out to determine the potential economic costs and benefits of pharmaceutical analysis in preventing PE in a pharmaceutical unit for full standardized injectable antineoplastic drugs CPOE (current strategy) compared to a setting with no pharmaceutical analysis (theoretical strategy).</p>

<sec id="sec2-1078155212447974" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1078155212447974"><title>Setting</title>
<p>Besançon University Hospital is the regional referral centre in oncology for the Franche-Comté region in eastern France. Drug order entry is fully computerized for injectable chemotherapy prescriptions, from the medical office to the centralized pharmaceutical unit in charge of antineoplastic drug preparation. BPC® software (acronym for bonnes pratiques de chimiothérapie, meaning good use of chemotherapy) was implemented for routine use in 2003. In our hospital, all injectable antineoplastic treatments are prescribed through this system. This software tool development requires the competence of a multidisciplinary staff. The project was supported by grants and public health resources. BPC® includes a specific thesaurus per tumour for all available antineoplastic treatments. This thesaurus resulted from a regional consensus meeting involving every physician authorized to treat cancer patients.</p>
<p>The therapeutic strategy decision and initiation systematically come from a multidisciplinary committee. A senior physician begins the antineoplastic treatment, then may or may not choose to delegate the next prescribing medication order to resident physicians.</p>
<p>Computerized prescribing medication order, including doses and administration procedure (route, infusion timing and duration and fluid) for each antineoplastic drug, is carried out and then validated by a referent physician. The computerized antineoplastic treatments could include a single antineoplastic drug or a combination, given on 1 day or on several days. All calculations (drug dose according to weight, body surface area or the Calvert/Chatelut formula) are automated at each step by the CPOE system. Each prescribing medication order is secured by multiple alarms: dose variation between two courses, exceeding maximal and cumulative doses, unexpected values of weight or size or body surface area, improbable interval between two prescriptions, etc. Physicians, like pharmacists, have full access to each patient’s past treatment history.</p>
<p>The prescribing medication order is transferred from the physician’s office to the centralized pharmaceutical unit by the computerized network and linked to a drug card-index (preparation procedures, concentration of active solution and incompatibilities). Before preparation, each prescribing medication order is reviewed by a pharmacist, according to a standardized process. The pharmacist checks and validates all the following items:
<list id="list1-1078155212447974" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>items related to patient characteristics: sex, age, size, weight, body surface area and serum creatinine;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>items related to prescribing medication order: accordance between disease stage and antineoplastic treatment selection, choice of prescribed schedule, modified or unchanged with regard to the previous cycle and expected interval between two cycles;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>items related to the dose: change between two cycles, exceeding the maximum or cumulative dose, renewal loading dose (yes or no), no renewal of previous modification; a dose may be modified up to a 2.5% limit to facilitate the preparation; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>items related to treatment setting: day ward or hospitalization.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1078155212447974"><title>Prescribing error</title>
<p>A PE was defined as any abnormality occurring in the prescription process and discovered by pharmacists. Then, prescribing physicians (resident or senior) were contacted to check and to confirm their prescriptions. In case of error, the computerized prescription medical order was corrected. Inter-observer reliability was not evaluated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1078155212447974"><title>Potential clinical impact</title>
<p>The potential clinical impact of each medication error was scored using a validated scale at four levels proposed by Hatoum et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078155212447974">27</xref></sup> This scale assesses the potential clinical impact of medication errors avoided by the pharmacist’s intervention: (a) no potential impact, (b) significant potential impact (increase of effectiveness and/or security and/or quality of life), (c) very significant potential impact (preventing organ dysfunction and/or an intensive medical surveillance and/or an irreversible sequela) and (d) vital potential impact (avoiding a potentially fatal accident).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1078155212447974"><title>Data</title>
<p>All consecutive medication orders prescribed from 1 February 2007 to 31 January 2008 were analysed prospectively (pharmaceutical analysis) in real-time by a resident pharmacist or assistant pharmacist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155212447974">26</xref></sup> Thus, among the 14,854 prescriptions studied, a pharmacist intervened in 459 cases (3.1%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212447974">2</xref></sup> 8–3.4]): 241 prescribing medication orders were confirmed and 218 included one medication error (prescribing error).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1078155212447974"><title>Decision analysis model</title>
<p>A cost–benefit analysis of pharmaceutical analysis in preventing PE related to injectable antineoplastic drugs was performed to compare two strategies:
<list id="list2-1078155212447974" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>current strategy, with pharmaceutical analysis of prescription, related to a probability of clinical pharmacy intervention, then probabilities of PE and type of clinical impact, then a probability of hospitalization (branch 1 to 17) and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>theoretical strategy, without pharmaceutical analysis, i.e. cost and benefit (branch 18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155212447974">Figure 1</xref>).
</p></list-item>
</list>
<fig id="fig1-1078155212447974" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Decision analysis tree to assess the cost–benefit of the prevention of PEs related to injectable antineoplastic drugs. PE: prescribing errors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1078155212447974-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The chosen viewpoint is that of the payer, the French national public health insurance system and it is limited to hospital cost (such as expensive antineoplastic drugs and hospitalization). The model is based only on direct medical costs (in Euros (€)) related to cost and benefit.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1078155212447974"><title>Cost or pharmaceutical cost</title>
<p>Cost is the pharmaceutical cost, defined as the monetary value of the time-investment by the pharmacy staff to prevent PE related to injectable antineoplastic drugs (official tariff 2007 salary). The pharmaceutical analysis was carried out by either a resident pharmacist (salary of €33,700, i.e. average hourly salary of €18.72) or an assistant pharmacist (salary of €49,980, i.e. average hourly salary of €30.33).</p>
<p>From 1 February 2007 to 31 January 2008, the time-investment by the pharmacy staff was measured prospectively for each pharmaceutical analysis with clinical pharmacy intervention. Because the number of pharmaceutical analyses without clinical pharmacy intervention is very high, the time-investment by the pharmacy staff for pharmaceutical analysis without clinical pharmacy intervention was prospectively measured in February 2008, after choosing a random sample of 100 pharmacy analyses without clinical pharmacy intervention.</p>
<p>Thus, the cost or pharmaceutical cost was calculated and associated at each branch of the decision analysis model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1078155212447974"><title>Benefit or medical cost</title>
<p>Benefit is the medical cost, derived from the monetary values of the potential clinical consequence of avoided PE: avoided cost of expensive antineoplastic drugs (e.g. cetuximab 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> instead of cetuximab 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), overcost of expensive antineoplastic drugs (e.g. bevacizumab 10 mg/kg instead of 15 mg/kg) and avoided cost of hospitalization.</p>
<p>First, potential clinical consequence was evaluated for each avoided PE. For this, two independent referral panels of physicians using the CPOE in our hospital and agreeing to participate in our study were created: six medical oncologists for avoiding PE related to a solid tumour and two haematologists, one of whom has a dual competency in haematology and paediatrics, for malignant haemopathy. Each physician evaluated the potential clinical consequence, according to the avoided PE and the medical history of patient, in terms of:
<list id="list3-1078155212447974" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>probability of hospitalization in the absence of clinical pharmacist intervention, expressed in percentage (five categories: 0% (i.e. no possibility of hospitalization), 0.01–30.00%, 30.01–60.00%, 60.01– 99.99%, 100.00%), length, ward (day ward, conventional hospitalization and intensive care unit);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>main and/or associated complications: neutropenia, anaemia, fever, mucositis, etc; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>primary medical measures and treatment: chemotherapy, transfusion, etc.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>After discussion between each panel, and in case of disagreement, a consensus was reached for each PE in case of disagreement.</p>
<p>Second, avoided costs of hospitalization were estimated by simulation, using the French public Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) prospective payment system. National hospitalization rates are fixed by decree for every DRG of stay; but these rates do not take into account the cost of expensive antineoplastic drugs (official tariff 2007–2008 of drugs). The simulation includes the following for (a) care in day ward or (b) hospital admission: (a) <italic>day ward</italic>: a main diagnosis (e.g. chemotherapy) and a related diagnosis (e.g. lung cancer), (b) <italic>hospitalization</italic>: type (conventional hospitalization or intensive care unit), a main diagnosis (e.g. neutropenia), a related diagnosis (e.g. lung cancer) and one or more associated diagnoses (e.g. mucositis and fever) and length of hospital stay. The simulation produces a DRG representing the cost of financing the medical activity according to the case-mix-based payment.</p>
<p>Thus, the benefit or medical benefit was calculated and associated at each branch of the decision analysis model.</p>

<p>Because this decision analysis model is based on a single study, and to account for the uncertainty of key estimates and assumptions made during the identification, measurement and evaluation of costs and outcomes, it is important to evaluate the robustness of the results. The robustness of the results was assessed through a series of one-way sensitivity analyses:
<list id="list4-1078155212447974" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>varying the pharmacy staff salary by ±30%;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>applying only the hourly salary of an assistant pharmacist (€30.33) or senior pharmacist (€63.25);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>pooling the probability of hospitalization into three classes instead of five: 0.00%, 0.01–60.00%, 60.01–100.00%; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>pooling the potential clinical impact of avoided PE into two classes: clinical impact (significant, very significant and vital) versus no clinical impact.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The uncertainty of the actual cost–benefit gained by analysing pharmaceutical analysis input in the prevention of PE was addressed with a probabilistic analysis involving second-order Monte Carlo simulations of 1000 trials (i.e. draws from probability distributions given to key model parameters).</p>

<sec id="sec14-1078155212447974" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 218 potential PE, 145 (66.6%) of which would have had a significant, very significant or vital clinical impact, were avoided due to pharmaceutical analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155212447974">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec15-1078155212447974"><title>Cost</title>
<p>Pharmaceutical analysis was mainly carried out by a resident pharmacist (185 days of the 250 annual workdays, i.e. 74% of the time). When absent, the resident pharmacist was replaced by an assistant pharmacist (65 days, i.e. 26% of the time). Taking into account this distribution and the salaries of both the resident pharmacist and the assistant pharmacist, an average hourly salary was estimated at €21.74.</p>
<p>During the study period, average time-investment of the pharmacy staff for only pharmacy analysis was estimated at 328.3 h: 1.0 min per pharmaceutical analysis without intervention (€0.36), 14.7 and 8.7 min per clinical pharmacy intervention, respectively, with (€5.33) and without PE (€3.15). There are no significant differences in time between the resident pharmacist and the assistant pharmacist, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.60, <italic>p</italic> = 0.07 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.14. Thus, the overall cost was estimated at €7137.</p>

<p>Some examples showing the potential benefit of preventing PE are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078155212447974">Table 2</xref>.

<p>In the context of computerized prescribing of standardized injectable chemotherapy schedules, the risk of prescribing error exists, as previously shown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155212447974">26</xref></sup>. Pharmaceutical analysis was deemed to be necessary, and potentially critical events were subsequently avoided by pharmaceutical analysis and interventions (3.7%). The clinical pharmacist adds both value and economic benefit, making it possible to avoid additional use of expensive antineoplastic drugs and hospitalization, but at a cost, in terms of time-investment by the pharmacy staff. Therefore, the relation between benefit and cost must be analysed.</p>
<p>This study was conducted in a teaching hospital over a 1 year period. It assesses the potential cost–benefit of preventing PE related to injectable antineoplastic drugs. Interestingly, to our knowledge, no study has yet been published on the subject of CPOE of injectable antineoplastic drugs. With a total benefit estimated at €249,844 per year for 2056 patients, it is clear that preventing PE using hospital pharmaceutical analysis provides greater benefits than the costs related to net time-investment. With a benefit–cost ratio greater than 1 (33.3) pharmaceutical analysis is worth implementing. These results are robust. In fact, different sensitivity analyses accounting for the uncertainty of key estimates and assumption made during the identification, measurement and evaluation of costs and outcomes confirmed the robustness: a mean total benefit of €16.80 ± 7.19 [−10.43 to 70.04] per pharmaceutical analysis or for 1 year a total benefit of €249,547 ± 106,800 [−154,927 to 1,040,374]. The results of sensitivity analyses support our conclusion suggesting that the benefit exceeds the cost with a positive total benefit. With the contribution of a team made up of three clinical pharmacists and six physicians, bias costs and outcomes were reduced because they were not dependent on the skills and competence of a single clinical pharmacist.</p>
<p>In the Van Den Bemt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078155212447974">28</xref></sup> study, cost was defined as the monetary value of the time-investment by the pharmacy staff minus that of the time-investment saved in the nursing staff. In the DRG system, nurses’ salaries are already included along with the cost of inexpensive drugs. This explains why these data were not collected and incorporated into cost or benefit. The hourly salaries of an assistant pharmacist and a senior pharmacist were estimated, on average, at €15.43 and €51.28, respectively.</p>
<p>The design of our cost–benefit analysis is original, taking into account clinical impact and probability of hospitalization. This is especially true because, as a rule, when hospital resources are used or can be avoided, the resulting cost (benefit) rarely includes the cost of preventive measures (time-investment by the pharmacy staff).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078155212447974">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078155212447974"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078155212447974">30</xref></sup> It is debatable whether or not this study results may be compared with those obtained in the literature. Economic evaluations of clinical pharmacy interventions have been reviewed by De Rijdt et al;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078155212447974">28</xref></sup> they systematically evaluate the existing literature in an attempt to update the pharmacoeconomic benefit of clinical pharmacist services. Most economic evaluations of clinical pharmacy interventions suffer from a number of methodological limitations relating to the absence of a control group without clinical pharmacist intervention. Among 21 studies included in a literature review, four studies deal with prevention of adverse drugs and PE, two with cost–benefit analyses and two with cost–effectiveness analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212447974">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212447974">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078155212447974">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078155212447974">30</xref></sup> These studies take place in general or university teaching hospital settings, within general medicine or medical intensive care units. Three studies demonstrate a reduction in preventable adverse drug events as a result of clinical pharmacist intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212447974">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212447974">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078155212447974">30</xref></sup> The results of cost–benefit analyses suggest that clinical pharmacy interventions are associated with cost savings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078155212447974">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078155212447974">30</xref></sup> The authors of these studies conclude that preventing PE by hospital pharmacy staff results in higher benefits than the costs related to net time-investment. Our findings confirm these results, but in a different context.</p>
<p>The results of this study need to be viewed within its limited context. First, only PE identified by a pharmacist were taken into account, thus excluding: (a) the medication error not identified by a pharmacist, and which can, therefore never be identified <italic>a posteriori</italic> by a pharmacist or prescribing physician, potentially leading to further need of expensive antineoplastic drugs and/or hospitalization, (b) additional therapies (oral antineoplastic drugs, antiemetics, corticosteroids, etc.) and hydratation and (c) errors occurring during the preparation process in the centralized pharmaceutical unit in charge of antineoplastic drug preparation. Second, the fact that this study was carried out in a single teaching hospital with its own specific organization limits the extrapolation of the above findings to other hospitals. Third, indirect costs of production losses and intangible costs, such as those related to pain and suffering, were not included in our analysis.</p>

<p>In a large teaching hospital that serves as an oncology referral centre, CPOE of injectable antineoplastic drugs improves the relevance of clinical pharmacist interventions, expanding pharmaceutical analysis and the role of the pharmacist to ensure the proper use of drugs. The PE incidence was estimated at 1.5% [1.3–1.7], with a significant or very significant potential clinical impact in 62.9% of cases. The clinical pharmacist adds both value and economic benefit, making it possible to avoid additional use of expensive antineoplastic drugs and hospitalization, for only a minor cost, in terms of time-investment by the pharmacy staff.</p>
