<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aortopulmonary window (APW) is a rare congenital cardiac malformation that may occur in isolation or in association with other lesions, often involving the aortic arch. Left untreated, there is rapid progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension and death.<sup>

</sup> We report an unusual combination with the absence of  intrapericardial left pulmonary artery (LPA), with all the cardiac output perforce entering the right lung.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 2-month-old male child presented with tachypnea, increased chest retractions, poor feeding, and bluish discoloration of the lips that increased on crying. The symptoms had been present since birth. On examination, the baby appeared pale, with a respiratory rate of 42 breaths per minute, heart rate of 174 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 86/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry revealed a systemic saturation of 84%. Fine crepitations were audible bilaterally on auscultation of the chest. Examination of the cardiovascular system revealed a loud second heart sound, which was narrowly split. A loud systolic murmur was present in the second intercostal space along the left sternal border. The liver was palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin. Chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly, with a cardiothoracic ratio of 0.6. The volume of the left lung was markedly reduced when compared to that of the right lung. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed dilation of the pulmonary trunk and a large APW, along with a small defect in the floor of the oval fossa. There were signs of severe pulmonary hypertension, but biventricular function was normal. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography showed a right aortic arch, with mirror-imaged branching. It confirmed the presence of the large APW, with dilation of the pulmonary trunk, and mosaic perfusion of both lung fields was suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension. There was no evidence of an intrapericardial LPA, the pulmonary trunk continuing as the right pulmonary artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135112436612">Figure 1</xref>). Minimal emphysematous changes were noted in lingula and anterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung. The diagnosis prior to surgery was a large APW with absent LPA and a defect within the oval fossa. Detailed analysis of the CT images had failed to reveal any additional source of arterial supply to the left lung. Cardiac catheterization was not performed because the diagnosis was established on the CT angiography and there was no doubt about the operability.</p>

<p>The surgical approach was through a standard median sternotomy. The brachiocephalic vein was absent, and there were separate right and left superior caval veins. Intraoperative findings confirmed the presence of usual atrial arrangement, concordant atrioventricular, and ventriculoarterial connections, normally related great arteries, normal systemic and pulmonary venous drainage, and a left-sided heart with the apex pointing to the left. The left atrium and left ventricle were enlarged. The aorta was dilated, and was to the right and posterior of the dilated and tense pulmonary trunk. The pulmonary trunk continued as the right pulmonary artery, with no evidence found for the LPA, no fibrous remnant being seen at its anticipated site. There was a large window, with a diameter of 1.5 cm, between the intrapericardial arterial trunks. The pulmonary trunk was tense and the measured pressure was 110/74 mm Hg against a systemic pressure of 106/80 mm Hg.  Cardiopulmonary bypass was established by aortobicaval cannulation, with core cooling to 28°C. The right pulmonary artery was snugged to prevent runoff into the right lung and fully mobilized. A careful search in the hilum of the hypoplastic left lung failed to demonstrate any remnant of the LPA, nor was there any sign of a left-sided arterial ligament. After applying the aortic cross-clamp and delivering cardioplegia, the aorta was opened transversely, revealing the presence of the large communication between the arterial trunks well above the sinutubular junctions, with separate and normally formed aortic and pulmonary valves. The communication was closed with a Gore-Tex (WL Gore; Flagstaff, Arizona) patch using a continuous polypropylene suture. Following this, the aortotomy was closed and the remainder of the operation was completed in the usual manner. The pulmonary arterial pressure following termination of cardiopulmonary bypass was dropped to 74/52 mm Hg, against a systemic pressure of 100/60 mm Hg. Elective inotropic support consisted of dobutamine 5 mcg/kg/min and nitroglycerin 0.5 mcg/kg/min. Mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen was continued for 12 hours, followed by uneventful weaning from mechanical ventilatory support and uneventful postoperative recovery. More than two years after surgery, the patient is doing well, requiring no cardiac medications. Follow-up echocardiograms have revealed no evidence of residual pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our case is more of interest when studied from a morphologic point of view, as the surgical procedure was relatively simple. All the cardiac output was delivered to the right lung, with no evidence of any arterial supply to the left lung. In such situations, with the right pulmonary artery representing the continuation of the pulmonary trunk, it is expected that the discontinuous LPA would be fed by the arterial duct, which might become ligamentous. In a recent report<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112436612">5</xref>
</sup> describing 24 cases of APW managed over a period of 26 years, mention was made of one patient with the absence of LPA, albeit without any detailed morphologic description. Other than this report, to the best of our knowledge, this combination has not otherwise been mentioned in the available English medical literature. There is a specimen in the archive of Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, nonetheless, which shows discontinuous pulmonary arteries but with the hilar LPA in continuity with a left-sided arterial ligament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135112436612">Figure 2</xref>). In our case, there was no evidence of the left-sided duct, nor its ligamentous remnant, albeit that because of the mirror-imaged arterial branching, the duct, had it been present, would have originated from the left-sided brachiocephalic artery. It is also of interest that the brachiocephalic vein was also absent, although we can offer no explanation for this combination of findings.</p>

</fig>
<p>The pathogenesis of APW is also of interest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135112436612">6</xref>
</sup> The lesion is sometimes described as an “aortopulmonary septal defect,” but there is no logic in such a description since there is no aortopulmonary septum between the definitive intrapericardial arterial trunks. There is, however, transient formation of an aortopulmonary foramen during embryological development of the intrapericardial trunks distal to the sinutubular junctions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112436612">7</xref>
</sup> The APWs, with separate formation of the aortic and pulmonary valves, almost certainly represent persistence of this transient developmental foramen.</p>
