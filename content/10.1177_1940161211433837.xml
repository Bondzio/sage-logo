<abstract>
<p>Research shows that news coverage of protest groups that challenge the status quo treats them relatively critically. To develop a more precise understanding of such coverage, this study content analyzes an international set of newspapers (<italic>N</italic> = 220) to explore the relationships between a protest group’s goals and tactics on resulting news coverage. The findings indicate that a group’s tactics—more than its goals—play a substantial role in affecting coverage. Furthermore, the findings also show that the protest issue and location indirectly affect coverage through their relationship to a group’s tactics. Implications for journalists and protesters alike are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>A recent surge in protest activity has stretched across many countries ranging from antigovernment protesters in Iran, Libya, and Egypt to protests of labor and political discontent in the United States. As contributors to the marketplace of ideas and an important impetus for progressive social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161211433837">Gamson 1990</xref>), the parties and viewpoints related to such protests deserve fair and balanced treatment from relevant news media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161211433837">Gurevitch and Blumler 1980</xref>). Given that protest movements elevate key issues on the social agenda and provide a voice to disenfranchised individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161211433837">McLeod and Hertog 1999</xref>), it would seem that not only would journalists pay particular attention to social protests but that they would dedicate effort to covering them as objectively as possible. However, a large body of research indicates that this is not the case. In fact, research shows that there are certain structural biases that produce a pattern of coverage known as the “protest paradigm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161211433837">Chan and Lee 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161211433837">McLeod and Hertog 1999</xref>). This pattern creates coverage that supports the status quo and disparages groups that challenge it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161211433837">Gitlin 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161211433837">McLeod and Hertog 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161211433837">Shoemaker 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>To the extent that this protest paradigm persists, the resultant structural bias against protesters compromises normative notions about objective journalism and its role in providing a fair marketplace of ideas. Moreover, there is evidence that journalists may not even treat all protest groups equally, subjecting them to frames that marginalize them from mainstream society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161211433837">McLeod 1999</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161211433837">Shoemaker (1984)</xref> found that more radical groups, which often present greater challenges to the status quo, were treated more unfavorably than more moderate groups. To identify the degree to which a group challenges that status quo, we must distinguish between the <italic>goals</italic> and the <italic>tactics</italic> of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161211433837">Boyle and Armstrong 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1940161211433837">McLeod 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161211433837">McLeod and Hertog 1999</xref>). A protest group’s goals may range from maintaining the status quo to moderate reform to radical social change, and tactics refer to the actions taken by a protest group to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>This study examines how the radicality of a protest group’s goals and tactics affects the news coverage it receives by content analyzing stories from thirteen newspapers from North America, East Asia, and the Middle East. In doing so, we also consider the protest issue and location to further our understanding of protest coverage patterns. Ultimately, this paper provides key insights into explaining why some protests are treated less favorably than others and reveals the extent to which the protest paradigm cuts across geographic and cultural lines.</p>

<title>Protest and the News Media</title>
<p>In the United States, groups including organized labor, abortion advocates and opponents, Civil Rights, Women’s, and antiwar movements have frequently turned to protest as a means of shaping political discourse, public opinion, and social policy. Recently, groups as diverse as the Tea Party and the Occupy movement have become visible through organized protests. Protest activity is not unique to the United States, however. European nations have experienced labor and economic protests, particularly in the wake of the recent economic downturn. Political unrest has spread throughout the Middle East in nations such as Egypt and Libya (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161211433837">“Egypt News: Timeline and Aftermath” 2011</xref>). Typically, these protests emerge when traditional forms of political engagement are not effective. Ultimately, however, such protests not only help advance issues but also make for interesting news coverage as journalists are drawn to conflict.</p>
<p>Given protest’s important contributions to social change, it is imperative for researchers to understand how journalistic processes might inhibit their influence. Protest groups play important roles in elevating issues onto the political agenda, providing critical feedback to various social institutions, encouraging social reforms, and enhancing the diversity of the marketplace of ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161211433837">McLeod and Hertog 1999</xref>). As such, protest and the quality of coverage that it receives are important indicators of the vitality of a democracy.</p>
<p>Protest news coverage is shaped by factors ranging from the biases of individual journalists, to the norms and practices of the news industry to the ideology of professions and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161211433837">Gans 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1940161211433837">Shoemaker and Reese 1996</xref>). Such factors have been shown to constrain the news diversity by giving more prominence to mainstream sources, while marginalizing or ignoring others (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161211433837">Brown 1979</xref>). Typically, journalists ignore radical social groups, unless the groups employ extreme tactics that attract media attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161211433837">Armstrong 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161211433837">Demers and Viswanath 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161211433837">Boykoff (2006)</xref> suggests that the need to gain media attention often escalates the extremity of tactics. However, as noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161211433837">Gitlin’s (1980)</xref> landmark book <italic>The Whole World Is Watching</italic>, the use of such extremist tactics tends to produce negative coverage.</p>
<p>In one of the first studies demonstrating the linkage between the nature of a protest group and its media coverage, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161211433837">Shoemaker (1984)</xref> found that when journalists perceived groups to be more extreme or radical, they were more likely to marginalize those groups in subsequent news coverage. Subsequent research has shown that radical groups, whose goals and tactics threaten the status quo, are more likely to trigger coverage that adheres more closely to the protest paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161211433837">McLeod and Hertog 1999</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161211433837">McLeod’s (1999)</xref> study of the “Right to Party” movement revealed that mainstream media repeatedly used disparaging labels to describe protesters, emphasized norm violations, and focused on their clashes with police rather than their issues.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful elements of the protest paradigm is the way in which protest news stories are framed. Framing researchers examine how news construction decisions affect the meaning of news stories as certain aspects of stories are emphasized over others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161211433837">Entman 1993</xref>). Framing decisions shape and define issues, giving structure and meaning to news events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433837">Gamson and Modigliani 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1940161211433837">Reese (2001)</xref> contends that frames not only organize issues but also help audience members make sense of the world around them. Ultimately, frames become as much defined by what is included within the frame as what is excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161211433837">Gitlin 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161211433837">Hertog and McLeod 1995</xref>). As such, the frames that are used to organize news stories can have a powerful influence on how audience members perceive issues and parties to a conflict, including perceptions of protesters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161211433837">McLeod 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161211433837">McLeod and Detenber 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The structural factors that shape news production make it difficult for protesters to control the nature of message framing. For example, when newspapers report on local politics, elected officials are given an ex-officio voice that allows them influence over media frames. By contrast, journalistic practices often limit the influence of challenging voices over the resultant messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161211433837">Hug and Wisler 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161211433837">Oliver and Maney 2000</xref>). As a result, protest story frames often emphasize violence, lawlessness, and events rather than issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161211433837">McLeod 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161211433837">McLeod and Hertog 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, protesters face a difficult challenge. News coverage is important to achieving protest goals, yet such coverage may not be forthcoming unless protesters engage in dramatic and even violent action. However, those very actions that attract media attention are often central features of stories that delegitimize the protesters. While there is some evidence to show that more radical goals and more extreme tactics are likely to be important determinants of adherence to the protest paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161211433837">McLeod and Hertog 1999</xref>), it is important to reveal other factors that lead news media to treat some protest groups differently than others. The current study considers several factors.</p>
<p>First, the protest issue may affect the nature of coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161211433837">Boyle et al. 2004</xref>). Most studies have focused on a single protest type—for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161211433837">Gitlin (1980)</xref> and the SDS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161211433837">Chan and Lee (1984)</xref> and the Golden Jubilee protests, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161211433837">Boyle and Armstrong (2009)</xref> and abortion protests—making comparison difficult. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161211433837">Boyle et al. (2004)</xref> content analyzed a broad cross section of protests, finding that war protests (relative to social and labor protests) produced coverage that adhered most closely to the protest paradigm. For example, war protests were treated more critically and were less likely than social protest to use protesters as sources. Notably, war protests were most radical in their goals and most extreme in their tactics.</p>
<p>Second, the location of protests is also likely to affect the nature of coverage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1940161211433837">Wittebols (1996)</xref> suggested that the country of origin affects how protesters are treated. In essence, it is likely that communities/nations with more to lose or that are under more threat from protesters should see more critical coverage of radical protests. Work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161211433837">McCluskey et al. (2009)</xref> found that protests against the government in low-pluralism communities typically generated negative coverage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1940161211433837">Wolfsfeld, Avraham, and Aburaiya (2000)</xref> showed that Jewish media were critical of Arab protests and tended to treat them critically and highlight violence. They further argue that this served to delegitimize Arab protesters by portraying them as violent even though they were generally engaging in peaceful demonstrations. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1940161211433837">Wittebols (1996)</xref> also found that the foreign policy position of a news agency’s home nation affected how those media treated protesters. For example, U.S. media tended to treat “protesters against adversary governments more favorably than friendly governments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1940161211433837">Wittebols 1996</xref>: 359). These findings further reinforce the social control function of the media and the integral role the media play in maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p>Systemic biases that favor the status quo may hamper the quality of social discourse and hinder an important impetus for positive social change. Ironically, citizens may intuitively realize the democratic significance of this observation when viewing conflicts in other areas of the world, but fail to recognize it domestically. Beyond the specific nature of coverage, however, exploration of news coverage demonstrates the differences in the nature of protest activity in the U.S. versus international locations. For instance, the U.S. has recently experienced fairly tame—yet sometimes rhetorically hostile—protests from both the Tea Party and the Labor movement. Internationally, however, the antigovernment clashes in Egypt, Libya, and other Middle East nations have been quite violent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161211433837">“Egypt News: Timeline and Aftermath” 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161211433837">Mackey 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It is likely then that both the type of protest and the location of the protest will have some bearing on the resulting news coverage. There are several reasons for this assertion. First, in areas of the world where more political unrest exists, protesters adopt more extreme goals of wholesale political change. These protests are a clear challenge to existing regimes, as exemplified in the 2011 Egyptian and Libyan protests. Both the extremity of goals and severity of tactics of these protests suggest a greater adherence to the protest paradigm. As such, it seems likely that news coverage of these events will be more critical than protests in North American countries, where most protest goals seeking political change tend to seek policy changes, such as health care reform. Furthermore, American protests may be less inclined to use violent tactics.</p>
<p>While protests, especially those that demand regime change, are often threatening to the political power structure of any system, the recent protests in the Middle East suggest that dictatorships and nondemocratic governments are often particularly hostile toward social protest. Furthermore, in many cases, such as Libya and Egypt, the political elites have considerable control over the news media even going so far as to block coverage of events or issues. Thus, it seems likely that protesters in these areas will be treated more harshly when challenging the status quo, particularly when compared to more democratic governments, such as those in North America. Media in these areas will likely treat protesters more critically in an attempt to maintain the status and delegitimize protesters.</p>
<p>As such, we state the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-1940161211433837" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1a</italic>: Protest type will affect media coverage such that war and political protests will be treated more critically than social-issue protests.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1b</italic>: Location of protest will affect media coverage such that foreign protests will be treated more critically than North American–based protests.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In all, the underlying theory behind the pattern of coverage known as the protest paradigm suggests that more extreme or radical protests will receive more critical coverage. The degree of extremism of a protest group is often referred to in the literature as the group’s “level of deviance,” a concept typically indicated by the extremity of the group’s goals and tactics. As such, groups with more radical goals (e.g., overturning existing law or governing structure) are considered more deviant than groups with more mundane goals (e.g., maintaining the status quo or existing policies). In addition, groups that employ more extreme tactics such as violence and civil disobedience are considered more deviant than groups who employ more peaceful or nondisruptive tactics such as sit-ins or vigils. It is likely then that more extreme goals and tactics should trigger the media’s social control function and lead to more critical treatment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161211433837">Boyle and Armstrong (2009)</xref> asserted that goals and tactics should be considered separately for their influence on news treatment of protesters. In the context of abortion protests, they found that protest tactics rather than goals were the stronger determinant of the nature of news content. As such, it did not matter whether pro-life protesters protested in support of or in opposition to the status quo as the nature of media coverage was more a function of the extremity of the protest tactics. When those tactics were more extreme, coverage was more critical. To ensure that the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161211433837">Boyle and Armstrong (2009)</xref> were not unique to the abortion issue, this study examines goals and tactics across a broader range of issues. However, because most past research fails to distinguish between goals and tactics in predicting that radical groups will be treated more critically, this study poses hypotheses for both goals and tactics.</p>
<list id="list2-1940161211433837" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2a</italic>: Groups with more deviant goals will be treated more critically.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2b</italic>: Groups with more deviant tactics will be treated more critically.</p></list-item></list>
<p>A final goal of this paper is to propose a more comprehensive model that includes goals, tactics, and news treatment in the context of other elements including the protest issue and location. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161211433837">Boyle and Armstrong’s (2009)</xref> study of abortion protests considered such a model and found variation in tactics to be the primary variable affecting news coverage. Furthermore, they found that variables such as news source, goals, and public opinion played little to no role in influencing coverage. As indicated, however, those findings may be unique to the abortion issue. Because the current study considers a wider range of factors and does so in an international context, the results will provide a clearer picture of how these variables work together to shape the nature of news coverage of social protest.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study used a content analysis of newspaper protest stories (<italic>N</italic> = 220) during a two-year period between 27 August 2007 and 27 August 2009. Stories were selected by a Lexis-Nexis search using the key word <italic>protester</italic> to search headlines of a geographically diverse—but purposive—sample of newspapers that employed English as the primary language.</p>
<p>In all, thirteen papers were selected to create the sampling frame. Four papers from Asia were selected, including the <italic>South China Morning Post, China Daily, The (Singapore) Straits Times</italic>, and <italic>The Nation</italic> (Thailand). North American papers included two Canadian papers—the <italic>Toronto Sun</italic> and the <italic>Toronto Star</italic> and four U.S. papers—<italic>The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times</italic>, and <italic>The Philadelphia Inquirer</italic>. Three papers were selected to represent the Middle East—<italic>Jerusalem Post, The Daily Star</italic>, and <italic>Gulf News</italic>. Although these papers do not represent an exhaustive list of available news coverage of protest events, their geographical and ideological diversity allow for an exploration of the influence of regional and cultural factors in addition to the influence of protest goals and tactics.</p>
<p>To be included in the sample, articles must have dealt directly with protest events or activities (not about planning or legal issues) and be longer than 400 words. Two trained coders evaluated 10% of the sample for reliability analysis (discussed below). Once acceptable reliability was obtained, the coders evaluated the remaining articles.</p>
<sec id="section4-1940161211433837">
<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-1940161211433837">
<title>Protester treatment</title>
<p>Two measures indicating the treatment of protesters were used. The first measured how favorable protesters were treated in the headlines of newspaper articles (α = .82; <italic>M</italic> = 2.89, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.71). The second item measured treatment of protesters in the body of the news article (α = .70; <italic>M</italic> = 3.28, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.12). Both items were coded on a 1 to 5 scale with 1 being <italic>opposes</italic> and 5 being <italic>favors</italic>. To make the evaluations of treatment of protesters, coders were trained to look for indicators of favorable and oppositional treatment including marginalizing frames and labels, mentions of failure or success, and whether articles focused on positive or negative characteristics of the protesters and their actions. Articles where nearly all paragraphs treated protesters critically received a score of 1. Cases where the numbers of paragraphs treating protesters critically and favorably was equal received a score of 3. Finally, cases where nearly all paragraphs treated protesters favorably received a score of 5.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1940161211433837">
<title>Goals and tactics</title>
<p>The extent to which groups pose a threat to the status quo is typically based on two factors: goals and tactics. The goals measure was an indicator of what the group was trying to accomplish and the extent to which that goal was a threat to the status quo (α = .77; <italic>M</italic> = 2.49, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.57). This item was measured using a scale from 1 to 3, with higher scores indicating that protest group goals were more extreme and therefore a greater threat to the status quo. Specifically, coders assigned a score of 1 when the protesters sought to “maintain the status quo,” a 2 for “somewhat radical change,” and a 3 for “radical change.”</p>
<p>The tactics measure was an indicator of how the protesters went about trying to accomplish their goals (α = .75; <italic>M</italic> = 2.18, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.74). This measure also used a scale from 1 to 3, with higher scores indicating more extreme tactics. The item was coded as 1 equals “no civil disobedience,” 2 equals “nonviolent civil disobedience,” and 3 equals “violent civil disobedience.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1940161211433837">
<title>Issue type</title>
<p>Coders were instructed to record the primary issue (e.g., war, health care, etc.) being addressed by the protesters in each article (α = 1.0). For analytical purposes, this measure was recoded to include four issue categories: (1) politics (<italic>n</italic> = 109); (2) war (<italic>n</italic> = 32); (3) public affairs/social issues (<italic>n</italic> = 44); and (4) other (<italic>n</italic> = 35).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1940161211433837">
<title>Protest and newspaper location</title>
<p>Finally, issue and newspaper origin were used to indicate the region where the events took place (α = 1.0) and where the news source was located (α = 1.0). For protest location, dummy variables were created for North America (<italic>n</italic> = 58 protests for 26.9%) and Asia (<italic>n</italic> = 131 protests for 59.5%). The remaining category included a range of locations such as New Zealand, Africa, the Middle East, and South America, all of which occurred at infrequent rates relative to the number of articles dealing with protests in North America and Asia. Dummy variables were also created for newspaper location for North America (<italic>n</italic> = 118) and Asia (<italic>n</italic> = 78). Finally, an interaction term was created to indicate whether protest and newspaper location were the same (e.g., a protest in the United States covered by a U.S. paper) or different (e.g., a protest in the United States covered by an Asian newspaper).</p>

<p>Hypothesis 1a predicted that news stories about war and political protests would be treated more critically than social issue protests. This hypothesis was tested using a one-way ANOVA with headline and article valence as dependent variables with Scheffe’s post hoc tests used to compare differences between protest issues. Hypothesis 1a was partially supported (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1940161211433837">Table 1</xref>). Although there were no statistically significant differences between political, war, or public issue protests for the headline (<italic>F</italic> = 2.32, <italic>ns</italic>), political protests were treated more critically than public issue protests in the main body of the article (<italic>F</italic> = 4.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<p>Hypothesis 1b predicted that the protest location would affect coverage such that protests in Asia and other non–North American locations would be treated more critically than North American protests. This hypothesis was tested using a one-way ANOVA with headline and article valence as dependent variables. Scheffe’s post hoc tests were used to compare differences between locations. Hypothesis 1b also received partial support (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1940161211433837">Table 2</xref>).

<p>Hypotheses 2a and 2b proposed that groups with more deviant goals and tactics, respectively, would be treated more critically. Both of these hypotheses received support at the zero-order level. Pearson correlations (not shown) for goals with headline (<italic>r</italic> = –.165, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and article valence (<italic>r</italic> = –.309, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) showed negative relationships such that more extreme goals resulted in less supportive coverage. Similar findings appeared for the relationship between tactics and headline (<italic>r</italic> = –.179, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and article valence (<italic>r</italic> = –.457, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) such that more extreme tactics resulted in less supportive coverage.</p>
<p>Beyond those hypotheses, this paper examined how these variables work together to influence treatment of protesters. We first used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to predict headline and article valence using location of protest, location of newspaper, protest issue, goals, and tactics as independent variables (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1940161211433837">Table 3</xref>). We also included the interaction term between protest and newspaper that tested whether protests within the country of the newspaper were treated differently than those that occurred outside of the newspaper country of origin. For headline valence, the analyses indicated that the full model was not statistically significant (<italic>F</italic> = 1.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and that only tactics (<italic>B</italic> = –.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) emerged as a marginally significant predictor such that more extreme tactics led to more critical treatment in headlines. However, caution should be used when interpreting this result given the level of statistical significance and the lack of model fit. However, for article valence, the full model was statistically significant (<italic>F</italic> = 6.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), yet again only tactics emerged as a significant predictor (<italic>B</italic> = –.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In all, these analyses demonstrate that although variables such as protest location, protest type, and a group’s goals matter in zero-order relationships, a group’s tactics was the strongest determinant of media coverage.</p>

<p>Given the central role that goals and tactics played in shaping news coverage, we conducted an additional set of OLS regression analyses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1940161211433837">Table 4</xref>) that considered what variables best predict group tactics and goals. For group tactics (<italic>F</italic> = 11.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), protests occurring in North America were less extreme in tactics (<italic>B</italic> = –.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) than their international counterparts. In addition, a group’s goals shared a strong positive relationship (<italic>B</italic> = .47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) with tactics even after controlling for all other factors. For predicting group goals, when the newspaper was located in either Asia (<italic>B</italic> = –.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) or North America (<italic>B</italic> = –.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), the protesters’ goals tended to be less extreme. In addition, public affairs protests (<italic>B</italic> = –.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were significantly less extreme in their goals. As with headline and story treatment, in no case did the interaction between protest and newspaper location influence tactics or goals.</p>

<p>We conducted an additional set of ANOVAs that compared select newspapers for headline treatment, article body treatment, group goals, and group tactics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1940161211433837">Table 5</xref>). The findings revealed no significant differences between news sources for either measures of protester treatment such that treatment of protesters in headlines (<italic>F</italic> = 1.29, <italic>ns</italic>) and article body (<italic>F</italic> = 2.38, <italic>ns</italic>) was fairly consistent. There was, however, great variation in the group’s goals depending on the particular news source (<italic>F</italic> = 3.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Specifically, the <italic>Washington Post</italic> and the <italic>South China Morning Post</italic> were the most likely newspapers to have articles featuring groups with more extreme goals.

The group’s goals in the <italic>South China Morning Post</italic> were significantly more extreme than those presented in the <italic>South China Morning Post</italic> and <italic>New York Times</italic>. For group tactics (<italic>F</italic> = 9.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), only the difference between the <italic>Washington Post</italic> and the <italic>Straits Times</italic> was statistically significant, with the former having more extreme tactics.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ultimately, the findings show that group tactics were the driving force behind news coverage. Specifically, tactics exert greater influence than a group’s goals, reinforcing a finding reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161211433837">Boyle and Armstrong (2009)</xref>. As such, this study reaffirms the methodological value in conceptually treating goals and tactics as separate indicators of a protest group’s level of threat to the status quo. Indicative of the influence of group tactics is the following description of protester tactics from the <italic>Straits Times</italic>: “The demonstrators, carrying banners calling for religious freedom, gathered in front of the former Hotel Indonesia before marching peacefully towards the presidential palace” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1940161211433837">Osman 2008</xref>). The article then presents a highly supportive argument for the group, emphasizing positive aspects of the group and their cause, while simultaneously criticizing the government group that was oppressing the protesters. Conversely, another article from the <italic>Straits Times</italic> dealing with protesters taking over an airport details the group’s extreme tactics—“Many were armed with poles, knives and swords, and some even had guns” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161211433837">Kaur and Yong 2008</xref>)—while then proceeding to criticize the protesters for interfering with the lives of tourists and other travelers. In this case, the news coverage emphasized negative characteristics over positive ones, reinforcing the central themes of the protest paradigm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this study also shows that, relative to tactics, other factors appear to exert a limited influence on treatment of protesters. Although a number of these—including protest location and type—affected news coverage at the zero-order level, once included in a full model, it was tactics that exerted the most influence. It is also interesting to note that there were no distinctions between individual papers within regions and their treatment of protesters in either the headline or the article body (e.g., treatment of protesters in the <italic>New York Times</italic> and <italic>Washington Post</italic> were not significantly different).</p>
<p>The findings also help explain what drives variation in goals and tactics. In the case of these data, tactics were driven by the location of the protest, while goals were driven by the location of the newspaper. This finding was further clarified by showing that extremity of goals varied widely depending on the particular newspaper, even revealing distinctions within geographic regions. Ultimately, though, factors such as the location of the protest, the country of origin of the newspaper, and the type of protest appear not to have direct effects on how groups were treated. However, it is likely they do have an indirect effect by influencing the particular goals groups will have and tactics groups will use, which, in turn, influence how groups are treated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, goals and tactics share a fairly strong positive relationship with one another. <italic>New York Times</italic>’s coverage of antigovernment protesters in Thailand demonstrates this extremity by describing the tactics of protesters trying to overthrow the government: “The army clashed with demonstrators early Monday after thousands of antigovernment protesters defied a state of emergency, massing in the streets, climbing on armored military vehicles and attacking the prime minister’s motorcade” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161211433837">Mydans and Fuller 2009</xref>). Coverage of a protest of a planned construction project in the <italic>Washington Times</italic> is indicative of less extreme goals—in this case seeking to maintain the status quo—often being pursued with less extreme tactics. In this article, protesters were described as gathering at a meeting and asking the governor “to stop building the six-lane highway until the state better studies its potential health impact on people nearby” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161211433837">Shaver 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional analyses (not shown) provide insights on how cultural and regional differences might influence not only protest coverage but what issues are being protested. For North America, there was a fairly even split for protest type, with 43.6% (24 of 55) being public affairs, 21.8% being politics, and 20% of those being war/conflict. For Asia, the distribution was skewed toward political protests (68%, 85 of 125), 9.6% being war related and 12.8% being public affairs issues. This aligns with the extremity of goals and tactics in those regions as the findings show that U.S.- and Canadian-based protests pose less of a threat both for goals and tactics. This ultimately resulted in those protesters being treated less critically than their international counterparts. This finding reinforces the central tenant of the protest paradigm and shows that the application of this concept is not limited to a given region. That is, protesters across the world are more likely to receive critical treatment if they pose a threat to the status quo—particularly if their tactics are more extreme.</p>
<p>These findings provide important insights for scholars and journalists alike. First, they reinforce the notion that there are clear and systemic biases in news coverage and these biases are not limited to particular countries are regions. Simply put, groups that use more extreme tactics are treated more critically, indicative of the social control function of the media. This pattern persists across a variety of journalistic cultures—including different countries and ideological perspectives. While this reinforces the importance of the “protest paradigm” as a perspective through which to study news treatment of protesters, it also suggests that journalists of all kinds respond more to group tactics than they do to group goals. As such, scholars should do more to uncover the root causes of such biases and work with journalists to provide more objective coverage of protesters. As suggested earlier in this article, treating some groups more critically may not be a conscious choice by journalists but a function of journalistic norms and practices such as something learned regardless of one’s ideological or cultural perspective. As such, understanding the triggers of the social control function is particularly important in understanding when and why the social control function is most likely to be invoked.</p>
<p>Such issues seem increasingly important given that partisan news has become an integral part of the respective identities of major news networks such as Fox News and MSNBC. The analyses looking closely at individual papers do reveal some subtle distinctions (on group goals and tactics) between newspapers. This shift in the nature of news—from the classic model of objective presenter of events to more of a subjective interpreter of events—could have important implications for news coverage of protesters and the protest paradigm itself. Mainly, it suggests that the notion that more extreme groups will be treated more critically needs continued review and analysis as the nature of news production and dissemination continues to evolve. For instance, with new technologies, there is the potential for a wider array of news sources and more niche audiences that may seek out and respond to different types of coverage. Given this level of instability, future research should continue to assess the variables that move in and out of prominence in terms of their influence on news treatment of protesters. In addition, it appears that the oft-discussed issue of news bias deserves continued assessment particularly as it continues to evolve in the new media environment.</p>
<p>Second, the findings demonstrate meaningful distinctions between the headlines and the main article portion of the news story. Somewhat surprisingly, headlines tended toward neutral whereas the main body of the article was more likely to present critical coverage of the protesters. The headlines of articles did not differ based on protest type or location whereas there was variation in how protesters were presented in the main body of the article for protest type and location. Furthermore, headlines were only marginally influenced by tactics and not at all by goals whereas the articles were clearly influenced by tactics. This suggests that there is little protesters can do to influence the nature of the headlines they receive. To be clear, our measurement approach did not capture the extent to which headlines were exciting or interesting—only the extent to which they were critical or supportive of protesters. It could be that headlines focus more on generating interest and less on being specifically critical or supportive of protesters. Beyond that, headlines provide a limited amount of space to present an issue, leaving little room for the nuanced criticism of groups that can be more easily included in the details of the article body. This is important if journalists are striving to maintain perceptions of objectivity as a blatantly critical or supportive headline would violate such an assumption.</p>
<p>The distinction between headline and article body is important particularly when considering the influence that news treatment might have on audiences. Based on these findings, those readers who are simply scanning headlines and not making their way further into the story are less likely to encounter the protest paradigm because the headlines themselves tend toward neutral regardless of the characteristics of the protest. It is not until readers venture further into the article that they are exposed to the marginalizing frames. Given that previous research has shown that critical treatment of protesters can have a negative influence on perceptions of protesters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161211433837">McLeod 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161211433837">McLeod and Detenber 1999</xref>), it is essential to understand how that influence is put into practice. Clearly these data suggest that the protest paradigm is manifest more in the details of the article itself than it is in the headline.</p>
<p>Finally, these findings indicate that context—in this case the location of both the protest and the news source—can be an important predictor in understanding both what the protesters will do and also how they will be treated. In these data, there were clear distinctions between North American and Asian protests. Those protesting outside of the boundaries of North America engaged in more extreme protests both from a goal and tactics standpoint. In turn, such protests are treated more critically. However, the final regression model predicting to goals and tactics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1940161211433837">Table 4</xref>) indicates that the direct influence of location and protest issue goes away when considered simultaneously with tactics. It is likely then that the situational differences created across the two regions lead to different types of tactics. In addition, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1940161211433837">Table 5</xref> suggests that newspapers are either selecting particular protests to cover—based on their goals—or interpreting protester’s goals as more or less extreme. For instance, North American protesters tended toward less extreme goals than their Asian counterparts and subsequently used less extreme tactics as well. Furthermore, protests in the <italic>Washington Post</italic> and <italic>Straits Times</italic> also had more extreme goals than protests presented in a number of the other papers, suggesting one of two possibilities: (1) either the <italic>Post</italic> and <italic>Straits Times</italic> cover more extreme protests or (2) they present protesters as more extreme than other papers do.</p>
<p>Such distinctions could have important implications for how the goals and tactics of groups are evaluated both by audiences reading coverage and scholars studying news treatment of protesters. If goals and tactics are subject to bias and interpreted or presented differently depending on the news source or some other factor such as whether a group is hostile or threatening, the group’s goals and tactics could be misrepresented and therefore not always representative of the actual tactics and goals of the group. For instance, news coverage of a protest movement in a hostile regime might be more likely to emphasize violent tactics even if they are not central to the action whereas coverage of protests in a friendly regime might be more likely to deemphasize any violence that occurs. Ultimately, future research should look more closely into journalistic biases, particularly when it comes to measurement and evaluation of a group’s tactics and goals.</p>
<p>These findings have some limitations. First, the sample is not a true representative sample of the regions discussed in this article. Although we took steps to include a diverse array of newspapers from within given regions, the newspapers used in this sample were purposefully selected because they were English-language newspapers. However, this still allows for important insights into differences across cultures and regions. Beyond that, the consistency of the findings across cultures supports the protest paradigm. Future research ought to extend news coverage of protest beyond English-only news sources.</p>
<p>Second, more work is needed in this area to better understand the root causes behind the protest paradigm. In most cases, scholars suggest that the social control function of the news media is not one that is purposefully or consciously enacted. However, more studies are needed to directly test this. Although on some level protester goals and tactics should be something determined by the protesters themselves, our findings appear to indicate great variance across individual newspapers suggesting journalists may have some say not only in how groups are treated but also how their goals and tactics are presented. Work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161211433837">Avraham (2003)</xref> and others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161211433837">Herman and Chomsky 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161211433837">Hertog and McLeod 1995</xref>) have also demonstrated similar findings indicating that in addition to group characteristics, the journalists and the organizations they work for also played a role both in whether groups were covered and in how they were treated. Although Avraham’s work focused on the context of Israeli–Arab relations not specifically on protest groups, the general findings indicate the value in considering both journalist and group characteristics in understanding news coverage. Future research should explore a wider array of topics that would help clarify which characteristics of both groups and journalists are central to affecting treatment of protesters. Furthermore, perhaps the use of different methodological approaches—as Avraham’s work did—such as rhetorical analyses or in-depth interviews with journalists across a broad array of topics, might provide key insights into how protest coverage is affected by these shifts.</p>
<p>Third, we also recognize that more can be done with contextual measures like institutional control, closer explorations of the relationships between newspaper country and protest location, and more finely tuned measures of the type of protest. Although the current findings reveal little distinction between the treatment of domestic and foreign protests, a more focused analysis that considers up-to-date political shifts might reveal more. It is also likely that beyond basic national boundaries, the nature of the relationship between countries ought to be considered as well. It could be that news sources will treat protesters from nations deemed hostile or unfriendly less critically than those in countries that are allied with the newspapers home nation. In addition, some nations exert more control over the press, thus having great influence on how protests and other issues are covered, particularly when protesters threaten that control, such as the protests from Egypt and Iran in 2009. As such, future studies should focus more specifically on the complexities of international politics and their influence on the treatment of protests both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the measure of protest type included in this study also needs to be examined in respect to the inherent complexities of defining a particular type of protest for any given protest event. For example, protest activities in the Middle East in 2010 suggest that political protests may go hand in hand with social issue protests or even be rooted in protests based on responses to social issues. A more nuanced look at the types of issues being protested within a given protest event or social movement might shed more light on the role that those issues play in how protesters are treated.</p>
<p>In all, these findings reinforce the notion that a group’s tactics largely determine whether they receive supportive or critical coverage. As such, from a measurement standpoint, future scholars should continue to treat goals and tactics as separate elements while working to identify additional factors that influence the implementation of the protest paradigm. From the perspective of protesters, it is clear that if they want to make supportive news coverage more likely, they must carefully consider decisions about the tactics they use. Although location, protest issue, and goals appear to exert some influence, the findings suggest that influence is indirect and operates through the tactics groups use. Ultimately, groups that use more extreme tactics are more likely to be treated critically in news coverage, and this study shows that such findings are not limited to U.S. news sources and that the premise of the protest paradigm is not geographically bound. The findings also reveal important distinctions in the nature of protests when comparing North American versus Asian protests. However, regardless of these distinctions, protesters of all walks of life are more likely to be treated critically by news media when their approach to reaching their goals is seen as more extreme.</p>
