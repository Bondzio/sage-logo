<title>Background:</title>
<p>Self-care behaviour in patients with heart failure (HF) represents a series of specific actions that patients should take, as an important treatment component.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1474515112439964">
<title>Aims:</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to identify potential determinants of HF self-care in ambulatory patients with stable systolic HF.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1474515112439964">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>In a cross-sectional study of 318 patients with chronic systolic HF recruited in 48 German primary care practices, we evaluated the patient-reported European HF Self-care Behaviour scale (EHFScBs) assessments (range 12–60, where lower scores indicate better self-care). Potential determinants included socio-demographic (e.g. age, living status), clinical (e.g. NYHA class, LVEF, NT-proBNP levels, co-morbidities), behavioural (e.g. smoking and alcohol intake), psychosocial (SF-36 scales and KCCQ domains, e.g. quality of life and self-efficacy) and depression status (PHQ-D), plus previous health care utilisation. Mixed regression modelling was applied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1474515112439964">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Patients had a mean (SD) age of 69.0 (10.4) years and were 71% male. They had a good overall EHFScBs score of 24.7 (7.8) (<italic>n</italic>=274). In the final regression model (<italic>n</italic>=271), six determinants were retained (β; descriptive <italic>p</italic>-value): self-efficacy (-0.24; &lt;.001), age (-0.22; &lt;.001), prosthetic heart valve (-0.14; .01), referrals to cardiologists (-0.14; .02), peripheral arterial disease (0.13; .03) and quality of life (0.16; .02).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1474515112439964">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>In this exploratory cross-sectional study, the potential non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors and resources involved in patients’ HF self-care were at the individual and organisational level. Self-efficacy and quality of life are potentially modifiable, so these could be targeted for improvement by enhancing patient motivation, HF education and further supporting a collaborative care approach.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic heart failure (HF) is characterised by impaired health-related quality of life, high mortality rates and high health care utilisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112439964">1</xref></sup> Treatment options include non-pharmacological and interventional strategies that can improve clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112439964">2</xref></sup> Self-care is part of the non-pharmacological treatment, comprising key behaviours that can improve disease outcomes: When patients engaged in self-care, hospitalisation rates decreased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112439964">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112439964"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112439964">5</xref></sup> Yet according to a scientific statement issued by the American Heart Association (AHA), ‘there is surprisingly little evidence on the <italic>direct</italic> relationship between HF self-care and health outcomes’ as in many intervention studies, self-care was only one of several intervention components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112439964">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112439964">7</xref></sup> The AHA statement concluded that interventions focusing on HF self-care can reduce hospitalisations, but have unclear effects on mortality and health-related quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112439964">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112439964">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no unanimous definition of general self-care. Commonly, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines self-care as ‘the activities individuals, families, and communities undertake with the intention of enhancing health, preventing disease, limiting illness, and restoring health’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112439964">9</xref></sup> Important HF self-care behaviours include the skills and appropriate behaviours regarding adherence to treatment, symptom recognition, fluid and sodium management, seeking assistance when necessary, heart-healthy nutrition and weight management, smoking cessation and physical exercise, as is recommended in clinical practice guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112439964">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112439964">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Assessment of HF self-care adherence has been conducted using various instruments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112439964">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112439964">12</xref></sup> depending on the underlying concepts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112439964">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112439964"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112439964">15</xref></sup> Riegel et al. (2008) describe a situation-specific theory of HF self-care, in which self-care is defined as a naturalistic decision-making process involving the choice of behaviours that include self-care maintenance, management and confidence, and established a Self-care of Heart Failure Model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112439964">16</xref></sup> The European HF Self-care Behaviour scale (EHFScBs) was developed as a short and practical outcome assessment instrument for interventions aimed at improved HF self-care behaviours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112439964">11</xref></sup> A shorter version was recently recommended for clinical care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112439964">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Identifying and supporting patients who are at the highest risk for poor self-care continues to challenge health care providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112439964">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112439964">19</xref></sup> In order to plan effective interventions, it is necessary to understand which patients do engage in HF self-care and why this is the case. Literature reviews have aimed to identify the sociodemographic, psychosocial, health-related, care-related, cognitive and behavioural determinants of HF self-care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112439964">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112439964">20</xref></sup> Type-D-personality, comorbidities, multiple medications, lack of knowledge, depression, anxiety, impaired cognition, poor health literacy and health care system-related problems have been reported as factors that hinder self-care adherence. The length of time since the patient’s HF diagnosis also seems to be positively related to self-care maintenance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112439964">20</xref></sup> However, more research identifying and targeting self-care efforts has been requested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112439964">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112439964">20</xref></sup> Moreover, evidence of HF self-care adherence in primary care settings is scarce. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify and explore the specific impact of potential determinants of HF self-care, with respect to a wide set of patient-modifiable or non-modifiable determinants.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-1474515112439964">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This cross-sectional study used pooled baseline data from ‘Subproject 10’ covering quality of life, within the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research’s sponsored ‘Competence Network Heart Failure’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112439964">21</xref></sup> Within Subproject 10, two primary care-based trials (TTT and HICMan) evaluated different kinds of interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112439964">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112439964">23</xref></sup> Both trials conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the institutional review boards (IRBs) of the local medical faculty of the University of Heidelberg and the Medical Association of the federal state Baden-Wuerttemberg in Germany. The trials were registered prior to inclusion of patients (ISRCTN08601529 and ISRCTN30822978).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1474515112439964">
<title>Participant selection and recruitment</title>
<p>Interested general practitioners (GPs) were eligible for participation if they were certified as a primary care physician or equivalent and if they practiced as a state health insurance-affiliated physician. The two studies, performed in the German region of Northern Baden, had participation of 50 GPs from 48 practices.</p>
<p>Eligible patients were adults ≥ 40 years of age with confirmed chronic systolic heart failure (HF) diagnosed at least 3 months prior to inclusion in the study, with clinical stability for at least 2 weeks before inclusion; impaired left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45%), based on objective measurement (e.g. by echocardiography); and dyspnea as assessed by the GP at time of enrolment as NYHA functional class II–IV, or even class I, if a hospital admission occurred because of HF within the last 24 months. Exclusion criteria were: Hemodynamically-relevant primary valvular heart diseases; hypertrophic obstructive/restrictive cardiomyopathy (HOCM/RCM); a concomitant terminal illness; addictive disorders (drug abuse or persistent alcohol abuse despite social, legal or occupational conflicts); and dementia or severe psychological illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112439964">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112439964">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>All GPs and patients gave written informed consent. Between March 2005 and January 2007, a total of 367 eligible patients were recruited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112439964">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112439964">23</xref></sup> Within the HICMan-trial, two patients failed to follow up and 47 patients participated in the TTT-trial; thus, a substudy sample encompassed the pooled baseline data of 318 patients from both trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474515112439964">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>GPs received an initiation visit by a study nurse, with an introduction to and handover of the trial’s investigator file that included patient-related GP documentation on pre-specified case report forms (CRFs), according to the Basic Clinical Dataset (BCD) of the HF Competence Network and patient-reported questionnaires.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112439964">21</xref></sup> Before randomisation as part of the trials, there was a 2-month time frame for obtaining baseline documentation, to be conducted by the GP during patient enrolment. CRFs were sent to the responsible Clinical Trial Coordination Centre. Parallel to the clinical baseline assessment, GPs or their personnel handed out patient questionnaires, to be returned by the patient in a pre-specified envelope, within 7 days. After data management, which included automated revision and consistency checks and application of standard operating procedures, final data were returned to the GP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112439964">21</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1474515112439964">
<title>Measurement</title>
<p>GPs documented on the CRFs the physician characteristics (e.g. years in practice) and patient clinical data (e.g. history, current clinical status, lab results, electrocardiogram (ECG), medication details, etc.), plus their health care utilisation for the previous 12 months (practice contacts, referrals to cardiologist and hospitalisations due to HF). Documentation of patients’ history included single co-occurring medical conditions such as angina pectoris, peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, depression, etc… Also, GPs applied the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS-G) to estimate patients’ morbidity burden (range 0 to 56, where higher scores indicate higher disease burden).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112439964">24</xref></sup> To determine N-terminal Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP), blood was analysed in a central facility serving the HF Competence Network project,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112439964">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112439964">23</xref></sup> using the Elecsys<sup>®</sup> 2010 (Roche Diagnostics, Germany).</p>
<p>Patient-reported data included a sociodemographic dataset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112439964">25</xref></sup> For the measurement of HF self-care adherence, the European Heart Failure Self-Care Behaviour scale (EHFScBs) was used: a 12-item, self-administered valid, reliable and practical scale that measures the self-reported self-care behaviour of patients with HF; for example, daily weighing, fluid restriction, exercise or contacting of a health care provider.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112439964">11</xref></sup> Patients could score each item on a 5-point scale between 1 (I completely agree) and 5 (I completely disagree). A summary score ranging from 12 to 60 is recommended, with low scores implying better self-care behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112439964">11</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112439964">26</xref></sup> Generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured using the German version of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112439964">27</xref></sup> and HF HRQOL was measured using the German version of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112439964">28</xref></sup> Both are valid and reliable instruments. The SF-36 questionnaire consists of eight dimensions: physical function, physical role functionality, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functionality and mental health. SF-36 scores were converted to a (T-) scale of 0 to 100, where the higher scores indicate superior health status.</p>
<p>The KCCQ quantifies several health status domains, including physical limitations, symptoms (stability, frequency and burden thereof), self-efficacy, mental quality of life and social functionality. Each scale was also transformed to a score between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating superior health status. In patients with HF, mean physical and mental component summary scores (SF-36) were 37 and 45, whereas the scores for normal Germans are 50.2 and 51.5, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474515112439964">29</xref></sup> Mean KCCQ scores correlate with NYHA stage, with mean overall KCCQ scores of approximately 80, 60, 40 and 20 corresponding to stage I, II, III and IV, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112439964">28</xref></sup> In longitudinal studies, a mean 5-point difference within a particular scale of the SF-36 or the overall score of KCCQ are regarded as clinically significant.</p>
<p>Depression was assessed using the German version of the Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474515112439964">30</xref></sup> In accordance with DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, it consists of nine depressive symptoms with a final score that ranges from 0 to 27. A categorical analysis was applied for a diagnosis of a major depressive syndrome, i.e. when five or more of the nine depressive symptoms were present, on at least ‘more than half the days’ in the past 2 weeks, including at least one of the two main diagnostic symptoms (a loss of interest or a depressed mood). Depression severity was indicated by the summary score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1474515112439964">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>The analyses focused on the summary score of the EHFScBs as the outcome variable. Dummy variables were built for all ordinal variables (such as a patients’ socio-economic status or left ventricular ejection fraction). We aggregated NYHA functional class I with II, as well as III with IV, to handle the low number of observations in classes I and IV. As NT-proBNP had a skewed distribution, logarithmic transformation, as described previously, was applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474515112439964">31</xref></sup> Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the analyses of relationships between numerical explanatory variables and the dependent variable. In a first step, a full regression model was calculated. In addition, we performed a forward stepwise regression using <italic>p</italic>=0.10 as a threshold. As this procedure uses only those individuals who had complete information on all explanatory variables within the model, the sample size was only 136. Variables with many missing items were successively excluded from the model; stepwise regression was repeated each time a variable was excluded. In a final step, a full model regression was performed using only those explanatory variables that were entered in at least one preliminary stepwise regression. All explanatory variables remained within this final unified model, except for ‘living alone’. To account for the clustering of data (intraclass correlation within each practice was attributable to clustering) we performed mixed effects regression analyses (PROC MIXED) with the patients nested within practices. We confirmed that regression coefficients within practices were nearly the same compared to the results of the final unified model. We present the results of the unified regression model. For our analyses, we used Stata/MP version 11.1, SPSS version 16.0.2 and SAS 9.2.</p>

<title>Characteristics of doctors and participants</title>
<p>Fifty GPs, mean age (SD) of 49.1 (9) years, 22% female, from 48 small office-based practices (50% one sole GP) participated. GPs had been practicing on average for 15 (8.3) years and recruited on average 6.4 (4.8) (range 1–18) eligible patients for our study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112439964">Table 1</xref> summarises the socio-demographic, clinical, psychosocial, behavioural and health care utilisation characteristics of the 318 eligible, predominantly male (71.4%), patients with a mean (SD) age of 69 (10.4) years. Patients had undergone different cardiovascular interventions, such as: 22.6% had a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, 15.4% an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and 6.3% a prosthetic heart valve. Patients had substantial comorbidities, e.g. vascular conditions such as peripheral arterial disease (PAD), cerebrovascular disease, angina pectoris and hypertension in 17.3, 18.9, 25.5 and 78.9%, respectively. Estimated renal function was impaired in more than 40% of cases (GFR&lt;60 ml/min). Mean (SD) NT-proBNP-levels were 2298.4 (3985.9) pg/ml. According to PHQ-9 screening, 12.9% of these patients fulfilled the criteria for major depression. One in seven patients was a smoker; their average (SD) alcohol consumption was 4.2 (6.4) drinks per week. Patients were prescribed an average of 6.5 (2.2) drugs. During the previous 12 months, patients had used health care services for the management of HF substantially, with a mean (SD) of 16.4 (13.2) practice contacts, 2.2 (2.0) cardiologist contacts and 0.6 (0.1) hospitalisations.</p>

<p>The mean (SD) EHFScBs summary score reflecting HF self-care behaviour was 24.7 (7.8), as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112439964">Table 2</xref>, reflecting a good mean level of adherence to self-care behaviours. Overall EHFScBs scores were found to be normally distributed, while on the item level, distributions were partially skewed. There were no gender-related differences found, except for small differences in two areas. However, these were not clinically relevant, as supported by the comparison of mean (SD) and median [IQR] in male vs. female: ‘If I get short of breath, I take it easy’, at 1.8 (1.1), 1 [1;2] vs. 1.5 (1.0), 1 [1;2], Mann–Whitney U test: <italic>P</italic>=.030); and ‘I take a rest during the day’, resulting in 1.8 (1.2), 1 [1;2] vs. 1.4 (0.8), 1 [1;1], Mann–Whitney U test: <italic>P</italic>=.004). There was considerable variance in the patients’ impairment in HRQOL, as indicated by the SF-36 and KCCQ scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112439964">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We explored patient- and care-related determinants of HF self-care behaviour in a cross-sectional study of a defined convenience sample of outpatients with stable systolic chronic heart failure. In these elderly patients with a considerable burden of morbidity, general HF self-care behaviour was good (based on the mean summary score), but with considerable interpersonal variations. Multiple linear regression analyses identified six determinants that were independently associated with HF self-care behaviours.</p>
<p>A recently reported systematic review of the literature on the determinants of HF self-care, which employed a quality analysis and a best evidence synthesis from 26 articles of at least fair quality, covered the ‘potential determinants for the full range of behaviours that patients need to perform to adequately care for themselves’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112439964">20</xref></sup> Many different instruments, but mostly the Self-Care HF Index, were applied for their outcome assessment. The length of time since a patient’s diagnosis with HF was positively related to performance of self-care maintenance. Patients’ perceived benefits and barriers were related to the restriction of sodium intake. Patients with type-D personality were less likely to consult medical professionals. Other evidence from the synthesis revealed few non-significant relationships, but their retrospective evidence was inconsistent and insufficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112439964">20</xref></sup> The authors concluded that more systematic, high-quality and behavioral theory-driven research is needed to provide further directions for future HF self-care promotion interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112439964">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Only a few studies have evaluated the determinants of HF self-care by applying the EHFScB scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1474515112439964">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1474515112439964"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112439964"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112439964"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1474515112439964">36</xref></sup> In a first step, a descriptive comparison of mean EHFScBs summary scores with patient characteristics, including other studies using the EHFScB scale, shows different results: In some reports, EHFScBs summary scores were similar at 24.8 and 24.0, respectively,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112439964">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1474515112439964">37</xref></sup> reflecting a good level of adherence that was similar to what we found in our current German study. Other researchers reported less adherence to self-care behaviours in patients with HF (mean scores of 33.3 and 32.6).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112439964">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112439964">34</xref></sup> In this study, patients were ambulatory, with stable HF. A stable status could be associated with better self-care adherence. Furthermore, patients were older in our study than in other studies (mean age 69 in our sample vs. 65 or 63 yrs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112439964">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112439964">35</xref></sup> and they had a long history of HF (5.8 yrs) as compared to Kato et al. (2.6 yrs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112439964">34</xref></sup> In addition, the patients in our sample had undergone more interventions, when compared to another study (PTCA/stent: 33% vs. 15%; CABG: 21% vs. 24%; Pacemaker: 24% vs. 9%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1474515112439964">38</xref></sup> Moreover, the morbidity burden in our sample, as measured by the CIRS-G instrument was considerably high.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112439964">35</xref></sup> In summary, these comparisons demonstrate the importance of showing consideration of the patient samples when studying self-care behaviours via assessment instruments, such as the EHFScB scale. Comparisons suggest that patients in our study were older, had experienced a longer time since diagnosis of HF, had undergone interventional procedures, and showed a considerable overall morbidity burden. Neither the descriptive comparison nor this study can definitively explain why overall adherence to self-care care behaviours was better in our sample than in other studies; however, considering the eventual fatal prognosis of HF,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112439964">1</xref></sup> these patients can at least be seen as survivors, because they experienced a longer disease trajectory. Thus, the good performance of self-care behaviours might reflect the skills that are usually attained with the experience acquired as a result of living with HF for a longer time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112439964">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The amount of variance explained (adjusted R2) in our results is small and similar to variance seen in previous studies (Kato et al., 0.15; Holzapfel et al., 0.24).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112439964">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112439964">35</xref></sup> This could be due to missing variables in these studies. Our finding is in line with findings from theory-driven research into health behaviours <italic>other</italic> than HF self-care, where social cognition models have been shown to predict the related <italic>intentions</italic>, but to a much lesser extent the actual <italic>behaviour</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1474515112439964">39</xref></sup> This demonstrates just how difficult it remains to determine or even predict human behaviour. Nevertheless, we believe that HF self-care adherence comprises a set of distinct and special behaviours that need more medical and public awareness, specific knowledge, patient confidence, patient motivation and skill in order to be applied in everyday routines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112439964">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Comparison of the apparent determinants of HF self-care found in this study to other studies might aid the interpretation of the results. Holzapfel and colleagues (2009) used the EHFScB scale as an outcome measure in a sample of 287 outpatients and found factors that are associated with better HF self-care: These were a less impaired systolic function and a higher morbidity burden, less social support (living alone) and minor but not major depression. Kato et al. (2009) found in 116 outpatients that being employed and having diabetes mellitus are associated with worse HF self-care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112439964">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112439964">35</xref></sup> and Schiffer et al. (2007) found, in a sample of 178 outpatients with HF, that a type-D personality was associated with inadequate self-management (i.e. a lack of consultation behaviour).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1474515112439964">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>High HF-related self-efficacy, based on asking about a patient’s sureness and understanding of what to do if heart failure worsens, was previously associated with higher self-reported self-care behavioural adherence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112439964">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1474515112439964">40</xref></sup> and was the strongest determinant in our study. Thus, our finding is in line with the literature and reinforces the need for HF patient education that specifically targets HF-related self-efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112439964">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Age was the second strongest independently-associated factor in successful HF self-care and it was also found in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112439964">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1474515112439964">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1474515112439964"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1474515112439964"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1474515112439964">44</xref></sup> Older age could be a surrogate of time since diagnosis, and therefore of expertise in handling the condition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112439964">20</xref></sup> or even as was suggested by a qualitative study, that elderly HF patients were more interested in health-promoting activities, in order to remain independent and self-reliant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1474515112439964">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whereas cardiovascular interventions such as a prosthetic heart valve, a CABG and an ICD all were associated with better self-care, only the prosthetic heart valve remained in the regression model. This finding was not previously reported: Perhaps the experience of a serious health impairment, followed by a major surgical cardiovascular intervention that improved both prognosis and symptoms, may have prompted greater behavioural changes. More research on this subject is needed.</p>
<p>The positive association of the number of contacts with a cardiologist represents an ambiguous, but interesting result and needs to be discussed in the context of the German health care system. The German system is characterised as a ‘free’ system, where patients can choose their health care provider. The system features privately run office-based ambulatory cardiologist care, next to hospital-based HF clinics that are usually located in university hospitals. As a causal direction of the observed association cannot be determined, we believe that repeated cardiologist contacts might play a motivating role, or, if viewed from another perspective, the lower levels of self-care could imply lower health care-seeking behaviour and also imply fewer requests for a referral by the primary care physician. Our data cannot inform us about the influence of the primary care physician, who might have been inactive or might have advised a referral that was denied or ignored by the patient. It is also possible that referral might create a potentially heightened awareness of the patient’s cardiac problems and thus, incite a desire to follow self-care recommendations, once referred.</p>
<p>PAD as a negative predictor of HF self-care has not been reported previously;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112439964">20</xref></sup> however, PAD is known to be an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and hospitalisation in patients with HF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1474515112439964">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1474515112439964">47</xref></sup> Functional capacity (exercise duration, peak oxygen consumption and the 6-minute walk distance) becomes reduced in comparison to HF patients without PAD, even after adjustment for differences in age, smoking, ischemic cause of HF, history of diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1474515112439964">47</xref></sup> Patients with PAD may also have limited functional benefits after exercise training. Skeletal muscle abnormalities or a mixture of central and peripheral hemodynamic abnormalities may be related, but the mechanism leading to poorer outcomes is unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1474515112439964">47</xref></sup> Therefore, PAD patients represent a certain high-risk subgroup for self-care adherence and health outcomes. Further studies on PAD and self-care are needed. One should avoid subjecting these patients to the stereotypes of poor compliance. Notably, we found that smoking status was not an associated factor in our HF self-care study.</p>
<p>One domain of overall HF-related quality of life, the KCCQ quality of life domain, correlated negatively with HF self-care. Patients not bothered by symptoms when carrying out activities of daily living or patients with better coping may represent a group that lived life without attention to self-care recommendations. The KCCQ quality of life domain asks about perceived limitation in enjoyment of life, satisfaction, acceptance of the HF diagnosis for the rest of the patient’s life and the frequency of feeling discouraged or down in the dumps because of HF. Patients feeling less limited in enjoyment of life, being able to accept HF as an irreversible disease and feeling less discouraged because of HF seem to participate less in HF self-care behaviours; however, no published literature could be identified regarding this negative association,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112439964">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112439964">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112439964">20</xref></sup> so it would need to be replicated in further studies. If replicated, enhanced self-management support may help such patients in adapting to better self-care behaviours.</p>

<title>Limitations and strengths of the study</title>
<p>Participants in these trials might not be representative of the general HF population; however, our comorbidity rates were similar to other studies that captured a general population of patients with HF. Contrary to most other studies in primary care, our sample consisted of patients with defined HF, and the larger parental trial was conducted as a clinical trial with support by a Clinical Trial Coordination Centre with specified data management, which favours our data validity. Data collection of some variables by GP could be incorrect, if based on memory, or if the chart data was incomplete or inaccurate. Moreover, the study was not originally designed to study factors associated with self-care; therefore, it may have missed some important variables that might have increased the proportion of explained variance. Our models were obtained for 274 patients with complete self-care scoring. Most missing data pertained to socio-economic status (e.g. living alone), duration of HF and SF-36 subscales. Results might have differed if complete data was available. We abstained from imputation methods, as they have their own limitations, plus we omitted the option of a non-responder analysis, due to the low number of non-respondents, which would otherwise be appropriate in the context of exploration.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In addition to established determinants (e.g. age and self-efficacy), good adherence to HF self-care behaviour in patients with stable chronic systolic heart failure under primary care was found to be associated with an older age, high HF-related competence, less attention in coping, a history of serious events and referral to specialist care. Addressing these factors might identify patients most at risk for poor HF self-care adherence. Observational studies with a wide set of variables would aid in the identification of causal predictors that might be successfully targeted. Patient care and educational needs remain complex. This research underlines the need for interdisciplinary and interprofessional collaborative care, with the focus on further patient motivation, education, and support for self-management.</p>
