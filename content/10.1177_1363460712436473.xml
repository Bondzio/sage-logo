<abstract>
<p>Using the Opening Ceremony of the Sydney 2002 Gay Games as a case study, in this article I analyse sexual citizenship through the lens of global cosmopolitanism. I begin by arguing that at these Games an idealised sexual citizen was produced through neoliberal discourses of freedom, rights, choice and cosmopolitanism. At events of this kind, these individualising practices function as new and important forms of ‘political’ action. I then argue that the idealised cosmopolitan sexual citizen is presumed to be a white, western citizen-subject who has access to ‘difference’ through urban living, global travel and through personal investments in the project of global queer world-making. Finally, I illustrate how becoming a cosmopolitan sexual citizen involves a set of consumptive practices that fetishise and Other non-white bodies and lives. At large global gay and lesbian events like the Gay Games, local histories and bodies are mediated as sites of consumption that affirm sexual citizens’ status as global cosmopolitan citizens and define the parameters of an imagined queer world.</p>

<p>Under different skies, at the beginning of a new millennium, in an old land and a young nation, we join together in the hope and conviction that the future will be kinder and more just than the past. At a time when there is so much fear and danger, anger and destruction, [the Sydney 2002 Gay Games] represent an alternative vision struggling for the soul of humanity. This is the competitive idea for all of us: Acceptance. Diversity. Inclusiveness. Participation. Tolerance and joy. Ours is a world of love, questing to find the common links that bind all people. We are here, because whatever our sexuality we know that the days of exclusion are numbered. This is a great night, a great night for Australia because we are a nation in the process of reinventing ourselves. We began our modern history by denying our indigenous peoples and their rights. We embraced White Australia. Women could play little part in public life – their place was in the kitchen. And as for gays and lesbians, transgender, bisexuals, intersex and other sexual minorities, they were an abomination. Lock’em up, throw away the key. Well, we have not corrected all these wrongs, but we are surely on the road to enlightenment and there will be no U-turns … So, let the word go out from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363460712436473">Sydney and the Gay Games of 2002</xref> that the movement for equality is unstoppable! Its message will eventually reach the four corners of the world. And these Gay Games in Sydney will be another catalyst to help make that happen. Be sure, be very sure, in the end inclusion will replace exclusion, for the sake of the planet and for the sake of humanity it must be so.</p>
<p>(The Honourable Justice Michael Kirby quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460712436473">Heil, 2002</xref>)</p></disp-quote>

<p>In his welcoming address at the Sydney 2002 Gay Games Opening Ceremony, Australian Supreme Court Judge, The Honourable Justice Michael Kirby,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363460712436473">1</xref></sup> suggests that the Games offer an alternative queer world where acceptance, diversity and tolerance supplant the exclusion and inequalities sexual citizens (but also women and ethnic and racial minorities) have long experienced. The language and metaphors Kirby evokes are also heavily invested in the values of global cosmopolitanism. Global living is positioned to provide opportunities for new and more ‘just’ identity politics and consuming a range of queer community experiences around the world defines what it means to be a global sexual citizen-subject.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363460712436473">3</xref></sup> Kirby’s vision invites his audience of international participants to insert themselves into a story of progress and change. By their very presence at this global gay and lesbian event,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363460712436473">2</xref></sup> participants are constructed as key players in the projects of local reinvention <italic>and</italic> global queer world-building. Participating in the Games means contributing to the making of a more just and equitable Australia. At the same time, consuming local histories and cultures affirms participants’ status as worldly, politically minded citizens whose shared liberal ideals (tolerance, equality, freedom and choice) will ‘eventually reach all four corners of the world’.</p>
<p>Drawing on other examples from the Opening Ceremony, in this article I make three key arguments about what I will refer to as cosmopolitan sexual citizenship. First, I suggest that cosmopolitan sexual citizenship is heavily invested in the neoliberal projects of freedom, choice and self-work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363460712436473">Rose, 1999</xref>), and that, at large tourist events like the Gay Games, these individualising projects come to function as new and important forms of local and global ‘political’ action. While Jon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712436473">Binnie (2004)</xref> has asked if the values of cosmopolitanism might provide a new model of global queer politics based on the values of equality and social justice, I suggest that, at least at these types of global ‘community’ events, cosmopolitanism is produced as a technology of consumption bound to a universalising and assimilationist model of ‘being political’. I am not suggesting that the Gay Games, or other highly commercialised events of this kind, do not do important work in terms of disrupting the heteronormativity of mainstream cultural or sporting spaces. Since the Gay Games inception, organisers have done a great deal to challenge the institutionalised homophobia of mainstream sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460712436473">Krane and Waldron, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363460712436473">Waitt, 2004</xref>). Likewise, it is not my intention to undermine the innumerable stories of personal transformation linked to participating in the Games. My focus is on the ways in which notions of sexual citizenship are produced and governed alongside discourses of cosmopolitan global living in the media and promotional climates of the event, and how this normalises and/or limits ways of ‘being political’.</p>
<p>My second key argument is that the cosmopolitan sexual citizen is almost always presumed to be a white, western citizen-subject who has access to ‘difference’ through urban living, global travel and through his or her investment in the project of global queer world-making. Finally, my third argument is that becoming a cosmopolitan sexual citizen involves a set of consumptive practices that fetishise and Other non-white bodies and lives. I argue that at large global gay and lesbian events like the Gay Games, local histories and bodies are mediated as sites of consumption that affirm sexual citizens’ status as global cosmopolitan citizens and define the parameters of an imagined queer world. Before pursuing these arguments in relation to my case study however, I want to clarify how cosmopolitanism is being used in the context of this article and tease out the relationship between cosmopolitanism and sexual citizenship in greater detail.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1363460712436473"><title>Defining the cosmopolitan sexual citizen</title>
<p>A very simple definition of cosmopolitanism is being open and able to interact with a variety of world cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460712436473">Hannerz, 1990</xref>). Cosmopolitanism thus describes a group of people who have ‘become seemingly more diverse, more international, more <italic>worldly</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436473">Latham, 2006</xref>: 92, original emphasis). It is often associated with global travel, and/or with living in a city where mixing with a range of people from different cultures is part of everyday experiences. In this article, I consider the broader political economy of cosmopolitanism from within which an entire set of cultural and consumer practices define and govern what it means to be a cosmopolite. Jon Binnie, Julian Holloway, Steve Millington and Craig Young offer this broader perspective in the introduction to the edited collection <italic>Cosmopolitan Urbanism</italic>. They argue that being a cosmopolitan citizen is a ‘classed phenomenon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460712436473">Binnie et al., 2006</xref>: 8–9) linked to various tenets of cultural citizenship:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Cosmopolitanism] is bound up with notions of knowledge, cultural capital and education: being worldly, being able to navigate between and within different cultures, requires confidence, skill and money … a cosmopolitan disposition is most often associated with transnational elites that have risen to power and visibility in the neo-liberal era. (2006: 8–9)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In making this link between cosmopolitanism and class, Binnie et al. argue that to be a cosmopolite is to have and/or to have access to certain bodies of knowledge, particular socio-cultural norms, particular experiences of urban living, specific types of consumption, a certain level of education and so on. From within the changing conditions of global living there emerges a new type of urban class, and being part of this grouping is about having certain lifestyle interests and experiences. Ulrich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712436473">Beck (2004)</xref> presses this point further, suggesting that the idea of a cosmopolitan citizen feeds an economy of excess that depends on the fetishisation and consumption of the Other. He writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Cosmopolitanism has itself become a commodity; the glitter of cultural difference fetches a good price. Images of an in-between world, of the black body, exotic beauty, exotic music, exotic food and so on, are globally cannibalised, re-staged and consumed as produce for mass markets. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712436473">Beck, 2004</xref>: 150–151)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For Beck, the desire to be more cosmopolitan, to acquire the quality of ‘being worldly’ is about making a number of consumer choices – travelling to certain ‘exotic’ places, buying certain types of consumer products, eating in certain ‘ethnic’ suburbs – that overlook the operations of power and give majoritarian cultures cause and permission to consume minoritarian Others. In a similar way, Annemarie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460712436473">Bodaar (2006)</xref> suggests that cosmopolitanism is produced and secured by defining and managing those bodies and spaces that are deemed ‘non-cosmopolitan’. The multiple strategies with which governments and businesses gentrify and commodify ‘multicultural’ or ‘ethnic’ neighbourhoods are central to her definition of cosmopolitanism and she takes into account the ways in which residents of these neighbourhoods are often deeply invested in cosmopolising initiatives because they improve their neighbourhood services and infrastructure. What is significant, Bodaar suggests, is that as certain urban spaces are being (re)produced and (re)structured as cosmopolitan, other spaces and other neighbourhoods become marked as non-cosmopolitan. The production of this duality – cosmopolitan (space)/non-cosmopolitan (space) – becomes particularly problematic when it comes to limit what constitutes intelligible or unintelligible cosmopolitan citizenship. These dualities fail to engage with the complex and often paradoxical ways in which urban spaces are experienced and/or lived in, particularly by sexual citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363460712436473">Binnie, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460712436473">Johnson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363460712436473">Valentine and Skelton, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>These broader approaches to cosmopolitanism, which define the cosmopolite as a subject position produced and governed from within the changing conditions of global living, are useful in asking how cosmopolitan <italic>sexual citizenship</italic> is produced at large gay and lesbian tourist events such as the Gay Games. A growing body of work considers the relationship between cosmopolitanism and sexual citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712436473">Binnie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712436473">Binnie and Skeggs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436473">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363460712436473">Rushbrook, 2002</xref>), focusing primarily on the ways in which the gentrification of gay and lesbian neighbourhoods has transformed these marginal areas into cultural hubs that are widely consumable by ‘straight’ residents and tourists. As manufactured sites of ‘difference’, these areas become branded as zones of tolerance and inclusion, but also sites of pleasure and spectacle. As such, practices of sexual dissidence are replaced by normalised and sanitised representations of queer living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712436473">Binnie and Skeggs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363460712436473">Rushbrook, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363460712436473">Warner, 2000</xref>). Sexual citizens are thus positioned as cosmopolitan Others, consumable by (straight) visitors and tourists as they move through these urban spaces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363460712436473">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Building on this work, in this article I ask how sexual citizens are invited to pursue the promise of cosmopolitanism by participating in similar consumptive and lifestyle practices that are bound to class and heavily invested in certain forms of cultural capital. I approach cosmopolitan sexual citizenship as a broad set of practices and modes of consumption that produce and govern a type of sexual subject whose lifestyle, political and consumer choices qualify as suitably ‘cosmopolitan’. As part of a much larger project of imagining a global gay and lesbian community, certain cultural experiences and/or consumptive practices are promoted and sold as evidence of increased political freedom, social mobility and economic choice for sexual citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712436473">Chasin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363460712436473">Sender, 2004</xref>). Travelling to global gay and lesbian events like the Gay Games and participating in the various economies that organise these events (accommodation, event tickets, parties, tourism), allows participants to identify as outward-looking, ‘freedom-loving’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363460712436473">Rose, 1999</xref>: 61) sexual citizens and as global cosmopolites who embrace and celebrate ‘difference’ through their tourist experiences.</p>
<p>Jasbir K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460712436473">Puar (2002)</xref> argues that travel has long functioned as an idealised means of escape for sexual citizens, especially for those who are closeted and/or oppressed within their local context. Certain holiday destinations – global queer cities, gay and lesbian cruises, global community events – are viewed as sites of belonging that shape individuals’ social and political identities. Puar, while acknowledging the importance of tourism in shaping queer identities, insists that more thought needs to be given to the ways in which gay and lesbian tourism impacts upon the local places and communities playing host to large gay and lesbian tourist events. Similarly, Lynda Johnson points out that tourism is ‘constructed through difference, the exotic, recreation and displacement’ (2005: 15) and thus is always a paradoxical cultural practice for queer travellers. Throughout this analysis, I consider the ways in which both Sydney as host city and Australia as host country were produced as cosmopolitan travel destinations. I illustrate how throughout the event, Australia was mediated as a model host country for a gay and lesbian community event of this scale and as a unique tourist destination for international visitors. Consuming certain aspects of ‘the local’ – Sydney’s multicultural suburbs, its sun-drenched beaches, the unique landscape of rural Australia, its colonial history and its Indigenous cultures – were seen as important features of a complete and unique cosmopolitan Australian experience. Australia’s adherence to the norms of queer western cultures (governed as they are by rights-based ideologies) together with its unique location and history, were used to affirm participants’ status as global cosmopolites and as fully-fledged sexual citizens.</p>
<p>Elsewhere I have argued with Cristyn Davies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712436473">Burns and Davies, 2009</xref>), that in the past three decades the sexual citizen has been positioned as the ultimate cosmopolitan consumer-citizen. The emergence of pink economy discourse has framed gay men, and to a much lesser extent lesbians, as a homogenous niche of consumers with a particularly high level of disposable income and leisure time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712436473">Binnie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712436473">Chasin, 2000</xref>). Their assumed social and spending priorities have located them as part of an urban ‘creative class’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460712436473">Halberstam, 2005</xref>: 15) whose sensibilities and tastes are seen as exemplarily diverse, stylish and inclusive. As Davies and I, along with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363460712436473">Brady, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460712436473">Miller, 2005</xref>) argue, this is perhaps best illustrated by the success of the television makeover show <italic>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</italic> (Bravo), where hapless straight men from Tri-state New York are given lifestyle tips from a team of five ‘fab’ gay men from Manhattan. This advice covers everything from how to get a better job, to how to attend a gallery opening, to how to romantically propose to a long-term girlfriend. On <italic>Queer Eye</italic>, consuming differently and learning to work on the self are the secrets to greater personal and professional success for straight men. Gay men from the metropolis are positioned as model cosmopolitan consumer-citizens and entrepreneurs of the self, who celebrate their difference and navigate new social and cultural terrains with grace, style and ease. Gay masculinity is, on the one hand, produced as the cosmopolitan norm, representing the standard of openness, cultural know-how and style mainstream viewers should aspire to. On the other hand, the fabulous team of gay men on <italic>Queer Eye</italic> function as cosmopolitan Others whose tips and time are consumable by both their makeoverees and their viewing audience.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this article, I return to the Sydney 2002 Opening Ceremony and suggest that participants were encouraged to see themselves in a similar way, as highly skilled, globally-minded urbanites who embrace diversity, difference and change. Cosmopolitan sexual citizenship was assembled by developing a sense of personal and collective pride, freedom and self-efficacy, all neoliberal mentalities that position the individual as ‘in control’ of his or her social and political destiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363460712436473">Rose, 1999</xref>). At the same time, cosmopolitan sexual citizenship was affirmed by certain lifestyle sensibilities or tastes that rely on the consumption of non-cosmopolitan places and non-cosmopolitan citizens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1363460712436473"><title>Cosmopolising the Gay Games movement</title>
<p>The Gay Games is a quadrennial sports and cultural event hosted by different global cities around the world. Since 1982 when the first Games were held in San Francisco, the event has grown in size and popularity, with the 2002 Games in Sydney attracting over 12,000 participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436473">Burns, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363460712436473">5</xref></sup> The Gay Games began as a relatively small community sporting event hosting 1350 athletes from 11 nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363460712436473">Symons, 2004</xref>) and was run on a modest budget of US $380,000. Since then the Games have become a hallmark gay and lesbian mega-event with a budget exceeding US$ 10 m. Host teams have come under mounting pressure to secure large corporate sponsors and attract large numbers of international participants. As such, organisers have fostered a public image of healthy, wealthy and wholesome gays and lesbians, and participants are promised a once in a lifetime cultural experience that will be personally and politically transformative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460712436473">Miller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712436473">Probyn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363460712436473">Pronger, 2000</xref>). While it is important to acknowledge the expanding programme of arts-based events and the modest scholarship programme aimed at diversifying the countries and ethnic groups taking part in the Games, the ‘community’ represented at the Games remains very homogenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436473">Burns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363460712436473">Waitt, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>With the Sydney 2002 Gay Games marking the first Games to be held in the southern hemisphere, the uniqueness of Australia as the host nation was considered central in attracting large numbers of participants to the event and the Opening Ceremony celebration aimed to establish the tone and atmosphere of these uniquely ‘Australian’ games. Australia was positioned as the centre of the Asian-Pacific region, and the host city Sydney, as a diverse and inclusive global city. At the same time, Australia’s rural landscape, its Indigenous populations and its history as a penal colony were used to sell Australia as a unique Gay Games host and holiday destination. For instance, according to the Team Sydney Bid documents, the Opening Ceremony aimed to ‘take the audience on a journey’ that would begin ‘in the dreamtime of Indigenous Australia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363460712436473">Sydney 2002 Gay Games Bid Ltd., 1997</xref>: 19) with an official Welcome given by a gay or lesbian Aboriginal elder. They believed that a welcome of this kind would promote the ‘spirit of peace and unity’ and serve as ‘recognition of the true heritage of [the Australian] land… [and] set the scene for the first Gay Games in the Southern Hemisphere, a Games where international inclusion [was] embraced’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363460712436473">Sydney 2002 Gay Games Bid Ltd., 1997</xref>: 19). Promotional materials also promised that the Opening would emphasise the uniqueness of the Asian/Pacific region through the incorporation of musical and dance performances specific to various cultures in the region. These uniquely ‘local’ and ‘regional’ features of the Opening would be combined with the more formal traditions of past Gay Games, modelled as they have been since the 1982 Games in San Francisco, after the modern Olympic Games: Speeches from Federation of Gay Games Board members,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1363460712436473">6</xref></sup> displaying of the Gay Games Federation flag, lighting of the Gay Games flame, and singing an official Sydney 2002 event anthem.</p>
<p>The ways in which local gay and lesbian communities have contributed to an imagined global rights movement was also used to promote the Opening Ceremony as a significant cultural event. At a press conference days before the opening night, Director of the ceremony, Ignatius Jones suggested that one of the biggest challenges for organisers was profiling the true strength and diversity of Australia’s gay and lesbian community. Jones and his team of choreographers aimed to tell a story about gay and lesbian Sydney past and present and to envision the possibilities for its future. The ceremony thus traced a tidy teleology that began with the early oppression of gays and lesbians in the penal colony and moved the audience through key periods of transformation and change — early community protests and the first Mardi Gras in 1978; the birth of the drag scene in Sydney’s sex districts; the grief, loss and vilification experienced by gays and lesbians at the onset of the AIDS epidemic; the rise in counter-political queer movements based on pride, celebration and visibility; and finally, the regionalisation and globalisation of queer communities. This story of transformation, from persecution to celebration, operated as the central theme for the Opening Ceremony. Violence and inequalities were things of past and contemporary queer life in Australia (and in other parts of the ‘western’ world) was constructed through discourses of equity, outreach and celebration. Gay Games participants and spectators were invited to insert themselves into this spectacle of progress and to view themselves as part of both a local and global story of social and political transformation.</p>
<p>The evening’s narrative was organised into nine closely linked segments: ‘Prelude’; ‘The Parade of Heroes’; ‘Welcome to Sydney 2002’; ‘Our Struggle: Persecution and Perseverance’; ‘Remembrance’; ‘Acceptance: Love and Pride’; ‘Celebration: Under New Skies’; ‘Official Opening’; and ‘Finale’. Each segment was produced using a combination of music, dance performance, images, light and various special effects. In the following subsections, I offer close readings of two of the nine ceremony segments – Segment 2: ‘The Parade of Heroes’ and Segment 3: ‘Welcome’ – suggesting that in each, the sexual citizen is produced as a self-determined, fully-enlightened global cosmopolite. Being part of this global event was about being open to change, embracing difference and diversity and imagining oneself as part of a global queer world. Moreover, the cosmopolitan sexual citizen was in all cases defined against what it is not, the cosmopolitan Other, who was mediated through a series of consumable and tokenistic signifiers of ethnic and cultural difference.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1363460712436473"><title>Segment 2: The Parade of Heroes</title>
<p>After a short prelude (Segment 1) of performances by local musicians, the Sydney 2002 Opening Ceremony officially got under way with the Gay Games ‘Parade of Heroes’. All accredited Games participants could take part in the parade and in keeping with Gay Games tradition and with the spirit of the modern Olympic Games, participants were marched into the stadium by country. As each country entered the large stadium, they were introduced by well-known local drag divas Vanessa Wagner and Portia Turbo. There were three particular points during the parade that Wagner and Turbo signalled as important historic and political moments for the Games, and in each case, the audience were on their feet in applause. These moments, I would argue, say much more about the mediation of cosmopolitan sexual citizenship than they do about the transformative political reach of the Sydney 2002 Gay Games. The first moment was when Yasir Samir, Iraq’s sole competitor, ‘took his place amongst the heroes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712436473">DV8TV, 2002</xref>); the second when the East Timorese athlete entered the stadium; and the third was when the athletes from Team India and Team Pakistan decided to march together.</p>
<p>The following day, the local gay and lesbian community broadsheet, the <italic>Sydney Star Observer</italic> described these three instances as moments in the programme when the audience really ‘gave it up’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363460712436473">Mills, 2002</xref>) for the participants. Speaking specifically about Yasir Samir’s entrance into the stadium as a representative of Iraq, the news article stated:

<p>Samir, who says he is ‘twenty-twelve’, left Baghdad at the age of nine and has been living in London ever since. Initially he hoped to compete in his sport (touch football) with other Iraqis, but after a fruitless search, he eventually hooked up with one of the two Melbourne teams competing in Sydney. He’s been playing football for eight years, but this is his first time at a Gay Games. So how did he feel hearing the cheer for Iraq at the opening ceremony? ‘Really, really good,’ he says. ‘I wasn’t really sure what to expect coming in, but it was fantastic, a very nice feeling.’ (‘Waving the flag’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363460712436473"><italic>Sydney Star Observer</italic>, 2002</xref>: 13)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite having lived in London for many years, Samir is narrated as an outsider of the global queer community, and his description of his age as ‘twenty-twelve’ is held up as charming evidence of this outsider status. After a ‘fruitless’ search for other Iraqi athletes, he turned to the well-established Melbourne football team to participate in the sport he loves. Iraq is positioned as a place devoid of any public queer life and both Australia and the Gay Games function as spaces of refuge for this ‘small world’ gay athlete. There seems to be an assumption that, given his country of ‘origin’, he <italic>must</italic> have had to overcome a great deal to get to the Games and that this type of large community gathering was entirely foreign to him. Samir is positioned on the periphery of an imagined global queer world, as a non-citizen, or, at best, as a sexual subject in the process of becoming a politically awakened, fully-fledged sexual citizen.</p>
<p>As the sexual non-citizen, Samir’s body is (re)produced against the norms and truths governing what it means to be a fully-fledged sexual citizen, and these norms are deeply invested in the values of global cosmopolitanism. In the ‘parade of heroes’, participants from western countries are ‘heroes’ because they are self-actualised agents of change who are tolerant, inclusive and validate the lives of those who have not yet actualised the conditions of full sexual citizenship. Sexual citizenship is defined by very particular forms of social and political freedom, having access to certain types of cultural knowledge and experiences, being able to make certain personal choices and being willing and active participants at global community events like the Games. In contrast, sexual non-citizens like Samir are defined as cosmopolitan Others who are heroes because they dare, against the odds, to embark on the journey towards full sexual citizenship.</p>
<p>Of course there is something terribly significant about the particular bodies and national histories being held up as examples of incomplete or failed cosmopolitan sexual citizenship. In the case of Samir, he is not just <italic>any</italic> sexual non-citizen or cosmopolitan Other. As a young gay man from Iraq, his body is marked with a series of complex and contradictory meanings about sexual identity, ethnicity and citizenship (both nationally and globally). The Gay Games were held in Sydney only one year after 9/11 and only a month after several Australians were killed in the terrorist blasts in the popular holiday nightclub on the Indonesian island, Bali. News coverage before and after Sydney 2002 suggested that the number of international participants taking part in these Games was down because of a widespread reluctance to travel by air and because of mounting fears of further terrorist attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436473">Burns, 2011</xref>). At that particular historical juncture, the figure of the young Muslim man was, internationally, bound to discourses of national panic and fear, and in the USA was used to shore up American exceptionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363460712436473">Puar, 2007</xref>). Samir’s body is mediated against what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363460712436473">Puar (2007: xviii)</xref> refers to as ‘terrorist masculinities’, representations that shifted the ‘terms of degeneracy’ in the transnational imaginary during the so-called ‘war on terror’ such that ‘homosexuality [was] no longer a priori excluded from nationalist formations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363460712436473">Puar, 2007</xref>: xxiii). Puar maintains that a very normative model of homosexuality was produced against the image of the racialised terrorist-outsider. Sexual citizens of a particular <italic>kind</italic> (white, middle class, patriots) were rearticulated from their place on the national periphery to be read as less foreign and less abject citizens by attaching their political appeals to discourses of normalisation, nationalism and patriotism.</p>
<p>Samir’s participation in the Games then, and the audience’s affirmation of his place in the global queer world being imagined at the event, reproduced the parameters of what constitutes intelligible sexual citizenship and established the terms by which outsiders can gain access to global gay and lesbian networks. The assumed incompleteness of Samir’s (sexual) citizenship and his willingness to participate in this American-born global gay and lesbian event, reaffirmed the values upon which western democratic citizenship is built and upheld the missionary vision and assimilationist impulse of the rights-based gay and lesbian polity inherent in the Gay Games movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363460712436473">Pronger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363460712436473">Waitt, 2004</xref>). Rights-based political platforms have operated as a dominant political platform for gay and lesbian movements in most western countries since the late 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363460712436473">Patton, 2002</xref>), and have been mobilised by US-based global rights organisations such as the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) in the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712436473">Massad, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The audience’s response to Samir’s participation in the Games also reinscribes various mythologies associated with queer world-making and the role of individual sexual citizens in this process. The global queer world imagined in the Parade of Heroes is defined through a series of binaries – West/non-West, developed/undeveloped, here/there – that overlook the myriad ways in which sexuality is defined and practised in <italic>all</italic> parts of the world. The West is represented as a homogonous ‘place’ and as the origin of queer politics and queer lifestyles. As a result, the diverse ways in which non-western countries press the western world to rethink categories of sex and gender are not adequately acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712436473">Altman, 2001</xref>). Additionally, the binarization of West and non-West and of citizen and non-citizen, overlooks the complex and contradictory ways in which heteronormativity continues to legitimate certain forms of social and political violence to sexual minorities living in all parts of the world. While in some cases living in a western democratic country <italic>does</italic> mean that a greater number of legal and social mechanisms are in place to protect sexual minorities, the freedom to be ‘out and proud’ in these western countries is not shared equally across lines of class, race, ethnicity or gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363460712436473">Muñoz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363460712436473">Patton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363460712436473">Phelan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460712436473">Puar, 2002</xref>). Further, as Cindy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363460712436473">Patton (2002)</xref> points out, the legal protection of gays and lesbians written into some (western) countries’ legislation does not necessarily ensure safety or equality. For example, despite its legacy as the ‘motherland’ of queer activism in the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712436473">Altman, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712436473">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712436473">Binnie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363460712436473">Manalansan IV, 1995</xref>), and despite almost four decades of increased visibility in and access to the public realm for sexual minorities, the USA remains a contested national terrain for sexual citizens. Examples include state bans on same-sex marriages, bans on the adoption of children by same-sex couples and the silencing of gays and lesbians in the military through their ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy. In the case of the Gay Games, since the 1986 Games held in San Francisco, the border regulation of people living with HIV/AIDS has been a significant obstacle for event organisers despite American participants representing the largest delegation at each and every one of the Games to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436473">Burns, 2011</xref>). Sexual citizenship in all contexts is fluid, contradictory and unevenly administered rather than an easily defined and accessed set of rights and freedoms available to all.</p>
<p>The queer world imagined in this segment of the Opening Ceremony is an idyllic space where sexual rights, recognition and freedom are affirmed. The gesture of unity offered by Team India and Team Pakistan, and the crowd’s emotive response to it, were underscored by the idea that cultural harmony, peace and reconciliation were <italic>real</italic> possibilities in this queer time and space. In that moment, complex histories were dissolved into a simple message of national, cultural and religious harmony and the Gay Games political reach was bound to these imaginative narratives of transformation and possibility.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1363460712436473"><title>Segment 3: Welcome to Sydney</title>
<p>The Parade of Heroes was followed by Deborah Cheetham singing an official Aboriginal Welcome, acknowledging the original owners of the land: the Eora people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1363460712436473">7</xref></sup> This was followed by her rendition of the Australian national anthem. Throughout the Welcome, the stadium floor was illuminated in yellowish-brown and orange shades that were suggestive of Australian grasses and other vegetation. In addition, white handprints, white dots, and fire were projected across the stadium ground. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1363460712436473">Figure 1</xref> is a still image of Cheetham dressed in an elaborate costume, one of a number of devices used throughout this segment to give the audience a sense of being transported out of the stadium to a different and more ‘exotic’ time and place.

<p>In his descriptive summary of the ceremony, <italic>Sydney Morning Herald</italic> reporter Bryce Hallett defined the significance of the Welcome:
<disp-quote>
<p>... the indigenous [sic] Welcome segment was striking with the use of fire and handprints projected onto the stadium ground, while Deborah Cheetham’s interpretation of <italic>Dali Mana Gamarada</italic> was soul-stirring. Acknowledging the Eora people, the Welcome set an inclusive tone. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436473">Hallett, 2002</xref>: 16)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Hallett suggested that the presence of Indigenous traditions in the ceremony was evidence of its ‘inclusive tone’. He also commented on the Aboriginal<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1363460712436473">8</xref></sup> symbols and motifs used throughout this segment. These were created using high-tech, carefully choreographed light and special effects and were used to create a mythical, primitive, primordial tone for the evening’s opening performances. What, one should ask, did the organisers hope these Indigenous symbols would tell the audience about Australia, about the local gay and lesbian community and/or about the Sydney 2002 Gay Games? How did they contribute to the making of an imagined queer world and/or to the construction of a local narrative of progressive sexual citizenship? Moreover, why does the addition of Indigenous narratives and/or cultural artefacts at a gay and lesbian event of this kind function, as Hallett suggests, as proof or evidence that it is being inclusive? And, if these symbols <italic>are</italic> read by organisers and/or the audience as inclusive, how is the figure of the sexual citizen mobilising the values of global cosmopolitanism?</p>
<p>Perhaps most central to the segment’s narrative was the Biame<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1363460712436473">9</xref></sup> spirit sculpture designed by local Indigenous artist, Idis Stewart. The inflatable artwork, 15 m long and 8 m, was assembled using traditional techniques of Indigenous basket-weaving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363460712436473">Mills, 2002</xref>) and rose up out of the staging platform, illuminated with white, yellow and pink internal lighting (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1363460712436473">Figure 2</xref>, which is more fully discussed in the Conclusion). As the Biame art piece was inflated, smoke was released around it and the dancers involved in the segment positioned themselves around the stadium ground to form the word ‘WELCOME’. These dancers had their bodies painted in primary colours — suggestive of a human rainbow — they wore small grass skirts and were carrying large reflective disks that cast the vectors of overhead lighting around the stadium in various directions. Most of these rainbow dancers were volunteers from the local community and were, perhaps by chance, primarily white. They were joined by a more professional team of dancers who supported Cheetham on the main stage, and by various performers dressed in elaborate costumes moving about the Stadium grounds (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1363460712436473">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1363460712436473">4</xref>). Unlike the rainbow dancers, most of the costumed performers were black and had traditional Indigenous Australian markings painted onto their arms and legs. There was a sense that this Welcome was one that combined the symbols of two marginalised local groups – the Eora people of New South Wales, represented by Cheetham and other black bodies, and Sydney’s gay and lesbian community, here represented as a ‘rainbow’ community, but one with very little racial and ethnic diversity. I am not implying here that ‘blackness’ and ‘whiteness’ are simple or uniform categories, nor that they operate in a simple dichotomy. Furthermore, these categories – black and white – in no way differentiate Indigenous bodies from non-Indigenous bodies in simple or absolute terms. What I am pointing to, however, is that gay community events of this size and nature are usually attended predominantly by white, middle-class members of the gay and lesbian community, with a disproportionate number of gay white men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712436473">Brady, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712436473">Chasin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460712436473">Lenskyj, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363460712436473">Murray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712436473">Podmore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363460712436473">Symons, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363460712436473">Waitt, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363460712436473">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363460712436473">Ward, 2003</xref>). Wendy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712436473">Brady (2001)</xref> argues that the dominant model of ‘queer community’ does not necessarily encapsulate the concerns and struggles of queer Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, even for those who live in Sydney, the ‘<italic>queer</italic> city’. Brady insists that for queer Indigenous Australians, sexuality is not the primary lens through which they frame their personal identity, nor is homophobia their primary point of struggle and oppression. Issues of sustained institutional racism and the reinstatement of neo-colonial policies and practices are often more central in shaping queer Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people’s sense of citizenship. Throughout this segment of the ceremony, the audience was given no context for the various ‘Indigenous’ elements used throughout this segment. There was no explanation or pretext offered for the significance of an Indigenous Australian Welcome, nor did organisers offer a broader historical context for who the Eora people are, what any of the props or costumes meant, who designed them, or how they were significant to this particular event, the Sydney 2002 Gay Games.

<p>Gordon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363460712436473">Waitt (1997)</xref> suggests that tourist events like these games often represent Indigenous cultures using oversimplified or generic images and/or objects. The diversity and complexities of the Indigenous communities are reduced to simple sets of signifiers that tourists can easily consume. A tourist’s encounter with the ‘unique’ or ‘primitive’ features of a place make the traveller’s journey seem more ‘authentic’ or complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436473">Mawani, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712436473">Puar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363460712436473">Waitt, 1997</xref>). Waitt maintains that this is certainly the case for Indigenous Australians whose art, culture and traditions are recolonised again and again by the representations tourism initiatives conjure up of ‘their’ culture:
<disp-quote>
<p>Indigenous people’s representations are stereotypical of the noble savage; male, dark-skinned savages, loin clothed primitives with boomerangs, stone axes, spears, located at their ancestral sites in the outback, performing secret rituals expressed in songs, dances and Dreamtime stories in their stone age art and body paintings. This all occurs against a colourful background of sunset and red-rock. The conjunction of these features implies that Aborigines are living in harmony with nature, and represent the beginnings of humankind. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363460712436473">Waitt, 1997</xref>: 51)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The diversity within Australia’s Indigenous cultures is reduced to souvenir-sized objects and rituals. Counter-narratives about Australia’s ‘past’ and/or representations of Indigenous Australians’ contemporary cultural practices are almost always absent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1363460712436473">10</xref></sup> Nowhere are urban Indigenous communities represented, and non-urban representations reinstate early colonial and anthropological mythologies of ‘Native cultures in a static, “pre-history” state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460712436473">Godwell, 2000</xref>: 246). Indigeneity is used to demonstrate the ‘uniqueness’ of Australia, but this uniqueness is rarely grounded in a historically accurate or culturally appropriate context.</p>
<p>Darren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460712436473">Godwell’s (2000)</xref> work critiques the ways in which these oversimplified representations were used to help Australia secure the Sydney 2000 Olympic bid. He argues that Indigenous peoples’ culture and art forms were used to highlight the uniqueness of Sydney as a potential Olympic city and to make Australia seem like a peculiar and original host nation, setting it apart from other bidders. The Bid Committee used a didgeridoo player at bid presentations around the world and integrated Aboriginal dot art into the bid logo in order to give the IOC the impression that the local Indigenous people wholeheartedly supported the Olympic bid. Godwell explains that when the first round of bid logo proposals were submitted the committee felt that nothing ‘jumped off the page’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460712436473">Godwell, 2000</xref>: 246). One committee member suggested that the logos needed to have ‘Aboriginal content’ and thus invited design firms to resubmit their entries. Godwell also notes that while the bid logo was reminiscent of traditional dot art, the official logo did not use these motifs. Aboriginality was thus used to secure the bid, but not central to the event’s overall publicity campaign. These types of snap shot representations of Aboriginal culture not only reduce Australia’s Indigenous peoples into readily produced and highly consumable objects, they also reinstate the norms of the dominant white national culture. Rey Chow reminds us that the ‘production of the native is in part the production of our postcolonial modernity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460712436473">Chow, 1996</xref>: 124). Chow argues that, ‘as that which is externalized in relation to the white-man-as-subject, the space occupied by the native is essentially objective, the space of the object’ (1996: 124). In objectifying the native Other through modern cultural practices and events such as the preparation of an Olympic bid, the whiteness of Australia’s national fabric is given its ‘ontological consistency and its fundamental structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460712436473">Chow, 1996</xref>: 124).</p>
<p>Although choreographing this segment clearly involved some consultation with local Aboriginal people, the images, figures and costumes used to represent Indigenous culture at the Sydney 2002 Gay Games Opening Ceremony (re)produced Aboriginality as a series of images and objects easily consumable by an international audience. The almost eerie lighting, elaborate projections and smoke effects together with the slow, rhythmic motions of the dancers, iconised Indigenous Australian cultures as primitive, ‘simplistic’ and unevolved. More importantly to this argument however, is the fact that this narrative of ‘Indigenous difference’ was inserted into a progress narrative about gay and lesbian life in Australia and served as the pretext for this global gay and lesbian community celebration. I would argue that like Yasir Samir who marched as a Gay Games hero for Team Iraq and the unnamed athletes from East Timor, Pakistan and India who symbolised the promise and reach of global queer world-building, the representations of Indigeneity in this ceremony, were central in defining the cosmopolitan sexual citizen. International participants were invited to consume the native Other as part of their Australian Gay Games tourist experience, but also as a way of affirming the political reach of the event. The completeness of the cosmopolitan sexual citizen was materialised through the easy consumption of the ‘native’ Indigenous Other and through the assumption of a shared history of oppression.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that the Indigenous communities were at the mercy of Sydney 2002 organisers or spectators. Arguing that the Opening was entirely exploitative or disempowering for the Aboriginal community would fail to acknowledge the efforts and/or agency of those community members involved in the segment itself (e.g. Deborah Cheetman and Idis Stewart). This type of critique mobilises the idea that power acts in uniform and absolute ways and risks reinstating the very thing this analysis attempts to challenge, that there is a singular, shared Indigenous experience. That said, Marcia Langton maintains that, ‘although ideas about Aboriginal culture are constantly recirculated and renegotiated in Australian society, many non-Indigenous Australians continue to hold to the trope of a “Stone Age” Aboriginal culture frozen in time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460712436473">Langton, 2003</xref>: 81). The aim of this critical reading is to highlight the ways in which Indigenous bodies and lives are positioned as cosmopolitan Others whose difference is easily conflated with narratives of homophobic oppression and violence consumable by international audiences.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the Indigenous Welcome was followed by the Australian national anthem, part of which was sung by Cheetham. The audience was thus transported from an Indigenous ‘Stone-age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460712436473">Langton, 2003</xref>) land occupied by spirits and other Aboriginal figures to the space of colonial Australia. The various ‘primitive’ figures like those featured in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1363460712436473">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1363460712436473">4</xref> exited the stadium but the (white) rainbow dancers remained on the field, this time forming themselves into a large map of Australia. An ABC news story outlined the organisers’ decision to have Cheetham sing both the Indigenous Welcome <italic>and</italic> the national anthem:
<disp-quote>
<p>Mr Jones says it will be the first time an indigenous [sic] performer has sung the Australian National Anthem at a major international sporting event. Indigenous soprano Deborah Cheetham will sing the anthem during the opening ceremony. Mr Jones says a traditional Aboriginal ‘welcome to country’ will also be performed. ‘First thing they said was that they were really miffed that at the Olympic Opening Ceremony the welcome to country was not part of the show … it was stuck away in the prelude and nobody saw it,’ Mr Jones said. ‘We actually turned it around and made it a huge feature and that’s how we open … as we say with Deborah, who sings the bejesus out of it,’ he said. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460712436473">International Gay Games, 2002</xref>: 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Unlike the Opening Ceremony of the Sydney Olympics (or of any other international sporting event for that matter), in the idyllic queer world created by the Sydney 2002 Gay Games, Indigenous Australians are not ‘stuck away in the prelude’. At this event, not only was an official and authentic Welcome used as the starting point of the ceremony, Cheetham was given permission to ‘sing the bejesus’ out of the Australian national anthem. The audience is, once again, invited to see themselves as inclusive, cosmopolitan citizens who celebrate and embrace sexual and cultural difference and the Games as a global queer event that celebrates inclusivity.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1363460712436473" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The photograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1363460712436473">Figure 2</xref> shows a photograph of a small glossy flyer that was part of the advertising campaign for the 2006 Chicago Gay Games that succeeded Sydney 2002. The central image on the flyer is the Biame creation spirit used in the Sydney Opening Ceremony Welcome I described earlier. The replication of this ‘local’ Indigenous figure for the promotion of an American event illustrates how the cosmopolitan Other is displayed and (re)appropriated transnationally for another gay and lesbian event.</p>
<p>In this article I have suggested that sexual citizenship is produced alongside discourses of global cosmopolitanism. The sexual citizen is defined by certain types of consumptive practices that are wedded to the neoliberal discourses of freedom and choice deeply invested in certain types of cultural capital. The Sydney 2002 Gay Games mobilised a model of sexual citizenship that assumes a white, western citizen-subject who is wedded to a rights-based model of political change. At the same time, the sexual citizen is positioned to take up a position of worldliness, openness and inclusiveness that defines him or her as a global cosmopolite and invests him or her in the project of global queer world-making. Defining the parameters of cosmopolitan sexual citizenship, I have argued, depends on the bodies, lives and experiences of sexual non-citizens, or Cosmopolitan Others. The Cosmopolitan Other, even in his or her absence, is defined through a series of tokenistic signifiers of diversity and difference that are easily consumable by organisers and participants.</p>
<p>This article invites further discussion and debate around how events like the Gay Games produce and normalise certain models of sexual citizenship both through their investment in a politics of visibility, rights and recognition, but also through their continued reliance on funding from government and/or corporate sponsors. More importantly perhaps, this article signals that more thought needs to be given to the ways in which discourses of sexual citizenship are invested in entrepreneurial constructions of global cosmopolitanism, that see the global cosmopolite as having power to impart cultural harmony, understanding and political change. There is a risk, I would argue, of failing to come to terms with the xenophobic and neo-colonial impetus behind such imaginings, and of reproducing a cosmopolitan sexual citizen who is always defined against that which he/she is not, the cosmopolitan Other.</p>

It is important to point out that the terms within which the cosmopolitan sexual citizen is produced at events like the Gay Games are almost always bound to the fixed identity categories, ‘gay’ and ‘lesbian’ and rarely make space for bisexual, transgender, intersex or queer bodies and lives.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-1363460712436473"><label>3</label><p>Etienne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436473">Balibar’s (1991)</xref> figuration of the citizen-subject reminds us of the ways in which subjectivity is always conferred through national policies and practices. How an individual defines himself or herself as a subject depends on how he or she is defined and framed as a citizen. Likewise it implies that citizens are granted rights and freedoms in exchange for certain responsibilities: orderly conduct, service in the national military, obeying the laws and voting. In linking citizenship to subjectivity, Balibar also acknowledges that when one does not register as an acceptable type of subject, one is often excluded from the status of full citizen. Likewise, when one is denied full citizenship rights, one becomes unintelligible as a human subject and is thus relegated to the status of ‘non-human other’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712436473">Butler, 2004</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn4-1363460712436473"><label>4</label><p>A recent example from the Australian context illustrates the way in which these ‘queer’ spaces become highly contested terrain. An inner city gay male club in Melbourne called The Peel, applied to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in 2007 seeking an exemption to the Equal Opportunities Act. Established as a club for gay men, The Peel quickly became popularised as a fun place to host a hen or stag night for heterosexual couples. Owners and gay male patrons argued that this club was no longer a safe place for gay men to socialise and/or express their sexuality. Having been successful in its appeal, the club now has the right to deny entry to women and heterosexual men. This of course raises a number of additional questions about how ‘gayness’ is proven or read by the staff and how legislation of this kind can be used to deny lesbian women entry into ‘gay’ spaces.</p></fn>

In 1998 the Games went to Amsterdam. In 2002 Sydney played host and in 2006 the event returned to the USA with Chicago playing host. In 2010 the Games were held in Cologne, Germany.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn8-1363460712436473"><label>8</label><p>Throughout this article, ‘Aboriginal’ and/or ‘Aboriginality’ function as categories of identity that are imbued with a number of different, and often conflicting, meanings. As Marcia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460712436473">Langton (2003)</xref> points out, ‘Aboriginal’ and ‘Aboriginality’ are terms that organise people based on ‘racial difference’ and racial difference was not, before colonisation, a way that Indigenous groups in ‘Australia’ ordered or governed ‘difference’. These terms therefore carry with them the colonial legacy of naming and differentiating people by race. They engender the colonial practice of singularising the richness and diversity of Indigenous tribes into a single, umbrella term. Langton argues that these terms are also defined by the enduring stereotypes and beliefs that non-Indigenous Australians place around them in private conversation, public policy and in popular culture. That said, she insists that these terms are also defined by the counter-narratives that Indigenous people themselves attach to these terms. In other words, Aboriginal and Aboriginality also function as terms that are remobilised and reinvented as a matter of resistance and/or cultural rejuvenation.</p></fn>
