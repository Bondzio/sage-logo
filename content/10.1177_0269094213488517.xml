<abstract>
<p>Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) are an increasingly familiar component of the management of places and the delivery of some services. However, how do we know if they succeed? An extended framework for the evaluation of BIDs is developed and then used in primary research on the Pathfinder BIDs in Scotland. The proposed framework, incorporating less tangible aspects of BIDs operations, appears to capture broad dimensions of activities, outcomes, impacts and processes. The Scottish experience shows limitations in traditional evaluation of BIDs and the benefits of an extended evaluation framework.</p>

<body>
<p>Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) are intended to redress decline and improve the resilience and regeneration of specific geographical areas (often town centres and local high streets). The research literature is short of answers to basic questions including whether BIDs work or whether BIDs could be used more extensively or differently to achieve particular development goals. Research has instead focused either on more conceptual or theoretical perspectives relating to urban planning, management and governance or on descriptive examples of the mechanistic aspects of setting up and operating BIDs. Consequently, much of the ‘evidence’ around BIDs is anecdotal or simply assertions of outcomes.</p>
<p>The transferability of the BIDs concept from country to country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094213488517">Hoyt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094213488517">Ward, 2006</xref>) has been remarkable. BIDs, whilst differing in detail from situation to situation, are now recognised widely as one of a range of possible public/private mechanisms to manage and develop locations and activities. The evaluation of the success or otherwise of BIDs is important to understand both what is attempted and achieved and to ensure that BIDs meet the goals of particular local contexts. Evaluation, however, is not a value-free construct and can depend on the viewpoints adopted or included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094213488517">Cook, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The authors were commissioned to undertake a review of Pathfinder BIDs in Scotland and challenged to find a way to evaluate the success of the initial BIDs scheme in Scotland. A range of significant questions emerged but these only partially coincided with traditional evaluation frameworks. The aim of this article is thus to report on the construction of an extended evaluative framework to enable a wider range of questions about the performance of BIDs to be addressed. To achieve this, first the evaluation literature is reviewed. The article then develops an extended framework for BIDs evaluation. This framework is utilised in primary research on the Scottish Pathfinder BIDs experience. Finally, conclusions are drawn in terms of the evaluative framework as well as what the evaluation of the Scottish Pathfinder BIDs reveals.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0269094213488517"><title>The challenge of evaluation: A review of the literature</title>
<p>There is a wider contextual literature on BIDs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094213488517">Mitchell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094213488517">Morçöl et al., 2008</xref>), as well as specific background and discussion of BIDs in the UK (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094213488517">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094213488517">British Retail Consortium, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094213488517">ODPM, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094213488517">2003b</xref>) and in Scotland (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213488517">Davison Porter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094213488517">Peel and Lloyd, 2005</xref>). This is not repeated here. Measuring the performance of BIDs is conceptually and methodologically problematic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094213488517">Mitchell (2009</xref>: 95) notes that ‘the root problem is the very theory that declares city places can be best brought back to life through countless people doing countless things’. It can be almost impossible to attribute changes in an area to the work of BIDs, as there are always national trends, local circumstances and a range of other ongoing initiatives at the same time. BIDs are by definition about changing outcomes, which are not necessarily easy to quantify. A ready-made, standard, mode of operating is not always applicable, although broad principles for approaching evaluation are relevant. Additionally, the need for BIDs to report their success has often led to ‘boosterism’. Rarely do BIDs report failure and it is very difficult to study a BID after it has failed, unless a pre-existing research programme is in place, and even then, considerable difficulties can be envisaged. Accountability is important as BIDs are shaping change in the public realm, spending private sector funding (and sometimes also public sector funding) and impacting on local economies. There has been recognition of a need for, and a call for, research into assessing impacts and accountability of BIDs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094213488517">Morçöl and Wolf, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature does not abound with methodologies for the evaluation of BIDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094213488517">Peel and Lloyd, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094213488517">Reenstra-Bryant, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094213488517">Caruso and Weber (2008)</xref> suggest that the evaluation procedure should be set out as part of the overall strategic programme and should be budgeted for at that point in the process. Businesses would then agree what measures would be used and what would characterise success as part of a logical process. Linking performance measurement to budgeting and resource allocation would offer the opportunity to change funding levels based on the results at the time of a future ballot. This means that although stakeholders may have different priorities and ideas about what constitutes success, a communal approach has been agreed prior to the start of the BID. This, however, is a particular approach to measurement and evaluation of success. It is dependent on agreement upfront, possibly data collection and an unchanging view of the topics and data coverage needed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094213488517">Mitchell (2009)</xref> suggests four categories of evaluation:
<list id="list1-0269094213488517" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>diligence (enumeration of tasks performed);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>effectiveness (the achievement of tangible impacts);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>responsiveness (the satisfaction of wants);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>sociability (the contribution to city life).</p></list-item>
</list>He concludes that: ‘The ultimate value of BIDs is their symbolism as tipping points and optimistic shapers of American cities’ (p. 109), which suggests that less tangible benefits may be as important as the more tangible outcomes. These may be of wider benefit both in terms of impact and in terms of establishing ways of achieving change through public/private partnership, but are difficult to isolate and measure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094213488517"><title>An evaluation framework</title>
<p>It is proposed here that in addition to the ‘obvious’ aspects, there are aspects of evaluation which should go beyond those noted above and which engage with the policy context and the partnership aspects of BIDs. An extended framework for the evaluation of BIDs is thus proposed, building and developing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094213488517">Mitchell (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094213488517">Caruso and Weber (2008)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094213488517">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0269094213488517" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>An extended framework for the evaluation of BIDs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094213488517-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<sec id="sec3-0269094213488517"><title>Diligence</title>
<p>Accountability is a key motive for evaluating BIDs. ‘Diligence’ (the term used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094213488517">Mitchell, 2009</xref>) is the first and most basic level of evaluating BIDs. The BID must ensure that projects which are agreed are undertaken as stipulated, funded, monitored and completed. It also means that business goals are reflected in the selection of projects. It has been argued that the very fact that projects make a visible difference is an adequate justification for the existence of BIDs. It is critical that BIDs are about more than local authority service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094213488517">Peel and Lloyd, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094213488517"><title>Effectiveness and impact</title>
<p>The effectiveness of BIDs requires some understanding of the impact of the projects rather than just whether they have been fulfilled. The level of activity is not a sufficient indicator that the process of BIDs is a success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094213488517">Mitchell, 2009</xref>). To understand impacts it is useful to identify the areas where positive outcomes might be expected and what these might be. Benchmarking is an essential starting point, potentially providing comparative data across BIDs. Qualitative measures will be important (e.g. perceptions of change) but quantitative data is also required. In the UK the lack of correspondence between boundaries for BIDs and other administrative or data collection units (GIS-based crime data is an exception) means that bespoke data must often be collected. Collecting relevant rather than available data must be the goal. Usually, former ‘health check’ style data, if available, is considered desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094213488517">Hogg et al., 2007</xref>). It would be difficult to find evidence from existing studies that any BID project has increased the profit potential of businesses on a par with the marketing initiatives of large multiple retailers or managed retail locations. It is equally hard to say whether BIDs have been cost effective. Evaluation in this regard needs to be sharper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094213488517"><title>Business response</title>
<p>Business response is the measure of whether businesses wish to renew the BID. For member businesses, returns which exceed expenditure on the scheme will always be a yardstick of success. In any BID there will be participants who make their views known to a greater extent than others. Positive anecdotal material is often published on websites. Anecdotes are not a good measure of returns or the likelihood that a BID will be renewed. Self-evaluations should be carefully scrutinised as they are mandates of self promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094213488517">Hoyt, 2008</xref>). It is, however, unfortunate if evaluation of a BID is limited simply to the renewal vote (i.e. delegated to a business view alone) and a more considered and analytic view of the progress and achievements are not taken into consideration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0269094213488517"><title>Social and entrepreneurial capital</title>
<p>Does the collective effort of the BID mobilise and create greater social and entrepreneurial capital? Increasingly it is being recognised that, although business based, BIDs should also be considering their social outcomes. BIDs engagement with regeneration suggests that this should be part of the evaluation process. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094213488517">Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce Conference (2010)</xref> noted that BIDs will need to engage to a greater extent with social outcomes. Arts organisation involvement in other countries such as Australia, Ireland, Germany and Spain exemplifies the importance of non-business participation in BIDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094213488517">Association of Town Centre Management, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094213488517">2006</xref>). This reflects some of the concerns expressed about issues of privatising public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094213488517">Clough and Vanderbeck, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094213488517">Eick, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094213488517">Guy, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094213488517">Minton, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094213488517">Peyroux et al., 2012</xref>), but also reflects the (increasing) need to draw on voluntary groups and activities as part of wider civic roles. It raises issues of identity, civic roles and the focus of activity. This may be reflected in decisions to locate activities and events in a town centre and in the social role of a town centre in the community. Even where a BID operates, it cannot have the same control over the space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094213488517">Teller and Elms, 2010</xref>) as an enclosed or managed shopping centre. BIDs rarely challenge managed shopping centres but increasingly managed shopping centres are challenging town centres by increasing their sense of identity and community engagement. The attractiveness of the managed shopping centre remains considerable and the place-making task of BIDs is to make places which shoppers will wish to patronise and in which businesses will wish to locate because they are different and offer something distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094213488517">Warnaby, 2009</xref>). This type of evaluation poses the underlying question of the extent to which BIDs should be civic based and what sense of the ‘civic’ is desired.</p>
<p>BIDs also create a network which is supportive of the process and which can facilitate sharing of best practice and perhaps comparative data. This potential learning network could bring benefits, build capacity and empower social and entrepreneurial capital. This is recognised in the social capital literature as critical to the development of healthy innovative business practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094213488517">Cooke and Wills, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0269094213488517"><title>Public entrepreneurship</title>
<p>Negotiation and representation of stakeholders may be changed by the existence of a BID. Included here are funding issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094213488517">Cook, 2009</xref>). It is important to distinguish between achieving funding and achieving funding which furthers the goals of the BID and member aspirations. Key to the understanding of the entrepreneurship discussion is the way in which public and private partnerships have been able to deliver something that could not otherwise have been delivered. A BID offers public authorities a recognised body with which to discuss plans. It is important to know whether, and in what ways, this is making a difference for businesses that are often unable to make their views heard amongst the other voices.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094213488517">Grossman (2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094213488517">2010b</xref>) sees the public/private nature of the partnership as key to the concept of BIDs. The partnership is not to favour the goals of either business or public authority but to create a working collective to manage change. He notes (2010a: 155):<disp-quote>
<p>Business Improvement Districts are an addition to, not separation from, democratic governance, and exist at the defining point of a private/public social and economic dichotomy which defines the term ‘community’ in society as disparate or adversarial. As PPPs, however, BIDs dispel this divide in order to achieve progress, and are measured politically by this ability.</p></disp-quote><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094213488517">Grossman concludes (2010a</xref>: 156): ‘the effectiveness of a BID is not that public goods are privatised but that private capacities are used and managed as a public good’. This partnership has certain implications for the future of BIDs in terms of funding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0269094213488517"><title>Shaping future policy</title>
<p>BIDs are only one of a range of ‘new governance’ models for places and spaces, town centre redevelopment and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094213488517">Coca-Stefaniak et al., 2009</xref>). Thematic BIDs and the spread of BIDs from town centres to business parks and other collective activities raise different issues from a town centre-based model. They are less engaged with public spaces and the civic role of places and public benefits of these are much more indirect. The model, which favours public funding, is harder to sustain in this context as the case for public funding is harder to justify. At a time of heightened risk for town centres due to recession capacity building is very important but equally local authorities are keen to off-load financial responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094213488517">De Malaghaes, 2012</xref>). The German application of BIDs to neighbourhood areas extended the BIDs concept, although remaining an initiative for area-based regeneration in designated urban areas. Tourist-based initiatives in Austria saw problems arise between policies for the tourist-based industries and those of other town centre functions. A ‘quarters’-based approach was considered more workable, emphasising the place rather than sectoral aspect of BIDs.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0269094213488517"><title>BIDs in Scotland</title>
<p>Delivering town centre regeneration has been the primary context for BIDs in Scotland, as it has been elsewhere across the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094213488517">BIS, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094213488517">Peel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094213488517">Peel and Lloyd, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094213488517">2008</xref>; Reilly and Aswat, 2009). The arguments for BIDs in the UK and in Scotland have often been supported by statements of their success elsewhere (termed associative discourse), primarily the United States. For example, Lloyd noted in a press release on BIDs in Scotland that:<disp-quote>
<p>A good example of a BID in practice is Times Square in New York which, 15 years ago was a dirty town, down at heel, graffiti covered eyesore. Today following the creation of a BID, it is the safest part of New York, and provides shopping, tourism and entertainment facilities for the city. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094213488517">University of Dundee, 2012</xref>)</p></disp-quote>But Scottish BIDs require evaluation in their own Scottish context.</p>
<p>Business Improvement Districts Scotland (BIDS) is the national organisation for BIDs in Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213488517">Davison Porter, 2011</xref>). It encourages development of, and brings together, individual BIDs from across Scotland, sharing knowledge and information whilst informing and advising on BID policy. The mission statement for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094213488517">Business Improvement Districts Scotland (2013)</xref> states that a BID delivers a sustainable financial model to a defined geographical area of a town, city, commercial district or tourism and visitor area, where businesses have voted to invest collectively in local improvements in addition to those delivered by statutory authorities. They are often, although not exclusively, a partnership arrangement through which the local business community and the statutory authorities can take forward projects which will benefit the local economy. A BID is not a substitute for central or local government investment, but an additional investment to strengthen the local economy and give local businesses a unified voice, helping to provide an arena for businesses and local authorities to increase their understanding of each other’s priorities. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.bids-scotland.com">www.bids-scotland.com</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Key features are the area-based aspect of BIDs, the public private relationship/partnership, the involvement of tenants and owners and the regeneration context with reference to towns and cities (though this does not have to be the focus). In Scotland the sectoral organisation of local authorities (i.e. transport, housing, etc.) has been at the expense of total place-based strategies. BIDs offer one approach to engaging with place making. There is also the very specific benefit that focused, locally raised money is spent locally, on focused activities, unlike business rate income, which is distributed generally across the local authority and all its activities.</p>
<p>The legislative framework for establishing BIDs in Scotland was passed in 2006 and 2007. Through a formal bidding process and review by public/private sector experts, six locations were selected as Pathfinder BID areas. The objective of this Pathfinder process was to test the concept of BIDs and its applicability in Scotland. The six Scottish Pathfinder BIDs were:
<list id="list2-0269094213488517" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Clacks First – incorporating 10 business parks across Clackmannanshire;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Enterprising Bathgate – incorporating Bathgate town centre;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Essential Edinburgh – incorporating the core retail area in Edinburgh city centre;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Falkirk Inspired – incorporating Falkirk town centre;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Glasgow’s Style Mile – incorporating the core retail area in Glasgow city centre; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inverness – incorporating the whole of Inverness city centre.</p></list-item>
</list>Each of the six Pathfinder BIDs was supported by Scottish Government up to the date of their ballot. All of the Pathfinder BIDs proceeded to formal ballot, with five being successfully established as BIDs, and one (Glasgow) marginally losing the vote. The Scottish Government has continued its proactive support for the development of BIDs through the Business Improvement Districts Scotland central support mechanism, but also through the provision of a development grant (of up to £20,000 to be matched locally by an equivalent sum) to support the establishment of new BIDs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094213488517">Table 1</xref> summarises the key aspects of the successful Pathfinder BIDs and those BIDs subsequently established by Autumn 2010.

<sec id="sec10-0269094213488517"><title>Evaluating the Scottish Pathfinder BIDs</title>
<p>In November 2010 the Scottish Government, via Business Improvements Districts Scotland commissioned an evaluation of the performance of the Pathfinder BIDs in Scotland. This work was completed by EKOS Economic and Social Development and the Institute for Retail Studies by the authors of this article. The review was an independent piece of work and was not subject to a prescribed format or pre-specified approach. The purpose of the evaluation was to appraise the effectiveness of BIDs in delivering projects of benefit to levy payers, to explore best practice, to assess the effectiveness of projects delivered and consider the impact of BIDs on local communities in the Pathfinder scheme.</p>
<p>This study specifically sought to investigate the BIDs process from the perspective of how stakeholders are involved and what they can achieve. Interviewees included the original 6 Pathfinder BIDs in Scotland, other operational BIDs in Scotland, operational BIDs in England, businesses operating from BIDs areas and three representative organisations (Business Improvement Districts Scotland, Federation of Small Business and the Association of Town Centre Management). A series of 23 structured interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone with the key respondent in each organisation. The survey questions addressed issues under each of the sections identified earlier in the evaluation framework with a view to determining the contribution of BIDs and the issues arising at the different levels at which BIDs might have an impact. Questions were open ended. Responses from this study would offer a blueprint for a more structured form of questionnaire in the future. Both the degree of consensus and the variety of responses were of interest and are reported in the discussion. A non-attributable approach was taken to the analysis as it was the BID process rather than success or failure of individual BIDs which was of interest. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094213488517">Table 2</xref> summarises the discussion, reported below, organised by the elements of the extended evaluation framework outlined earlier.

<sec id="sec11-0269094213488517"><title>Diligence: Are projects undertaken as stipulated, funded and completed?</title>
<p>Interviewees recognised the need for, and importance of project additionality for the BID, with most citing service level agreements with the local authority and the police. Business Plans were prepared. These involved engagement of businesses through surveys and workshops. Project activity focused around six main areas: delivering marketing and promotion, including events and activities; reducing crime and fear of crime, including lighting and security initiatives; creating a high quality environment, including cleaning, street furniture and blooms; providing advocacy and facilitation services, including lobbying; improving accessibility, including signage and parking; promoting property improvement such as facades. In general, interviewees reported that BID-funded project activity had been additional to that which would have happened without the BID and there was a perception that it would have generated impacts for the BID area. One interviewee said: ‘I know that BID activity is additional because what they are doing wasn’t happening and still wouldn’t be happening without them. They are using the levy to lever other funds’. Some projects were perceived to have been more successful than others. Shop front improvements were cited as successful whilst removal of chewing gum had no lasting benefit. The websites for the BIDs, their annual reports (where they exist) and business plans and budgets demonstrate the accountability, spend and fulfilment of projects. These show that a range of projects have been commissioned and completed. Experience that sometimes they have ‘not got it 100% right’ has changed future activity to be ‘more focused’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0269094213488517"><title>Effectiveness and impact: Where and what outcomes might be expected?</title>
<p>Some interviewees understood the difference between impact and ‘diligence’ in terms of project activity. One interviewee noted: ‘I think that BIDs should be measuring impacts, not activities but I think most are doing the latter’. The BID is charged with delivering economic returns for the businesses that pay the levy. It was acknowledged by all interviewees that performance measurement that demonstrates impacts is difficult. One response was that: ‘KPIs and impacts are essential but I recognise that it is very difficult to demonstrate the effectiveness of BIDs to businesses’. Some agreed that impact assessment was desirable but that resourcing this was too expensive. To date it seems that the Pathfinder BIDs in Scotland have focused on measuring activity and financial leverage and that little has been done on creating other performance indicators. Some data on footfall, crime and vacancy rates is being collected but none of the Pathfinder BIDs had a formal monitoring framework against which key performance indicator data is recorded. Essential Edinburgh comes closest with a quarterly review of trend data entitled Essential Trends which traces footfall, hotel occupancy, retail trade and consumer perceptions. Feedback from businesses showed that they do want information on impact and some form of independent validation of the BID that goes beyond the anecdotal. Such statements were common: ‘I think that the BID project has brought more businesses into the town’, ‘Anecdotal evidence has been very positive’ and ‘Anecdotal and verbal feedback has been very positive. They considered footfall counters but were too expensive’. Projects were not related to expected outcomes through a logic process as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094213488517">Caruso and Weber (2008)</xref>. Demand for better impact data is reflected in several comments: ‘I know we need to do more and it should have been done from the start’, ‘Yes, we need to start doing this … we need to set a baseline to understand the difference’. There was an appreciation that for the future much better demonstration of impact would be desirable. Experience from England shows an increasing recognition of the importance of this data as the BID process has developed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0269094213488517"><title>Business response: Do returns exceed expenditure?</title>
<p>Pathfinder BIDs were confident that the BID projects had made a difference, but this was a perception rather than based on evidence. When asked how they knew that a BID was making a difference to the levy payers responses were: ‘no real way to tell’, ‘don’t think they do know’, ‘don’t know’ and ‘too early to tell’. Other responses were that the BID ‘hasn’t made a difference to my business but the town centre is a better place to run a business from’ and ‘I don’t know. I know that without the BID things would be worse but I have no evidence’. Each of the BIDs was asked about the likelihood that they would seek a further term through a BID ballot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094213488517">1</xref></sup> With one exception they thought that this was likely. One did comment that they ‘would need to scrabble about and get what information they had organised if someone asked for it’. Levy collection on the whole showed good rates of compliance. Some did respond that proof of improvement would be reassuring for levy payers. ‘We are planning to organise our data to use it for the renewal ballot process’ was the response of one interviewee. Three of the BIDs said that they would in future collect better data on the impact of the BID but two continued to think that they did not have the resources to accomplish this: ‘We have no data to measure due to a lack of time and resources to do this’. They seemed satisfied that the improved urban environment and the financial leverage gained by being a BID were adequate reasons to continue the BID. One business reported that: ‘I think I would support the BID for another term but I am not sure after that. I think it has a shelf life and the future may be more about business-to-business support’. Leverage of additional funding varied considerably between BIDs in Scotland. Local authorities and the one-off Town Centre Regeneration Fund have contributed very significantly to extra funding. The levy collected to date and other funding demonstrate that BIDs (Pathfinder and non-Pathfinder) have brought new money into town centre development with £13.70 raised for every £1.00 spent by Scottish Government. At least half is raised from the levy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0269094213488517"><title>Social and entrepreneurial capital: Is such capital mobilised and created?</title>
<p>In the Scottish Government discussion paper on Building a Sustainable Future, BIDs are described as ‘not only improving the trading environment and commercial potential for those businesses involved in the BIDs but contributing to the local community’s wider regeneration aspirations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094213488517">Scottish Government, 2011: para. 58</xref>).</p>
<p>A key feature of the interviewee responses was their enthusiasm for the Pathfinder process, the interchange of ideas and the establishment of a learning network. Of the Pathfinder process one respondent said:<disp-quote>
<p>The Pathfinder was an appropriate route to introduce a new venture and I would support this for future initiatives. It gave clarity on the process. It needed a critical mass to take it forward and [BIDs] wouldn’t have got any interest without the funding and Business Improvement Districts Scotland support.</p></disp-quote>Most of the Scottish BIDs have been involved in offering help and support to new BIDs. The Pathfinder BIDs reported that the process itself was beneficial as it allowed progress to be reviewed and offered the opportunity for BIDs to learn from each other. BIDs reported that they had had face-to-face meetings with other BIDs and telephone contact to improve their understanding of different aspects of BIDs. Interviewees agreed that the sharing of experience had been hugely influential. Answering the question on how non-Pathfinder BIDs have benefited from the knowledge and experience of the Pathfinders one respondent said:<disp-quote>
<p>I think the process generated longer term benefits to non-Pathfinders – building capacity at the local level. It stopped people going down black holes. I think that some Pathfinders have been very supportive in sharing their experiences with new places. This is one of the major benefits of the process. I am not sure that it could have happened without Pathfinder support.</p></disp-quote>For some ‘the process brings benefits’. This is the kind of interaction which builds confidence and resilience. It is the sort of shared risk taking and embeddedness advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094213488517">Cooke and Wills (1999)</xref>. Quantifying questions is possible and desirable for the future.</p>
<p>The making of local places in a global economy demands greater awareness of the wider context of change in urban areas. The establishment of a network offers the possibility of much greater engagement. BIDs, along with other town- and place-based initiatives, including the Town Centre Regeneration Fund, Scottish Towns Group, the Towns website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.scotlandstowns.org/scotlandstowns.html">www.scotlandstowns.org/scotlandstowns.html</ext-link>) and a range of conferences and reports in Scotland, have promoted the importance of the regeneration of towns and the need to build greater resilience in towns. Business Improvement Districts Scotland has the potential to extend the business support and training in a way that can make a difference. Individual BIDs have fostered business to business networking through events such as BID breakfasts and actions such as joint procurement. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094213488517">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the importance of advocacy and networking as an integral part of the Inverness BID.

<sec id="sec15-0269094213488517"><title>Public entrepreneurship: Are new things developed and delivered?</title>
<p>BIDs have played an important lobby role with local authorities. BIDs are seen as bridging the gap between places and local authorities, facilitating lobbying and the presentation of local business views: ‘The BID is a lobby voice. The bulk of the money for local government comes from the city but doesn’t go back into it’. Interviewees were asked to comment on the role of supporting infrastructure, funding and Business Improvement Districts Scotland as a governance structure. A development grant of £20,000 is available from Scottish Government to support the development of a new BID, provided there is local matched funding. Although in government budget terms this is a comparatively small amount of money, this funding is regarded as of critical importance in securing the interest of local partners. It has played a key role in generating interest in the BID process. The supporting infrastructure, which is currently government funded, has also been considered as essential to the process. Some local authorities also offer administrative support in kind. The existence of a BID has helped BID projects to attract other funding which would not been available otherwise. In answer to the question about the importance of funding, interviewees responded using terms such as ‘critical’ and ‘essential’ with doubt that their BIDs would have gone ahead without it and expressing its importance in leveraging other funding. Equally some local authorities have made additional payments to BIDs in their areas, emphasising the importance of the BID in leveraging funds. There was consensus that the Scottish balance of private and public partnership was good practice. It is the combination of the support service and the grant rather than one or the other which is regarded as important to BIDs. Interviewees recognised that BIDs offered the chance to share good practice, help with the BIDs process, and gain support and advice for development of the BID. There is therefore, within the existing BID community in Scotland, a recognition that the public/private partnership aspect works well and is integral to the success of BIDs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0269094213488517"><title>Shaping future policy: What future possibilities are considered?</title>
<p>The original concept of Business Improvements Districts Scotland was that following the Pathfinder stage the public involvement might decrease and Business Improvements Districts Scotland would become independent of public funding. There is, however, overwhelming support for the current model and particularly the start-up funding. Town centre-based BIDs bring private and public funding together to contribute to civic life, both justifying public expenditure and maintaining public accountability. The BIDs Scotland legislation allows for the extension of BIDs to places other than town centres and indeed one of the Pathfinder BIDs is not town centre based. One respondent said: ‘I think BIDs might be suited to a sector perspective e.g. golf, whisky, historic buildings where there is a rationale for businesses to come together to promote their produce’. This could privilege the sectoral over the place aspect of BIDs.</p>
<p>In the Scottish case the wider government aims for regeneration suggest greater community involvement. This represents challenges for BIDs in Scotland. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094213488517">Table 1</xref> shows disparities in numbers of businesses and income amongst BIDs. The rateable values of an area determine the level of finance which can be raised. Smaller and less affluent areas may struggle to raise the finance to provide the levels currently needed for a successful BID. Newly emerging BIDs are paying more per business than the Pathfinders and yet they are in areas where potential funding is lower, e.g. Clarkston. Low rateable values may mean that the percentage levy rate would need to be high to generate sufficient income. The very areas most in need of regeneration may struggle to cope with the current BIDs model as they would not be able to raise sufficient capital.</p>

<sec id="sec17-0269094213488517" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The extended evaluation framework offers a nuanced BIDs evaluation process and moves beyond the assumption that diligence in operation is the most important outcome of BIDs. Conclusions can be drawn from this research in terms of the framework itself and the process of evaluation of the Scottish BIDs to date.</p>
<p>At this point in the development of the framework, it remains at a high level, but with further experience in utilisation, a nested set of measures and components could be developed to sit underneath each element. This would seem an appropriate approach to provide the breadth and depth of coverage, but also open up possibilities of comparisons. The framework captures significant dimensions of BIDs evaluation.</p>
<p>In terms of the evaluation outcomes for Scottish BIDs, some issues are suggested. The lack of evaluation of effectiveness and value for money is both notable and regrettable. At the operational BID level there is little actual data and measurement related to outcomes. Data issues in Scotland, as elsewhere, are well known and there remain problems of obtaining data in a consistent, clear and comparable basis, at an acceptable cost. This needs to be addressed either nationally or such data collection built in to the BID establishment process. Business Improvement Districts Scotland, as the national organisation, has a role here in providing guidance on the key measures and aspects on which evidence should be collected, possibly in sourcing some data and ensuring comparability, and developing guidelines on how all activity should be recorded, captured and evaluated.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, BIDs in Scotland would be stronger as a concept if the mechanisms of change were evidence based. Instead the approach is anecdotal and assertion based, with evidence gathering seen as an afterthought or too costly. There was the suggestion by the participants that the learning process and networking of places has been indicative of the potential for social capital development. Integral to this has been the Pathfinder process and the establishment of cross BID networking and mentoring. Understanding the processes by which BIDs work matters therefore, and if nothing else provides reassurance on enhancing the chances of avoiding failure of activity.</p>
<p>The evaluation framework proposed and operationalised in this article not only includes new aspects of evaluation but also affords the possibility of looking to where, and how, BIDs might develop. In Scotland, there are choices regarding the nature and extent of public/private partnerships. The essence of BIDs is in enabling town centres, high streets or groups of businesses to realise the potential available to them. The wider evaluation framework provides a better measure of the extent to which this happening and how the process might be developed. The Scottish Learning Towns Initiative notably said ‘Participation is the way we do things in Scotland’ (Architecture + Design Scotland, 2012).</p>
<p>Perhaps it is not so much that BIDs’ ‘ultimate value is in their symbolism as tipping points and optimistic shapers of cities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094213488517">Mitchell, 2009</xref>: 109) but rather in their ability to inculcate a new culture which is proactive and ‘can do’, a process which begins from the satisfaction that diligence can be achieved but which goes on to enhance social and entrepreneurial capital at the local level and establish new forms of public/private partnership.</p>
