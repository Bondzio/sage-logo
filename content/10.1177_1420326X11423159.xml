<abstract>
<p>A residential environment configured under inappropriate architectural planning could have a harmful influence on the health of users. Such an issue has led to requirements to improve and to evaluate the health performance of buildings. A proper health performance evaluation would aid tenants or purchasers to make a suitable decision, while also providing building owners and house sellers with useful information regarding the health performance of the buildings. The overall health performance of a building should not merely be a total evaluation score of factors, but a framework that reflects the characteristics and importance of each health-affecting factor. In addition, the overall health performance should include a concept that would enable the use of the tool to estimate and improve the health performance not only at the actual operational stage after completion of a building but over the entire lifecycle including planning, design and construction. To this end, a lifecycle health performance tree (LHT) for sustainable healthy buildings has been developed by this study. Unlike the existing method, which measures the indoor air quality, light and noise factors of a completed space, LHT provides an overall evaluation of the health performance of a space during planning.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11423159" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>A residential environment constructed under inappropriate architectural planning could cause ventilation problems, noise, bad smells, exposure to chemical components and electromagnetic fields, overheating and humidity problems, and mental stresses for the occupants. Such factors would in turn lead to allergies, virus infections, fatigue and various physical and mental diseases and disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11423159">1</xref>]. These issues have led to a demand for improved health performance in buildings and are required for assessment in some green building rating schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11423159">2</xref>]. To accomplish this goal, the first priority would be to assess the health performance of buildings. The health performance evaluation would provide tenants or purchasers with information to make an appropriate decision while at the same time, allow the building owners and house sellers to assess the health performance of buildings. Furthermore, when a health performance evaluation system is configured, the active improvement of the health performance of the building by the project owners and constructors would enhance the environmental credential of the building and be attractive to potential buyers.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the health performance of buildings based on measurements can be adopted at the operational stage of the project lifecycle. However, in order to improve the health performance, the evaluation should be undertaken at the planning, design and construction stages to predict impact of the construction. Several factors should be considered for the evaluation, including the volume and shape of the indoor space, size and direction of openings and materials of building elements. The configuration factors of the space could influence the effect on health of the occupants in a variety of ways. The factors are mainly related to light, noise, heat and air. The degree to which a health factor could influence a user would vary depending on the measurement and evaluation methods. Thus, an analysis of the casual relationship between the possible effects on health of the occupants and the configuration factor of the space is required so as to predict and evaluate the health performance of the space. Furthermore, health factors may have different characteristics in terms of their types and degree of influence on the effect on health of the occupants. Therefore, the evaluation method should be flexible to encompass consideration of all factors, including occupants’ age, period of stay and activities in the space. However, works conducted up to now, including design or case studies on healthy buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11423159">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11423159">4</xref>], health performance of specific factors such as air quality and light quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11423159">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11423159">9</xref>], health-related factors or evaluation items of buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11423159">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11423159">4</xref>], and building configuration factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11423159">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11423159">11</xref>], which do not provide the criteria for an overall health performance evaluation.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to develop an overall framework scheme, a lifecycle health performance tree (LHT), for evaluation of sustainable healthy buildings. The LHT is a guideline for evaluating the overall health performance via the establishment of a health performance evaluation system that takes into account the lifecycle with the building unit space as a basis. Here, the lifecycle includes consideration of all stages of the project process, including the design, planning, procurement, construction, operation and maintenance, and renovation stages. It is not limited to evaluating partial materials or spatial plans. The concept of health performance prediction and evaluation for each project stage is adopted to develop a more realistic, practical and applicable method. The LHT has been developed from the space unit analysis concept of indoor air quality (IAQ) evaluation covered in Lee’s original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11423159">12</xref>], which combined with a lifecycle and space unit analysis. In addition, depending on their physical impact on the occupants, the LHT framework classifies the configuration factors of space into air, heat, noise and lighting categories. The classified health performance areas then would allow the parameters to be evaluated and quantified separately, so to give a prediction of the various health performance factors (HFs). Since it is difficult to directly convert the configuration factors of space (such as the opening, space and services) into health performance, the health performance of each factor is respectively analyzed to quantify the overall health performance.</p>
<p>The LHT covers all the spatial scope of the apartment unit including individual rooms and staircases. The unit space is analyzed with factors that are relevant to the health performance among the configuration factors of space, including the combination of materials and services, volume of the space, shape of the space and direction. Thus, the LHT allows for an evaluation of the health performance by analyzing the configuration factors per unit space. The LHT also predicts the health performance so as to control the configuration factors at the design and construction stages. Feedback on the results of the performance evaluation is conducted at the trial run and maintenance stages and is to be reflected in the next project. In this study, existing health performance evaluations were based on a documentary survey and spatial analysis that led to the development of the concept of LHT.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11423159"><title>Preliminary Study</title>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11423159"><title>Literature Survey</title>
<p>Some of the research conducted up to now has addressed designs or case studies of healthy buildings. For example, Loftness et al. carried out a study on elements that contribute to healthy building design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11423159">4</xref>] and Dili et al. researched traditional and modern architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11423159">3</xref>]. Yu and Kim conducted a study on the health performance of specific areas, including the air and light quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11423159">5</xref>], while Bluyssen et al. researched methods to reduce the impact of construction projects on the IAQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11423159">6</xref>]. Khoder et al. studied the loading rate of dust, Pb, Cd and Ni, and the mass concentration of metals in settled surface dust in domestic houses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11423159">7</xref>]. Brown, Holmes and Harrison researched the applicability of epidemiological methods to the assessment of the risks to human health due to indoor air pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11423159">8</xref>]. Dascalaki and Sermpetzoglou studied the indoor environment quality in school buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11423159">9</xref>]. In a study by Zheng et al., a model to evaluate the overall IAQ by allocating scores according to the weights for the causes of air pollution has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11423159">13</xref>]. However, the evaluation method based on measurement was applicable after the building was completed. As such, the model was not useful for predicting the health performance at the design and planning stage.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11423159"><title>A Part of the IAQ Concept of the LHT Module</title>
<p>An apartment building is generally made up of a combination of several unit spaces that are classified based on the structure of the apartment building. The IAQ of each space could represent other identical spaces. Lee proposed a spatial concept of the LHT by limiting the evaluation solely on the IAQ of an apartment building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11423159">12</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11423159">Figure 1</xref>, the type and quantity of air pollutant that could be emitted from a separate unit space would be identified by analyzing several combinations of materials, such as those comprising the ceiling, walls and floor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11423159">12</xref>].
<fig id="fig1-1420326X11423159" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Analysis of the combination of materials composing a unit space.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423159-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A part of the IAQ performance in the LHT would require two types of key information for the health performance evaluation:
<list id="list1-1420326X11423159" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The material information, which is the quantity of air pollutant emitted per unit area for each material used in the apartment buildings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Information on the combinations of different types of materials that form the walls, ceiling and floors.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>These data are interconnected with the material information to calculate the quantity of air pollutant for each part. Meanwhile, the quantity of air pollutant emitted from the inner laid materials of a wall can be restrained due to the surface material of the wall, which forms a barrier to the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and formaldehyde to indoor air. This can be adjusted by applying a delay ratio. The quantity of air pollutants emitted from each of the overlapping material may be calculated by applying a delay ratio, using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1420326X11423159">Equation (1)</xref> as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1420326X11423159"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423159-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1420326X11423159">Equation (2)</xref>, the air quality of the relevant space in the LHT module is calculated based on the quantity of air pollutant per unit area of each material and the area of each material. This figure is then divided by the space volume. At the first stage, the quantity of air pollutant per unit area of each material is calculated based on the material used for each structure and the data on the material combination. The details of each space are then analyzed so as to generate the quantity of parts and calculate the total quantity of air pollutant emitted. At the second stage, the total quantity of air pollutants per part that composes the space and the volume of the space are analyzed so as to calculate the concentration of air pollutants for the space.

<sec id="sec5-1420326X11423159"><title>Classification of the Health Elements for Residents</title>
<p>Lim classified the elements that could have an impact on the health of residents in the design of a healthy apartment building. Lim divided the elements that affect the design of an apartment building and are desirable for the health of residents into spatial planning elements, environmental planning elements, material planning elements, and construction and maintenance planning elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11423159">1</xref>]. Cho et al. classify the elements and reorganize them into four types of evaluations on healthy residential levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11423159">14</xref>]. This concept is being expanded here by adding a managerial dimension into three other physical, mental and social dimensions defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for holistic health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11423159">15</xref>]. Considering similar attributes and implications among the elements, the overall indicator would consist of 16 evaluation attributes and 40 subattributes based on the 4 evaluation dimensions. These considerations would reflect the applicability of the health performance evaluation as well as the economic feasibility and practicality of the evaluation on an actual apartment building. Among the HFs in the study by Cho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11423159">14</xref>], the attributes that are applied to the LHT evaluation are air quality, noise quality, light quality, and heating quality for an amenity area.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11423159"><title>Analysis on the Health Performance of a Space Unit</title>
<p>The basic unit of health performance is the individual space. Generally, the health performance of the space is divided by the building wall framework, which could vary according to the structure, finishing material and various services, and which would not have a significant impact on the health performance of neighbouring spaces. In addition, since the purpose and the occupant would differ by the various spaces, the criteria for evaluating the health performance would be different. Therefore, it is desirable to measure the health performance of each of the divided space unit. In this section, the concept of configuration factors of the building space is defined.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1420326X11423159"><title>Configuration Factor of Space</title>
<p>In the case of commercial buildings and apartment buildings, the spaces can be divided as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11423159">Figure 2</xref>. The commercial building can be divided into blocks, floors and sections depending on location, shape and function. Further division into rooms is also possible. The lowest spatial concept, the room, is the space that would become the basis for the health performance evaluation. Each room is analyzed by the configuration factors. The configuration factors are the components that would enable analysis of the unit space, including the material, services, volume, shape and opening of the space. The configuration factor would include an evaluation factor (EF) for evaluating the health performance. The EF is the health-related performance of the configuration factor, including the illumination intensity of lighting devices, the amount of lighting and the quantity of pollutants. For example, one of the configuration factors to evaluate the lighting element is the opening of the space. Here, the health performance of the opening is determined by the amount of lighting and this amount becomes the EF.
<fig id="fig2-1420326X11423159" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Concept of space division.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423159-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11423159">Figure 3</xref>, the unit space would retain the elements that could have an impact on the health performance, including the material combinations or placement, the opening, volume and services. The LHT is able to predict and evaluate the health performance by analyzing five configuration factors of a space. For example, the IAQ is predictable at the planning stage by applying ventilation rate, and loading of the material combinations and services, while the illumination of a student room is predictable by considering the lamps, room opening and room volume among the services. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11423159">Figure 3</xref>, the material combinations and services are the information required for the configuration materials used for the space and arrangement, opening, volume and shape can be classified into spatial information.
<fig id="fig3-1420326X11423159" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Concept of spatial analysis of the lifecycle health performance tree (LHT).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423159-fig3.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1420326X11423159"><title>Configuration Factor of Space and Health Performance</title>
<p>The configuration factors of the space should be analyzed to predict the health performance of a unit space. The result of the analysis would be the health performance. The health performance can be evaluated with a wide range of HFs including the air, heat, noise and light. The criteria for such an evaluation should be selected based on the occupant and the purpose of the unit space. Since HFs such as the air, heat, noise and light cannot be measured before the building is completed, the planned configuration factors of the building should be analyzed and the health performance should then be controlled at the design and construction stages. The flow of the performance evaluation from the configuration factors of space, including the materials, spaces and services, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11423159">Figure 4</xref>. The EF of the space and the configuration factors should be evaluated to calculate the HF of the unit space. The overall performance is then assessed by allocating scores according to the weight given for each of the criteria based on the purpose of the space and the occupants. This flow links the spatial concept with the health performance. The preceding part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11423159">Figure 4</xref> was based on the EF evaluation of the space division.
<fig id="fig4-1420326X11423159" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Configuration factors of the space and health performance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423159-fig4.tif"/></fig></p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1420326X11423159"><title>Overall Health Performance of the LHT</title>
<p>The LHT provides and updates information on the health performance evaluation of a unit space. This information can be applied to all stages of a construction project. The evaluation method adopted in the LHT has upper and lower limits in the range of 0 to 100 points for each health performance area for a proper evaluation. The evaluated health performance is then weighted against the criteria and converted into an overall health performance score.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1420326X11423159"><title>LHT Structure</title>
<p>The health performance evaluation tree for the unit space consists of the following EFs: IAQ, noise, heat, light and a detailed evaluation item of each factor. The structure of LHT is as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11423159">Figure 5</xref>. Each factor would include a function for the evaluation of the performance. The evaluation function of each factor (g(x) and f(x) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11423159">Figure 5</xref>) includes the criteria, method and weight per factor for the evaluation.
<fig id="fig5-1420326X11423159" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Structure of the lifecycle health performance tree.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423159-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The initial configuration factor of the space is evaluated based on g(x), the evaluation function per factor. The EF is then correlated to the HF for the evaluation, including the IAQ, noise, heat and light. The evaluated HF is weighted in order to allocate a score to evaluate the overall health performance.</p>
<p>Since different health performances are required for different buildings depending on the occupants, different evaluation criteria should be applied according to the resident’s age, main activities, activity time, records of illness and the purpose of the building. The four EFs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11423159">Figure 5</xref> are calculated and scored based on a method that considers the various factors in order to determine the overall health performance. Here, the f(x) function was used to calculate the overall performance, which is the sum of the g(x) functions per factor. The g(x) function would include the weighted criteria to allocate a score appropriate for the users and the purpose of the building. Since the importance of the four EFs could vary, a different function would be applied depending on the users and the purpose of the building.
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-1420326X11423159"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423159-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>Here,

<list-item><p><italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> : health influence value of a lighting system</p></list-item>

<list-item><p><italic>x</italic><sub>4</sub> : measured pollutant, such as for the IAQ.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The LHT has two sets of weight values; one is based on the degree of the EF’s influence on the HF, while the other type is based on the users of the room and the purpose of the space when calculating the overall health performance. For example, assume that the HF is the IAQ and when analyzing the impact of the VOCs generated from the material combinations and those of the space shape, the influence of the VOCs generated from the materials would be larger than that of the VOCs generated from the space shape. So the VOCs generated from the materials would be weighted. The second weighted value would be applied at the evaluation stage, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11423159">Figure 5</xref>. For example, if the purpose of the space was for cooking (such as in a kitchen), the air quality generated by the services would be more important than the noise quality. As such, a different weight should be applied, and this is shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-1420326X11423159">Equation (4)</xref>.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1420326X11423159"><title>Health Performance Evaluation Method</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11423159">Figure 6</xref>, the health performance per configuration factor is measured, and the range of the scores would vary depending on the scoring range and the method during the scoring process. The final business performance may vary greatly depending on the range of the performance measuring result among the configuration factors or the calculation method. As such, the calculated weight may be meaningless. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the evaluation method for the individual configuration factors and the calculation of the values in order to accurately measure the health performance of the overall evaluation model.
<fig id="fig6-1420326X11423159" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>Adjustment of the scoring range and the concept of evaluation factor (EF) weighted values.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423159-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The scoring range and the evaluation method are set to give the highest score of 100 points and the lowest score of 0 points for each configuration factor of space. That is, the range of the performance generated for each configuration factor shall be adjusted in order to establish an equivalent scoring range. The LHT prevents the weights from becoming meaningless, as an incorrect score is given for evaluation by adjusting the scoring range. A diagram of the concept of scoring range adjustment and weighting is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11423159">Figure 6</xref>. An initial EF is quantitatively evaluated and its result adjusted based on the EF score distribution. An HF score can then be calculated by applying the weight based on the importance of each EF.</p>
<p>In this study, a method to set the upper and lower limits for the performance range in order to adjust the scoring range is proposed. For example, VOCs generated from a material can have a minimum value of 0.3 mg m<sup>−3</sup>, which has no impact on human health, and a maximum value of 50 mg m<sup>−3</sup>, which may be highly harmful to human health. The evaluation range can be formed by setting the formaldehyde from a minimum value of 0 ppm to a maximum value of 100 ppm, which may lead to coma or death, depending on the health risk.</p>
<p>The set upper and lower limit values shall be the criteria for evaluating the health performance. When the upper and lower limit values are not set, the evaluation will become imbalanced since the range where the estimated performance value of the unit space exists would differ with the scoring range. In the case of VOCs, an estimated value ranging from 0.3 mg m<sup>−3</sup> to 50 mg m<sup>−3</sup> is set as the scoring range. A material that generates 40 mg m<sup>−3</sup> of VOCs can be evaluated as a material with very low health effect. However, if there is no scoring range, 40 mg m<sup>−3</sup> can be recognized as a small quantity. In this study, the maximum and minimum performance values of the health performance are set, and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-1420326X11423159">Equations (7)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula8-1420326X11423159">8</xref>) are applied to evaluate the health performance in the range of 0 to 100. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-1420326X11423159">Equation (7)</xref> is a function that is applicable when the maximum value is larger than the minimum performance value. The larger of the maximum and minimum performance values is set as Max and the smaller value is set as Min. Like the generation of pollutants, if the maximum value is smaller than the minimum value, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula8-1420326X11423159">Equation (8)</xref> is applied and the minimum performance value is set as Min and the maximum performance value is set as Max.

Thus, regardless of the unit and volume of the maximum and minimum performance values, an even scoring range and distribution are formed among the performance indicators. However, if the performance value exceeds the maximum performance value or is less than the minimum performance value, it will go beyond the range of 0 ∼ 100. If the performance value is below 0 or above 100, it shall be calculated as 0 points and 100 points, respectively, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11423159">Figure 7</xref>.

<p>The HF generated as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11423159">Figure 6</xref> is applied with different weights depending on the users and the purpose of the space. The LHT calculates the overall health performance of the unit space by adding up the HF applied with the weight. The secondary weight application method is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11423159">Figure 8</xref>.
<fig id="fig8-1420326X11423159" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p>Concept of health performance factor (HF) weighting.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423159-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The weighted value of the HF shall be applied differently according to the users and the purpose of the space. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) or Fuzzy-Delphi analytic hierarchy process (FD-AHP) is widely used for calculating the weight. These methods are effective tools to set the priority of the evaluation alternatives based on the decision making of an expert group. Due to their qualitative characteristics, the methods are especially useful in cases where an objective measurement is difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11423159">16</xref>]. However, the weight of the EFs proposed in this study is not a simple determination of the influence of air quality, noise quality and heating quality on the health through the use of experts; it involves a complicated relationship with multiple factors including the users, purpose, outdoor setting, lifestyle of the residents and so on. That is, the weight of the indoor EFs may vary depending on the city, district and even the complex.</p>
<p>Values converted based on the weight of the air quality, noise quality and heating quality determined from the residential performance evaluation of Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11423159">17</xref>] are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11423159">Table 2</xref>. These are results generated by an expert group and do not consider the residential environment, the lifestyle of residents and so on. While there is a difference between the amenity and the health performance, they are determined to be similar for use as an example here. It requires the selection of an overall health performance weight that is not limited to the amenity in the future. Also, data on weight based on different cases should be obtained so as to be properly applied based on the users and the purpose.

<sec id="sec12-1420326X11423159"><title>Health Performance Evaluation Considering Lifecycle</title>
<p>The EFs including the IAQ, noise and lighting of the buildings are evaluated based on the configuration factors of space, including the material combinations, space arrangement and volume, and services, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11423159">Figure 3</xref>. For an overall performance evaluation, the performance of the calculated factor would require conversion into weight per area or score using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-1420326X11423159">equations (4)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-1420326X11423159">6</xref>). The evaluation criteria established based on the users and the purpose of building shall be applied here. That is, the overall health performance of a unit space is calculated by scoring the elements and applying a weight to them. Unlike the existing health performance measurement method, the LHT can estimate the health performance using the configuration factors of space and can be used in simulation. A diagram of the use of the LHT at each project stage is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1420326X11423159">Figure 9</xref>. When the building users and the purpose of the building are planned at the project planning stage, the health performance evaluation criteria can be selected. Based on the health performance criteria selected at the building design and construction stages, the configuration factors of the space are adjusted to ensure proper health performance. When the building is completed, the actual health performance, not the estimated health performance, is measured at the commissioning and operation and maintenance stages. The performance evaluation criteria can then be modified after the feedback.
<fig id="fig9-1420326X11423159" position="float"><label>Fig. 9.</label><caption><p>Application of the lifecycle health performance tree (LHT) at different project stages.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423159-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The LHT can thus provide information on the evaluation of health performance at all stages of the lifecycle of a construction project. Each health performance value is modified depending on the changes in the planning and construction and the overall health performance can be evaluated. The information on health performance is managed from the project planning stage to the operation and maintenance stage, and the data can be used for future projects when the current project is completed.</p>
<p>The data flow includes various data on materials and services. When a product name is searched or a product code is inserted, the LHT data flow would then be able to provide information on the general performance, company information, price and health performance class. The data that are displayed in the data field of products can be imported from the database (DB) of previous projects. This is an integrated DB that includes the DBs of all newly written project data or a general DB that manages the overall information required for data operation. By allowing the use of data extracted from similar projects when implementing the new project, the data on the health performance and general performance of materials can be utilized efficiently. In addition, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs), defined at the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI) are used for data sharing, which is required for improving the efficiency of the LHT. If the IFC are used, all IFC-based applications can be used together and practical tools for the design analysis, integration and data exchange will be provided. A designer should use the objects provided from the supplier’s library to perform the project and to analyze the cost price, laws and regulations, and productivity.</p>
<p>When applying the LHT for an evaluation of the health performance, the project constructor should consider the cost input to improve the health performance. Since the cost is an input for improving the health performance, it is realistically impossible to indefinitely improve the health performance. Therefore, the health performance depending on the purpose of use at the design and construction stages should be estimated so as to adequately ensure the required performance. An example of cost changes based on the health performance secured at each project stage is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1420326X11423159">Figure 10</xref>. Unlike the initial planning stage, the cost and health performance can be reduced to ensure feasibility at the design stage (A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1420326X11423159">Figure 10</xref>). However, the required health performance should be ensured based on the estimated health performance through the LHT analysis (B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1420326X11423159">Figure 10</xref>). The health performance can be ensured by analyzing the estimated HF and EF information in the LHT.

<sec id="sec13-1420326X11423159" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, the concept of estimation and evaluation by analyzing the health performance with a unit space is proposed. Unlike the existing method of measuring individual health-influencing factors, including the IAQ, light and noise of a constructed space, the LHT proposed in this study enables an evaluation of the overall health performance of a space during planning. The results of this study may be summarized as follows.</p>
<p>Criteria for evaluating the health performance at the planning stage of the project lifecycle were established. The evaluation is reflected in the design stage of the project lifecycle. The health performance is subsequently determined by constructing spaces or rooms with materials selected for good quality at the building construction stage. When the building is completed, the actual health performance, not the estimated health performance, is measured at the operation and maintenance stage and whether or not the planned performance is achieved is checked. The result can be reflected in the next project.</p>
<p>The concept of applying an LHT to the health-influencing factors of a unit space was suggested. In short, a hierarchical tree is proposed to evaluate the health performance of a given space by combining multiple HF such as the air quality, heating, noise and lighting. Each EF is divided into sub-EFs.</p>
<p>A method to convert HFs with different measured values and health performance weights into percentile scores was presented. That is, a method to evenly evaluate the HFs is required since factors such as air, heating, noise and lighting have different measurement scales. The maximum and minimum limits were set for each factor in the range of 0 to 100 points so that they could be evenly evaluated. The evaluated HFs were weighted with a value, which are converted into an overall health performance score.</p>
<p>The LHT proposed in this study would ensure health performance by estimating and measuring the health performance of a unit space and by providing information to purchasers. The LHT should be applied to all construction project stages and should be used for evaluating the health performance.</p></sec>
