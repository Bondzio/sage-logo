<p>While all levels of the auditory pathway may be involved in the production of tinnitus, the trigger can occur at the cochlea, especially the outer hair cell (OHC) level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812467429">1</xref></sup> Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) is an objective assessment tool for determination of OHC function. Several investigators reported that subjects with tinnitus, when compared with nontinnitus control subjects, had elevated hearing thresholds and reduced DPOAE amplitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812467429">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812467429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812467429"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812467429">5</xref></sup> However, there have been inconsistent reports on the relationship between tinnitus and DPOAEs, as DPOAE amplitudes in tinnitus patients have been reported as being lower or higher than in normal-hearing individuals without tinnitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812467429">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812467429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812467429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812467429"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812467429">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>DPOAE responses can vary across subjects, but there have been no reports evaluating intrasubject interaural differences of DPOAE amplitudes in patients suffering from unilateral tinnitus. Thus, the aim of the present study was to compare DPOAE amplitudes between the tinnitus and nontinnitus ears in patients suffering from unilateral tinnitus with relatively good hearing thresholds.</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599812467429" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Medical records of 130 patients suffering from unilateral tinnitus, attending the corresponding author’s clinic for the first time between March 2011 and December 2011, were reviewed. Of the 130 patients, 51 patients showed normal otoscopic examinations, type A tympanometry, and pure-tone average of both ears ≤25 dB hearing loss (HL) at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. It is routine practice to obtain OAEs in patients with tinnitus in the authors’ clinic; however, not all of the patients agreed to undergo the test, especially when hearing was normal. Twenty-seven (53%) of 51 patients who underwent the DPOAE test were enrolled in this study. Any patients with previous otologic diseases, previous ear surgeries, neurologic diseases, acoustic traumas, vascular diseases, previous ototoxic drug usage, or a history of vestibular problems were excluded from the study. All patients who were included in the study had ears with tinnitus, comprising the study group, whereas the contralateral nontinnitus ears acted as control group. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center.</p>
<p>Air conduction pure-tone thresholds were measured for both ears between the frequencies of 250 and 8000 Hz. These hearing assessments were performed in a sound-attenuated acoustic chamber. Air conduction pure-tone thresholds were measured at high frequencies up to 16,000 Hz using an ORBITER-922 (Madsen, Taastrup, Denmark).</p>
<p>The DPOAE measurements were made with an ILO 96 OAE system (Otodynamics Ltd, Herts, United Kingdom). The DPOAE responses were collected in response to pairs of primary tones (f1 and f2; f2/f1 = 1.22), with L1 and L2 both set to 70 dB sound pressure level. DPOAE amplitudes were determined as being the levels of the 2f1-f2 components. DPOAE amplitudes for f2 = 1001, 1257, 1587, 2002, 3174, 4004, 5042, and 6348 Hz were analyzed and compared between tinnitus and nontinnitus ears.</p>
<p>The data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon signed-ranks test for paired observations of pure-tone thresholds and DPOAE amplitudes. A difference was considered statistically significant when <italic>P</italic> was &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The study consisted of 27 patients, of which 14 were male and 13 were female. The patients ranged in age from 11 to 70 years (mean ± SD, 46 ± 16 years). The mean duration of tinnitus was 33 ± 64 weeks (range, 1-360 weeks). The frequencies of tinnitus were 8000 Hz in 10 patients (37%), 6000 Hz in 1 patient, 4000 Hz in 2 patients, 2000 Hz in 2 patients, 1000 Hz in 1 patient, 250 Hz in 2 patients, and 125 Hz in 1 patient. The intensity of the tinnitus was 7 ± 6 dB SL. The frequencies of tinnitus in 8 patients could not be identified (nontonal tinnitus).</p>
<p>The pure-tone average at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz in tinnitus ears was 15 ± 6 dB HL (1-25 dB HL) and in nontinnitus ears was 13 ± 4 dB HL (4-25 dB HL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812467429"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). The pure-tone thresholds throughout the frequencies measured in the tinnitus and nontinnitus ears were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812467429"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>Despite the similarity in pure-tone thresholds, differences in the DPOAE amplitudes between the tinnitus ears and nontinnitus ears were observed at high f2 frequency ranges (4004-6348 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812467429"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). The DPOAE amplitudes in the tinnitus ears for f2 values of 4004, 5042, and 6348 Hz were significantly lower than those in the nontinnitus ears (<italic>P</italic> = .002 for 4004 Hz; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 for 5042 Hz; <italic>P</italic> = .011 for 6348 Hz; Wilcoxon signed-ranks test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812467429"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812467429"><bold>2B</bold></xref>). When only the patients with tonal tinnitus (matched frequencies of 4000 to 8000 Hz) were considered (n = 13), the DPOAE amplitudes in the tinnitus ears for f2 values of 4004, 5042, and 6348 Hz were also significantly lower than those in the nontinnitus ears (<italic>P</italic> = .017 for 4004 Hz; <italic>P</italic> = .002 for 5042 Hz; <italic>P</italic> = .003 for 6348 Hz; Wilcoxon signed-ranks test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812467429"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812467429"><bold>2B</bold></xref>). The DPOAE amplitudes observed at low f2 frequencies (1001-3174 Hz) in the tinnitus and nontinnitus ears were not different from each other.</p>
<p>There were 7 patients who showed interaural threshold differences more than 10 dB at 4000 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812467429"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). All 4 patients who had better hearing in the nontinnitus ears compared with the tinnitus ears showed higher DPOAE amplitudes at the f2 frequency of 4004 Hz compared with the tinnitus ears. Three patients showed better hearing in the tinnitus ears compared with the nontinnitus ears, and 2 of them showed higher DPOAE amplitudes in the nontinnitus ears at the f2 frequency of 4004 Hz compared with the tinnitus ears. At the f2 frequency of 5042 Hz, all 7 patients showed higher DPOAE amplitudes in the nontinnitus ears than in the tinnitus ears regardless of the hearing thresholds. At the f2 frequency of 6348 Hz, 3 of 4 patients who had better hearing in the nontinnitus ears compared with the tinnitus ears and 2 of 3 patients who had better hearing in the tinnitus ears compared with the nontinnitus ears showed higher DPOAE amplitudes in the nontinnitus ears than the tinnitus ears.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>DPOAE is an objective assessment tool for determination of OHC function. DPOAE responses not only depend on hearing loss but also can vary across subjects. We included patients with pure-tone average ≤25 dB HL at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz to minimize the influence of hearing loss on the DPOAE responses, and we compared hearing thresholds at all the frequencies between both ears, and there was no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812467429"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). Also, we tried to avoid individual variability by evaluating intrasubject interaural DPOAE differences in this study.</p>
<p>The presence of significant amounts of energy at the 2F1-F2 frequency is considered a sign that the OHCs in the region of the primaries are functioning normally and is a finding typically observed in individuals with normal audiometric sensitivity. Sensorineural hearing loss is often associated with loss or damage to OHCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812467429">10</xref></sup> When the OHCs become dysfunctional, the energy at the distortion product frequency decreases. In this study, we did not observe any differences in pure-tone averages as well as thresholds at specific frequencies between the tinnitus and nontinnitus ears. However, DPOAE amplitudes in tinnitus ears were smaller than those in nontinnitus ears at f2 frequencies of 4004, 5042, and 6348 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812467429"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>While several reports on the relationship between tinnitus and DPOAEs have been published, the results have been variable. DPOAE levels in tinnitus patients with normal hearing are reported to be lower or higher than in normal-hearing individuals without tinnitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812467429">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812467429"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812467429">7</xref></sup> Two studies reported that tinnitus ears exhibited increased DPOAE amplitudes at high frequencies (4-6.3 kHz) and decreased DPOAE amplitudes at middle frequencies (1650 to 2400 Hz) when compared with healthy ears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812467429">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812467429">9</xref></sup> On the contrary, other studies reported that subjects with tinnitus had reduced DPOAEs when compared with nontinnitus control subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812467429">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812467429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812467429"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812467429">5</xref></sup> In the current study, there were interaural differences in OHC function between ears with and without tinnitus, suggesting that ears with tinnitus had dysfunction of OHCs more frequently than ears without tinnitus, especially at high frequencies. Our results suggest that OHC dysfunction is closely related to the generation of tinnitus, even if there are no differences in hearing thresholds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812467429">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812467429"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812467429">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was reported that tinnitus is probably triggered by hearing loss, and neural plasticity plays a central role in the development of many forms of tinnitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812467429">11</xref></sup> Deafferentation of tonotopically organized central auditory structures leads to increased neuron spontaneous firing rates and neural synchrony in the hearing loss region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812467429">12</xref></sup> Maintaining central hyperactivity in the event of an auditory system sensory deprivation could be done by amplifying “neural noise” due to the overall increase of gain (or sensitivity), ultimately resulting in the generation of tinnitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812467429">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The subjects in the current study had the similar level of hearing loss at high frequencies in both ears; however, bilateral hearing loss cannot explain the unilateral occurrence of tinnitus. More severe OHC dysfunction in tinnitus ears compared with the nontinnitus ears, particularly in high-frequency cochlear regions, may be related to the generation of tinnitus. It was reported that there was a significantly greater loss of OHCs in the tinnitus group compared with the control group in the basal and upper middle turns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812467429">14</xref></sup> Our data suggest that reduced OHC activity may manifest as tinnitus even before there is a shift on the hearing threshold, and reduced peripheral inputs may lead to elevated sensitivity or spontaneous hyperactivity in central structures, which results in tinnitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812467429">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812467429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812467429"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812467429">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812467429">15</xref></sup> Our results are consistent with the previous report that all levels of the auditory pathway may be involved in the production of tinnitus but that the trigger is probably at the OHC level,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812467429">1</xref></sup> at least in these cases.</p>
<p>In summary, our data revealed the presence of reduced DPOAE amplitudes at higher frequencies in the tinnitus ears compared with the contralateral nontinnitus ears. Our findings suggest that DPOAE tests can provide additional diagnostic information for cochlear dysfunction that would be complementary to pure-tone tests when evaluating patients with tinnitus.</p>
