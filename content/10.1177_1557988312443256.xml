<p>In a recent publication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557988312443256">Winstock (2012)</xref> discusses the issue of partner violence and how the perception of the problem determines the involvement of social agents, both formal and informal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557988312443256">Winstock (2012)</xref> also emphasizes that social agents help with coping and that severity of aggression leads to involvement of multiple agencies that provide support services.</p>
<p>Sexual violence within the armed forces is now a focus of public concern. Military sexual trauma (MST) has led to negative outcomes, both psychological and physical, in men and women veterans. Female soldiers who have experienced MST, the incidence of which is as high as 40%, describe it as a betrayal from fellow soldiers, the very ones who should be protecting them. Their view of this negative experience and reaction to it has been described in several publications, and these have brought public attention to the national problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557988312443256">Fraser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1557988312443256">Kelly, Skelton, Patel, &amp; Bradley, 2011</xref>; Mattocks et al., 2011). Men have reported sexual assault in the military, as well, with incidence of 1.6%, and this is associated with depression and somatic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557988312443256">Fraser, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557988312443256">Winstock (2012)</xref> states that the perception of partner violence determines the degree of involvement of social agents.</p>
<p>Similarly, the current perception of MST as a devastating personal and societal problem has led to multiple interventions by VA Healthcare System. Now all veterans are screened for MST and offered counseling services. There is increasing awareness of its consequences by health care providers. In addition, multiple studies are ongoing to determine the most effective treatments for men and women who have experienced MST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557988312443256">Maguen et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The actions of VA Healthcare System underscore the conclusions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557988312443256">Winstock (2012)</xref> that societal perception of problems of interpersonal violence determines involvement of social agents. The VA System has increased its services for MST as awareness of this problem has grown. It is imperative that publications such as the one by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557988312443256">Winstock (2012)</xref> continue to focus on the tragic issue of violence so that this problem is effectively addressed.</p>
