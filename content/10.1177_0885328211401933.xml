<p>Current problems associated with bone allografts include risk of disease transmission, limited availability, and cost. Synthetic scaffolds have been proposed as substitute graft materials to address these issues. Calcium polyphosphate is a novel synthetic scaffold material that has shown good mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Here, we evaluated calcium polyphosphate in terms of its ability to support cell proliferation and differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Calcium polyphosphate, morsellized cancellous bone, and hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate particles were seeded with marrow stromal cells and implanted subcutaneously in the back of NOD/Scid mice. At 7, 14, and 28 days the samples were harvested and the proliferation characteristics and gene expression were analyzed. All tested graft materials had similar proliferation characteristics and gene expression. The subcutaneous environment had a stronger impact on the proliferation and differentiation of the cells than the scaffold material itself. However, it was shown that calcium polyphosphate is superior to hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate and bone in its ability to support cell survival <italic>in vivo</italic>. The study confirmed that calcium polyphosphate has potential for replacing morsellized cancellous bone as a graft material for bone regeneration.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211401933" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than two million bone graft procedures are performed worldwide each year. Roughly 90% of these are done using autograft or allograft bone and only 10% using synthetic materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211401933">1</xref></sup> However, limitations associated with autograft or allograft bone, such as limited availability, cost, and risk of disease transmission, have provided incentive for the development of a synthetic graft material. Impaction allografting is a total hip replacement procedure that uses morsellized allograft bone to restore the bone stock lost due to osteolysis. This procedure could particularly benefit from the development of a suitable synthetic graft material due to the amount of allograft bone required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211401933">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>To promote the repair and regeneration of bone tissue the most common tissue engineering concept is to combine osteogenic cells, osteoinductive factors, and an osteoconductive structural scaffold for cell attachment and orientation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211401933">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211401933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211401933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211401933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211401933"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211401933">8</xref></sup> Marrow stromal cells (MSCs) are a heterogeneous cell population that contains cells with the potential to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and even myoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211401933">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211401933">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211401933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211401933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211401933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211401933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211401933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211401933"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211401933"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211401933">17</xref></sup> They are an attractive cell population for tissue engineering as they can be harvested through bone aspirates, or isolated from fat tissue, and can be readily expanded and purified by virtue of their adherence to tissue culture plastic. MSCs are also thought to be immunosuppressive and it has been suggested that these allogenic cells may be used for transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211401933">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211401933">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>MSCs are not only capable of restoring bone defects but, due to their asymmetric division, the repaired tissue may also be maintained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211401933">10</xref></sup> MSCs give rise to a hierarchy of cell populations within bone such that the developmental continuum can be separated into a series of developmental stages starting with uncommitted MSCs, determined osteoprogenitor cells, preosteoblasts, osteoblasts, and lastly osteocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211401933">2</xref></sup> Cells progress from early progenitors to fully functional matrix synthesizing osteoblasts as a result of the biological periods of cellular proliferation, cellular maturation, and focal mineralization, each associated with characteristic changes in gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211401933">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211401933">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211401933">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Osteoblasts are known to synthesize and secrete Collagen-I (Col-I), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), and other non-collagenous extracellular bone-matrix proteins such as Osteocalcin (OC) and Osteopontin (OP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211401933">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211401933">20</xref></sup> Col-I is prevalent during the initial period of proliferation and extracellular-matrix biosynthesis, followed by ALP which is expressed during the post-proliferative period of extracellular-matrix maturation. Mature mineralizing osteoblasts become embedded into the secreted matrix and differentiate terminally to become osteocytes. These osteocytes do not express ALP, but will express OP and other bone matrix proteins such as OC. Thus, OP and OC appear during the third period of extracellular matrix mineralization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211401933">11</xref></sup> However, the knowledge of the differentiation cascade is based on <italic>in vitro</italic> tissue culture experiments and there is little knowledge of how the gene expression level will change <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>To address the limitations associated with allograft bone, synthetic scaffolds have been proposed as substitutes due to their availability, ease of preparation, and sterilization. Pore size, interconnected porosity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, adequate stiffness, and strength are important properties that need to be considered when a scaffold material is developed for use in bone grafting. Although, to date, no synthetic scaffold material is available that meets all these criteria, there are several classes of materials, including calcium sulfates, bioactive glasses, calcium phosphates, polymers, and composites, that have shown potential. Calcium phosphates have been of particular interest for use as synthetic grafts due to a molecular chemistry that is similar to bone. However, their limitations include limited strength, high brittleness, and poor fatigue properties, and they are generally not fully resorbed during bone remodeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211401933">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211401933">22</xref></sup> Calcium polyphosphate (CPP) is a relatively new class of biodegradable inorganic biomaterial that shows promise in overcoming some of these issues. Its chain-like structure, and ease of hydrolysis at the ‘bridging’ oxygen atoms between the monomers, is ideal for the degradation of CPP into the naturally occurring and readily metabolized calcium orthophosphate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211401933">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211401933">24</xref></sup> In early studies, CPP has shown strong dissolution properties in a biological environment and potential to achieve good mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211401933">25</xref></sup> The goal of this study was to compare CPP with morsellized bone (MB) and biphasic hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) in terms of their ability to support MSC proliferation and differentiation. A recent <italic>in vitro</italic> investigation by Siggers et al. suggested that CPP, similar to MB, supports MSC proliferation rather than differentiation, while HA/TCP pushes MSCs towards differentiation and maturation along the osteogenic lineage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211401933">26</xref></sup> However, due to the inherent limitations of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments it is not known if these findings are reproducible <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore the objective of this study is to examine the proliferation and differentiation characteristics of MSCs seeded on these three substrate materials <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<p>MB chips were harvested from the femora and tibiae of Sprague-Dawley rats. After removing the soft tissue, the bone was crushed into 1–7 mm size particles. Any remaining tissue was removed through several washes in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).</p>
<p>The CPP material used in this study was provided by Dr Pilliar's research group at the University of Toronto.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211401933">27</xref></sup> A CPP powder was formed by first calcining the precursor powder of calcium phosphate monobasic monohydrate in a platinum crucible at 500°C for 10 h. The CPP powder was then melted at 1100°C to produce an amorphous glass, poured directly into distilled water to form an amorphous frit, and then dried in 100% ethanol. Next, the powders were gravity sintered and crushed into angular particles of 1–3 mm in diameter. The resulting particles were previously shown to have an interconnected porous network of 30–45 vol.% porosity and an internal pore size in the range of 100 µm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211401933">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>HA/TCP was purchased from Berkeley Advanced Biomaterials Inc. and consisted of a 20% HA and 80% TCP composition. The particles were 1–3 mm with a pore size of approximately 250 µm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328211401933"><title>Cell isolation, culturing, seeding, and implantation</title>
<p>MSCs were harvested from the femora and tibiae of two 6-week old transgenic GFP+ Sprague-Dawley rats (NBRP, Japan). The bones were crushed and rinsed with PBS. Cell strainers were used to separate the bone marrow cells from the bone fragments. The bone marrow wash was centrifuged, the supernatant aspirated, and the cells suspended in fresh culture medium consisting of Mesencult basal medium (Cat#05401 Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC), 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cat#06471 Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC), and 100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin (P/S), and plated onto 15 cm tissue culture plates. After 4 days, the nonadherent cells were washed off and the attached MSCs were expanded to 80% confluence. The cells were further expanded to passage six then cryopreserved until needed. Before seeding, the cryopreserved MSC were thawed and further expanded in the culture medium to passage nine.</p>
<p>Prior to seeding, the particulate scaffold materials were repeatedly washed in 70% ethanol for a minimum of 48 h, and rinsed in PBS for 24 h. PBS washes were used to remove any traces of ethanol, buffer the scaffold to a more neutral pH, and safeguard cell viability. The particles were divided into the wells of the 24-well nontissue culture treated plate. About 1 mL of culture media was added to each well and the plate was placed in the incubator for 24–48 h prior to seeding.</p>
<p>The culture medium was aspirated from the 24-well plates and the MSCs were seeded onto the scaffolds by pipetting a cell suspension of 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL of culture medium onto the different scaffold particles, resulting in a minimum of 7 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells successfully seeded onto each scaffold. Following a brief 37°C incubation period of 5 min, the plates were centrifuged at 1500 RPM and 4°C for 6 min and then incubated for another 6 h at 37°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211401933">28</xref></sup> After 6 h, the culture medium was removed from the plate and the scaffolds were washed twice with 500 µL of PBS. Chilled PBS (1 mL) was added to each well and stored on ice until transplantation. Seeding efficiencies were calculated as the number of MSC's attached to the scaffold materials divided by the number of cells seeded onto the scaffold. The number of attached cells was determined by subtracting the number of cells in the aspirated culture medium and the subsequent PBS washes from the cells seeded onto the scaffold.</p>
<p>NOD/Scid mice, purchased from the Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), were first anesthetized with Isoflurane, the hair was clipped, and the exposed skin surgically prepared with alcohol pads and iodine. Using sterile tweezers and scissors, the scaffolds were transplanted subcutaneously into the back of the mice. One scaffold of each material (i.e., CPP, HA/TCP, and MB) was implanted in each mouse. After surgery the incisions were closed with Michel clips and wiped with iodine, and the mice were transferred to a clean cage. All <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were performed in triplicates (i.e., three mice per study period) and the samples were harvested after 7, 14, and 28 days. A 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU; BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON) assay was used to determine MSC proliferation. The mice were injected with 100 µL of a 1 mg BrdU/mL mixture with PBS at each implantation site daily 3 days prior to harvesting. In addition, during the 3 days BrdU at a concentration of 0.8 mg/mL was added to the drinking water. An additional mouse, similarly implanted with seeded scaffolds but not given any BrdU, was used as a BrdU-negative control for each time point. For the differentiation analysis with quantitative Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), an additional mouse for each time point was implanted with nonseeded scaffolds to determine the effect of host cell adherence to the scaffolds on qRT-PCR. This differentiation analysis control was useful in observing how effective the techniques to isolate the GFP+ rat cells were. Twenty-four mice were successfully implanted with scaffolds in this study. The Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals, Volume 1, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, 1993) were observed. Animal procedures for this study were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of British Columbia (application #A05-0351).</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328211401933"><title>Cell harvesting</title>
<p>At 7, 14, or 28 days the mice were euthanized using carbon dioxide and the scaffolds extracted. To remove the adherent cells from the material, the samples were placed in 15 mL centrifuge tubes with approximately 1 mL of a collagenase D (1.5 U/mL) /dispase II (2.4 U/mL) activated with calcium chloride and kept at 37°C for 1 h. The samples were quickly rinsed with culture medium and filtered to collect the detached cells which were then stored on ice. The particles were next crushed and incubated at 37°C with another 1 mL of fresh collagenase/dispase for an additional 45 min to harvest the remaining cells. The samples were again rinsed with culture medium and the resulting filtrate was pooled with the initial filtrate. The filtrate was then centrifuged, the supernatant aspirated off, and the cells re-suspended in FACS buffer (PBS + 2 mM EDTA + 2% FBS). Visual inspection of the particles under fluorescence microscope ensured that all the GFP+ cells were harvested and detached from the scaffolds. No GFP+ cells were found in the surrounding tissue. The number of harvested GPP+ cells was divided by the number of seeded cells on each scaffold to determine the fraction of GFP+ cells still viable at each time interval spent <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>To isolate the transplanted GFP+ Rat MSCs from contaminating host cells and scaffold particle debris for subsequent qRT-PCR analysis, the cells were stained with rat-specific anti-CD44 (anti-rat; BD cat# 554869, BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON), anti-IgG2a-PE (Caltag cat# M30004-4, Caltag Laboratories), and anti-PE magnetic beads (Cat#130-048-801, Miltenyi Biotec Inc., CA, USA), and then magnetically sorted using autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., CA, USA). Magnetic sorting was not necessary for analyzing MSC proliferation using the BrdU assay and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328211401933"><title>Cellular proliferation</title>
<p>MSC proliferation was assayed using BrdU. After removing the cells from the scaffold, the filtrate for the BrdU analysis was next stained with anti-rat CD45 (BD Cat# 554876, BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON) and streptavadin-PE (Caltag cat# SA1004-4, Caltag Laboratories). The cells were then fixed, suspended in permeabilization buffer, and intracellularly stained with Allophycocyanin (APC; Alexa Fluor 647) fluorescent protein conjugated anti-BrdU antibody (APC-anti-BrdU; BD cat# 550891, BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON). Before the samples were analyzed using a FACS machine (BD FACSCalibur SE, Mississauga, ON), the cell suspension was diluted by a factor of 4 (total sample volume was 800 µL) and filtered to reach an acceptable scaffold particle debris concentration in the samples for FACS analysis. The analysis involved gating for GFP+ and APC+ labelled cells. Proliferation of GFP+ MSCs was quantified by dividing the total number of double-positive GFP+ and APC+ cells by the total number of GFP+ cells recovered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328211401933"><title>Cellular differentiation</title>
<p>mRNA was extracted from the isolated MSC using the mRNAse-easy kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario) and a thermocycler (Biometra, Goettingen, Germany), and the mRNA concentration was determined using the ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). The mRNA was then reverse transcribed using superscript III (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) and the resulting cDNA concentration determined using ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Taqman probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an Applied Biosystems 7900 HT fast real-time PCR system (Foster City, CA, USA) were used to determine the osteogenic gene expression. The genes of interest were Collagen I (Col I; Taqman#: Rn00801649_gl), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP; Taqman#: Rn00564931_ml), Osteopontin (OP; Taqman#: Rn01449972_ml), and Osteocalcin (OC; Taqman#: Rn00566386_gl). The expression levels of these genes were normalized to the housekeeping gene of Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Taqman#: Hs02758991_gl). Each scaffold was analyzed in duplicates and the values were averaged.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0885328211401933"><title>Statistics</title>
<p>The effect of scaffold material and follow-up time on BrdU incorporation and gene expression was analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA with the scaffold material and time as factors. Student-Newman Keuls <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was also used for BrdU incorporation and gene expression. A <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

The results of the qRT-PCR analysis of the Col-I, ALP, OP, and OC osteogenic markers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211401933">Figure 3</xref>. Although there was a substantial variation in gene expression some trends could be observed. Col-I expression was higher on CPP and MB compared with HA/TCP. The expression peaked at day 14 for CPP and HA/TCP but was lowest at that time on MB. A similar trend was observed for ALP where the expression levels were higher on CPP and MB compared with HA/TCP for day 7 and 14, but while the ALP expression remained similar on HA/TCP, it dropped substantially on CPP and MB by day 28. In the case of both our Col-I and ALP analyses there was statistically no significant difference among the samples (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). OP expression was highest on HA/TCP on day 7 but continuously dropped until day 28. A similar trend was observed on CPP but with much lower expression levels. OP expression on MB decreased from day 7 to day 14 but significantly increased on day 28 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02) to a level substantially higher compared with HA/TCP and CPP at the same time interval. OC expression followed a trend similar to Col-I where on CPP and HA/TCP, the expression peaked at 14 days whereas on MB it was lowest. HA/TCP had the lowest expression levels of OC at each time interval implanted. Except for ALP, expression levels on MB constantly dropped at day 14 and increased again by day 28.

<p>CPP is a promising scaffold material for bone tissue engineering due to its excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211401933">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211401933">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211401933"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211401933">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211401933">29</xref></sup> In addition, MSCs seeded onto CPP showed similar proliferation and differentiation characteristics compared with MB <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211401933">26</xref></sup> In this study, we developed an experimental protocol that allowed us to compare the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation characteristics of MSCs seeded onto CPP to other commonly used tissue engineering scaffolds such as HA/TCP and MB <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Following the seeding protocol of Siggers et al. the MSCs showed excellent adherence to all tested scaffolds with a seeding efficiency of more than 94%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211401933">26</xref></sup> Our experimental protocol allowed us to harvest a sufficient number of GFP+ cells in order to perform reliable FACS and qRT-PCR analysis. It also effectively isolated the GFP+ rat cells from any scaffold debris or host mice cells and improved upon the reproducibility of the results.</p>
<p>Within the first week of transplantation no MSC proliferation was observed, which is consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> data for bone and HA/TCP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211401933">26</xref></sup> There was no difference in MSC proliferation among the different materials, which is in contrast to <italic>in vitro</italic> data where MSC proliferation on HA/TCP was reported to be substantially lower than both CPP and MB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211401933">26</xref></sup> This suggests that the determining factor driving MSC proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>, is the environment and not the scaffold material.</p>
<p>The lack of proliferation at day 7, together with the substantial reduction in relative cell numbers, suggests that approximately 67.4% of the MSC seeded onto CPP, 71.5% of those on HA/TCP, and 80.2% of that on MB died within the first week after transplantation. Despite approximately one third of the transplanted cells showing proliferation at day 14, the decline in relative cell numbers indicates further cell death. The largest decline in cell viability was observed on HA/TCP and on CPP between day 7 and day 14, whereas on MB the relative cell number remained almost constant indicating that cell proliferation and death were in balance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211401933">Figure 1</xref>). At day 28 a substantial decrease in BrdU incorporation was observed for all the scaffold materials. This drop in proliferation and only modest decrease in relative cell numbers on MB, support the notion that cell death and proliferation are balanced. However, the substantial decrease in relative cell numbers on HA/TCP indicates that this scaffold material is less efficient in supporting the survival of MSCs and their progeny. In contrast, on CPP, despite the substantial drop in proliferation at day 28, the relative cell number increased, suggesting that CPP is superior to HA/TCP and MB in its ability to support cell survival <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In addition to an analysis of the proliferation characteristics, an analysis of gene expression helps to determine the extent of differentiation along the osteoblast lineage. Assuming that the house keeping gene GAPDH is expressed at a similar level <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, ALP and COL-I are expressed in an order of magnitude higher levels <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to that found in the <italic>in vitro</italic> study by Siggers et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211401933">26</xref></sup> As it has previously shown that the measurements of GAPDH level within tissue types are reproducible, this assumption for comparison of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> results is not unreasonable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211401933">30</xref></sup> However, late stage marker OP is expressed at an order of magnitude lower while for OC, similar levels of expressions are observed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. This could be a result of the strong induction toward differentiation obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> by using pro-osteogenic supplements in the culture medium, and suggests that the milieu <italic>in vivo</italic> is comparatively more supportive of progenitor maintenance.</p>
<p>The highest OP expression levels were observed on scaffolds on day 7 where no BrdU incorporation was detected. This suggests that the transplanted population already contained a subset of relatively mature osteogenic progenitors and that the scaffolds together with the subcutaneous environment may have supported the differentiation of these cells to a more mature osteoblast population within a week <italic>in vivo</italic>. The high expression of OC on MB suggests that on this substrate these osteoblasts have further matured and that mineralization of the extracellular matrix has started. It is also possible that some active factors were released from the MB, despite the material preparation prior to MSC seeding and transplantation, and that these assisted in the early promotion of bone differentiation on this substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211401933">31</xref></sup> On CPP the expression levels of OP and OC are much lower compared with MB, indicating that on this substrate a smaller population of cells matured or that the maturation was delayed. This delay would also be consistent with the observed increase in OC expression on CPP on day 14 from day 7. In contrast, only a modest amount of OC was expressed on HA/TCP throughout the experimental time frame, which suggests that the majority of the cells on this material did not fully mature. The substantial drop of OP and OC expression on MB, HA/TCP, and to a lesser extent on CPP, together with a high BrdU incorporation at day 14 suggests that most of these mature transplanted osteoblasts died between day 7 and 14 and an immature pre-osteoblast population, also contained in the original transplant, proliferated. Except for MB, this proliferation was not sufficient to maintain relative cell numbers. The increase of OP and OC expression on MB at day 28 and the corresponding drop in BrdU incorporation may be evidence that these proliferating cells differentiated and matured between day 14 and 28. The lack of significant OP expression on CPP and HA/TCP suggests that, similarly to the more mature cells discussed above, progenitors proliferating at day 14 are also subject to a delay in the acquisition of a mature bone transcriptional program specifically on these two substrates. The results from our study contrast those of an earlier study in which CPP and MB supported cell populations containing more immature osteogenic cells, compared to HA/TCP, which was shown to be more effective at inducing differentiation and osteoblast maturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211401933">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>As cell–scaffold interaction is still not fully understood, it is unclear what component of the scaffolds surface directly causes the proliferation and differentiation on CPP, HA/TCP, or MB. However, it is known that on some level how each material interacts with the biological environment is a result of the surface reactions that lead to surface modification and adsorption of molecules, ions, and biomolecules and is influenced by the surface characteristics (i.e. porosity and surface area) of each of the materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211401933">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211401933"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211401933">34</xref></sup> In addition, as this study showed that MSC-seeded scaffolds underwent proliferation but did not show an increasing degree of differentiation with a proliferation decrease, a recommendation for the addition of inductive factors (i.e. growth factors) is included in this report. It is likely that our observations during the 28 days of cell–substrate implantation reflect the different kinetics of differentiation of two distinct subsets of osteogenic cells contained in the heterogeneous donor MSCs cultures. The first burst of differentiation followed directly after implant of the cell substrates but the mature progeny generated at this point appeared to be short lived. BrdU incorporation dramatically increased at day 14, suggesting that a second population of proliferative progenitors was activated by the <italic>in vivo</italic> milieu. Interestingly, however, the drop in proliferation observed on all substrates following day 14 did not correspond to an increase in mature differentiation markers except on MB, suggesting that HA and CPP are less efficient in supporting osteogenic maturation. It seems likely that additional factors may be needed to stimulate this developmental step. Synthetic biomaterials that are endowed with matricellular cues and are able to deliver morphogenic factors are emerging today to guide various tissue regeneration processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211401933">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211401933">36</xref></sup> CPP had a similar impact on cellular growth and differentiation as both MB and HA/TCP, which makes it a promising candidate for a synthetic bone graft substitute. This differs slightly from what was found in the <italic>in vitro</italic> study by Siggers et al. who found that CPP and MB were equally able to support MSC expansion rather than differentiation, and that HA/TCP instead favored MSC differentiation and maturation along the osteogenic lineage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211401933">26</xref></sup> In our <italic>in vivo</italic> study the three materials (CPP, MB, and HA/TCP) were found to be equally able to support both proliferation and differentiation to a point along the osteogenic lineage. One possible reason for the difference in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results is that the environment in the <italic>in vitro</italic> osteogenic media does not fully match what is seen by the cells in their <italic>in vivo</italic> subcutaneous site.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0885328211401933" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, marrow stromal cells seeded on MB chips, CPP, and biphasic HA/TCP were shown to have similar proliferation characteristics and osteogenic gene expression when implanted subcutaneously in mice for a period of 7, 14, and 28 days. Each of the scaffold materials was shown to be able to support immature proliferating MSCs and induce some differentiation of MSCs down the osteogenic lineage. However, analysis of cell survival in combination with the proliferation and differentiation results indicated that CPP is in fact superior in its ability to support cell survival over an <italic>in vivo</italic> period of 28 days. As cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation are all necessary for sustained bone regeneration and growth, CPP has been shown in this study to be a promising synthetic bone graft substitute. The study also verified the effectiveness of the protocol developed for the post-harvest analysis.</p>
