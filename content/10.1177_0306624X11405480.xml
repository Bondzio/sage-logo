<abstract>
<p>Despite recent research, few studies have examined the specific social contexts in which animal cruelty may be learned. Using data collected from 180 inmates at a medium- and maximum-security prison in a southern state, the authors seek to replicate findings from the Hensley and Tallichet study that examined the potential for the onset and recurrence of childhood animal cruelty to become a learned behavior, specifically in terms of demographic characteristics and childhood experiences with witnessing animal abuse. In the current study, those who were younger when they first witnessed animal cruelty initially hurt or killed animals themselves at a younger age. Respondents who had witnessed a family member hurt or kill animals reported engaging in recurrent animal cruelty and were older when they committed their first act of animal cruelty.</p>

<p>As early as 1966, research, particularly among institutionalized populations (i.e., in psychiatric and correctional facilities), began to demonstrate an appreciable link between childhood animal cruelty and antisocial behaviors, including later violence against humans (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11405480">Hellman &amp; Blackman, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11405480">Hensley, Tallichet, &amp; Dutkiewicz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11405480">Kellert &amp; Felthous, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez &amp; Heide, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez, Heide, &amp; Silverman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11405480">Ressler, Burgess, Hartman, Douglas, &amp; McCormack, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11405480">Tallichet &amp; Hensley, 2004</xref>). Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11405480">Bryant (1979)</xref> pointed out, violating the norms related to the humane treatment of animals may be one of the most widespread forms of deviant behavior. Despite recent renewed interest in the exploration of the potential relationship between prior acts of animal cruelty and violence toward humans with incarcerated samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11405480">Hensley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez &amp; Heide, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11405480">Tallichet &amp; Hensley, 2004</xref>), it has been argued that some researchers misunderstand the theoretical and empirical importance of animal abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11405480">Agnew, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11405480">Beirne, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11405480">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11405480">1999</xref>). Bryant’s early assertion, along with the findings of recent studies outlined herein, strongly suggest that animal cruelty is a complex phenomenon with potentially far-reaching implications in the study of deviance. As such, the current study seeks to replicate findings from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet (2005b)</xref> study with respect to how demographic characteristics and the influence of childhood experiences with animal cruelty are related to the age of onset and recurrence of childhood animal cruelty among an incarcerated sample.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Early researchers varied as much in their definitions of animal cruelty as their methods for examining in what some argue is a relatively “misunderstood phenomenon” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet, 2005b</xref>, for a thorough discussion). However, recent research has focused on examining the potential link between acts of cruelty toward animals and later violence toward humans especially among incarcerated samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11405480">Hensley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez &amp; Heide, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11405480">Tallichet &amp; Hensley, 2004</xref>). Unfortunately, few studies of incarcerated populations have examined recurrent animal cruelty or have addressed early exposure to animal cruelty, its potential to influence its later commission, and the age at which this behavior began (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley &amp; Tallichet, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11405480">Kellert &amp; Felthous, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez &amp; Heide, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11405480">Miller &amp; Knutson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11405480">Ressler et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, the current study seeks to replicate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet’s (2005b)</xref> findings as related to the potential for the onset and recurrence of childhood and adolescent animal cruelty to manifest as a learned behavior.</p>
<p>According to social learning theory, and in particular differential association theory, people learn the “hows” and “whys” of engaging in any behavior, including criminal and deviant behaviors. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11405480">Sutherland (1947)</xref>, learning typically takes place with intimate personal groups (i.e., family and friends). In addition, the motives, drives, rationalizations, and attitudes for engaging in any behavior are learned from these same groups. Thus, it can be assumed that children who watch others in their intimate circles engage in animal cruelty would be more likely to engage in the behavior themselves. As stated previously, few studies have explored this very important issue.</p>
<p>In 1985, Kellert and Felthous conducted an in-depth investigation into the context and dynamics behind acts of animal cruelty. Their research consisted of interviews of 172 criminal and noncriminal respondents regarding their antisocial behaviors, environmental background, and involvement with animals, including 16 specific types of animal cruelty. The 102 criminals (32 aggressive, 18 moderately aggressive, and 52 nonaggressive) and 50 noncriminals in Kansas and Connecticut reported 373 acts of animal cruelty with 60% of the participants engaging in at least one act of cruelty toward animals. Kellert and Felthous found that 25% of respondents classified as aggressive criminals reported committing 5 or more acts of animal cruelty as compared with less than 6% of respondents classified as moderate or nonaggressive criminals, whereas respondents classified as noncriminals reported never having engaged in an act of animal cruelty. Their further statistical analyses revealed a significant association between the frequency of childhood animal cruelty and later aggression toward humans as adults. This demonstrated relationship was a foundational finding, for as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez and Heide (2004)</xref> would later point out, the frequency of acts of animal cruelty is indicative of a pattern of escalating violence.</p>
<p>A survey of 314 felony inmates (84% men) at the Iowa Medical and Classification Center by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11405480">Miller and Knutson (1997)</xref> found that 66% of the inmates had hurt or killed animals or had witnessed someone do it. Miller and Knutson also asked the respondents to report who they witnessed commit animal cruelty, the type of cruelty done, what types of animals were involved, the number of times it was committed, the age of the respondent at the time, if anyone was aware that it occurred, and, if so, what were the ramifications of that person’s actions. More than 40% of the respondents reported witnessing an animal being hurt and an additional 50% had witnessed an animal being killed by another individual. Of these two groups, 16% and 31% admitted to hurting an animal or killing a stray animal. Despite the relatively high base rate of exposure to animal cruelty among the sample (71%), the researchers did not find an association between witnessing or committing animal cruelty and the respondent’s criminal charges.</p>
<p>The following year, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11405480">Ressler et al. (1998)</xref> studied animal cruelty in relation to the offenders’ backgrounds, experiences, and ages. More specifically, they examined the early behavioral characteristics of 36 sexual murderers. Of the 36 male respondents, 28 were examined for the existence of certain childhood characteristics, including acts of animal cruelty. Of these, 36% had been cruel to animals as children, 46% were cruel to animals as adolescents, and 36% continued their abusive nature toward animals as adults.</p>
<p>In terms of the investigation of childhood animal cruelty and its relationship to later violence toward humans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez and Heide (2004)</xref> collected data from 45 violent and 45 nonviolent inmates incarcerated in a Florida maximum-security prison (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez et al., 2001</xref>). In addition to recording the frequency with which a given respondent engaged in acts of cruelty toward animals, they also examined factors such as the observance of acts of animal cruelty committed by a family member, friend, acquaintance, or stranger. Not only did their analyses of the frequency measure of animal cruelty support a relationship between prior acts of animal cruelty against wild animals and later acts of human violence, but, and of greater importance to the current study, their research also found that violent participants reported observing more total acts of animal cruelty than nonviolent participants. Although this finding was not statistically significant, Merz-Perez and Heide concluded, based on their qualitative data, that several of the violent participants in their sample reported witnessing the same friend commit the same cruelty on several occasions. This point is relevant to the aim of the present study which examines demographic characteristics and learned-behavioral factors that lead to the onset and recurrence of these violent acts against animals. In addition, Merz-Perez and Heide reported that some of their participants, regardless of their violent or nonviolent classification, “reported abuse that included the victimization of pets that had either been abused or killed by parent figures” (p. 123).</p>
<p>Based on the findings of these recent studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet (2005b)</xref> sought to further investigate the potential relationship between demographic characteristics and the effects of exposure to animal cruelty and an offender’s age of onset of animal cruelty as well as the recurrent nature of their own participation in childhood animal cruelty. They surveyed 261 male inmates at two medium- and one maximum-security prisons in a southern state in an effort to determine whether exposure to animal cruelty (i.e., witnessing a family member, friend, neighbor, and/or stranger hurt or kill animals) affected the respondents’ repeated acts of animal cruelty and the age when the animal abuse first occurred. The researchers also recorded the respondent’s race, educational level, and childhood residence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet (2005b)</xref> found that inmates who were younger when they first witnessed someone hurt or kill animals and those who witnessed a friend hurt or kill animals were more likely to commit animal cruelty more frequently. They also found that the age at which an inmate first witnessed someone hurt or kill animals was positively related to the age at which the inmate first committed an act of animal cruelty. Their findings implied that the onset and recurrence of animal cruelty might have been influenced by members of the respondents’ primary social environments, suggesting that animal cruelty is at least, in part, a learned behavior.</p>
<p>Research into animal cruelty and its corresponding influences remains sparse for incarcerated samples and even fewer of these studies have examined the circumstances under which animal cruelty may be learned. Thus, exploring the factors related to the age of onset and recurrence of acts of animal cruelty represents an opportunity to unravel underlying influential characteristics and suggests possible solutions to deter or even prevent this behavior. Specifically, the current study seeks to replicate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet’s (2005b)</xref> findings through an examination of the age of onset and recurrent nature of acts of animal cruelty in terms of various demographic characteristics (race, education, and residence while growing up) and childhood experiences related to animal cruelty (the age when animal cruelty was witnessed and whether the animal abuser was a family member, friend, neighbor, or stranger).</p>
<p>The current study is different in three important ways. First, the independent variable, saw someone hurt or kill animals, was included in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet’s (2005b)</xref> study, but was removed from the current study. This was done as the questions about whom they witnessed hurt or kill animals captures the information already in this variable. Second, the variable, recurrent animal cruelty, was coded in the Hensley and Tallichet study as 0 = <italic>never</italic>, 1 = <italic>once</italic>, 2 = <italic>twice</italic>, and 3 = <italic>more than twice</italic>. However, for the current study, the same variable is continuous in nature, allowing for a more accurate depiction of recurrent animal cruelty. Finally, the sample in the current study is from a different southern state.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>In March 2007, all inmates housed in one medium- and one maximum-security southern correctional facility for men were provided questionnaires for a study on childhood animal cruelty. Of the 1,800 inmates incarcerated in the two prisons, a total of 180 agreed to participate in the study, yielding a response rate of 10% (as each inmate received a questionnaire). Although this response rate appears low, most prison studies dealing with sensitive issues attract 25% or fewer respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11405480">Hensley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11405480">Tallichet &amp; Hensley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11405480">Tourangeau, Rips, &amp; Rasinski, 2000</xref>). After obtaining approval from the state department of corrections and the university’s Institutional Review Board, the principal researcher drove to the facilities and delivered the questionnaires and informed consent forms. The informed consent stated that the questionnaires were confidential and the respondents’ participation was voluntary. In addition, the state department of corrections agreed not to open any of the surveys prior to mailing them to the authors. Unfortunately, the consent form did not include this important information.</p>
<p>Correctional counselors at each prison distributed self-administered questionnaires to each inmate. Inmates were informed that it would take approximately 20 min to complete the 26-item questionnaire. Inmates were asked to return their completed questionnaires and signed informed consent forms in a stamped, self-addressed envelope within 1 month of distribution. The informed consents were immediately shredded after arrival. No incentives were given for completion of the survey. The researchers contacted the two prisons after the 30-day period to make sure all completed surveys had been mailed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306624X11405480">Table 1</xref> displays the characteristics of the state prison population and the sample. A comparison of the racial composition and age distribution of the respondents and the state prison population revealed no significant differences. Thus, the sample appears to be representative of the state prison population in terms of these variables.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>The primary goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of several demographic and childhood characteristics (race, education, residence, the age when animal cruelty was witnessed, and whether the animal abuser was a family member, friend, neighbor, or stranger) on the initial age of animal cruelty and its repetitive nature. The variables were derived from previous studies that had examined these relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez &amp; Heide, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11405480">Miller &amp; Knutson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley &amp; Tallichet, 2005b</xref>).</p>
<p>Two items in the survey defined “animal” in which inmates could choose between hurting or killing a pet or stray animal and listing the exact type or types (i.e., dog, cat, horse, etc.) that they hurt or killed. In addition, the means for “hurting or killing” animals was examined by allowing inmates to select what methods they had used to hurt or kill animals (i.e., drowned, hit, shot, kicked, choked, burned, and/or sex). Animal cruelty included any action where the respondent hurt or killed animals as children (other than for hunting). This is consistent with the most-frequently used definition of animal cruelty by social scientists which states that animal cruelty is “socially unacceptable behavior that intentionally causes unnecessary pain, suffering, or distress to and/or death of an animal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11405480">Ascione, 1993</xref>, p. 228). This definition is preferred because it omits behaviors that may be socially and culturally acceptable or condoned in other contexts, such as hunting. Respondents who reported killing animals for food were not considered animal abusers as this is socially condoned behavior.</p>
<p>Inmates were asked two questions regarding the frequency with which they committed animal cruelty and their age when they initially engaged in this conduct. The two questions were (a) “How many times have you ever hurt or killed animals other than for hunting?” and (b) “How old were you when you first hurt or killed animals other than for hunting?” These two items served as the dependent variables.</p>
<p>Inmates were also asked “how old they were when they first witnessed someone hurt or kill animals other than for hunting,” and “who they had seen hurt or kill animals other than for hunting” (a family member, a friend, and a neighbor, with a stranger serving as the reference category). Demographic characteristics (race, educational level, and childhood residence) were also included. These items served as the independent variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0306624X11405480">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To achieve the main goal of the study, zero-order correlations between the demographic and childhood characteristics, as well as the age when respondents first hurt or killed animals and the number of times they hurt or killed animals, were first assessed. Correlational analyses were conducted because some of these variables were ordinal or interval in nature. Second, because the primary goal was to examine the effects that demographic characteristics and childhood experiences had on the age of onset and recurrent nature of childhood animal cruelty, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was performed. OLS regression models were calculated to determine the effects that the demographic and childhood characteristics had in predicting both the age of onset of animal cruelty and recurrent childhood animal cruelty.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Out of the 180 respondents,103 engaged in some form of childhood animal cruelty at least once. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0306624X11405480">Table 2</xref> presents the zero-order correlations between the independent and dependent variables. White inmates were more likely to have resided in rural areas and to have witnessed a family member hurt or kill animals as children than non-Whites. Those who had witnessed a family member hurt or kill animals were more likely to have resided in rural areas as children. Inmates who had first witnessed someone hurt or kill an animal when they were younger were more likely to report that they had witnessed a family member do so. Respondents who were younger when they first witnessed someone hurt or kill animals were more likely to commit animal cruelty more frequently. Those respondents who were older when they first witnessed someone hurt or kill animals were more likely to report that they were older when they first committed such acts. Respondents who had witnessed a family member hurt or kill animals were less likely to report that they had also witnessed a friend commit a similar act. Inmates who had witnessed a family member hurt or kill animals were more likely to commit animal cruelty with greater frequency. Finally, those who were younger when they first hurt or killed animals were more likely to commit recurrent animal cruelty.</p>

<p>In sum, most of the nine significant correlations discussed above were weak to moderate in strength (.19-.39). However, one correlation was strong (.40 or higher). The age when respondents first saw someone hurt or kill animals was strongly correlated with the age when they first hurt or killed animals (.46). Interestingly, the respondents’ education levels had no significant relationship with any of the other variables.</p>
<p>To examine the effects of the independent variables on each of the two dependent variables, two separate multiple regression analyses were performed. According to the first model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0306624X11405480">Table 3</xref>, witnessing a family member hurt or kill animals was the only statistically salient variable affecting the number of times respondents had hurt or killed animals. In other words, respondents who had witnessed a family member commit animal cruelty reported engaging in recurrent animal cruelty themselves. The independent variables accounted for 18% of the total variance in the first model.</p>

<p>According to the second model, age when witnessing someone hurt or kill animals for the first time and witnessing a family member hurt or kill animals were the only two statistically salient variables which affected the age when the respondent first hurt or killed animals. Inmates who were younger when they first witnessed animal cruelty also hurt or killed animals at a younger age. The age when respondents first saw someone hurt or kill animals was the strongest predictor of the age when they themselves first hurt or killed animals in the model. In addition to this finding, respondents who had observed a family member commit animal cruelty were older when they first hurt or killed animals themselves. As previously addressed, those who had observed a family member commit animal cruelty was the only significant variable in the first model. The independent variables accounted for 24% of the total variance in the second model.</p>
<sec id="section7-0306624X11405480">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To date, youthful animal cruelty has been linked to numerous concurrent and subsequent antisocial behaviors, including interpersonal violence, necessitating a better understanding of the demographic, and contextual factors affecting how recurrent animal cruelty begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11405480">Ascione, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez &amp; Heide, 2004</xref>). Examining a few of these types of factors among an inmate sample in a southern state, the present research revealed that inmates most likely began their own recurrent acts of animal abuse during their youth as a result of having witnessed a family member hurt or kill an animal. Moreover, the age of onset for animal abuse was predicted by the age when the inmate first witnessed acts of animal abuse by a family member, suggesting that animal cruelty may be a learned behavior.</p>
<p>Similar to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet study (2005b)</xref> in which recurrent animal abuse was predicted by seeing a friend hurt or kill an animal, witnessing animal abuse by a significant other in a primary social environment may desensitize youth to this form of violence, possibly rendering them less capable of empathizing with an animal’s pain and suffering and more likely to engage in further acts of victimizing them. According to the specifics of social learning theory, the hows and whys of animal cruelty are being learned in these contexts and may become manifested as recurrent animal cruelty. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X11405480">Arluke and Lockwood (1997)</xref> have asserted, researchers need to develop a more comprehensive model for explaining animal abuse that makes it more “intelligible by constructing such behavior as ordered and rational, unpacking the abusers’ reasoning, logic, and decision-making that informs their actions” (p. 187).</p>
<p>In a previously mentioned landmark study of inmates and animal abuse by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez and Heide (2004)</xref>, they revealed that the capacity for empathy was important in explaining the commission of recurrent animal abuse. These researchers investigated the effects of cruelty observed and the response to it among violent and nonviolent inmates. Most of the inmates in their sample, victims of abuse themselves, had been exposed to similar amounts and types of animal abuse. The only exception was that violent offenders repeatedly observed the same friends commit the same acts of animal cruelty which, as Merz-Perez and Heide asserted, suggests their complicity. Nonetheless, these inmates demonstrated different responses to their experiences. Violent offenders were more likely to have engaged in recurrent animal abuse than nonviolent offenders, depending on the type of animal abused. More importantly, nonviolent offenders expressed significantly more empathy with abused animals and showed remorse when they had been cruel to animals than violent offenders in the study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11405480">Coston and Protz (1998)</xref> have suggested that there may be “a pecking order of aggressive acts, involving a lack of empathy, being passed down from the head of household through the child and down to animals” (pp. 154-155). These aggressive acts may be passed not only from parent to child but also from older siblings to younger ones. Peer groups are also structured according to a hierarchy, so it is possible that the transmission of certain behaviors, such as animal abuse, may occur in a similar fashion as those found in families although under different conditions or circumstances. In other words, in families, children are subject to parental and/or a parent figure’s (an older sibling) authority, whereas in peer groups they may be subject to peer pressure. In either scenario, observing animal cruelty could lead to an individual’s recurrent commission of it.</p>
<p>Given that this exposure to animal cruelty by either a family member or friend was related to recurrent animal cruelty in both the earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet (2005b)</xref> and the present one suggests that this behavior may be learned and may have been repeated as a result of that initial exposure. Indeed, family members or friends, or both, may also be recurrent abusers themselves. As Ascione has suggested in his afterward, witnessing acts of animal cruelty can begin to erode a child’s emotional and moral development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez &amp; Heide, 2004</xref>). Thus, when parents or peers commit animal cruelty in front of a child or adolescent, they are providing de facto approval of this form of violence. It is also possible that whether the cruelty observed is being committed by a family member or a peer, the witness to animal abuse may feel the expectation that he or she should either immediately or eventually join in by committing the same or similar acts of animal abuse.</p>
<p>The current study also sought to replicate the earlier research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet (2005b)</xref> who also found that age of exposure was related to age of onset but that age of exposure and witnessing a friend commit animal cruelty were related to the frequency of its commission.</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons for the discrepancies in the findings between the two studies. First, unlike the Hensley and Tallichet study, the present study did not include the independent variable “saw someone hurt or kill an animal” in either model because as previously mentioned it was redundant. Moreover, recurrent animal cruelty was measured as a continuous variable in the present study. Second, the present sample was drawn from a different southern state and although there were a few potentially relevant similarities between the findings of the two studies, there were also some differences between them. On one hand, in both studies, Whites were significantly more likely to have grown up in rural areas than non-Whites and inmates who grew up in rural areas were more likely to report having seen a family member commit animal cruelty than urban-reared inmates. On the other hand, in the present sample, Whites were more likely to have reported having seen a family member commit animal cruelty than non-Whites. However, there was no such association found in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet (2005b)</xref>. Furthermore, in the Hensley and Tallichet study, inmates who reported seeing a family member abuse an animal were significantly more likely to have seen a friend hurt or kill an animal. But in the present sample, inmates who reported seeing a family member hurt or kill an animal were significantly less likely to have seen a friend hurt or kill an animal. Thus, there may be some racial or residence-specific differences in the respective samples that may explain the differences in the findings between the two studies.</p>
<p>Although the present study seeks to add to the literature examining some elements of the social context under which animal cruelty may be learned, it does have limitations. First, the data analyzed in the study were based on inmates’ self-reported behavior which may have compromised the validity of the sample delineation of violent and nonviolent inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405480">Merz-Perez &amp; Heide, 2004</xref>). Second, although other studies dealing with sensitive topics among prison populations have yielded relatively low response rates, our 10% return rate is very low for survey-based methodology. In addition, our sole reliance on pencil-and-paper self-reports may have excluded illiterate inmates and further selected our sample. Thus, our results may not generalize to the larger population of inmates both within the state as well as nationwide. Finally, our study did not include a control group, which could also possibly affect the generalizability of the study.</p>
<p>Clearly, more studies are needed to identify the important background characteristics that constitute the social contexts in which animal cruelty may be learned and lead to the recurrent commission of animal abuse. When considering the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405480">Hensley and Tallichet (2005b)</xref> study and the present research, two possible areas for future research emerge. The first consists of examining the possible different pathways leading to recurrent animal cruelty in the family as different from those that may be occurring in peer groups. The second stems from place-based cultural differences between rural and urban areas. For example, in their investigation of rural–urban differences in the youthful commission of animal cruelty, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11405480">Tallichet and Hensley (2005)</xref> found that witnessing family members’ animal cruelty led to their own recurrent acts of animal abuse among rural-reared inmates, whereas urban-reared inmates’ recurrent acts of animal cruelty stemmed from witnessing animal abuse by both family members and friends. The place-based cultural differences in the learning of animal abuse have yet to be fully explored in the animal-cruelty literature. Future studies should also continue to explore the effects of motives identified by previous researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11405480">Hensley &amp; Tallichet, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11405480">Kellert &amp; Felthous, 1985</xref>) and early exposure on the onset and frequency of animal cruelty, particularly as it may lead to human violence. Finally, although the use of survey data is arguably superior to simple record review, direct interviews of participants will reap more fruitful data in future studies. Subsequent investigations could also move beyond using samples of incarcerated populations to the general population.</p>
<p>Animal cruelty is a serious offense that has implications for violence done to both animals and humans. To develop measures for prevention and intervention, it is essential that we understand how this behavior is transmitted. Thus, we must continue to investigate the circumstances under which animal cruelty is learned to develop theoretical and empirical explanations for its development and recurrence among certain individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11405480">Agnew, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11405480">Beirne, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11405480">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11405480">1999</xref>). Not all individuals who are exposed to animal cruelty in their youth become animal abusers. What makes them different from those who do? We might also ask that if animal cruelty is a learned behavior, who teaches it? How does it become acceptable and what motivates individuals to repeat it?</p>
<p>If animal abuse and other forms of violence operate in cycles, knowing more about how it operates in diverse settings could inform family-based and/or school-based interventions and humane education programs that teach empathy toward animals. As a preventive measure, school curriculums could include the humane treatment in K-12 programs. These programs could also be extended into communities beginning at animal shelters. Ultimately, if parents and peers demonstrate empathy toward animals in word and deed, then appropriate behavior toward animals is equally as likely to be learned as it has been when parents and peer abuse animals in their homes and beyond. Almost 50 years ago, noted social scientist Margaret <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11405480">Mead (1964)</xref> wrote about the importance of addressing the problem of animal cruelty in a civil society. Today, it remains a relatively understudied phenomenon we simply can no longer afford to ignore.</p>
