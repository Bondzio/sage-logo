<abstract>
<p>All-cellulose nanocomposite films with different ratios of cellulose I and II were produced by partial dissolution of microfibrillated cellulose using ionic liquid and subsequent film casting. The films were isotropic, transparent to visible light, highly crystalline, and contained different amounts of undissolved cellulose I crystallites in a matrix of dissolved cellulose. X-ray diffraction confirmed that cellulose I, i.e., the major polymorphic modification of cellulose in these nanocomposites, is rearranged to cellulose II crystal packing after the partial dissolution. The all-cellulose nanocomposite showed enhanced thermal properties, with thermal degradation temperature increased by 22% compared with thedissolved cellulose. The SEM and AFM studies verified that the nano-sized cellulose crystallites were well dispersed in the matrix. Results from DMA showed that the storage modulus was increased from 270 MPa for the dissolved cellulose to 1104 MPa for the nanocomposite with lower dissolution grade. This indicates that the all-cellulose nanocomposite films contained undissolved cellulose fragments – possibly cellulose I crystallites or aggregates of crystallites in a matrix of regenerated cellulose.</p>

<p>Cellulose is a representative natural polysaccharide and is the most abundant organic substance on earth. For over a century, many researchers have been attracted by this natural substance as a central topic in macromolecular science.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311418017">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311418017">3</xref></sup> Many basic and practical studies concerning its structure, chemical and physical properties, biosynthesis, and morphology have been performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311418017">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311418017">4</xref></sup> The major limitation in extending novel application of cellulose is its strong inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding, which resists the dissolution of the macromolecule by many solvents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311418017">4</xref></sup> It is hard to dissolve cellulose in water and most common organic solvents, unless superheated water is used, causing difficulty to obtain the composites containing cellulose as one component. To date, only a limited number of solvent systems for cellulose have been found, for example, the LiCl/N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311418017">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Investigations on the use of ionic liquids (ILs) as an alternative solvent have been steadily increased over the past 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311418017">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311418017">7</xref></sup> Their advantages are low melting points, wide liquid ranges, and lack of vapor pressure, which have encouraged researchers to explore known chemical reactions and processes using ILs instead of volatile organic solvents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311418017">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311418017">7</xref></sup>The interest in this study isthe utilization of the above-mentioned unique properties of ILs solvent for process applications of biopolymers.</p>
<p>The commercially available polymers used as composite matrices are currently petroleum based, non-biodegradable, and regarded as non-sustainable materials. In general, composites are composed of two chemically different materials. The interface between the incorporated fiber and the matrix often causes problems such as poor compatibility, insufficient stress transfer, and high water uptake. If the fiber and the matrix are both made of the same material, benefits such as recycle ability and good adhesion through the perfect interface can be expected. Similar to natural plant fibers, the use of regenerated cellulose fibers for the reinforcement of ‘green’ composites is increasing in importance. Following the successes of all-polymer composites like all-PP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311418017">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311418017">9</xref></sup>all-cellulose composites has recently been introduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311418017">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311418017">15</xref></sup> The term all-cellulose composite was first introduced by Nishino et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311418017">10</xref></sup> for a material consisting of <italic>ramie</italic> fibers embedded in a matrix of regenerated cellulose. Monocomponent, all-cellulose composite materials have been developed in which the matrix is dissolved and then precipitated cellulose, while the reinforcement is undissolved or partly dissolved cellulose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311418017">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311418017">15</xref></sup> Most studies related to all-cellulose composites have described the use of the LiCl/DMAc solvent system for dissolution of the cellulose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311418017">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311418017">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, the aim has been to explore the use of IL, particularly 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup>), as a novel solvent for nonderivatizing cellulose dissolution and regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311418017">5</xref></sup> For this purpose, microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) was partly dissolved in IL solvent and films were casted from the solution. The concentration effect of the MFC in the solvent during preparation, which determines the amount of the outer layer of the MFC dissolved to form a matrix phase, was investigated. With decreased concentration and increased immersion time, larger fractions of the MFC can be dissolved to form a matrix phase and by that leading to composites with different compositions of the crystalline reinforcing phase. Since both the MFC and matrix phases of this cellulose nanocomposite are of the same origin and hence are chemically identical, a strong interfacial adhesion can be expected between them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311418017">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311418017">14</xref></sup> The structure and microstructure of the prepared nanocomposites were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).</p>

<p>MFC (10.3% solid content, pH, 6.6, Ash, 0.3%) commercial product was supplied from Daicel Chemical Ind. LTD, Japan. The MFC was vacuum dried at 80°C for 2days before use.

<p>A mixture of MFC (3 and 5 g) with 100 g of IL ([BMIM]<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup>), were heated at 100°C for 5 min with magnetic stirring to obtain a transparent solution. The solutions were then poured into Petri dishes (diameters 10 cm) with a thickness of 0.3–0.5 mm, the samples placed for 1 h on the laboratory bench in order to be cooled to room temperature and exposed to ambient moisture. This step increased the solvent viscosity and also stopped the dissolution process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311418017">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311418017">17</xref></sup> Samples were then sequentially coagulated in water to obtain a transparent gel followed by washing with deionized water until no chloride ion was detected using AgNO<sub>3</sub>. The all-cellulose composites were dried at room temperature for 12 h and further under vacuum at 60°C for 24 h to ensure complete solidification. The final films were optically transparent and had a thickness between 0.4 and 0.6 mm and named as MD- and LD-cellulose. In order to evaluate the reinforcing effect of MFC, dissolved cellulose films were produced by dissolving 1 g of MFC for 4 h in 100 mL of [BMIM]<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> under constant stirring at 100°C. The solution was poured into a Petri dish and left as described above. The final films were optically transparent and had a thickness of 0.3 mm and named as HD-cellulose.

<p>The films obtained in this study by partially dissolving MFC in [BMIM]<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> are referred to as all-cellulose nanocomposites because dissolved part of cellulose is supposed to serve as matrix, which is reinforced by cellulose I crystallites originating from undissolved cellulose. The film has two components that exhibit different structures and mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311418017">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>X-ray diffractograms collected from MFC, HD-cellulose, MD- and LD-nanocomposites showed different crystalline structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311418017">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311418017">Table 2</xref>). Partial dissolution was accompanied by a displacement of the (2 0 0) diffraction peak to lower values and an overall loss of crystallinity, as reported in studies of similar composites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311418017">10</xref></sup> and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311418017">13</xref></sup>. In general, transformation was extensive for the HD-cellulose. CrI decreased with increasing dissolution, which was primarily controlled by concentration and dissolution time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311418017">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311418017">Table 2</xref>). All samples showed CrIs lower than that for the MFC (CrI = 0.79) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311418017">Table 2</xref>). This indicates partial dissolution for all the composites produced in this study, regardless of the dissolution time or concentration. In the XRD profile of the HD-cellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311418017">Figure 1</xref>(a)), the diffraction peaks due to crystallinestructures of the standard cellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311418017">Figure 1</xref>(d)) were not obviously exhibited. These XRD results indicate that the crystalline structures of the cellulose are largely disrupted in the dissolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311418017">Table 2</xref>). The intensity distribution ofdissolved cellulose sheets formed after dissolving 1 g of MFC in 100 g of [BMIM]<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> indicates that the crystalline part of this film is cellulose II,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311418017">22</xref></sup> with highest scattering intensity at 20.5° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311418017">Figure 1</xref>(a)). By contrast, the crystalline part of MFC corresponds to cellulose I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311418017">17</xref></sup> and shows highest scattering intensity at 2<italic>θ</italic> = 22.8°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311418017">21</xref></sup> In contrast, the X-ray pattern of all-cellulose nanocomposites demonstrates two overlapping diffractions at 19.8° and 20.5°, which suggest that the regeneration part (cellulose II) appeared and laid over the native cellulosic fibers (cellulose I). In addition, a widening of diffraction line appeared at around 2<italic>θ</italic> = 20°, indicating that the regeneration part (cellulose II) turned into non-crystalline regions in the composite with the dissolving of the cellulose fibers gradually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311418017">23</xref></sup> The broadening of the peakcorresponds to the creation of the poorly crystalline phase that forms the matrix material, and it increases withdecreasing MFC content and increasing dissolution time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311418017">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311418017">15</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig1-0021998311418017" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>X-ray diffractograms of nanofiber cellulose, regenerated cellulose, and all-cellulose nanocomposite films containing cellulose I and cellulose II: (a) dissolved MFC, (b) all-cellulose nanocomposites 3 wt%, (c) 5 wt%, and (d) pure MFC.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311418017-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A comparison of Crl obtained from both nanocomposites made by partly dissolving different amounts of MFC in [BMIM]<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> reveals differences in crystallinity and cellulose I/cellulose II content. The lateral dimensions of cellulose crystallites in the nanocomposite films were evaluated by means of the Scherrer’s formula (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998311418017">Equation (2)</xref>) and typically are in the range 16–20 nm. Thus, we refer to the all-cellulose films produced here as nanocomposites of regenerated cellulose reinforced by cellulose I crystallites. This statement is supported by the fact that the all-cellulose nanocomposite films B and C show transparency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311418017">Figure 4</xref>). Since only components less than 1/10 of a wavelength in size provide optical transparency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311418017">24</xref></sup> it is expected that only nanoscale components are present in our all-cellulose composite films.</p>
<p>The reference sample and both nanocomposites (MD and LD) were viewed with SEM and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418017">Figure 2</xref>. It is possible to see that the fractured surfaces of the medium- and low-dissolution grade of MFC and all-cellulose nanocomposites were less smooth than the dissolved sample. The medium dissolved nanocomposite appeared to be smoother than the low dissolved nanocomposite. This gave us the indication that the MFC was uniformly dispersed in the cellulose matrix.
<fig id="fig2-0021998311418017" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Scanning electron micrographs of cross-sectional view of: (a) dissolved cellulose, (b) all-nanocellulose 3 wt%, and(c) 5 wt% MFC concentrations in solution.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311418017-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The AFM study showed very promising results. Cellulose nanocrystals were homogeneously dispersed in cellulose matrix and the smallest size of the nanocellulose was less than 100 nm. Further, the non-crystalline phase became increasingly prevalent as the cellulose concentration was decreased, regardless of the precipitation conditions. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311418017">Figure 3</xref>, where the low dissolved nanocomposites are shown. The relatively uniform gray area, occupying most of, surface was assigned to be the non-crystalline phase. This phase creates a matrix that surrounds the remaining undissolved cellulose crystals, seen as scattered white point with a diameter between 20 and 100 nm. This observation suggests that the surface of the MFC could be dissolved selectively, providing a matrix to cement adjacent fibers and lead to self-reinforced composite as proposed by Nishino and Arimoto.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311418017">13</xref></sup>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311418017">Figure 4</xref> shows transparency of the dissolved and both MD- and LD-cellulose nanocomposites. The HD-cellulose shows a better optical transparency which is another indication for improved interfacial interaction as less light is scattered at their interfaces. The observation of optical transparency is another indication for an improved interfacial adhesion of the composites. This transparency requires a perfect interphase with a perfect bonding between matrix and fiber. Thus, the enhanced interface and the additional effect of the closure of the internal cell wall porosity by compression are thought to bring optical transparency tothis composite. The all-cellulose nanocomposite possesses a good interface between the remaining undissolved MFC and the surrounding matrix from the selectively dissolved/resolidified cellulose, resulting in an excellent bonding, a high mechanical performance, and an optical transparency.</p>
<p>The TGA results of the thermal stability of HD and the MD and LD all-cellulose nanocomposites are graphically represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311418017">Figure 5</xref>. It can be clearly seen that there is a shift in the onset of weight loss of MD- and LD-nanocomposite if compared to HD reference material, indicating the undissolved part will actually enhance the properties of HD-cellulose making it more thermally stable. The HD-cellulose actually had onset of weight loss (<italic>T<sub>d</sub></italic>) at around 197°C, while MD all-cellulose nanocomposite was at 224°C and LD at 240°C, respectively. The difference in the thermal degradation temperatures also indicates disruption of most of the crystalline regions of MFC in the dissolved cellulose. The results also indicate that MD nanocomposite was less thermally stable compared with LD-nanocomposites. This can be attributed to the higher crystalline content.

<p>The storage modulus (<italic>E</italic>′) of the HD-cellulose and the MD- and LD-nanocomposites is shown as a function of temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311418017">Figure 6</xref>). The storage modulus of the nanocomposites was increased with increasing MFC concentration compared to the reference sample. This improvement might be due to the small size and large specific surface area of the nanocrystals which enables it to affect the polymer chain mobility of the matrix. There is a continuing decrease in modulus as a function of temperature. This decrease is relatively significant for the HD-cellulose and the MD-nanocomposite compared to the nanocomposite with lower dissolving degree (LD). The storage modulus values of the HD-cellulose and the MD- and LD-nanocomposites at 40°C are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311418017">Table 2</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311418017">Figure 7</xref> shows the tan <italic>δ</italic> curves of the HD-cellulose and the MD- and LD-nanocomposites as a function of temperature. The tan <italic>δ</italic> peaks recorded for the nanocomposites were shifted to higher temperatures compared to the tan <italic>δ</italic> peak for HD-cellulose. The temperature shift is quite remarkable, about 50–90°C, and indicates the undissolved part were able to affect the segmental motions of the dissolved cellulose. The height of tan <italic>δ</italic> of the nanocomposite with LD seems to decrease probably showing the decrease of the molecular mobility at the glass transition. An increase of the <italic>E</italic>′ and a shift of the tan <italic>δ</italic> peak to higher temperatures could be an indication of well-dispersed crystallites with good matrix interaction. With strong interaction between the reinforcing phase and the matrix, the polymer motion of the matrix is restricted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311418017">25</xref></sup> It can be seen that the nanocomposite has a boarder tan <italic>δ</italic> peak than for the HD-cellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311418017">Figure 7</xref>).

<p>All-cellulose nanocomposite films consisting of dissolved cellulose reinforced with undissolved cellulose Icrystallites were produced using partial dissolution of MFC cellulose in [BMIM]<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> and subsequent film casting. The random-oriented nanocrystallite-reinforced films were transparent and of high strength and stiffness with regard to comparable cellulosic materials. This composite possessed a good interface between the remaining fibers and the surrounding matrix from the selectively dissolved/resolidified MFC-fibril surfaces, which resulted in excellent bonding, good mechanical and thermal performances, and optical transparency. However, the major advantage of the new nanocomposite films is the fact that they are at the same time fullybiobased, easily recyclable, and biodegradable, yet reasonably strong materials.</p>
