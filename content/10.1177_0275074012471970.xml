<p>E-government has evolved from a stage where basic, static information is made available on websites to a transformative stage that provides mechanisms for two-way communication between citizens and public administrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074012471970">Layne &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>). This transformation of government continues to occur at a rapid rate and one of the greatest forces stimulating this push is the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Whether the focus of government is placed on sharing services, performance measurement and management efforts, improving citizen engagement, or service delivery, ICTs are commonly used to promulgate change and innovation. Interestingly, despite the fiscal crises that plague many state governments, investment in advanced features of e-government, including customer relations management (CRM) and 311 technologies and geospatial information systems (GIS), continues to increase. Essentially, innovative e-government features have afforded government the opportunity to improve service delivery, effectiveness, and increase channels of communication to the public.</p>
<p>While the potential benefits of e-government are immense, many scholars and practitioners would argue that e-government has yet to reach its full potential or promise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074012471970">Bekkers &amp; Homburg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0275074012471970">Moon, 2002</xref>). Moreover, as the use of ICTs in government has been perceived as a positive to improve organizational efficiency, they have also been viewed as a negative because some ICT strategies have been poorly planned and implemented, which ultimately results in failed projects. In <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success—An Integrative Study of Government-wide Websites, Organizational Capabilities, and Institutions</italic>, Gil-Garcia explores the many factors that are likely to predict a successful e-government initiative.</p>
<p>The introduction to <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic> sets out the course for identifying successful e-government initiatives that Gil-Garcia effortlessly weaves his readers through. He first presents the two primary research questions that are the focus of the text. First, “To what extent are e-government initiatives shaped by different organizational characteristics, institutional arrangements, and environmental conditions?” (p. xxvi). The second research question is a juxtaposition of the first in which “To what extent are organizational characteristics, institutional arrangements, and environmental conditions affected by the existence and characteristics of e-government initiatives?” is explored (p. xxvi). In <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic>, the reader is quickly made aware that this text will be unlike others that examine the seemingly elusive topic of utilizing ICTs to improve government performance. Gil-Garcia takes a holistic approach to uncovering the complexities that determine what potentially leads to an effective e-government, undoubtedly setting the stage for the robust quantitative analyses he relies on to strengthen the case.</p>
<p>Readers will also be made cognizant of the conscious effort by Gil-Garcia, to use an “old” term, to define the wide-ranging phenomena of ICT use within government. Instead of separating e-government into various stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074012471970">Layne &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074012471970">Hiller &amp; Belanger, 2001</xref>) or dissecting related areas, such as e-governance, e-democracy, or e-commerce, Gil-Garcia retreats to using the term <italic>e-government</italic> to define all aspects of ICT use in the public sector. Students, scholars, and practitioners familiar with e-government research will recall Layne and Lee’s assertion that the fourth stage of e-government, horizontal integration, occurs when government services across different functional walls become integrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074012471970">Layne &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>). Instead, Gil-Garcia simplifies a complex and multidimensional concept. Because electronic services, management, democracy and policy intersect, the use of a single term to define their relationship is appropriate. The definition of e-government that <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic> establishes is
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . the selection, design, implementation and use of ICTs in government to provide public services, improve managerial effectiveness, and promote democratic values and participation mechanisms, as well as the development of a legal and regulatory framework that facilitates information intensive initiatives and fosters the knowledge society. (p. 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Defining public sector use of ICTs by using an all-encompassing term may seem too broad or general, but many who conduct e-government research will find solace in its sophisticated simplicity. The provision of public services, improving administrative capacity and managerial effectiveness, along with promoting democratic values are concepts that not only describe what e-government allows public administrators to do but also explains what government is responsible for. ICTs are simply the mechanism that allows government to attain such goals. One must also remember that e-government is not just citizen-centric, nor is it just concerned with administrative capacities or only service delivery—it encompasses all of these concepts.</p>
<p>The theoretical model used to examine e-government success is covered in chapter 2. In a very detailed, yet easy to comprehend manner, Gil-Garcia explains the various theoretical models commonly used in information systems and e-government research. These comprehensive and integrative theoretical traditions are considered the ensemble view of information technology and organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074012471970">Orlikowski &amp; Iacono, 2001</xref>). Gil-Garcia effectively supports his rationale for using this approach by asserting that “in order to understand information technologies, it is necessary to analyze not only the technological artifacts, but also the social and organizational aspects surrounding those artifacts” (p. 33). The ensemble view applies a comprehensive perspective to examine the relationships between IT and social structures. Gil-Garcia asserts that technology is simply one component of the multifaceted sociotechnical system. Accordingly, sociotechnical system perspective suggests that implementing a new technology within an organization is complex and is largely impacted by the internal social structure or context of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074012471970">Welch &amp; Pandey, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>After carefully reviewing various theories that encapsulate the ensemble view of information technology and organizations, Gil-Garcia chooses the technology enactment framework as the theoretical model to uncover the factors impacting e-government success. Gil-Garcia identifies six reasons why the technology enactment framework is suitable for this study:</p>
<list id="list1-0275074012471970" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>It is appropriate for conducting research regarding various stages or processes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The framework allows the organization to be the primary unit of analysis instead of the individual.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It was developed by relying on empirical data from government agencies and is therefore grounded in the unique characteristics of the public sector.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>IT can be used from both positivist and nonpositivist perspectives.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The framework can use quantitative or qualitative methods.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It recognizes the importance institutional arrangements play in understanding “government phenomena” (p. 53).</p></list-item></list>
<p>Chapter 3 cogently explains the three constructs used in <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic>. Gil-Garcia identifies organizational structures and processes, institutional arrangements, and environmental conditions as indicators of e-government success. Organizational structures and processes are delineated into two areas: general organizational factors and management strategies. General organization factors include the number of people working for the IT organization as a measure of size, the percentage of the IT budget’s revenue sources from federal funds, whether the state provides accessibility training for IT professionals, and the percentage of the IT budget devoted to maintenance (p. 69). The number of marketing outlets used by states and the intensity of the marketing efforts, whether website services are outsourced completely or if they are entirely provided by the government, whether the IT organization is the only one directly providing website services, and whether the central IT organization directly manages portal development for other agencies are included as management strategies.</p>
<p>Institutional arrangements are defined as “laws, regulations, policies and other rules that shape organizational forms and affect both enacted technology and the organizational outputs and outcomes” (p. 69). In <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic>, the existence of mandatory accessibility standards for state websites, whether state IT professionals are all members of the civil service, whether the state relies entirely on executive orders or directives to establish authority for the CEO office, and whether the state has an IT-specific legislative committee in the Senate as a measure of legislative involvement, represent institutional arrangements.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Gil-Garcia states that it is nearly impossible to identify each of the conditions influencing the environment of an organization in one study. And while environmental factors that impede organizational performance may be addressed by promoting collaborative learning opportunities, cross-organizational structure arrangements, and transformative leadership activities, <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic> is not primarily concerned with correcting the environment of state government; the focus is to identify environmental conditions, or determinants of successful state e-government systems. Environmental conditions include demographic factors, voting preferences, and the size of the economy. Demographic factors include education, income, computer ownership, and Internet access. Voting preference, which is used as a proxy for political orientation, is operationalized as the percentage of votes for the Democratic or Republican gubernatorial candidates. The overall size of the state economy is measured based on the government gross state product, total state debt, total state revenue, and the number of jobs and private earnings in various industries. Inspecting success factors in this manner allows the reader to develop a better understanding of the uncontrollable elements impacting e-government.</p>
<p>One of the greatest attributes of <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic> is the ease with which Gil-Garcia explains the use of partial least squares (PLS) as the statistical technique. Explaining structural equation models (SEM) is not an easy task even for the experienced quantitative researcher. The simplicity and straightforwardness that Gil-Garcia uses will generate the confidence to undertake research projects that necessitate a sophisticated method to uncover complex relationships.</p>
<p>Another reason for one to read <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic> is due to the mixed methodological approach it relies on. Chapters 4 and 5 examine the cases of e-government success in New York and Indiana. Each case explores the areas of enacted technology, organizational outputs and outcomes, management strategies and practices, general organizational characteristics, institutional arrangements, and environmental conditions. The case of New York and Indiana both conclude with final comments and lessons learned.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 puts all of the pieces of <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic> together by summarizing the theoretical and methodological contributions. Chapter 6 also provides the results from the quantitative and qualitative analysis.</p>
<p>For the period examined (early 2000s), <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic> is one of the most robust and sophisticated studies examining e-government success to date. A concern that must be noted, however, is the time period that data is analyzed from. The e-government rankings, U.S. Census data, and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics were gathered between 2000 and 2002 and environmental conditions, organizational structures, and institutional arrangements have substantially changed over the past decade. Thus a second edition with recently analyzed data utilizing the same methodological approach would be welcomed.</p>
<p><italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic> is a multidimensional study that uncovers several layers that are likely to impact e-government success at the state level of government in the United States. One of the greatest aspects of this research may lie in the factors that influence institutions and their effect on e-government success. Assuredly, readers will appreciate the ease with which Gil-Garcia explains the complex relationships between ICTs and social structures within public sector organizations. No matter the field of study, <italic>Enacting Electronic Government Success</italic> is a must read for all public administration students, scholars, and practitioners.</p>
