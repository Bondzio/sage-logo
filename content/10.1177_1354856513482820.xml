<p>This issue of <italic>Convergence</italic> opens with an extended special Debates section, edited by Irena Reifová and Jaroslav Švelch, which – as they explain in their Introduction – brings together a selection of papers resulting from a symposium they held in June 2012 in Prague. At the heart of the symposium was discussion about and investigation of media audience ‘participation’ in the digital era, which generated post-symposium the wide ranging and illuminating conversation between Henry Jenkins and Nico Carpentier that opens and frames the Debates section. In particular, the symposium organisers, together with Jenkins and Carpentier, were keen to not only interrogate the ‘grand narratives’ that have emerged in the ‘age of media convergence’ but perhaps more importantly focus in more depth on the kinds of participation that have developed, under what circumstances and for what purpose. In both Jenkins and Carpentier’s opening conversation and the shorter pieces that follow, the contributors to this special Debates section explore a wide range of participatory practices, from those with more overtly political aims, like the Invisible Children group discussed by Jenkins, through to the supposedly more playful, ‘just for fun’ Bollywood flash mobs studied by Sangita Shresthova.</p>
<p>However, what emerges from these Debates is the <italic>complexity</italic> of participatory practices. For instance, it involves Jenkins and Carpentier in a detailed discussion of how we define ‘participation’ – and related terms such as interaction, engagement, interpretation and access – and prompts recognition by Jenkins that inequality of access to technological infrastructure, opportunities, skills and knowledge make it more difficult for some groups to participate than others, while Carpentier asserts that full participatory culture will never be realised. But the Debates section also raises the thorny issue of participation in what? As Jenkins notes, although many new platforms, such as YouTube, describe themselves as participatory, the emphasis remains on individual self-expression rather than facilitating or supporting a participatory community based on shared values.</p>
<p>In the course of their conversation, Jenkins acknowledges that his research tends to start with specific case studies and look for conceptual tools to explain what’s being observed, whereas Carpentier begins with abstract definitions and assesses their applicability to specific cases. Yet editors Reifová and Švelch argue that their Debates section precisely demonstrates that our understanding of participation can only benefit from a dialogue between these differing approaches. Indeed, Jenkins and Carpentier themselves find and readily recognise that they share a common aim: to understand and foster <italic>participation that matters</italic>. And the pursuit of this aim takes them on to a discussion of the nature of community and communication, modes of organisation that underpin different kinds of participation, forms of leadership that direct or nurture participation and the vital need for education so that – as Jenkins asserts – ‘as many young people as possible have access to the skills and knowledge necessary to meaningfully participate in the core decisions that impact their lives’.</p>
<p>The theme of participation also provides a broad framework for the research articles in this issue, since all address how we engage with social spheres of interaction or forms of participatory practice in a digitally based culture, and demonstrate – albeit in very different ways – that participation matters. In ‘Mediated Gesture: Paralinguistic Communication and Phatic Text’, for instance, Michael Schandorf explores how and why we participate in certain communicative acts in digital media. He discusses the nature and role of co-speech gestures (such as hand movement) in face-to-face communication in order to argue that the textual conventions that have developed in digital media can be viewed in the same way. Drawing on examples from his own personal Twitter stream over a period of several months, Schandorf uses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856513482820">Kendon’s (2004)</xref> categories of co-speech gesture – deictic, imagistic, expressive, rhythmic and emblematic – to analyse paralinguistic forms and conventions of text-based new media. While he acknowledges that such digital ‘gestures’ are apparent in differing degrees across a wide range of technologies, Schandorf’s primary concern is ‘to demonstrate that nearly all new media and conversational text has some gestural element’. While such gestures can change the meaning of a communication entirely, Schandorf relates his analysis to the ways in which digital media communication often performs the phatic role of establishing and maintaining social relationships rather than imparting information. Thus, he does not view digital communication as a ‘cultural regression’ but as part of an ongoing extension of our possible communication spaces that constantly shifts and reorganises ‘the balance of our social interactions’.</p>
<p>Exploring another field of communication – journalism – our second research article is entitled ‘Converging practices and discourses: Obstacles in production culture for interactivity in Slovenian online newspapers’. Authors Tanja Oblak Črnič and Igor Vobič undertook news website analysis of three Slovenian print media organisations and conducted in-depth research interviews with their print and online editors in order to establish the degree to which their audiences/readership were able to take a more active role in information delivery – to, as they express it, ‘evaluate … the extent of interactivity within online media’. Echoing some of the issues raised in the Debates section, the authors recognise the need to first determine what we mean by the term ‘interactivity’ and its implications for the role of journalists as gatekeepers. Their ethnographic methods then demonstrate that all three news websites offer users the ability to personalize their news consumption and provide content for online media, but that ‘interactivity as a set of practices’ was limited. Indeed they found that while the news organizations had implemented the use of so-called interactive features on their websites, online news production and information delivery remained in the control of editors and journalists, and failed to open up ‘a new space of dialogue and interactive communication’.</p>
<p>Moving on from communicative acts in digital media, our final research article by Abraham Stein, Mia Consalve and Konstantin Mitgutsch examines the neglected research area of sports video game players. To address this gap in our knowledge, the authors conducted an online survey of over 1700 participants to build-up an understanding of the general demographics of the players, their habits and activities. While some of the popular but untested assumptions about sports video game players were confirmed, the study also highlighted interesting and important exceptions. For instance, the assumption that the overwhelming majority of sports gamers self-identify as sports fans proved to be correct, with video gaming forming part of a broader engagement with sports which involved attending sporting events, following particular teams or sports, and participating in sporting activities themselves, as well as watching sport on television. But, although most respondents spent most of their time playing on their own, the study demonstrated that when they played with family and friends or online, these activities yielded the most meaningful experiences. While such interaction offered competitive opportunities, the authors also found shared gameplay played a significant role in shaping players’ passion for sports games and pointed to ‘the importance of games as facilitators for social interaction among friends and family’.</p>
<p>Finally, to wind up our theme for this issue, in our May issue we commemorated our former Associate Editor, Rebecca Coyle, for her invaluable participation in the <italic>Convergence</italic> editorial board before she sadly passed away in November of last year. We would like to close this editorial by welcoming Rebecca’s successor, Chris Chesher (University of Sydney, Australia), as our new Associate Editor for the Western Pacific region.</p>
