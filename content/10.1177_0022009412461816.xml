<abstract>
<p>There has been much historical debate about whether or not there was a ‘political consensus’ in Britain in the postwar decades. However, surprisingly little attention has been paid to what politicians said about ‘consensus’ at the time and what this indicated about the nature of political argument. This article shows that ‘consensus’ and similar terms (such as ‘the middle way’) were in use from the 1940s, but it does not assume that consensus existed just because some contemporaries asserted that it did. Rather, it examines how differing interpretations of consensus were invoked in political debate in order to advance a range of partisan agendas. It further shows how right-wing Conservatives from the late 1960s sought both to attack the consensus rhetorically and to reach out (in Keith Joseph’s phrase) to ‘the common ground’ that New Right policies supposedly represented. It concludes that Thatcher, as Conservative leader and Prime Minister, did not abandon the <italic>structure</italic> of consensus rhetoric so much as repopulate it with exclusively ‘national’ terms.</p>

<p>Bargaining is a repulsive habit; compromise is one of the highest human virtues – the difference between the two being that the first is practised on the Continent, the latter in Great Britain. […]</p>
<p>The Labour Party is a fair compromise between Socialism and Bureaucracy; the Beveridge Plan is a fair compromise between being and not being a Socialist at the same time; the Liberal Party is a fair compromise between the Beveridge Plan and Toryism; the Independent Labour Party is a fair compromise between Independent Labour and a political party; the Tory-reformers are a fair compromise between revolutionary conservatism and retrograde progress; and the whole British political life is a huge and noncompromising fight between compromising Conservatives and compromising Socialists.</p>

<p>On 11 April 1975, the Conservative Shadow Cabinet met to discuss a controversial policy paper written by Sir Keith Joseph, New Right guru and mentor to Margaret Thatcher, the party’s newly-elected leader. The paper explicitly rejected ‘the path of consensus’ which, it claimed, the Conservatives had followed in the years after the Second World War to damaging effect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009412461816">1</xref></sup> According to notes made by Lord Hailsham, the discussion was lively. Ian Gilmour, later one of Thatcher’s harshest Tory critics, argued that up until 1970 – the year of Edward Heath’s electoral victory – the consensus had been a Conservative rather than a Labour one, a point disputed by Joseph later in the meeting. Geoffrey Howe, Thatcher’s future Chancellor, emphasized that Heath’s manifesto had been ‘a <italic>departure</italic> from consensus’ and that Joseph’s paper did not differ from it. The 1970–4 Conservative government had however failed to present and explain the manifesto properly. Angus Maude, a figure who had been sacked by Heath but who had Thatcher’s confidence, suggested that in 1960–2 ‘Consensus began to move towards Soc[ialis]m.’ Timothy Raison argued that ‘there are matters on wh. we have <italic>got</italic> to operate a consensus, e.g. we must try to persuade [Labour Chancellor Denis] Healey to produce a sensible budget.’ Francis Pym stated: ‘Society is moving left. There must be continuity, which means a broad measure of agreement. The Keith paper is a recipe for disaster.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009412461816">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the ideological divisions within the Conservative Party at this time, it is unsurprising that its leading figures disagreed over whether cross-party consensus was inherently desirable. What is intriguing is the fact that no-one present seemed to doubt that some such consensus had existed in the postwar period; but the group differed over the historical understanding of what this consensus had been and which party had extracted most advantage from it. The debate was illustrative of a wider phenomenon: that of how politicians and commentators over several decades invoked the concept of ‘consensus politics’ in a variety of ways in order to advance a diverse range of agendas. The discourse of consensus – whether or not consensus itself was approved of – was used rhetorically as part of the battle within and between parties. It is these rhetorical uses of ‘consensus’ and similar terms and concepts that this article sets out to investigate.</p>
<p>There has, of course, been a longstanding historiographical debate over whether or not a consensus existed. Although it was not the first work to deal with the theme of political agreement, Paul Addison’s <italic>The Road to 1945</italic> (1975) was a landmark work. It argued that the roots of consensus had been laid during the Second World War, Churchill’s coalition government having established the groundwork through its important reforming initiatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009412461816">3</xref></sup> Addison’s findings were subsequently attacked by a number of scholars. Writing in 1988, Pimlott suggested that the term ‘consensus’ was largely a post-hoc invention that had only become important in British political life since Thatcher took office in 1979. Many of those who promoted it, he argued, were guilty of ‘a shamelessly sentimental yearning’, wrapping, for current political purposes, what had in reality been a conflictual era in the warm glow of historical nostalgia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009412461816">4</xref></sup> In fact, use of the term consensus can be traced back to the 1940s. The significance of this has been overlooked in the historical debate thus far. Historians have attempted to establish – as it were objectively – whether or not consensus existed, by comparing the ideological statements and concrete policies of the two main parties. They have not been interested, however, in establishing why political <italic>claims</italic> about consensus were made at the time, or to work out what such claims can tell us about the nature of the party battle.</p>
<p>Pimlott’s arguments were followed by many later scholars, some of whom made useful efforts to bring Cold War and colonial issues into the picture, but the limitations of his approach remained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009412461816">5</xref></sup> In 1999, Brian Harrison offered a helpful critique of the literature, in which he argued for an extension of ‘consensus’ backwards into the interwar period and forwards into the Blair era. In his analysis, ‘British inter-war politics were highly consensual in mood and content – even to the extent of producing inter-party coalition government for most of the period.’ Moreover, he argued, even Thatcher had pursued a form of consensus, the difference being that, unlike previous postwar leaders, she had sought to shape electoral opinion rather than accommodate it, as her predecessors had done. As evidence, he noted her speech to the 1983 Conservative Party conference, in which she claimed: ‘We have created the new common ground, and that is why our opponents have been forced to shift their ground. […] The Conservative party has staked out the common ground and the other parties are tiptoeing on to it.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009412461816">6</xref></sup> But if we are to understand Thatcher’s use of ‘common ground’ rhetoric fully, we must explore its antecedents in the rhetoric of ‘consensus’, an ostensibly similar term from which she overtly sought to distance herself.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that, whatever one’s reservations about it, the term ‘postwar consensus’ is simply too convenient a shorthand to be dispensed with entirely and Addison’s use of the more restricted term ‘Whitehall consensus’ in the revised edition of his book is undoubtedly helpful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009412461816">7</xref></sup> But if further advance is to be made – in line with recent efforts to develop novel approaches to the period<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009412461816">8</xref></sup> – a new methodology is needed. Rather than investigating the truth value of contemporary claims about consensus – that is to say, trying to work out whether or not politicians fundamentally agreed with each other – this article examines the rhetorical status of those claims. What, in other words, were politicians trying to achieve when they claimed that consensus existed and what role did the idea of consensus play in their broader arguments?</p>
<p>This effort can be assisted by consideration of other national literatures. Regrettably, the British case has generally been considered more or less in isolation, but by the 1960s scholars from other countries were noting a trend ‘in many post-World-War II western political systems […] towards decreasing political conflict and increasing political consensus.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009412461816">9</xref></sup> In particular, a consensus was detected in the United States. More recently, historians have asked whether or not that consensus was a true one. Wendy Wall has written:<disp-quote>
<p>America’s mid-century ‘consensus’ can best be understood not as a ‘natural’ development but as a political project. […] Business and advertising executives, interfaith activists, government officials, and other cultural elites seized on the notion of a unifying and distinctive ‘American Way’ and sought to define it in ways that furthered their own political and social agendas. All of these groups had a strong interest in cementing national cohesion, and all promoted the notion of ‘consensus,’ even as they differed on the specific values and attributes that their fellow citizens shared.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009412461816">10</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The British and American experiences were not, of course, exactly analogous. However, lessons can be learned from Wall’s approach, as well as from British scholarship that falls strictly outside the consensus debate. Colin Hay has suggested that the 1978–9 ‘Winter of Discontent’ was a ‘discursive construction’ of the New Right. By this he does not mean that the industrial action of the period did not take place, but rather that politicians and media figures successfully portrayed the events as a fundamental national crisis, thus helping bring about a transformational shift in the nature of the state in the way that many other similar episodes (such as the Italian ‘hot autumn’ of 1969) did not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009412461816">11</xref></sup> Similarly, David McCourt has suggested that Britain’s East of Suez role was a ‘rhetorical construction’. Again, he is not suggesting that the military deployments did not really exist, but rather that policymakers designated a diverse set of commitments as a single ‘role’, which in due course became ripe for abolition as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009412461816">12</xref></sup> It is appropriate to view consensus though a similar framework; indeed, unlike the Winter of Discontent or East of Suez, consensus was something that could exist <italic>only</italic> at the level of language or ideas. To a considerable extent, historiographical definitions of the domestic consensus – which tend to centre on economic management and the welfare state – have been determined by the rhetorical priorities of historical actors themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009412461816">13</xref></sup> This has had some strange effects. Given that partisan rhetoric by definition focused on contentious issues, some genuine areas of bipartisan agreement (such as road safety legislation) have been excluded from understandings of ‘consensus’, precisely because they did not generate such rhetoric.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009412461816">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The argument presented here is not that consensus was a single rhetorical construct, but rather that there were a series of competing constructs. As in the US case, a series of rival and overlapping interpretations of consensus co-existed and were deployed in pursuit of differing objectives. On the one hand, the trope of consensus was deployed as a rhetorical tactic, to suggest that one’s opponents did <italic>not</italic> belong to a wide and established national community of common sense. On the other – well before Thatcher became Tory leader – consensus was portrayed negatively, as a means used by the political establishment to shut out alternative viewpoints, at the cost of voter apathy. In some senses, then, ‘consensus’ was inherently exclusionary, being deployed both by those who wished to marginalize their opponents and by those who wished to extract kudos by presenting themselves and their ideas as victims of elite marginalization.</p>
<p>What, then, were the origins of the term ‘political consensus’? One early use was by an anonymous author in the <italic>Saturday Review</italic> in 1897, who noted that whereas in Britain there was ‘a common understanding or consensus’ about the basic forms of government, in France ‘the French Revolution destroyed this political consensus.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009412461816">15</xref></sup> This referred to consensus over procedure; we may note that (until 1903) there was also broad agreement over important policy areas such as free trade. However, until the 1940s, use of phrases such as ‘political consensus’ remained rare. The interwar years did see a growth of conscious efforts to articulate programmes based on cross-party ‘political agreement’ and ‘middle opinion’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009412461816">16</xref></sup> Nevertheless, terms such as ‘planning’ that gained considerable currency in Conservative as well as Labour circles could be interpreted in very different ways; and, as will be seen below, even seemingly anodyne terms such as ‘the middle way’ could potentially be deployed in a highly partisan fashion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009412461816">17</xref></sup> In Addison’s view, whereas the MacDonald–Baldwin rapprochement represented merely ‘a consensus to prevent anything unusual from happening’, some of the developments of the later 1930s represented signposts on the way to the more constructive post-Dunkirk consensus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009412461816">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first uses of the term ‘consensus’ in the sense that is applied to the postwar domestic settlement can be found in 1942. In May of that year <italic>The Times</italic> discussed the Labour Party report <italic>The Old World and the New Society</italic> in approving terms: ‘the leading features of the report reflect a broad consensus of opinion on vital issues transcending party divisions and party programmes.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009412461816">19</xref></sup> A few days later, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Lang, commented in the Lords not only on Labour’s report but on others by the Federation of British Industries and the London Chamber of Commerce: ‘it is really remarkable what a consensus there is among all these different bodies as to the main outlines of any economic settlement after the war.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009412461816">20</xref></sup> The idea of consensus, then, was not a retrospective nostalgic invention; but it would be naïve to take these statements as proof that consensus existed. They were not merely descriptions of a state of affairs; they were themselves interventions in ideological debate. <italic>The Times</italic>’s comments were made in the course of an editorial which urged Labour to stick to a moderate path and to avoid disrupting the coalition government by pursuing partisan proposals: praise of the party’s consensual proposals doubled as a warning not to abandon the straight-and-narrow represented by the pursuit of ‘national ends.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009412461816">21</xref></sup> Lang, for his part, made clear his desire for an authoritative government statement on post-war planning and his own preference for the growth of state economic control. Moreover,<disp-quote>
<p>Let us make no mistake that even the carrying out of these matters upon which there is so much rather surprising agreement will make a very great moral as well as intellectual demand. It will mean – let us make no mistake about it – that many vested interests, sectional interests, strongly entrenched, many temptations to make Party advantage, will have to be resisted. It will mean for most of us a change in our accustomed ways of thinking, acting, and living which we cannot now imagine. I am sure that to carry through any kind of social and economic resettlement after the war will need some inward constraining motive and inspiration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009412461816">22</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The ‘inspiration’ Lang referred to was, of course, Christianity, a theme which did not obtrude overtly into many of these debates. However his (and <italic>The Times</italic>’s) denigration of partisanship was a much more common theme which had its roots in the interwar period and earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009412461816">23</xref></sup> What is interesting about this period is the way in which Labour managed to rework this theme – which had traditionally suffered from its opponents’ portrayal of it as a ‘sectional’ party – to its own advantage.</p>
<p>Some sense of how the party did this can be gained from a letter sent by its leader, Clement Attlee, to Winston Churchill, in the aftermath of the publication of the 1942 Beveridge Report on social services. Churchill had taken the view that it would be wrong for the coalition government, which lacked a fresh electoral mandate, to implement decisions on postwar policy. Attlee wrote that this had not been his understanding when he joined the government and argued that hitherto the government had successfully cooperated to legislate on areas over which agreement could be reached. The people of Britain, moreover, were prepared for radical change, a point borne out, he suggested, by a recent review of public opinion circulated by the Minister of Information:<disp-quote>
<p>In particular it showed a remarkable consensus of opinion on many points between people of different political parties and different economic and social backgrounds. I have myself been in contact with a number of prominent business men and with many people not of my own political views and have found it possible to arrive at a very large measure of agreement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009412461816">24</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Attlee’s disagreement with Churchill was over the timing rather than the content of reform. His technique, nonetheless, was to use the ‘consensus’ idea to paint the Prime Minister as someone isolated from the main currents of national opinion and who formed an obstacle to measures that were needed if disaster were to be avoided at the end of the war.</p>
<p>Attlee’s audience in this case of course was only Churchill (and perhaps his political advisers) and it is doubtful that his words had much effect. At the 1945 election, however, the two men battled publicly over ‘national’ values, both attempting to portray themselves and their respective parties as representative of mainstream opinion. Churchill hoped to draw Liberal and other moderate voters to his side by casting the fight as ‘“socialists v. the rest” rather than “Tories v. the rest”.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009412461816">25</xref></sup> The seemingly unconsensual (and undoubtedly uncontroversial) election broadcast in which he said that a Labour government would be obliged to fall back on ‘some form of <italic>Gestapo</italic>’ was in fact a cack-handed attempt to win over Liberals by presenting conservatism and liberalism as allies in the face of the socialist threat.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009412461816">26</xref></sup> In his highly effective broadcast reply, Attlee contested Churchill’s claim to ‘National’ credentials and painted the Conservatives as a sectional, class-based party that represented property and privilege. He also claimed that there was a broad-based national and international consensus on economic issues that excluded the Tories: ‘I welcome […] the general acceptance now of the view always held by the Labour Party, but derided by our opponents, that the interests of this country and the world demand the utilization of abundance, and not the artificial creation of scarcity.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009412461816">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once in Opposition, Churchill acknowledged that ‘not only are the two parties in the House agreed in the main essentials of foreign policy and in our moral outlook on world affairs, but we also have an immense programme, prepared by our joint exertions during the Coalition, which requires to be brought into law and made an inherent part of the life of the people.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009412461816">28</xref></sup> However, within months he was accusing Labour of weakening the country by failing to match his allegedly non-partisan and cooperative spirit:<disp-quote>
<p>If I had obtained a substantial majority at the last Election my first thought would have been to seek the co-operation of the minority, and gather together the widest and strongest measure of agreement over the largest possible area. Very different is the treatment which has been meted out to us, and which has already produced party antagonism, bitter as anything I have seen in my long life of political conflict. I charge the Government with deliberately trying to exalt their partisan and faction interests at the cost not only of the national unity but of our recovery and of our vital interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009412461816">29</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>On this occasion, Attlee was again effective in ridiculing Conservative efforts to define ‘the nation’ according to their own ideological convenience. Churchill, he said, ‘was himself called to the Premiership, not by the Tory Party, by whom he was despised and rejected, but by the action and with the support of the doctrinaire Socialists, the vultures, the people who are not really allowed to belong to the nation now.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009412461816">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the lifetime of the Attlee government the term ‘consensus’ was not in evidence, but similar concepts such as ‘the middle way’ were used. Harold Macmillan had published a book with that title in 1938.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009412461816">31</xref></sup> The idea of the middle way – which gained considerable potency from the physicality of the metaphor – was frequently linked with claims about national identity. This can be seen, for example, in the industrialist Samuel Courtauld’s observation that ‘The English genius for social evolution and for compromise can find a middle way, between pure Individualism and pure Socialism, which will bring the greatest attainable good to the nation.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009412461816">32</xref></sup> To oppose such a compromise, then, was implicitly unpatriotic; and accordingly many politicians sought to define and colonize the middle ground and exclude their opponents from it. The discourse of the middle way, as articulated by Macmillan in a 1946 speech, was designed to incorporate Liberals and unaffiliated voters into ‘the truly national and patriotic’ (and Conservative) cause and to depict Labour’s nationalisation policies as the embodiment of the totalitarian state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009412461816">33</xref></sup> Wrapped up with such debates was the new concept of the ‘floating vote’, which, at least up until 1951, was generally assumed to coincide with the middle class vote. Amongst the self-appointed defenders of the middle class against the depredations of the Attlee government, the concepts ‘middle class vote’, ‘middle opinion’ and ‘floating vote’ were frequently conflated and were used not merely descriptively but with approval. As the political scientist John Bonham noted in 1954, ‘People speak of tolerance of a “floating vote”, not as a band of turncoats and traitors, but as men possessing the meritorious qualities of mature and independent judgement’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009412461816">34</xref></sup> However, there was also some resistance to the middle way concept. The Liberal Party – perhaps in an attempt to resist Tory efforts at co-option – explicitly rejected the idea that Liberalism represented a middle way between Tory ‘monopoly capitalism’ and Labour ‘collectivism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009412461816">35</xref></sup> Rather, it was a distinct philosophy – a ‘<italic>Third Way</italic>’ – opposed to them both.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009412461816">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Labour and Tory partisans were eager to claim <italic>both</italic> that their respective parties had something distinct to offer <italic>and</italic> that they occupied an ideological middle-ground that represented a national consensus (but did not include the other party). This presented some dilemmas on those occasions when it was necessary to account for the reform initiatives of the Churchill coalition, in which both had participated. After all, if the parties were really so different from one another, how was it that they had been able to work together? Differing approaches to this problem can be seen in two volumes commissioned by Penguin, and published in 1947, to put the Labour and Conservative cases respectively.</p>
<p>In <italic>Labour Marches On</italic> John Parker MP attributed the Conservative Party’s early difficulties in Opposition partly to the fact that ‘it had more or less committed itself during the period of the Coalition to supporting a good many of the measures which the Labour Government introduced.’ He did not state explicitly <italic>why</italic> the Conservatives had committed themselves in this way; the reader was left to infer that it was out of expediency rather than ideological commitment. Parker saw a division within the Tory Party between individualists who wished to return to a ‘the planless Britain of 1939’ and those ‘more progressive elements’ which accepted the need for some degree of economic planning. However, in his view these Tory planners carried little conviction because of their failure, when it came to the point, to support specific measures of nationalisation. The Conservative <italic>Industrial Charter</italic> of 1947 represented ‘the acceptance of a watered-down form of planned economy’ and was presumably aimed at winning Liberal votes, but would not much appeal to genuine believers in planning. Tory resistance to the nationalization of basic industries shut it out of the electoral mainstream, because voters would increasingly rally to the new <italic>status quo</italic> as nationalised industries proved successful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009412461816">37</xref></sup> In this analysis, the adherence of some Conservatives to apparently consensus-type policies was merely nominal and was, furthermore, evidence of tensions within a party which was itself divided.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Case for Conservatism</italic>, Quintin Hogg MP also saw public ownership as a critical issue. Unlike Parker, however, he argued that there was a genuine and substantial measure of agreement between the Labour and Conservative parties in 1945 and made a close comparison of their respective manifestos in order to establish this. The only substantial difference, he claimed, was over nationalization, which at a broader level represented the contrast between the Tories’ ‘national approach’ and Labour’s ‘party approach’ to the postwar situation. ‘At a time when the highest common factor of agreement offered a completely adequate programme for five years’ constructive Parliamentary work, and when much also depended upon the preservation of national unity on essential matters, the electorate deliberately chose the party approach to problems based on a sharp fight on those few (and, as I see it, minor) issues on which men of good will differ most deeply.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009412461816">38</xref></sup> For Hogg, then, the problem with Labour was less its actual policies than its divisive approach to politics; and cross-party agreement on policy was not itself sufficient to preserve the desired ‘national unity’. This demonstrates the wisdom of Michael Freeden’s comment on the pitfalls of supposing ‘that an array of policies can be unequivocally related to an ideological position.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009412461816">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other Tories made the argument, similar to that of Hogg, that there had indeed been agreement on key issues during the war but that Labour after 1945 had misapplied its principles. R.A. Butler, for example, did not reject Keynesian economics but argued that Labour had stoked up inflation by deploying policies that Keynes intended for use during a depression rather than during a period of full employment. As Butler put it at the end of the Attlee government’s life, ‘the theories of Lord Keynes and those we agreed to, with Mr. Bevin and others in the Coalition Government, [have] been turned over’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009412461816">40</xref></sup> Consensus had existed at one stage, in other words, but Labour had broken faith by departing from it or misinterpreting its lessons. This Conservative use of Keynes was to become a familiar one and continued up to the early part of the Thatcher/Lawson era.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009412461816">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Butler, who became Chancellor when Churchill returned to power in 1951, has been a key figure in historical debates about consensus. This is not least because of the famous 1954 <italic>Economist</italic> article which depicted him as one part of the composite figure ‘Mr. Butskell’, the other being Hugh Gaitskell, his Labour predecessor. Scholars critical of the notion that the 1950s was dominated by a Butskellite consensus have rightly pointed out that the immediate purpose of the article was to urge a strategy of ‘constructive Butskellism’ upon Labour as it confronted the Tories over their economic record.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009412461816">42</xref></sup> They have also argued that as ‘Butskellism’ became, in the mouths of many a term of abuse, its usage should not be read as evidence of consensus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009412461816">43</xref></sup> According to Neil Rollings, ‘Contemporary discourse in terms of Butskellism may […] be no more than pejorative rhetoric as opposed to a considered interpretation of the direction of economic policy.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009412461816">44</xref></sup> But although we may accept that ‘Butskellism’ does not serve as an objective description of the realities of 1950s policymaking, it does not follow that the rhetoric can be ignored. The question must be why, even if inaccurate, did the label seem appropriate to many contemporaries and what were the rhetorical purposes that lay behind its application?</p>
<p>One purpose was satirical. The supposed British genius for political compromise was ripe for such treatment, as in the extract from <italic>How To Be An Alien</italic> quoted at the start of this article. The left-wing cartoonist Vicky (Victor Weisz) depicted Mr. Butskell in several cartoons. In March 1954, for example, he imagined a scene 50 years later in which a deputation of women demands equal pay. Mr Butskell (still Chancellor after all this time) responds: ‘Ladies, the government agrees in principle, but does not think the time opportune etc, etc […]’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009412461816">45</xref></sup> This type of treatment was obviously not intended as a factual portrayal of macroeconomic policy, but rather as a critique of the political conservatism of both main parties. Although ‘Butskellism’ was not used by Labour figures exclusively in a negative sense, it was often used by left-wingers as a stick to beat their party’s leadership. Even before the <italic>Economist</italic> article was published, Gaitskell had complained of the <italic>New Statesman</italic>’s ‘attempts to identify me with Mr. Butler on every possible occasion. […] It is hard to believe that this is not a deliberate attempt to “smear” me in the eyes of Labour people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009412461816">46</xref></sup> Thus a term coined by a journalist and popularized by a cartoonist gained saliency at the level of elite politics. After Gaitskell’s death, the left critique was applied to his successors. After the Wilson government’s devaluation of sterling in 1967, the Labour MP Edward Fletcher observed in the Commons:<disp-quote>
<p>We have endured a long period when Ministers have been pursuing policies that have received support from the Opposition. This disturbs me very much. […] We have had a long period of Butskellism. We seem to be in danger of getting in the immediate future what I would call Callamacleodism. We had a consensus between the two Front Benches about what was needed to save the £. I am very glad that at least one thing to have come out of devaluation is that we have started fighting again.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009412461816">47</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>From this point of view, Butskellism and ‘consensus’ were ideologically enervating features of the political landscape; agreement with the Conservatives was in itself proof that Labour was on the wrong track and the party had to break free from consensus if it was to stand a chance of fulfilling its mission.</p>
<p>There were some similarities in the varying Conservative uses of ‘Butskellism’. Butler, like Gaitskell, rejected the concept. He and his supporters claimed that the 1955 Budget (which raised interest rates and cut taxes) had killed off what was merely a media-generated notion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009412461816">48</xref></sup> Some right-wingers, however, accepted its reality, and, like Labour left-wingers, were very critical of it. In 1960 the Tory MP Viscount Hinchingbrooke equated Butskellism with ‘bastard socialism’. ‘We have had nine years of “Mr. Butskell” and that is nine years too many’, he complained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009412461816">49</xref></sup> Others, during the Macmillan years, believed that Butskellism had existed in the past but that it had now been done away with. This was felt to be gratifying because the voters would be left in no doubt as to what the parties respectively stood for.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009412461816">50</xref></sup> It is tempting to conclude that, the closer a politician’s opinions were to the consensus-type view-point, the less likely he or she was to concede that a consensus existed. This may seem paradoxical given the value that was so often put in adhering to ‘middle opinion’. The explanation once more is that although many politicians wished to stake a claim to the middle ground, they could only do so by rejecting their opponents’ claim to that ground. To acknowledge genuine commonality of ideas would be to render oneself vulnerable to the charge from the fringe that one’s party’s true principles had been sold out. However, the ‘unholy alliances’ that sometimes developed between Labour leftists and Tory rightists were vulnerable to centrist ridicule. For example, when in 1961 the Macmillan government applied for EEC membership both Viscount Hinchingbrooke and the socialist Sydney Silverman MP were amongst those who opposed the decision. The Labour MP Charles Pannell, noting Hinchingbrooke’s attack on Butskellism, observed that ‘Generally speaking […] I consider Mr. Butskell far more rational than Mr. Silverbrooke.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009412461816">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>There nonetheless remained much potential to present consensus negatively, as a cosy Establishment arrangement or conspiracy. Apparent disagreement between them was phoney. From the Scottish Nationalist perspective, Labour, Liberals and Tories were all ‘UNION Parties because however they argue about superficial political issues, they cannot openly fight London control’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009412461816">52</xref></sup> From the viewpoint of the ILP – disaffiliated from the Labour Party since 1932 – growing voters’ disenchantment in the 1950s was explained by the fact that ‘electors are realising that the Tories and the Labour Party not only look alike – with their “belted knights, marquesses, dukes and a’ that” – they act alike.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009412461816">53</xref></sup> The Liberals too, seeking to present themselves as unique alternative to the two main parties, used rhetoric with a strong anti-establishment tinge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009412461816">54</xref></sup> In the later 1950s, many of the party’s candidates offered variations on the theme that the two main parties were failing to offer genuine alternative programmes and that neither was a true party of progress. Labour and the Conservatives represented the vested interests of labour and capital respectively and were thus fighting a class war at the expense of the national interest. But if there was a class war going on, did this not mean at least that there were genuine differences between the parties? The answer, it seems, was that Labour and the Tories had fought each other to a stalemate ‘in a kind of civil “cold war”’ and had accordingly been reduced to following policies of compromise and expediency. Only the Liberals, representing no vested interest, could transcend this, refusing to favour any section of the community at another’s expense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009412461816">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the later 1960s ‘consensus politics’ was coming under explicit attack and was increasingly discussed. Concurrent discussion of American consensus politics – or its breakdown – may have encouraged the use of the phrase. The Liberals played their part in this. In 1966, the Vice-Chairman of the Union of Liberal Students claimed that his organization was ‘leading the rebellion against what is called consensus politics’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009412461816">56</xref></sup> One problem with such politics was that the voters were in effect becoming disenfranchised. As one by-election candidate put it in a leaflet, ‘As the Tory and Labour Parties become more and more alike, they are losing sight of the real issues, and you, the electorate, are losing your right to choose between policies.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009412461816">57</xref></sup> There was an anti-politics/anti-system strand to this discourse. In 1968, another by-election leaflet pictured the candidate standing in front of a poster which read ‘To hell with “politicians”: LIBERALS are on <italic>your</italic> side’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009412461816">58</xref></sup> In the same year the campaigner Des Wilson, later a prominent Liberal, argued that ‘youth is not politically apathetic but appalled by the politician, the emergence and dominance of consensus politics, and “the system” that gives birth to the modern politician and his policies.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009412461816">59</xref></sup> Although there was no significant Liberal breakthrough until 1974, the party clearly saw the potential to gain from such rhetoric in an atmosphere in which – according to a survey carried out for the Conservatives – 44 per cent of the electorate was fed up with both main parties and half of voters agreed that it would be a ‘good thing if the Liberals won some by-elections as it would show how fed up people were with the two main parties’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009412461816">60</xref></sup> A little paradoxically, whilst rejecting the allegedly existing two-party elite consensus, the Liberals were claiming to represent an otherwise unarticulated consensus amongst the voters in favour of a shake-up of the existing state of affairs.</p>
<p>Consensus politics also came under overt attack from the New Left intellectuals Stuart Hall, Raymond Williams and E.P. Thompson, as well as in a 1968 charter drawn-up by the journal <italic>Tribune</italic> and backed by union leaders and left-wing MPs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009412461816">61</xref></sup> The Labour Cabinet minister Richard Crossman declared too that he had little taste for consensus politics, although at the same time he argued – the day before Enoch Powell’s notorious ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech – that bipartisanship was essential on matters of both race and religion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009412461816">62</xref></sup> (Powell, of course, presented himself as the spokesman of ordinary, decent white Britons whose concerns about immigration were being ignored by the political elite, a theme that struck a powerful chord with members of the public who wrote to him in support.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0022009412461816">63</xref></sup> These left-wing assaults on consensus were matched by others from the right. Criticizing proposed defence cuts in July 1967 the Tory MP Hugh Fraser linked the ‘rather strange world of what is called the permissive society’ with ‘what is called consensus politics’. Appearing to imply that the Conservative front bench’s stance was not sufficiently distinct from that of the government, he warned members on both sides of the House ‘that the consensus for which politicians often search leads to the lowest common denominator – a common denominator which is bad.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0022009412461816">64</xref></sup> In this analysis, the substantive policy outcomes of the consensus were faulty because of the very consensual decision-making process by which they had been reached. This anticipated the later Thatcherite critique, which presented the new ideological content she offered as intrinsically linked to a new political <italic>style</italic>, labelled ‘conviction politics’, which rejected not only previous policies but the methods by which they had been reached.</p>
<p>However, Thatcher’s own late-1960s assault on ‘the consensus theory’ was a slightly different beast. In a 1968 lecture, made when she was a member of Edward Heath’s Shadow Cabinet, she warned against the dangers of a consensus approach but denied that such an approach had been taken in Britain. She argued that the two party system was working well because the Conservatives were carrying out their job vigorously: ‘We have therefore not suffered the fate of countries which have had a “consensus” or central government, without an official opposition.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0022009412461816">65</xref></sup> (In this she was more cautious than, for example, Angus Maude – now on the backbenches, having been sacked by Heath in 1966 for his outspokenness – who had written critically in May 1968 of ‘the current state of near-consensus.’)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0022009412461816">66</xref></sup> In an article for the <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> the following year she outlined her views in more depth. ‘In the post-war years, all Governments in this country have tended to be more compromising in power than their policies in Opposition would have led an inexperienced observer to expect’, she acknowledged. But the similarity between the parties was only superficial: ‘a deeper analysis of the system finds fundamental differences in approach.’ Whereas left-wingers believed in nationalization and central control, she wrote, the pro-competition, anti-monopoly Conservative approach was different. Consensus was wrong because if the differences between the parties were to cease to be significant the voters would be denied meaningful choice. Yet her purpose in writing was not only to warn against this happening but also to deny that the current Conservative leadership had already fallen prey to such a tendency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0022009412461816">67</xref></sup> She may of course have intended her observations as a shot across Heath’s bows.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0022009412461816">68</xref></sup> Given her position within the party, though, she could not concede that the Conservatives were in the grip of a consensus that she later labelled as ‘fraudulent’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0022009412461816">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nonetheless, by the early stages of the 1970–4 Heath government, many of the rhetorical tropes associated with the Thatcherite assault on consensus were already in currency. Powell, for instance, criticized ‘the limbo of semi-socialism – with the “semi” continually diminishing and the “socialism” continually advancing – which has been our consensus system for more years than most of us care to remember.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0022009412461816">70</xref></sup> This was a version of the so-called ‘ratchet effect’ argument more famously made by Keith Joseph – that is, that Labour governments had made leftward shifts in policy that their Conservative successors had failed to reverse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0022009412461816">71</xref></sup> As Ben Jackson has recently shown, the rise of the New Right was a more complicated ideological story than the movement’s supporters later liked to admit, but it is certainly true that from its beginnings in the 1930s and 1940s its proponents had seen themselves as a network of ‘isolated men’ defending economic liberalism against a seemingly hegemonic conventional wisdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0022009412461816">72</xref></sup> Famously, F.A. Hayek dedicated <italic>The Road to Serfdom</italic> (1944) ‘To The Socialists of All Parties’; according to him, ‘if we take the people whose views influence developments, they are now in this country in some measure all socialists’, and to the extent that they differed from one another it was because they were ‘merely trying to deflect this movement [towards socialism] in the interest of a particular class or group.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0022009412461816">73</xref></sup> In <italic>Ordeal By Planning</italic> (1948), John Jewkes, a British follower of Hayek, wrote that there were many Conservatives whose views on planning he found hard to distinguish from those of members of the Labour Party.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0022009412461816">74</xref></sup> Updating the book in the 1960s, he suggested that the planning initiatives of the Macmillan–Home government and those of the Wilson administration had few differences between them; Tory efforts to distinguish their own policies from those of Labour were ‘little more than shadow-boxing.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0022009412461816">75</xref></sup> The anti-planners’ sense of ideological marginalization was matched at the political level by the Tory grassroots sense of social marginalization that led to the ‘middle class revolt’ of the late 1950s. As Tory leader, Thatcher was to exploit these feelings by presenting herself as an anti-elitist champion of the middle classes against an Establishment consensus that threatened to defeat the bourgeois virtues (as she saw them) of enterprise and thrift.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0022009412461816">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the pervasive and divergent usage of the idea of ‘consensus’, it is hardly surprising that – as seen at the start of this article – Thatcher’s own Shadow Cabinet could not agree on what the complexion and parameters of the consensus had been, even though they all accepted that it had existed. Nor were the rhetorical battles over consensus yet over. At the 1975 party conference – Thatcher’s first as leader – Joseph played to the rightwing grassroots, presenting crisis events as allies of Conservatism, ‘dragging socialists to the common ground of reality’. He argued, ‘Common ground is the real meaning of the word consensus; common ground policies consistent with the reality and yet with the beliefs that we and others have come to hold.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0022009412461816">77</xref></sup> Joseph pushed this theme over a period of months and it generated a significant amount of discussion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0022009412461816">78</xref></sup> For him, the undesirable ‘middle ground’ represented only ‘a compromise between politicians, unrelated to the aspirations of the people’. The ‘common ground’ by contrast, was shared by politicians ‘with the people and their aspirations.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0022009412461816">79</xref></sup> Unsurprisingly, he saw the Conservatives as more in touch with the common ground than Labour was. Equally unsurprisingly, there were contemporary suspicions that the idea of ‘common ground’ might be little more than a ‘clever technique for conducting partisan politics in the language of consensus’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0022009412461816">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>The continuing manipulation of the consensus idea can also be seen in the rhetoric of Labour leaders. During the second general election of 1974, Labour Chancellor Denis Healey attacked Joseph’s bold declaration in favour of monetarism: ‘The British people are asked to vote either for a slump and class conflict on an unprecedented scale or for national unity in the fight for full employment and justice.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0022009412461816">81</xref></sup> To reject full employment – or the means by which it had been sought since the Second World War – was to exclude oneself from the nation. In May 1975 – just as Paul Addison was preparing to publish <italic>The Road to 1945</italic> – Prime Minister Harold Wilson presented Labour’s plans for extending public ownership under the proposed National Enterprise Board not as a swing to the left but as a modernized version of Keynesian doctrine. ‘The NEB concept is an updating of what we all agreed in the 1944 White Paper’, he said. But although this cross-party consensus had once existed, the Conservatives had now reneged on it and were opposing Labour’s plans out of doctrinal obstinacy. (In some ways this was the Labour inverse of Butler’s 1951 argument.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0022009412461816">82</xref></sup> In 1977, Wilson’s successor James Callaghan argued that the defeat of inflation required the voluntary cooperation of Britain’s working people: ‘There is only one way, that of conciliation and consultation, preserving the cohesion and consensus in our society, of which the Opposition were once rightly proud but which in recent years they seem to have deserted.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0022009412461816">83</xref></sup> This was an overt defence of the consensus method, not merely of the ideological content of the post-war settlement.</p>
<p>But in spite of the increased willingness of many Conservatives to explicitly question both the ‘economic consensus’ and the ‘welfare consensus’, Thatcher herself, not wishing to stir up divisions within the party, continued to tread carefully.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0022009412461816">84</xref></sup> This may help explain the results of a September 1978 survey commissioned by Central Office which found that there was no consensus amongst the electorate about the differences between the parties and the directions in which they were moving. In the words of the report:<disp-quote>
<p>Conservatives were more likely to see a difference than Labour supporters and in both parties strong supporters were more likely to see a difference than weak ones. […] In terms of the electorate as a whole, a quarter think that the difference between the Labour and Conservative party is now greater than it was a few years ago, a quarter think that the difference is now less and the remainder think that the difference is not changing or have no opinion. Strong supporters of the Conservatives are most likely to see an increasing difference between the parties (37%).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0022009412461816">85</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Callaghan’s claims to be able to govern by consensus rather than by confrontation and thus to avoid class warfare gained their appeal from the memories of the industrial strife that brought down the Heath government. They lost credibility, of course, during the ‘Winter of Discontent’ that preceded Thatcher’s 1979 victory. When the TUC General Council rejected Callaghan’s pay policy in the autumn of 1978 he was forced to concede ‘that we still have to reach a national consensus on these matters’ although he stated that he still intended to pursue one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0022009412461816">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>But although explicit invocations of consensus were not her style, Thatcher arguably owed her eventual success not to the use of divisive rhetoric but to her seizure of the mantle of national conciliator that had fallen from Callaghan’s shoulders. After the Prime Minister’s disastrous ‘Crisis? What Crisis?’ press encounter of January 1979 she made a crucial party political broadcast. At the urgings of her advisers, and against her own instinct against appearing to reach out to Labour, she argued the need to put country before party in the face of domestic emergency:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0022009412461816">87</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>We’ve been unable to establish sufficient common ground in Parliament to carry through a programme of reform which the whole country wants and the whole trade union movement can accept. […]</p>
<p>The case is now surely overwhelming, there will be no solution to our difficulties which does not include some restriction on the power of the unions. And if that case is overwhelming, then in the national interest surely government and opposition should make common cause on this one issue.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>She presented herself as a unifier who represented values held by ‘the vast majority of us, whether we call ourselves Labour, Conservative, Liberal – or simply British.’ Her conclusion was that ‘We have to learn again to be one nation, or one day we shall be no nation.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0022009412461816">88</xref></sup> Nonetheless, during the election itself, she explicitly attacked the concept of consensus, making it the first such national campaign in which the term became an explicit point of contention. She told a rally in Cardiff: ‘The Old Testament prophets didn’t go out into the highways saying, “Brothers, I want consensus.” They said, “This is my faith and my vision! This is what I passionately believe!''’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0022009412461816">89</xref></sup> She recalled in her memoirs that this speech – which gave Callaghan the opportunity once more to lay claim to the centre ground – provoked tensions between her and Conservative Central Office. She noted: ‘I agreed with Keith Joseph that it was the “common ground”, not the “middle ground”, on which we must stake our case.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0022009412461816">90</xref></sup> The notion of the ‘common ground’, then, was a means to reconcile the idea of national collective values with anti-consensus politics.</p>
<p>Thus although Thatcher herself was widely seen as an opponent of ‘One Nation’ conservatism she often invoked it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0022009412461816">91</xref></sup> This was doubtless in part a rearguard action against her own party’s dissident left-wing, but it was also a stick with which to beat Labour. She accused her opponents of wishing, for electoral purposes, to create a socially divisive dependence on public sector jobs and services: ‘I am much much more nearer [sic] to creating one nation than the Labour Party will ever be. Socialism is two nations. The rule of the privileged rulers and everyone else.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0022009412461816">92</xref></sup> During that most divisive of episodes, the 1984–5 miners’ strike, Thatcher and Labour leader Neil Kinnock battled over this ground. Stephen Reicher and Nicolas Hopkins, who have analysed their rhetoric, argue that ‘both speakers construe the nature of the event such that their party is representative of an ingroup which encompasses almost the entire population and such that their policies are consonant with the definition of the ingroup identity.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0022009412461816">93</xref></sup> Put more simply, both Thatcher and Kinnock defined their own values as national values and then defined their opponents as transgressors against these.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0022009412461816">94</xref></sup> The battle continued throughout the decade. In the face of the SDP–Liberal Alliance’s efforts to seize the centre ground, Labour’s 1987 manifesto claimed ‘Only we believe that the whole nation should win and can win.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0022009412461816">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thatcher’s electoral record would suggest that it was she who manipulated the rhetoric of ‘national values’ most successfully, even as she rejected that of ‘consensus’. Here there was an element of sleight of hand. Richard Vinen has noted that, in the early 1980s, the Labour Party moved away from the traditional cross-party agreement in favour of membership of the EEC and NATO; yet it was Thatcher who was portrayed as having breached the consensus. He argues:<disp-quote>
<p>In the contexts of great power status and attitudes to economic decline, the Thatcher government did not merely accept the post-war consensus; it was a strong defender of it. […] in 1983 it was Thatcher’s Conservative Party that defended the pre-1979 consensus – revolving around the American alliance, nuclear weapons and the EEC. It was Michael Foot’s Labour Party that attacked it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0022009412461816">96</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thatcher, of course, was very happy to be seen as marking a break with a post-war ‘consensus’ settlement that was perceived as having failed even by many on the left.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0022009412461816">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we have seen, ‘consensus’ politicians had often used apparently inclusive ‘national consensus’ rhetoric to disparage and marginalize their opponents, depicting themselves and their parties as part of an in-group, which included majority national opinion but excluded the rival party. Ostensibly, the approach of those who rejected consensus as an elite imposition was very different. However, they too often posited themselves as part of an in-group – the common people, excluded from power – and as thus able to express the frustrations of the silenced majority. The two main parties or at least their leaderships were cast as the out-group, powerful but distanced from the desires of the people. Thatcher’s triumph in the Tory Party leadership contest of 1975 marked the moment when this second type of rhetoric came out of the wilderness. But Thatcher did not abandon the <italic>structure</italic> of consensus rhetoric so much as repopulate it with exclusively ‘national’ terms. Moreover, she cast political discourse as a form of preaching, not as a means of reaching rational solutions through the interplay of ideas. In her mind, ‘national values’ were innate, common-sense and non-negotiable; ‘consensus’, then, was inherently problematic, precisely because it might involve people moving away from their original ideas.</p>
<p>Arguments about ‘consensus’, then, were about far more than the technical content of policy. They were also about class, national identity, styles of political conduct, perceptions of social and political marginalization and ‘the claim to represent’, and thus marked a development of themes present in the pre-Second World War period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0022009412461816">98</xref></sup> At one level, the very fact that consensus was discussed itself constitutes evidence that it did not exist. The term ‘politics of consensus’ may be an oxymoron. In the words of Murray Edelman, ‘There is no politics respecting matters that evoke a consensus about the pertinent facts, their meanings, and the rational course of action.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0022009412461816">99</xref></sup> But if, paradoxically, the discourse of consensus was innately divisive, we may have to look elsewhere, to various pertinent silences, if areas of genuine consensus are to be identified. In other words, we need to seek out the fields of agreement that remained unarticulated precisely because they went unquestioned. This article has mainly examined elite political discourse; future research might explore further the relationship between elite and popular perceptions of consensus (for example, through the greater use of polling evidence). In conclusion, we are now in a position to see that Thatcher’s advent to power in 1979 did not constitute a revolution but rather heralded a series of incomplete ‘system changes’ that left key parts of the post-war settlement intact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0022009412461816">100</xref></sup> One thing which did not change, although it was reformulated, was the use of the rhetoric of national unity to advance partisan claims. Thatcher may have abandoned the language of consensus but she could not avoid making use of the underlying rhetorical model on which it was based.</p>

Meanwhile, Paul Addison’s <italic>No Turning Back: The Peacetime Revolutions of Post-War Britain</italic> (Oxford 2010), 76, 113, 196, touches on the question of the ‘moral consensus’ that some contemporaries also identified in regard to personal values.
