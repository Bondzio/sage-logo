<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of the study was to examine the long-term effect of a Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program on weight, impaired fasting glucose, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in an urban, medically underserved community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721712458834">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was a single-arm prospective intervention study that was designed to test the effectiveness of a community-based GLB intervention. In sum, 638 residents from 11 targeted neighborhoods were screened for body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and metabolic syndrome. Eligible individuals took part in a 12-week GLB intervention (n = 105) that addressed weight loss and physical activity. Subjects were followed for 24 months.</p>

<p>The obesity epidemic continues to rise in the United States, putting the health of its communities in jeopardy. Approximately 79 million Americans have prediabetes, placing them at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (diabetes).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712458834">1</xref></sup> Roughly one-third of individuals in the United States have metabolic syndrome (MetS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712458834">2</xref></sup> which substantially increases the risk for developing diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712458834">2</xref></sup> Given the clustering of MetS risk factors and the possible long duration of the “prediabetic” state, the prevalence of diabetes is expected to double over the next 30 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712458834">3</xref></sup> This figure, coupled with the increasing prevalence of diabetes-related complications, exemplifies the need for efforts that decrease the disease burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712458834">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Randomized controlled trials demonstrate the efficacy of lifestyle interventions aimed at preventing or delaying diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712458834">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712458834"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712458834">7</xref></sup> and the positive outcomes observed initially in these trials appear sustainable in the long term. Data from the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study demonstrate a 43% lower incidence of diabetes for up to 14 and 7 years, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712458834">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712458834">9</xref></sup> Similarly, the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) demonstrated a reduction in diabetes incidence by 34% in the lifestyle group at 10-year follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712458834">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Multiple interventions adapted from these efficacy studies demonstrate the effectiveness in “real world” settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712458834">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712458834"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712458834"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712458834"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712458834"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712458834"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712458834">17</xref></sup> Indeed, the need for these efforts is increasingly recognized by health professionals, payers, and policy makers worldwide. However, to meaningfully affect public health policy for primary prevention, understanding the effect of primary prevention efforts in community settings and in the long term is critical.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712458834">18</xref></sup> Therefore, the aim of these analyses was to examine the long-term effects of a Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712458834">16</xref></sup> on weight, impaired fasting glucose, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in an urban, medically underserved community.</p>
<sec id="section5-0145721712458834" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research Design and Methods</title>
<p>The methods of the original study are previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712458834">12</xref></sup> Briefly, this was a single-arm intervention study designed to test the effectiveness of a community-based GLB intervention, based on the Diabetes Prevention Program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712458834">5</xref></sup> Single-arm intervention studies do not contain a comparison group; rather, one group is utilized, in which all participants receive the intervention and participants serve as their own controls. The study took place in 11 urban, underserved neighborhoods near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, between 2005 and 2008. The study was carried out in 2 phases: phase 1, community-based screening to determine eligibility for the GLB intervention; phase 2, provision of the GLB intervention with 24-month follow-up including clinical assessment. The study design is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721712458834">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Community-Based Screening and Study Eligibility</title>
<p>As described previously, screening to determine study eligibility took place at community sites and was completed by staff certified in standardized outcomes measurement consistent with the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712458834">12</xref></sup> The free screenings were advertised through flyers posted in churches, physician offices, worksites, and store fronts, as well as through announcements in local newspapers and the local cable broadcast channel. In sum, 638 individuals attended 1 of 44 screenings between 2005 and 2008. They had height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure measured according to standard protocol and using calibrated equipment. Fasting blood samples were collected and analyzed to determine glucose, triglyceride, and HDL levels with the Dade Behring RXL. Adults ≥ 18 years old from the targeted neighborhoods were eligible with body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and at least 3 of the 5 components of the MetS, as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program’s Adult Treatment Panel III<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712458834">19</xref></sup>:</p>

<title>GLB Program</title>
<p>Details of the GLB intervention are described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712458834">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712458834">16</xref></sup> Briefly, members of the University of Pittsburgh Diabetes Prevention Support Center modified the DPP intensive lifestyle intervention into a group-based GLB program, reconfiguring the 16 sessions into 12 sessions while maintaining key concepts and using social learning theory as its behavioral foundation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712458834">16</xref></sup> A series of 10 support sessions are offered following the GLB intervention; however, the support sessions were not used as part of this study. Smith et al determined that the GLB is low cost and scalable and should be considered a sound investment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712458834">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712458834">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two Diabetes Prevention Support Center trained “preventionists” (1 dietitian and 1 exercise specialist) delivered the intervention at local community sites in all 11 study communities. Two “lay” health coaches provided peer support to participants and aided the preventionists. The intervention was held weekly for 12 weeks lasting approximately 90 minutes per session. Group size ranged from 5 to 13 participants. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721712458834">Figure 1</xref> represents the numbers of participants who attended each follow-up reassessment at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the intervention. Response rates were 77.1%, 61%, 46.7%, 42.9%, and 35.2%, respectively. Twenty-dollar gift cards were provided to those who completed each reassessment. Not all participants completed all reassessments. This report focuses on individuals with at least 1 reassessment (n = 86).</p>

<title>Study Outcomes</title>
<p>There were 2 primary outcomes: (1) diabetes and CVD risk reduction and (2) weight loss of ≥ 5% in the long term. Secondary outcomes included reductions in individual components of MetS in the long term (triglyceride, waist circumference, blood pressure, HDL, and glucose levels). The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol, and all participants provided informed consent. The TREND (Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Non Randomized Designs) statement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712458834">19</xref></sup> was used to prepare this report.</p>

<sec id="section11-0145721712458834">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Analyses were conducted at the individual level on all participants who had at least 1 reassessment (n = 86). Analyses were not “intent to treat,” as the study design was a nonrandomized intervention study. Intention-to-treat analysis is based on the original treatment intent, not on the treatment eventually administered. Although commonly used, especially when a comparison group is available, intention-to-treat analyses are prone to bias and often result in false-positive results. In lieu of such analyses, multivariate mixed modeling was used to address the impact of attrition on the results. Descriptive analysis was reported using measures of central tendency (eg, proportions or mean/median). Linear and 2-piecewise random-intercept mixed models were used to determine the change in outcomes over time, while controlling for relevant covariates. In piecewise models, time was divided into 2 segments (0-6 and 12-24 months), and change over time comprised 2 piecewise linear trends to determine when the most amount of change occurred. Necessary covariates included time (month), baseline age (year centered at mean value), race, gender, and baseline anthropometric or laboratory data centered at their respective mean values. Antihyperlipidemic medication use was a time-varying covariate and used when needed. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

<p>Results of the original study are reported elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712458834">12</xref></sup> as are comparisons to determine generalizability of the intervention population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712458834">12</xref></sup> Briefly, of the 203 eligible participants, 105 enrolled in the GLB intervention. When generalizability of the study sample to the overall population was examined, average age, baseline weight, and gender were all similar; however, females accounted for a larger proportion of those who participated (83.8%) to those who did not (70.8%). There were no significant differences in education or income level between groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712458834">12</xref></sup> Results from the initial report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712458834">12</xref></sup> demonstrated a marked decline in weight (46.4% lost ≥ 5% and 26.1% lost ≥ 7%) following the intervention.

After controlling for age, gender, race, and time, the probability of meeting weight loss goals at 3 months was significantly higher than attaining weight loss goals at 24 months for 3% weight loss (68.8% vs 22.1%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and 5% weight loss (45.7% vs 17.3%, <italic>P</italic> = .004; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0145721712458834">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed, participants lost the most weight immediately following the GLB intervention (a mean of 5% by 3 months) but gradually regained over time. Similarly, although the probability of meeting the respective weight loss goals decreased with time, of the participants who lost at least 5% of their body weight following the intervention (n = 38), 52.6% maintained the 5% weight loss at their last reassessment, weighing about 20 lb less than they did at baseline.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This follow-up report of a nonrandomized, prospective intervention study demonstrated that the probability of being at risk for diabetes and CVD was significantly reduced over the course of the 24-month follow-up period following a GLB program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712458834">16</xref></sup> Significant reductions in the probability of having hypertension, abnormal HDL, and high triglyceride were also observed during the follow-up period. The probability of abdominal obesity decreased; however, the greatest reduction was observed during months 0 to 6. Similarly, the probability of achieving and maintaining weight loss goals decreased over time; however, of the participants who lost at least 5% of their body weight following the intervention, over half maintained the 5% weight loss at their last reassessment, weighing nearly 20 lb less than they did at baseline.</p>
<p>These data support the efforts of others who designed and implemented lifestyle interventions based on the DPP in community settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712458834">20</xref></sup> Numerous studies report initial weight loss and risk reduction immediately following a lifestyle intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712458834">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712458834">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712458834">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712458834">20</xref></sup>; however, few report achievement of these outcomes for more than 1 year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712458834">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712458834">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712458834">23</xref></sup> Of the studies that do, Ackermann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712458834">13</xref></sup> reported that at 6 months following a lifestyle intervention, body weight decreased by 6%, and significant reductions were observed in total cholesterol. These differences were sustained after 12 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712458834">13</xref></sup> Absetz et al reported 3-year results of the GOAL Lifestyle Implementation Trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712458834">22</xref></sup> which took place in the primary care setting. Three-year results demonstrated maintenance of significant reductions in weight, body mass index, and cholesterol parameters in the long term but not glucose or waist circumference. Similar to Absetz and colleagues, Eriksson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712458834">23</xref></sup> conducted a randomized controlled trial in the primary care setting to attempt to replicate the DPP in Sweden. At 3-year follow-up, the lifestyle intervention was effective at reducing waist circumference, waist:hip ratio, and blood pressure values compared to the control group. However, there was no difference in glycemia or lipid values compared to controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712458834">23</xref></sup> These results are similar to the observed results in this report, as the greatest amount of risk reduction was found in cholesterol parameters but not glucose. Additionally, as in the studies listed above, the greatest weight loss occurred early on in the follow-up period.</p>
<p>Although this is a report of the long-term effectiveness of a community-based GLB program, it would be remiss not to compare and contrast the results to the DPPOS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712458834">10</xref></sup> As the DPPOS is an efficacy-based clinical trial, the comparisons should be interpreted with caution. Most notably, the DPPOS reports a 34% reduction in diabetes incidence over the course of the 10-year follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712458834">10</xref></sup> Although the impact of the intervention on diabetes incidence could not be determined due to the short follow-up time, the results demonstrated that risk for diabetes and/or CVD was reduced by approximately 26% at 24 months. Similarly, DPPOS lifestyle participants lost, then partly regained, weight over the course of the follow-up period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712458834">10</xref></sup> Although the participants gradually regained, they still weighed about 4 lb less than they did at randomization. The same pattern was observed in our study. Over half the participants who lost at least 5% of their body weight following the intervention maintained the 5% weight loss at their last reassessment. Given the differences in follow-up time, this number is likely to decrease if follow-up were to continue.</p>
<p>In conducting community interventions, there are various limitations that may affect the study results. For example, in this study, all participants were volunteers able to attend morning screenings. This inherently introduced volunteer bias, as only those available in the morning could participate; it may also have contributed to the small sample size of the cohort. Modified strategies to avoid fasting blood work may enhance recruitment of individuals in need of more flexible screening schedules. Additionally, as is typical with most community studies, males were underrepresented with 26% participation. Our study was also underpowered to detect significant differences in the primary and secondary outcomes due to the small sample size. Initial sample size calculations estimated that 190 participants would provide sufficient power to demonstrate valid changes in the study outcomes. Therefore, it is possible that the reported findings are subject to type II error. Thus, if there were improvements, we were unable to detect them. However, those findings that showed statistically significant differences represent true differences. As attrition may be perceived as a major limitation in our data, all our multivariate models were mixed models, which are able to account for attrition. Unlike methods that carry data forward, mixed models do not provide an overestimation of the intervention effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712458834">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>These results suggest that adults in an urban, medically underserved community may experience decreased risk for diabetes and CVD and meet weight loss goals over the course of 2 years, following participation in a GLB intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712458834">16</xref></sup> Similar to the DPPOS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712458834">10</xref></sup> the largest impact, however, is likely to be observed immediately following the intervention. Future analyses will examine differences within subgroups of the population.</p>
<p>The need for cost-effective, scalable, community-based primary prevention efforts is increasingly recognized by health professionals, payers, and policy makers worldwide. To meaningfully affect public health policy, integration of primary prevention efforts into the community is critical. Initiatives to make primary prevention a billable and reimbursable service similar to diabetes self-management education remain ongoing at the local and national levels.</p>
