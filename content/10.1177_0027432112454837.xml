<p>Due to the current recession, the American economy within the last few years has taken a nosedive, making it difficult for national, state, and local governments to support all the programs they currently have in place. There are difficult choices that need to be made about where to make sacrifices in their budgets so things can still run effectively and smoothly. Unfortunately, one of the areas where many governments have decided to make major sacrifices is in education. According to music education leader Estelle Jorgenson, “among the problems that cut across the particular settings in which [music educators] teach, [they] often individually and collectively experience a sense of powerlessness in the face of pervasive expectations of [them] by governments, businesses, religions, music professionals, and the public at large.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432112454837">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>School administrations have reduced funding, and they now have to make difficult decisions about which programs to cut. Many are choosing to let go of or reduce funding to their fine arts programs and music education in particular. In a 2012 article on “Music In Schools Month,” Sarah Randolph stated that “music programs nationwide are in danger. State and local legislators are attempting to make up for funding shortfalls in this difficult economy by cutting education budgets, which can place school music at risk.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432112454837">2</xref></sup> Fewer schools are hiring music teachers because music programs are being cut. Very little is being done at the university level to combat the problems facing our schools. As I continue with my studies to become a music teacher, I am hearing my professors speak constantly on the issue. They talk to us because they want us to be aware of what we will face in a few short years when we enter the workforce. They tell us how the program is suffering and how we are running out of money, but they cannot always provide us with the facts of the issue, there is not enough time. They are talking about the issue, but nothing is being done to combat the problem facing our schools.</p>
<p>Due to the budget crisis, music teachers are losing their jobs because schools cannot afford to keep them. Existing fine arts programs are also suffering. Teachers are scrounging for options to keep their programs alive, from fund-raising to having students contribute money so that the program can afford to function. Discussing music programs in urban settings, the Boston Conservatory’s Rhoda Bernard states that teachers are “[hosting] fund-raisers every year to support the costs of purchasing new instruments, repairing and maintaining the instruments that they have, and paying the instrumental music instructors who teach small-group lessons.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432112454837">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Schools require large sums of money to be able to keep fine arts programs operating, but the benefits that I have seen that students receive far outweigh the costs. Continuing to support our school music programs is critical to educating creative, disciplined students who can communicate effectively and work together. School administrations and governments at all levels need to come together and agree on compromises in their budgets so that our music programs can continue to shape and build our future generations.</p>

<p>Continuing to support our school music programs is critical to educating creative, disciplined students who can communicate effectively and work together.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Some people oppose saving the music programs in our schools and actively work against this. They think that the money could be better used in other ways. One reason why many want to eliminate music education programs in schools is because of their high cost. An unnamed author of a forum stated recently online that “The primary argument against the inclusion of things like art and music in school curriculum is that it distracts from those areas that are more relevant in the ‘real world’ and in terms of developing job skills.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432112454837">4</xref></sup> This author also said that “the funds required hiring music teachers, purchasing equipment for their classrooms, and making other budgetary allowances for their programs takes money away from other areas where it could be more wisely spent.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432112454837">4</xref></sup> This is true. Maintaining a good music program can be extremely expensive, but it is important to our students. Eliminating the music program would ultimately be counterproductive. You want the students to get better academically, not to suffer because the county or state wants them to have better test scores. Many students achieve better test scores just by actively participating in a school music program.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers have been looking into whether music has an effect on students’ academic performance in other subjects such as math. According to childhood education expert Ellen Booth Church, “neurological research has found that the higher brain functions of abstract reasoning as well as spatial and temporal conceptualization are enhanced by music activities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432112454837">5</xref></sup> She also states that “activities with music can generate the neural connections necessary for using important math skills.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432112454837">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Laura Jenschke, a professor at Texas Lutheran University in Seguin and a former elementary and high school teacher, commented in a recent interview about how having music in elementary schools affects children. “Having music in elementary schools is not only a creative outlet that all students need, but it enhances all of their learning skills. The students who are in our all-state choir and band have SAT scores almost four hundred points above the average. It not only shows that music skills require great intelligence, but also foster it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432112454837">6</xref></sup> Students that are involved in music programs appear to benefit academically.</p>
<p>According to a study cited by Stephen Morrison that was conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, “the students [taught] in the music classrooms, rehearsal rooms, and football fields demonstrate academic behaviors above and beyond many of their counterparts outside the music curriculum.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432112454837">7</xref></sup> Teachers cannot claim “that [their] programs are responsible for bringing out the best that each student has to offer, but [they] can say that many of the best and brightest students in [their] schools participate in the music program.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432112454837">7</xref></sup> It is hard to determine if being involved in a music program actually helps students academically, but there is no evidence to support that it does not.</p>
<p>Due to the changing budget, we have been forced to make uncomfortable accommodations. One such accommodation has been to increase the number of students each educator teaches. This means that each teacher is in charge of a larger number of students, decreasing the quality of learning and the number of teachers employed. According to Jeff Archer, “budget reductions have led some districts to boost the number of students assigned to a single teacher who is certified as a music specialist. Although the National Association for Music Education recommends one teacher per 400 in elementary schools, the ratio in Denver is closer to 1 to 700, and in New Orleans and Boston it is higher than 1 to 800.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0027432112454837">8</xref></sup> These new ratios are unacceptable because teachers cannot establish the close relationships with their students that help them create the best possible learning environment.</p>
<p>Teachers are also being forced to resort to raising money from outside sources to solve the budget problem at their schools. Some teachers are even having students pay a fee to be a part of the program. Students might not be able to participate due to the financial requirements. According to an article in <italic>Education Week</italic>, because a “proposed tax hike—50 cents per $100 of assessed property value”—would not be passed, “students in the Chicago suburb will have to pay about $30 a month to participate in band.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0027432112454837">9</xref></sup> This drastically reduces the number of students who are able to participate in music programs within their schools. Parents pay taxes so that their children can go to public schools and receive a good education, but the economy sometimes makes this challenging. We need to be able to find a way to increase funding without drastically rising taxes.</p>
<p>Keeping music alive in our schools could potentially mean the difference between a well-educated generation of young adults entering the workforce and a poorly educated one. Budget cuts in many areas are making it difficult for teachers to provide students with the education that they deserve and that is needed for these individuals to become functioning members of society in the future. When music and other arts programs are cut, the entire society is affected. We need to be able to come together to find a solution instead of having teachers being forced to take matters into their own hands. Teachers can only do so much, and only on a small scale.</p>
<p>Decreased budgets also affect parents and students. Members of the public can go to school boards and state why they want music programs to remain in schools, and students can participate in surveys and studies in the hopes of fixing the problem. Teachers can go directly to their administrations and back up claims with research of how it benefits students. A concerned parent can be very effective, but it is music teachers who decide how the funds that they are budgeted to run a music program are ultimately used to benefit children. If our society as a whole begins to look closer to what our schools are dealing with, solutions can be found that are easily agreed to by governments and administrations alike.</p>
<p>The real solution lies in looking at where money in schools is actually being spent. Columnist Dave Kindred suggested that our great universities are cutting corners in favor of athletics over academics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0027432112454837">10</xref></sup> Something similar could be happening in our grade schools as well. To find a solution to the budget problem, we should determine the necessity of funding for other programs. Budget cuts do not appear to be consistent but are focused on fine arts. Writer and politician Jeff Archer says that “at the heart of the debate…is the philosophical question of whether music should be a major part of the curriculum.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0027432112454837">11</xref></sup> The debate on whether keeping music programs in schools has become very heated, especially when parents and teachers enter the argument. Teachers are fighting for their jobs as well as their students.</p>
<p>Any of these solutions can work, but only for a short time. Administrators need to take a fresh look at their budgets and decide once again what is essential to the school system and what is not. According to an article that appeared in <italic>Teaching Music</italic>, “an informal nationwide gaze at budget battles shows that citizens are crowding into meeting rooms to stand up for programs they believe in, particularly music programs.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0027432112454837">12</xref></sup> We have at last begun to focus on the budget crisis for music education. If administrators and politicians alike would decrease funding all around, there would not be as much of a problem in schools, but they did not, and now we need to find a way to salvage the education of our students. There are politicians who are up for election this fall that are actively supporting an improved education system. Jay Inslee of the Democratic Party has put forth “an education plan that is at times less a plan and more a list of objectives and priorities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0027432112454837">13</xref></sup> Some politicians are devising nationwide plans and are working with communities to improve the education system. There will be more and more solutions offered by politicians who are trying to gain your vote. The key is to decide who is truly keeping our students’ best interests at heart. Many politicians say that they are for saving the music education program, but only a few are going out of their way to address the issue. Some are trying to find ways to get schools more money, whereas others are taking it away. The problem could easily be solved if the population takes it on themselves to do a little searching and learn about the politicians in their towns, districts, and counties. We would soon see who is actively trying to salvage music education programs in our schools.</p>
<p>Another option is to advocate for music and arts programs before your local school board. These people are the ones who are making the decisions for individual school districts. If administrations don’t believe that the community thinks that that music is an important academic offering in their schools, then the issue will never be addressed, and it will continue to get worse. We need to bring up this information to people who are in power and show them that music is important in our schools, to our students, and to our society as a whole. We as individuals and members of the public have to take it on ourselves to bring the benefits of music education to the attention of lawmakers and administrations alike.</p>
