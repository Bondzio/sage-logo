<p>Published under the aegis of the Documentation and Research Centre for Religion, Culture and Society at the Catholic University of Leuven (KADOC), these companion volumes form only the first instalments of an ambitious series of six volumes that take as their theme religious reform in England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Norway during the ‘long nineteenth century’. As reiterated in the first of these volumes, religious reform is understood as meaning ‘the conscious pursuit of renewal with the aim of adapting organized religion to the changing relations between church, state and society’. The geographical setting of these studies is perhaps harder to define for, as Keith Robbins readily concedes in his introductory essay to <italic>Political and Legal Perspectives</italic>, there is ‘an inescapable fuzziness about “Northern Europe”’ (7) as an entity. If the scope of these volumes is ‘consciously capacious, unashamedly provocative and inescapably blurred’ (9), it nevertheless makes for a fascinating historical canvas upon which very different processes of reform are delineated in very different national and pre-national settings, ranging from the United Kingdom, with its great religious diversity and broad imperial horizons, to Sweden, with its monolithic Lutheran identity and chastened national ambitions. However, there are significant commonalties in the experience of the countries under examination. All harboured powerful and privileged established churches at the beginning of this period and all witnessed the redrawing of national boundaries between 1780 and 1920, a process that was fraught with ecclesiastical as well as other difficulties. Despite major losses to overseas emigration in some cases, all experienced net population growth and increasing urbanization. Furthermore, both established and semi-established churches often served as repositories and emblems of national identity while monarchs continued to play an influential role in church affairs. This could range from Queen Victoria’s determination to promote a ‘generous pan-Protestantism’ (80), to the fondness of her grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm II, for building new churches in the Romanesque and Gothic styles as expressions of the legitimacy and antiquity of his caesaropapal functions.</p>
<p>Following the editor’s wide-ranging and thoughtful introduction, <italic>Political and Legal Perspectives</italic> proceeds to a four-part examination of the state’s management of religious reform in the United Kingdom, the Low Countries, Germany and the Nordic countries. Usually, each of these parts consists of two separate essays, divided according to chronology (in the case of the United Kingdom) or geography (in the case of the Low Countries and the Nordic countries). Significantly, the hugely tangled web of German church affairs, both before and after Unification, is unpicked by means of synthesizing the contributions of two authors (Heiner de Wall and Andreas Gestrich, an ecclesiastical lawyer and social historian respectively) into a single, lengthy chapter. Collectively, what these chapters succeed in doing is demonstrating the ebb and flow of constitutional, political and ecclesiastical fortunes, the undiminished salience of religious issues in European public life, and the diversity of approaches to religious reform. There is, for example, a striking difference between the segmented or ‘pillarized’ system that emerged in the mixed religious landscape of Belgium and the Netherlands in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the comparative stasis that prevailed in the Nordic countries. Following the separation of church and state in the Low Countries, competing religious and non-religious subcultures were supported by various forms of state aid as a means of reducing the scope for friction between them. In the overwhelmingly Lutheran Nordic countries, however, church and state remained closely intertwined throughout; the clergy of the established churches remained <italic>de facto</italic> civil servants, the rights of their tiny religious minorities were granted only belatedly, and, though there was an internal impulse for renewal, institutional change was comparatively limited. However, regardless of their different circumstances and the varied trajectories of reform, what emerges from these chapters is the intractability of some common problems, especially how to provide adequate stipends for the parochial clergy, even in those countries where established churches remained deeply entrenched.</p>
<p>Whereas the theme of <italic>Political and Legal Perspectives</italic> is ‘the role of the state in “adapting organized religion”’ (26), and is thus largely governmental and bureaucratic in its approach to the subject of church reform, the focus shifts to a ‘bottom up’ approach in the second volume which is simply entitled <italic>The Churches</italic>. Here, the process of internal reform takes centre stage, the argument being that the churches were by no means passive in meeting contemporary challenges or in shaping their own futures. In their introductory essay, Joris Van Eijnatten and Paula Yates make the critical point that the idea of reform had particular connotations in different national and cultural contexts. The concept of ‘home mission’, for example, was broadly understood in the British context as the domestic counterpart to foreign missions, whereas in Denmark the ‘indre mission’ became identified with a Pietist lobby group within the Danish state church. However, a shared dynamic towards internal reform generated a general mood of confidence; it empowered the laity, raised the professional standards of the clergy and led to theological reform, both in a conservative and liberal direction. In short, in this challenging era of church reform the common characteristics of the churches were those of ‘spirited idealism and adroit management’ (26). This experience is again illustrated through the fourfold structure employed in <italic>Political and Legal Perspectives</italic>. However, here the coverage is not quite so equal, with three essays being devoted to the United Kingdom and to the Nordic Countries whereas Germany and the Low Countries are the subjects of two each. Whether this is quite the right balance to strike is open to question, especially given the inherent complexities of the German situation and the fundamental similarities between the Nordic Countries. Nevertheless, the essays themselves are uniformly illuminating and dovetail quite nicely. In the tripartite section on the United Kingdom, for example, the late Nigel Yates made a cogent case for the vigour and effectiveness of internal church reform between 1780 and 1850, arguing that its impact was at least equal to that of contemporary reforms enacted by parliament. Peter Nockles then goes on to examine the reformist credentials and far-reaching impact of the Oxford Movement on the Church of England. Finally, Frances Knight reflects on the ubiquity of reform as a trope within the life and historiography of the British churches in the nineteenth century, acknowledges the new chronology of secularization in Great Britain as propounded by Callum Brown and others, and goes on to make the compelling argument that the classic ‘age of reform’, as covered by Yates, was followed in the United Kingdom ‘by a seventy-year period that was characterized by extraordinary energy and innovation, together with what we may begin to discern as the making of the modern religious mind’ (68). In another story of remarkable long-term success, albeit in very different circumstances, Claus Arnold considers ‘Internal Reform in Catholic Germany’, demonstrating that German Catholicism survived the vicissitudes of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, the 1848 Revolution, the wars of unification, the Old Catholic schism, the <italic>Kulturkampf</italic>, World War I and ongoing demographic change, thanks to its high degree of internal organization and prevailing ultramontanism. Given the paucity of scholarship on Dutch ecclesiastical history in this period, Joris van Eijnatten had a much harder task to demonstrate the success of the churches in the Netherlands, yet here again his tentative conclusions point to a process of energetic internal reform, which, in the later nineteenth century in particular, made a major contribution to the reconfiguration of Dutch society on largely religious lines. In terms of the Nordic Countries, special mention is due to Erik Sidenvall’s essay on Sweden, which grapples with the meaning of ecclesiastical ‘self-reform’ in the context of a society in which the fusion of church and state was particularly close. Here again, Sidenvall’s ‘maximalist definition of self-reform’, ranging from the formation of devotional societies to the creation of new types of church workers, reveals a picture of the long-term transformation of Swedish church life.</p>
<p>Both of these volumes represent a major and unprecedented exercise in the comparative history of church reform during the nineteenth century and both employ the talents of a distinguished and international body of historians. Though impressive in scope, these volumes are nevertheless accessible, with each chapter being followed by a useful bibliography. While their balance and geographical coverage may be open to question, these volumes represent the first contributions to a series which already shows considerable promise and which will no doubt serve as a major resource for the study of European religious life in the nineteenth century.</p>
