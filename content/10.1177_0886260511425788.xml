<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence of physical and psychological dating violence victimization and perpetration reported by inner-city African American and Hispanic adolescent girls as well as associated risky sexual behaviors among this population. Participants in this study were 10th- and 11th-grade female students from seven inner-city Chicago public high schools. Participants were administered with the Safe Dates measures of physical violence victimization, physical violence perpetration, psychological abuse victimization, and psychological perpetration. Approximately half of the sample reported some psychological dating violence victimization and perpetration, and approximately one third reported some physical victimization and perpetration. Hispanic adolescents were significantly more likely to report psychological victimization, whereas African American adolescents were significantly more likely to report physical dating violence perpetration. Victimization was found to predict perpetration in this population, and adolescents who acknowledged being both victims and perpetrators of dating violence were more likely to report having had vaginal sex and a higher number of past-year sexual partners. Inner-city African American and Hispanic adolescent girls may be particularly vulnerable to dating violence victimization and perpetration, which may be due to a number of other social factors not explored within this study. Furthermore, African American adolescent girls continue to engage in behaviors that increase their risk for negative health outcomes, predominantly STIs, highlighting the need for effective interventions with this population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence of physical and psychological dating violence victimization and perpetration reported by inner-city African American and Hispanic adolescent girls as well as associated risky sexual behaviors among this population. Dating violence, defined as physical, sexual, psychological/emotional abuse, or threat of abuse, by a current or former spouse or partner, is a serious public health concern in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511425788">Saltzman, Fanslow, McMahon, &amp; Shelley, 1999</xref>). Dating violence among adolescents has received increased attention in recent years due to the possible misperception that acts of pushing, verbal threats, and hitting are signs of affection and love (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511425788">Wekerle &amp; Wolfe, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511425788">Howard and Wang (2003a)</xref> found that 1 in 10 adolescent girls reported a history of dating violence, whereas other scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511425788">Coker, McKeown, Sanderson, Davis, Valois, &amp; Huebne, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511425788">Silverman, Raj, Mucci, &amp; Hathaway, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511425788">Wingood, DiClemente, &amp; McCree, 2001</xref>) have found that between 8% and 53% of adolescents report a history of physical abuse by an intimate partner. In their study of dating violence among a sample of young Hispanic adolescents (ages 11 to 13), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511425788">Yan, Howard, Beck, Shattuck, and Hallmark-Kerr (2010)</xref> found that almost one in eight reported having been hit, slapped, or physically hurt on purpose by their boyfriend or girlfriend.</p>
<p>Females who experience dating violence are significantly more likely to experience adverse health outcomes compared with those who have not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511425788">Bonomi, Anderson, Rivara, &amp; Thompson, 2007</xref>). Health consequences of dating violence include chronic gynecological, central nervous system, and stress-related health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511425788">Campbell, Jones, Dienemann, Kub, Schollenberger, &amp; O’Campo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511425788">Kernic et al., 2002</xref>) as well as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and suicidal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511425788">Campbell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511425788">Dutton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511425788">Woods et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, dating violence during adolescence has been found to be a risk factor for continued violence into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511425788">St. Mars &amp; Valdez, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Rates of dating violence among adolescent boys and girls have been a source of debate with conflicting findings. Some researchers have argued higher rates of perpetration by either girls or boys. For instance, 228 11th-grade students (122 boys and 106 girls) from two urban public high schools were asked if they were physically aggressive in their dating relationships. In the total sample, nearly 50% of the girls and fewer than 20% of the boys reported engaging in at least one physically aggressive behavior against a dating partner in the context of a disagreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511425788">Lavoie, Robitaille, &amp; Hebert, 2000</xref>). However, researchers have noted that although perpetration of dating violence by young women is just as likely to occur as with young men, young women tend to suffer more serious injuries as a result of dating violence than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511425788">Roberts, Auinger, &amp; Klein, 2005</xref>), and young women are more likely to be victims of sexual assault than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511425788">Foshee, 1996</xref>). For these reasons, we chose to focus this study on female adolescents.</p>

<title>Limited Research About Dating Violence Among Minority Youth</title>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511425788">CDC, 2010</xref>), 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data revealed that the prevalence of dating violence was higher among African American (14.3%) and Hispanic (11.5%) than White (8.0%) students, with African American girls (14.8%) having higher rates of dating violence than their Hispanic (11.4%) and White (7.2%) counterparts. To date, few studies addressing dating violence among adolescents have had enough Hispanic participants to make racial comparisons. However, the rapid growth of the young Hispanic population within the United States necessitates further exploration of the impact of dating violence on health behaviors among this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511425788">Yan et al., 2010</xref>), warranting the need to develop holistic and culturally appropriate interventions for this population. Research has also shown that in addition to experiencing higher rates of dating violence than both their Hispanic and White counterparts, African American adolescents also have higher rates of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511425788">Howard &amp; Wang, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511425788">2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511425788">Wingood et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>One study of dating violence among a group of ethnically and economically diverse urban adolescents found that almost half of their sample reported a history of dating violence with African American adolescent girls reporting the highest rates of victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511425788">Watson, Cascardi, Avery-Leaf, &amp; O’Leary, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511425788">Holt and Espelage (2005)</xref> found that African American adolescents reported higher rates of dating violence victimization than their White counterparts (43% vs. 32%), with 37% of African American girls reporting physical dating violence victimization and 66% of African American girls reporting emotional abuse in dating relationships. Similarly, approximately one in four African American adolescent girls reported experiencing dating violence at baseline in a longitudinal study of dating violence, with an additional 12% reporting dating violence at 1-year follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511425788">Raiford, Wingood, &amp; DiClemente, 2009</xref>). In regard to their Hispanic counterparts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511425788">Howard and Wang (2003a)</xref> used national 1999 YRBS data and found that physical dating violence rates were 82% higher for Hispanic girls (11%) compared with White girls (7.4%).</p>

<sec id="section3-0886260511425788">
<title>Risky Sexual Behavior</title>
<p>Adolescence is marked by sexual maturation and increased sexual risk behavior that may increase the risk of contracting an STI. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511425788">CDC (2008)</xref>, youth in the United States are at persistent risk for HIV infection, with minority youth at notable risk. Recent data have shown that 46% of high school students reported being sexually active, and 14% reported to have four or more sex partners during their life. Furthermore, 34% of currently sexually active high school students did not use a condom during last sexual intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511425788">CDC, 2010</xref>). According to Raiford and colleagues (2009), as girls maneuver through adolescence, some will experience abuse by dating partners, which can adversely affect their abilities to practice and negotiate safer sexual behaviors, thereby increasing their risk for contracting STIs including HIV. Although research has indicated that there is a significant correlation between dating violence victimization and sexual risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511425788">Kreiter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511425788">Raiford et al., 2009</xref>), to date, there remains a gap in the literature regarding dating violence perpetration and sexual risk behaviors among minority adolescent girls. This study seeks to fill this gap in the literature.</p>
<p>Given the higher rates of dating violence and STIs previously found with African American and Hispanic adolescent female populations, it is worthwhile to explore and distinguish their role as dating violence victim, perpetrator, or both and how this may affect their sexual behaviors which can have negative long-term consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511425788">Kreiter et al., 1999</xref>). Drawing primarily on social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511425788">Bandura, 1973</xref>), which states that behavior is learned through observation of others, particularly within intimate primary groups such as the family and peers, we hypothesize that African American and Hispanic adolescent girls will have similar rates of dating violence perpetration and victimization. Social learning theory also postulates that exposure to violence within these intimate groups provides young people with behaviors to emulate. Violence perpetration and victimization are often thought to result from exposure to various forms of violence including witnessing and being a victim of violence. Therefore, we also hypothesize that there will be a positive relationship between dating violence perpetration and victimization to risky sexual behaviors among this population.</p>

<sec id="section5-0886260511425788">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in this study were 10th- and 11th-grade students who were recruited in kindergarten from seven inner-city Chicago public schools. They were drawn from a longitudinal family-focused preventive intervention combined with academic tutoring called <italic>SAFEChildren</italic> that began in 1997. At that time, parents of all kindergarten children in each of the seven schools were contacted and asked to participate in the study. A total of 507 families were eligible to participate on the basis of their residence within the neighborhood boundaries of the school that their children would attend in the fall of the children’s first-grade year. Of these, 424 families (84%) consented to participate and completed at least one baseline assessment. The majority of those consented to participate had a family income below US$30,000 per year in 1996 (85%), and 59% had a family income below US$20,000 per year. Additional information regarding the methodology of this longitudinal study can be found elsewhere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511425788">Tolan, Gorman-Smith, &amp; Henry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511425788">Tolan, Gorman-Smith, Henry, &amp; Schoeny, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The full sample for this study was 308, of which 165 were female. This sample represented 72.6% of the 424 kindergarten children originally recruited for the SAFEChildren study. The adolescents ranged in age from 16 to 18 years (<italic>M</italic> = 16.9 years, <italic>SD</italic> = .45) and were evenly distributed across gender (54% female). The majority (98%) identified their ethnicity as African American or Hispanic. Only girls who were African American (52.1%) or Hispanic (47.9%) reported having ever dated someone were included in the study sample, resulting in a final sample of 140. To date, there remains a gap in the literature regarding dating violence perpetration and sexual risk behaviors among minority adolescent girls. Therefore, in an attempt to fill this gap in the literature, only data from female participants within this sample were analyzed for this study. Only heterosexual relationships were included in this analysis, as no psychometric data were available for same-sex relationships for measures used. The University of Illinois at Chicago Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260511425788">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Participants were administered the following Safe Dates measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511425788">Foshee et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511425788">1998</xref>), which are targeted at high school students and have been used with minority populations: Physical Violence Victimization Scale (internal consistency = .92), Physical Violence Perpetration Scale (internal consistency = .95), Psychological Abuse Victimization Scale (internal consistency = .91), and Psychological Abuse Perpetration Scales (internal consistency = .95). In addition, general dating questions were pulled from the Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory (CADRI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511425788">Wolfe, Scott, Reitzel-Jaffe, &amp; Wekerle, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The Physical Violence Victimization Scale asked students “How many times has any person that you have been on a date with done the following things to you? Only include it when the dating partner did it to you first. In other words, don’t count it if they did it to you in self-defense.” A score is calculated by summing the point values of the 16 responses. Higher scores are indicative of greater abuse, and scores can be categorized as 0 = <italic>no physical victimization</italic>, 1 = <italic>victimization occurred 1 to 3 times</italic>, and 2 = <italic>victimization occurred more than 3 times</italic>. The Physical Violence Perpetration Scale has the same structure as the Victimization scale but asked students “How many times have you ever done the following things to a person that you have been on a date with? Only include when you did it to him or her first. In other words, don’t count it if you did it in self-defense.”</p>
<p>The Psychological Abuse Victimization Scale asked “How often has anyone that you have ever been on a date with done the following things to you?” The score is calculated by summing responses across all 14 items. A score of 0 indicates no victimization, scores of 1 through 5 indicate mild psychological abuse, scores of 6 through 9 indicate moderate psychological abuse, and scores of 10 and greater indicate severe psychological abuse. The Psychological Abuse Perpetration Scale follows the same structure but asked “How often have you done the following things to someone you have ever had a date with?”</p>
<p>General dating questions such as “how many boyfriends have you had?” and “at what age did you start going out/having boyfriends?” were culled from the CADRI. Sexual risk behavior questions were culled from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) In-Home Questionnaire, Section 16 (Sexual Experiences and STDs). Add Health is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of adolescents in Grades 7 through 12 in the United States during the 1994 and 1995 school year, and the interview was designed to gather data on social, economic, psychological, and physical well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511425788">Harris et al., 2009</xref>). For our purposes, we assessed the following risky sexual behavior: ever having had vaginal sex, oral sex, number of sex partners, number of times had sex in the past year, condom use, pregnancy, and drug or alcohol use during most recent sexual encounter. Needle use was assessed, but none in the sample acknowledged this behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886260511425788">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed with SPSS Version 19.0 (Chicago, Illinois). As we collected both categorical and continuous data, several statistical tests were used. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to analyze differences in the dependent variables (i.e., physical and psychological victimization and physical and psychological perpetration scale scores) by race. A simple linear regression was conducted to determine if dating violence perpetration scores could be predicted from dating violence victimization scores. A multiple linear regression, entering both variables simultaneously, was used to determine the impact of race being added to the model. Stepwise multiple linear regression was also used to determine if risky sexual behaviors (i.e., having ever had vaginal sex, past-year number of vaginal sex partners, past-year condom use, and pregnancy) could be predicted from an acknowledgement of victimization, perpetration, or both. Chi-square analysis was used to analyze categorical data related to sexual risk behaviors.</p>
<p>Results with <italic>p</italic> levels less than .05 were considered significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section9-0886260511425788">
<title>Victimization</title>
<p>Sixty-five percent of girls reported no physical victimization, 11% reported being victimized once, 9% reported being victimized 2 or 3 times, and 14% reported being victimized more than 3 times. Forty-four percent of girls reported no psychological victimization, 45% reported mild psychological victimization (scores of 1-5), 9% reported moderate psychological victimization, and 2% reported severe psychological victimization. Overall, 35% of African American and Hispanic girls reported having experienced at least one instance of physical victimization in a dating relationship and 55.7% reported having experienced at least one instance of psychological victimization. When examined by race, Hispanic girls were significantly more likely than African American girls to report higher levels of psychological victimization in a relationship, <italic>F</italic>(1, 138) = 35.42, <italic>p</italic> = .04, but no more likely to report physical victimization. Both African American and Hispanic girls reported physical and psychological victimization somewhat infrequently. African American girls had a mean score of 1.4 on both the Physical (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.8) and Psychological (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.1) Victimization scales. The Hispanic sample reported a mean score of 1.3 on the Physical Victimization (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.6) and 2.4 on the Psychological Victimization (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.4) scales.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260511425788">
<title>Perpetration</title>
<p>With regard to perpetration of dating violence, 51.4% of African American and Hispanic girls reported having displayed at least mild psychological aggression in a dating relationship, and 37.1% reported having perpetrated at least some physical aggression. African American girls reported significantly higher levels of perpetration of physical dating violence than Hispanic girls, <italic>F</italic>(1, 138) = 4.56, <italic>p</italic> = .03, but there was no difference in psychological perpetration of violence in dating relationships. As with victimization, reports of perpetration of dating violence were somewhat infrequent. African American girls had a mean score of 2.7 on the Physical Aggression Scale (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.7) and 2.3 on the Psychological Aggression Scale (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.0). Hispanic girls reported a mean score of 1.2 on the Physical Aggression Scale (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.1) and 1.6 on the Psychological Aggression Scale (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.7).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0886260511425788">
<title>Predicting Perpetration From Victimization</title>
<p>A simple linear regression model revealed that reports of victimization significantly predicted reports of perpetration of dating violence, β = .62, <italic>t</italic>(138) = 9.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Dating violence victimization scores also explained a significant proportion of variance in dating violence perpetration scores, adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .39, <italic>F</italic>(1, 138) = 87.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>To determine the role of race in the model, a multiple linear regression with race and victimization entered simultaneously was used to predict perpetration. Race is also shown as predicting dating violence perpetration, β = .25, <italic>t</italic>(137) = 3.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The inclusion of race as a factor is a slight improvement on the model at predicting dating violence perpetration, adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .44, <italic>F</italic>(2, 137) = 56.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0886260511425788">
<title>Sexual Risk Behaviors</title>
<p>Sexual risk behaviors were compared between groups of those reporting no victimization or perpetration and those reporting at least one instance of victimization or perpetration. As expected, sexual risk behaviors were present to a greater degree among those who reported being victims or perpetrators of dating violence (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511425788">Table 1</xref>). This group was more likely to report having ever had vaginal sex, having ever received oral sex, drinking during their most recent sexual encounter, having more oral sex partners in the past year, and having vaginal sex at an earlier age.</p>

<p>Additional analyses were conducted to examine the sexual risk behaviors of African American and Hispanic girls who had been victimized and/or had perpetrated dating violence. Dating violence victimization (psychological or physical) was reported by 83 girls, perpetration was reported by 77, and both victimization and perpetration was reported by 67 girls. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260511425788">Table 2</xref> illustrates the percentage of responses to sexual risk behavior questions. Significant findings were found between groups in response to whether they have ever had vaginal sex and the number of past-year (vaginal) sexual partners. Girls who reported both victimization and perpetration were significantly more likely to have had vaginal sex and reported a higher number of past-year sexual partners than the victimization-only group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Much of the current literature that has focused on dating violence among adolescents has used school-age, middle-class, White girls. When minority youth are included in study samples, a comparative race approach is often used which may contribute to inappropriate and misleading results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511425788">West &amp; Rose, 2000</xref>). This has served to create a significant gap in the literature in regard to the dating violence experienced by adolescent minority girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511425788">Jackson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511425788">West &amp; Rose, 2000</xref>). Although there is a growing body of literature on dating violence among minority adolescents, to date this is one of the first studies that has focused specifically on the associations between dating violence perpetration and/or victimization and sexual behavior among a predominant sample of inner-city African American and Hispanic adolescent girls.</p>
<p>There are several significant findings of this study. First, 35% of African American and Hispanic girls reported having experienced at least one instance of physical victimization in a dating relationship and approximately 56% reported having experienced at least one instance of psychological victimization. These findings are consistent with the findings of other researchers noting that adolescent girls in dating relationships experience high rates of dating violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511425788">Kreiter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511425788">Foshee, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511425788">Sanderson, Coker, Roberts, Tortolero, &amp; Reininger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511425788">Silverman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511425788">Watson et al., 2001</xref>) and that African American and Hispanic adolescents report even higher rates of dating violence victimization than their White counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511425788">CDC, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511425788">Holt &amp; Espelage, 2005</xref>). Of note, Hispanic girls were more likely than African American girls to report psychological victimization.</p>
<p>Another significant finding of this study is that approximately half of the African American and Hispanic girls reported having displayed at least mild psychological aggression in a dating relationship, and 37% reported having perpetrated at least some physical aggression. In terms of racial/ethnic differences, African American girls reported significantly higher levels of perpetration of physical dating violence than Hispanic girls, but there was no difference in psychological perpetration of violence in dating relationships. These data suggest a higher incidence of adolescent girls reporting dating violence perpetration than that previously reported in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511425788">Foshee (1996)</xref> found that almost 28% of adolescent girls reported perpetrating at least one incidence of dating violence, even when controlling for self-defense. Our study also controlled for self-defense, as measures asked respondents to exclude any violence related to self-defense.</p>
<p>Third, inner-city adolescent girls who reported victimization were more likely to also report perpetration of dating violence. African American adolescents who reported dating violence victimization were particularly more likely to report dating violence perpetration. This suggests that African American adolescent girls may be perpetrating violence in self-defense or are in mutually violent relationships, which would be consistent with other research findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511425788">Capaldi &amp; Owen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511425788">Milan, Lewis, Ethier, Kershaw, &amp; Ickovics, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511425788">Whitaker, Haileyesus, Swahn, &amp; Saltzman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, in examining the association between dating violence perpetration and/or victimization on risky sexual behavior among African American and Hispanic adolescent girls, the results indicate that sexual risk behaviors were present to a greater degree among those who reported being victims or perpetrators of dating violence. This group was more likely to report having ever had vaginal sex, having ever received oral sex, drinking during their most recent sexual encounter, having more oral sex partners in the past year, and having vaginal sex at an earlier age. Furthermore, within the victimization-only group, African American girls were significantly more likely than Hispanics to have ever had vaginal sex. Again, these results are consistent with other research indicating the negative health outcomes such as high number of sexual partners, inconsistent condom use, substance use, depression, and pregnancy associated with dating violence among adolescents, especially African American adolescent girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511425788">Silverman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511425788">Wingood et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of this study provide some implications for prevention and future research. In an effort to establish autonomy, adolescents often seek relationships outside of the family structure. Families cannot always protect their adolescents from experiences with intimate partner violence and risky sexual behavior; however, an understanding of the health outcomes that are associated with these experiences can be helpful in designing effective prevention curricula for adolescents who have experienced such violence. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511425788">Whitaker et al. (2007)</xref>, to date primary prevention strategies have not been targeted to girls or provided sex-specific curriculum. Thus, future prevention efforts in the area of dating violence among adolescents should unequivocally include content on female perpetration and, when available and appropriate, provide culturally relevant, holistic, and sex-specific interventions.</p>
<p>Due to the rates of dating violence perpetration and victimization among African American and Hispanic adolescent girls within this sample, it is recommended that future researchers replicate this study with a larger sample of minority girls. Although study participants’ were inner-city high school sophomores and juniors, research has shown that dating violence is occurring among youth as young as 11 years old. Studying dating violence among a younger sample of African American and Hispanic girls can assist researchers and practitioners in developing holistic and age-appropriate interventions for these young women earlier rather than later.</p>
<sec id="section14-0886260511425788">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The findings of this study should be interpreted in light of the following limitations. First, although the results of this study provided some rich data in regard to dating violence among inner-city African American and Hispanic adolescent girls, the cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow a determination of the temporal and causal nature of relationships. Second, even though perpetration was predicted from victimization, there is no way for the researchers to conclude that victimization came first for these adolescents. Third, the data used in this analysis were collected from a study with different aims and thus were not structured for our particular hypotheses. Further research addressing the primary aims of this study is needed to fully understand the effects of dating violence among adolescent minority girls. Fourth, the small size of the sample and the specificity of the sample (i.e., inner-city) prohibit our ability to generalize the findings of this study to other African American and Hispanic adolescent girls; therefore, replication of this study with a larger sample size is recommended. Finally, the self-report nature of the survey may create some issues with report bias and thus the level of confidence in the data. Due to the taboo nature of dating violence and sex among adolescents, participants may have underreported their involvement in dating violence perpetration, victimization, or their sexual history. If this were the case, it would provide further evidence that dating violence prevention efforts are needed to target this population.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, we found that inner-city African American and Hispanic adolescent girls are likely to encounter some level of dating violence as they navigate adolescence and as a result may perpetrate violence in future dating relationships and/or participate in risky sexual behaviors. Though Hispanic adolescent girls may experience greater psychological victimization, African American adolescent girls may be particularly vulnerable to dating violence victimization and perpetration, which may be due to a number of other social factors not explored within this study. Furthermore, African American adolescent girls continue to engage in behaviors that increase their risk for negative health outcomes, predominantly STIs including HIV and pregnancy, indicating the need for effective interventions with this population.</p>
