<abstract>
<p>Among Asia Pacific Muslims who migrate West, spirituality is fundamental. The implications include the need for Western social workers when appropriate to apply Islamic-specific spiritual criteria. The dampening effects of Western social work absent Islamic spiritual resources will impair the potential of the profession. Effective social work practice involving Asia Pacific Muslim populations must necessarily incorporate knowledge of Islamic spirituality and if necessary apply it. The ability of Western social workers to accurately perceive, conceptualize, and interact therapeutically with Asia Pacific Muslim populations is a necessity where such populations have recently migrated West.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Citizens of Western nations tend to regard confrontations with the Islamic Muslim community as a modern-day phenomenon. In fact, tensions between Islam and the West existed prior to America’s Declaration of Independence in 1776 (Weinberg, 2006). American conflicts with Muslim states in North Africa were memorialized in song by Francis Scott Key via ‘The Shores of Tripoli’. That reference was eventually institutionalized as America’s ‘Star Spangled Banner’ national anthem. No less relevant were confrontations with Europe where European colonial powers intentionally avoided Muslim states in their slave transactions as Muslim slave rebellions were not uncommon (Mouser, 2007). Subsequently, historical tensions between Muslims and the West are far from being a modern-day phenomenon. This fact has imposed upon the well-being of Muslims who migrate and settle in Western countries. The recent tragedies of September 11, 2001 committed by Arab Muslims, while disassociated with Asia Pacific Muslims, have exacerbated pre-existing tensions. Unlike other immigrants, all Muslims must now establish their loyalty in being accepted as authentic citizens of Western civilization (Jenkins, 2003).</p>
<p>Just prior to September 11, 2001, Muslims felt confident in their acceptance after the US Postal Service issued a stamp in Arabic for ‘blessed holiday’ (Schmid, 2001). Unfortunately, its release occurred a week before terrorist attacks on New York City’s financial district. Elsewhere in the West, European countries visited by terrorism in the form of Muslim violence include Sweden, France, and the UK (Lebl, 2010). Such acts, perhaps more than any others, have dominated modern era perceptions of the Muslim community, including Asia Pacific Muslim populations, spurring further tensions with the West. Simultaneously, via migration to Western countries, the Muslim community has grown. Despite Islam’s formidable diversity, Muslims of Asia Pacific heritage are less acknowledged and have not as yet engaged in any significant violent confrontations with Western societies: but they have been no less characterized (Sodhy, 2003).</p>
<p>Of the 49 countries included among the Asia Pacific region, the leading economies include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Russia, and the United States (Hewison, 2007). With the exception of Japan, most are of Judeo-Christian spiritual origins. Among the poorest countries are Indonesia, the Philippines, and Pakistan, where Islam for many is the preferred cultural and spiritual tradition of the people. Such countries differ culturally not only by religion but language and government as well. What’s more, among the poorer economies in the region exist differences such as the democracy in India and the military government in Thailand (Hewison, 2007).</p>
<p>Currently, Islam is the fastest growing spiritual tradition in the world. As a result it serves as the second largest spiritual resource, that is a support system that social workers need to be familiar with if they are to serve Muslim populations. There are currently over 1.5 billion Muslims who follow Islam worldwide (Forum, 2009). Although most contemporary attention has been focused on Arab Muslims in the Middle East and Near Eastern countries, there are significant Islamic believers of Asian descent located in Southeast Asia (Rights, 2003). In particular are Asia Pacific countries where followers of Islam account for more than half the total population (Forum, 2009). These countries include: Indonesia (95 percent), Malaysia (52 percent), and Pakistan (97 percent) (Forum, 2009). Not included but no less significant are Asia Pacific Muslim populations located in the Philippines. More than any other Asian people, Filipinos (i.e. Asia Pacific Muslims) have actively migrated West since the Spanish-American war of 1898 (Hendrickson, 2003). This fact increases the likelihood of their encounter with Western social work practitioners. As an ethnic group they are distinct from Arab and Near Eastern ethnic groups culturally and linguistically. Thus, given the historical migration trends of Asia Pacific Muslim populations in particular to Western countries, as well as the burgeoning population of citizen Muslims already there, it is imperative that Western social work practitioners have adequate knowledge of the Islamic faith and the differentiations associated with the various populations. Yet Western social workers have not adequately incorporated Islamic spirituality as a practice resource commensurate with the Muslim population. Subsequently, Asia Pacific Muslim populations are then disserved, due to the limitations of traditional Western social work practice. These limitations are a formidable obstacle to the sanctity and future viability of the social work profession. Since the implementation of a joint mental health mandate in 1979, in Western countries such as the US those in the helping professions (i.e. social workers, psychologists, counselors, and others) have been encouraged to adopt practices that respect diversity, cultural, and religious differences (Livingston et al., 2008). Such policies have required that Western social work practitioners be not only abreast of cultural differences but also understand familial strengths, and ideological and cultural factors that undergird differences in behavior, thought, attitude, and faith.</p>
<p>The dampening effects of traditional Western social work practice absent Islamic spiritual resources can impair the effectiveness of social work interventions. Without exception, the application of Islamic spirituality as practice resource is a necessity of intervention with Asia Pacific Muslim populations, who may not respond to traditional Western methods of intervention (Hodge, 2000). Thus, the ability to enable social work practice in the West – despite rhetoric to the contrary – will require the introduction of Islamic spirituality as available resource into the practice setting when traditional methods of therapeutic intervention fail. This will require social workers to do what is necessary to educate themselves about the dynamics of Islamic spirituality in reference to the Asia Pacific Muslim populations being served. Although the Western social work literature acknowledges spirituality among the list of practice resources, amidst the prioritization of more traditional resources it has been all but trivialized (Callaghan and Schnell, 2009). A greater focus on the significance of Islamic spirituality would enable Western social work practitioners to intervene on behalf of Asia Pacific Muslim populations efficiently and without incident. Instead, social workers have relied too heavily upon non-spiritual resources, including Western therapeutic techniques as standard practice despite the increasing diversity among Muslims and other practice populations. As a result, rather than attempting to incorporate Islamic spirituality for effective practice outcomes, the profession has failed in not keeping pace with the various populations being served.</p>
<p>As indicated, the aforementioned Asia Pacific Muslim populations have increased substantially, migrating actively to Western countries. Since September 11, 2001, due to the consistent negative portrayal of Muslims worldwide and their active migration to Western countries, members of the Islamic faith located in Western countries have increasingly begun to seek social work services (Rights, 2003). Continued negative stereotyping, racial epithets, and actual physical attacks against Muslims have amplified since the events of 2001 and military engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although Asia Pacific Muslim populations are smaller in Western numbers and appear and dress differently from Arab or Middle Eastern Muslims, still they share the common spirituality of Islam. Thus the negative stereotypes, imagery, and racial and religious provocation against the Islamic community affect all Muslims, leading to an increase in fear, isolation, and depression among those Muslims who reside in the West. That fear must be addressed in a manner that acknowledges the various differentiations between Muslims in toto.</p>
<p>In Western countries, conscientious social workers would be remiss to exclude a critical resource when it is essential to therapeutic outcomes and building rapport with Asia Pacific Muslim populations. Islamic spirituality for such populations may enhance the therapeutic potential of family values, family belief systems, and family traditions that would be otherwise inaccessible by Western methods. Furthermore, spirituality for Asia Pacific Muslim populations may contain cultural coping mechanisms that enable them to confront and overcome the many challenges of daily life, especially as it pertains to Western cultural disconnects. In an effort to educate and contribute to the effectiveness of Western social work’s practice intervention, this article has three objectives: (1) to inform and bring clarity to Western social work practitioners of misunderstood and underrepresented Asia Pacific Muslim populations; (2) to provide a brief definitive account of Islam as spiritual resource; and (3) to detail the implications of Islamic spirituality for Western social work practice with Asia Pacific Muslim populations who migrate to Western countries.</p>

<title>Spirituality and Islam</title>
<p>Numerous scholars have attempted to define spirituality in an effort to simplify its myriad complexity of meanings. Among those are Joseph M. Cervantes and Oscar Ramirez (1992), who suggest that spirituality includes the pursuit of universal accord and completeness. Paul Tillich (1959) maintains that spirituality pertains to humanity’s utmost concerns relative to the meaning-giving aspect of culture. Father Leo Booth (1992), in a more tangible explanation, refers to spirituality as an ‘inner attitude that emphasizes energy, creative choice, and a powerful force for living’ (Booth, 1992: 25). Similarly, Elkins et al. (1988) suggest that spirituality includes an admiration for the holiness of life and a harmonious regard for the material, an attitude of altruism toward one’s fellow man, hope for a better world, and the acknowledgment that life has a tragic dimension. Furthermore, according to Chandler et al. (1992), spirituality includes ‘any experience of transcendence of one’s former frame of reference that result in greater knowledge and love’ (Chandler et al., 1992: 170). Subsequently, Hinterkopf (1994) refers to spirituality as something felt in one’s body. Such a feeling then precipitates comprehension of new meanings in life, which enhances growth.</p>
<p>The religious and moral systems of Asia Pacific Muslim populations vary and, unlike Arab Muslim populations, differ from others in that they are historically influenced by Buddhism, Hinduism, Shamanism, Confucianism, and Taoism; Christianity, as well as Islam, has had a significant contemporary influence in Asia. Hence through the travel of merchants navigating spice routes to South Asia and Southeast Asia, the spirituality of Islam was spread. Moreover these exchanges of goods and services along with religion have continued from antiquity up to the present day. Currently Muslims of Asian descent are employed throughout the West, as computer programmers, doctors, scientists, sea farers, etc. (Vaughn, 2005). Although their culture is an influence, their spirituality, manifested in the form of Islam, has a significant impact upon their lives.</p>
<p>Spirituality manifested via Islam is by far the prevailing life force among Asia Pacific Muslim populations. Such populations are born into Islam and are expected to remain committed to its spiritual rituals and traditions for life. Their commitment to Islam is so old and deep-rooted that it has permeated all aspects of family life (Al-Krenawi and Graham, 2000). It is most evident in the belief system held by persons dedicated to the faith. These beliefs are considered canons and not subject to debate. Perhaps foremost in importance among such canons is a belief in the oneness of Allah (God). That belief is associated with the prophet Muhammad. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. While the Koran regards Him as an ordinary human being, in the Muslim belief system Muhammad has been accorded the status of a divine entity (Dougherty, 2010; Wasfi, 1964).</p>
<p>Akin to Muhammad in status is the spiritual canon that takes the Koran to be the literal word of Allah. The Koran is the holy literature that exemplifies the final revelations of mankind. It holds the directives for life to which all Muslims must submit. Not to be minimized in context is its recognition of Gabriel. Gabriel is the most spiritually prominent among angels and considered bearer of the revelation and the force of holiness. Belief in angels is essential because it enables the last spiritual canon, which is life after death. Dependent upon how one lives, reward or punishment will await them in the hereafter (Siegel, 1980).</p>
<p>Despite cultural and linguistic differences between various ethnic Asia Muslim populations, Muslim families place high value on spirituality. The patriarchal arrangement is its traditional family structure. Both recent and not so recent Asia Pacific Muslim populations who migrate West conform to a hierarchical organization of family authority that extends to roles, obligations and status. The welfare of the family supersedes the welfare of the individual, making it the basis of identity (Ghazi et al., 2011; Wasfi, 1964). Family is, furthermore, the reference point for individual behavior. Its union all but completely negates personal independence – a concept that is foreign to traditional Western mores where personal individuality more often reigns of primary significance.</p>
<p>Especially among Asia Pacific Muslim families where Islam is the spiritual tradition, reverence for the patriarch, as well as concern for the family’s status, provides a strong sense of solidarity and loyalty (Ghazi et al., 2011; Wasfi, 1964). Hence, the individual family member is not free to live independently but must consider family in each of their life decisions as prescribed by the Koran. The Koran, being the direct instruction from Allah, means that family members are expected to fulfill rules of behavior, as well as family roles such as husband, wife, child, etc., without the opportunity for personal input or preference. An individual’s ability to adhere to spiritual directives reflects not so much upon him or her personally, but upon the family and its kinship network. In the Islamic tradition, males are then more valued than females, which may cause conflict for social workers in Western practice settings. Moreover, in such settings, men are the individuals to whom questions are expected to be directed, and although children are valued, they are not expected to be in the company of adults after greeting them. This presents a considerable challenge for Western social workers engaging families in treatment, such as couples, family, or group therapy.</p>
<p>The importance of spiritual matters for Asia Pacific Muslim populations is evident in the extreme reluctance of Asia Pacific Muslim individuals to yield to conversion (Krings, 2008; Wasfi, 1964). For the individual Muslim, family is not irrelevant to Islam, as the family role in the spiritual existence of the community is crucial. Thus, those families who migrate West more often send for their relatives in the ‘old country’. Once abroad, there are few who do not have blood ties. Those who do not are obvious by their difficulty in finding jobs or otherwise sustaining themselves. Frustrated, such Muslims without family frequently return to the ‘old country’, where normal family ties are a way of life. This significance of family is evident by the fact that whole Muslim communities may contain a small number of patrilineages (Clarke, 2009; Wasfi, 1964). Consequently, there is considerable overlap between family and spirituality within the Muslim community. However, while family is an important social structure, spirituality as pertains to Islam guides life and the family belief system. Western social workers who do not acknowledge this fact in the practice setting will be at a severe disadvantage in their attempts to treat Asia Pacific Muslim populations. Those who do will consider the values extended from spiritual resources when working with such families. Spiritual values recognized by the Koran include the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Hospitality and generosity in giving and spending</p>
<p>Respect for elders and parents</p>
<p>Wealth and male children</p>
<p>Subordination of women to men</p>
<p>Modesty</p>
<p>Intensive religiosity</p>
<p>Equality of all human beings</p>
<p>Health and strength</p>
<attrib>(Wasfi, 1964: 61–2)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The therapeutic worth of spirituality has been investigated empirically. Narayanasamy (2006) examined the impact of empirical studies of spirituality and culture relative to nurse education. The investigator applied action research containing qualitative methods. Given the nature of spirituality, various research methods were applied. The results yielded the development of applicable theories, models, and conceptual literature to spiritual and cultural care. Succinctly put, Narayanasamy’s investigation produced a body of research conducive to nursing education and practice as pertains to spiritual resources.</p>
<p>Tsuang et al. (2002) investigated the associations of spirituality with mental health in twins. Variables included empirically defined dimensions of spirituality, personality measures, and mental disorders in Vietnam-era veterans. The sample consisted of 100 pairs of male twins. They were assigned the self-report Spiritual Well-Being Scale and a pilot Index of Spiritual Involvement. Statistical calculations applied correlation analyses and regression analyses that assessed the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on aspects of spirituality. Results suggest that well-being is associated with 7 of the 11 dimensions of personality. The same was negatively associated with substance abuse and/or two of three clusters of personality disorder symptoms. Associations between mental health and spirituality were minimal (Tsuang et al., 2002).</p>
<p>Tsuang et al. (2007) investigated the associations of spirituality with well-being and health. Their objective was to determine whether or not links to health variables were attributed to religious aspects of spiritual well-being. They sampled 345 pairs of twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Each completed a diagnostic interview and questionnaires that contained the 2-factor SWB (spiritual well-being) Scale and general health items. Results suggest that links between SWB and health outcomes are explained by the SWB subscale of existential well-being. The investigators concluded that research pertaining to SWB and health should maintain distinction between religious variables, which more directly approximate the psychological construct of personal well-being.</p>
<p>Volcan et al. (2003) investigated the relationship between spiritual well-being and minor psychiatric disorders in a cross-sectional study. Their objective was to assess the influence of spiritual well-being as pertains to the mental health of college students. The study took place in Brazil, consisting of a combination of 464 medical and law students. Of the total, 43 of the students were absent, which resulted in a 9.3 percent sample loss. Three instruments were used, consisting of the following: 1) Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS); 2) Self Reporting Questionnaire 20 (SRQ-20); and 3) a pre-coded questionnaire with questions on socio-demographic data, religious/spiritual practices, and stressful life events. After the collection of data, investigators calculated Chi-square tests and logistic regression. Results suggest 80 percent of the students claimed a spiritual belief and/or religious affiliation. The calculated mean score vis-à-vis spiritual well-being was measured at 90.4. Scores of 45.6 and 45.1 were calculated for the existential and religious subscales. The Spiritual Well-Being Scale noted a relationship with religious practices, but said relationship was not impacted by socio-demographic and cultural variables. Those students measuring low to moderate spiritual well-being were double in risk for presenting minor psychiatric disorders (MPD) (OR [odds ratio] = 0.42; 95 percent CI [confidence interval]: 0.22–0.85). Those students measuring low to moderate existential well-being were almost five times more inclined to MPD (OR = 0.19; 95 percent CI: 0.08–0.45).</p>
<p>Social workers have not been aloof from the potential of spiritual resources. For those who utilize cognitive therapy in practice, seldom do they attend to the value assumptions contained in the self-statements germane to the change process. A rewording of statements associated with values drawn from clients’ spiritual belief systems has the potential to enhance effectiveness for a variety of social work practice populations (Hodge, 2008). The fact is that Western social workers on some level, albeit minimal, have attempted to fuse client spirituality with the therapeutic process. This attempt without legitimate objection validates the spiritual connections between clients and their well-being (Zapf, 2005).</p>
<p>Health care professionals, including social workers, have for some time questioned the validity of the Western practice model. According to Rich (2007), the Buddhist Sangha where workers together strive for a common goal might prove more useful. Family intervention with Chinese schizophrenics, according to Kung (2005), would not prove effective via Western models. The extent of centrality of the Chinese family is not the norm in Western societies, posing unique challenges to Western social workers accustomed to Western models of service (Kung, 2005). Thus, as per the aforementioned, effective and efficient Western social work practice involving Asia Pacific Muslim populations must necessarily incorporate knowledge of Islam. Of key importance for Western social work practitioners is to understand that Islam is submission to the Will of God and obedience to His (Allah) law. Hence, it is only by submission to God’s Will and obedience to His law that believers can achieve peace and everlasting purity manifested through their adherence to Islam via its directives. Thus, Western social work practitioners must take into account the relevance of how spirituality is manifested in Islamic influences, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and familial interactions. This is most apparent when addressing styles of coping, assessing patterns of behavior, and overall treatment planning. Moreover, in order to build rapport and increase engagement of treatment interventions, Western social work practitioners must acknowledge the Islamic spiritual perspectives and their application to daily living. Thus, Western social work practice with Asia Pacific Muslim populations cannot bring about positive therapeutic outcomes without at least the availability of Islamic spiritual resources. Subsequently, alliances with Islamic clergy, called imams, are a critical factor for Western social work practitioners who serve Asia Pacific Muslim populations.</p>
<p>‘Imam’ is an Arabic term that often refers to the head of a Muslim community. It is mentioned numerous times in the Koran in reference to Muslim leaders and to Abraham. The term imam may have different implications among the various sects of the Islamic community. Such differences were not irrelevant to the political and religious intra-group interpretations. According to the literature among Sunnites, imam is similar to the caliph. The caliph assumes an administrative and political but not religious role. The caliph is appointed by men and is to be obeyed by all as long as he adheres to the dictates of Islam (Haney, 2009).</p>
<p>Among the Shiite sect of Islam, the imam assumes a religious and/or spiritual role. They are believed to possess unique and secret insights into the Koran that common Muslims do not have. The Shiite imam is a most revered and respected Islamic authority figure among the people. In contrast to the Sunnite imam, the Shiite imam determines matters of doctrinal importance and interpreted revelation. As per the historical disappearance of the last true imam, there has been little agreement as to the actual number who existed among the major sects.</p>
<p>Social work practitioners in Western countries who serve Asia Pacific Muslim populations would be advised to acknowledge and respect the imam. Aside from the various sect roles, those designated as imam carry an honorary title and utmost status within the Muslim community. At times they may include those specially trained to lead prayers in the mosque, making them well known among mosque members. Their cooperation will thus prove invaluable for access to the Asia Pacific Muslim populations otherwise not amenable to Western traditions rooted in Christian norms (Khuri, 1990).</p>

<title>Implications of spirituality for social work intervention</title>
<p>The implications of spirituality for social work intervention with Asia Pacific Muslim populations include the need for Western social work practitioners to acknowledge and, when appropriate, apply values, belief systems, and other Islamic specific spiritual criteria. Such spiritual criteria will provide the social work practitioner with alternatives to bring about the desired change or coping mechanisms. Specific issues for Asia Pacific Muslims who migrate West include language, culture, and nation of origin. In the aftermath of New York City’s terrorism, Asia Pacific Muslims were tainted by their associations with middle-eastern ethnics who, except for Islamic spirituality, have little in common. Furthermore, among Asia Pacific Muslims exists differentiation relative to the history of their Western migration. While Indonesians have limited experience, Filipinos have migrated West actively since the Spanish–American War. Evidence of these migration trends exists in the Western Filipino communities and their longevity there (Vachon and Toews, 2008). It is not compulsory that Western social workers endorse client belief systems or other aspects of client spirituality. However, Western social workers must at least be willing to acknowledge that Islamic spiritual criteria may serve as a critical point in the client’s existential orientation.</p>
<p>Western social workers who serve Asia Pacific Muslim populations would be acutely advised to cultivate working relationships with Islamic clergy (i.e. imams). These relationships might prove useful in the clarification of norms, the facilitation of referrals, and the effective application of treatment strategies. Such relationships are mutually beneficial to the extent that both clients and service provider are enabled by the information exchanged. While some Asia Pacific Muslim individuals may prefer assistance from Islamic personnel, others may be uncomfortable or self-conscious about expressing family concerns to Islamic members of a tight-knit community. Under such circumstances, the availability of Western social work practitioners might prove invaluable. What is more, the availability of social workers will be particularly helpful if, in fact, the spiritual system (i.e. Islam) is the focus of the client’s presenting concern. The spiritually informed but non-sectarian Western social worker will allow the client to explore alternatives within the context of a spiritually neutral practice environment. Thus, the social worker is able to engage in a shared relationship without perceived bias while simultaneously allowing for a mutual cultural exchange between the client and practitioner. This exchange leads to a healthy understanding of desired treatment outcomes and derived goals that will assist the Western social work practitioner to develop effective treatment interventions unique to the needs of the Asia Pacific Muslim client, consistent with their belief system.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the professional, there are several reasons why Western social work practitioners might consider Islamic spirituality as resource for practice with Asia Pacific Muslim populations. First, the effects of spiritual resources are well known and are likely to enable practice with clients where relevant (De la Rosa, 1988). Second, the term ‘spiritual’ for most social workers in Western settings conjures up images of legal conflicts with the potential to charge emotions; when it is associated with a stereotype it encourages knee-jerk condemnation of an entire group of people, their social structure, lifestyle, and other aspects of their being (Bar-Tal and Labin, 2001). The outcome will impair the ability of Asia Pacific Muslim populations who migrate to Western countries to sustain themselves unless more culturally competent social work factions prevail. Third, in Western countries the spiritual must be viewed separate and apart from the legal process. To do otherwise will cause bias within social work practice involving Asia Pacific Muslim populations, rendering social work less potent in its ability to accommodate practice with clients.</p>
<p>Beyond legal conflicts, the most efficient means of enabling practice with Asia Pacific Muslim populations is for Western social workers to become more educated about Islamic spirituality. Education pertaining to Islamic spirituality will enable practice (Al-Krenawi and Graham, 2000). Social workers so enabled will be in a better position to learn and assist Asia Pacific Muslim populations who migrate to Western countries in sustaining themselves. Furthermore, social workers who help reinforce respect for Asia Pacific Muslim populations build the self-esteem of their younger family members, which will assist the group’s ability to survive in what is often perceived as an alien cultural environment. Equally important is the impact of education upon the society at-large. One approach to this method for Western social workers is to create a tolerant atmosphere by the building of bridges to Asia Pacific Muslim communities beyond what is professionally necessary. The focus on such communities should be their Asian language, history, cultures, etc. rather than the terrorist acts associated with any one of its spiritual cohort(s). Community action groups and youth projects, which familiarize the otherwise unfamiliar, have the potential to validate social work as a helping profession among Asia Pacific Muslim populations who might otherwise not seek social work services from Western practitioners (Edmond, 1990).</p>
<p>Ultimately, to enable practice Western social workers assigned to Asia Pacific Muslim populations must be willing to utilize alternative treatment models beyond the traditional Western methods. Actualizing such utilization includes the willingness of Western social work practitioners to apply Islamic spiritual resources to practice with Asia Pacific Muslim populations (Hodge and Nadir, 2008). What’s more, consultations with Islamic imams have the potential to enhance the therapeutic process and bring about the desired practice outcomes. This will usher in a new approach to social work practice in that presenting problems will no longer dictate selected traditional methods applied. Instead traditional methods will exist among a sundry of methods selected on the basis of what is most applicable and/or appropriate to bring about the desired client outcome.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As previously indicated, Islam is one of the fastest growing religions in the world, and given the influence of globalization and migration it is imperative that Western social work practitioners be informed and adequately trained to negotiate differences among ethnic minority individuals and families. The purpose of this article was to provide an understanding of the cultural and religious uniqueness of Asia Pacific Muslim populations. Additionally it is intended to provide Western social work practitioners with an understanding of how Islam as spiritual resource impacts the lives of its followers, in particular Asia Pacific Muslim populations.</p>
<p>Due to the potential for harm and legal repercussions in the West brought by the application of spiritual resources in practice, it is critical that Western social workers exercise caution when incorporating Islam into practice. Some aspects of spiritual resources might appear abnormal and indeed dysfunctional from a secular Western perspective. For example, among certain Christian sects is the phenomenon of ‘speaking in tongues’, where church-goers slip into a trance-like state and begin to verbalize in an unfamiliar language (Gilbert, 2000). In the not too distant past, such persons may have been diagnosed as psychotic and prescribed psychotropic medication. In fact, among said Christian sects, ‘speaking in tongues’ is not regarded as psychotic or abnormal. Indeed, it is perceived by them as a gift from God. Among Muslims, practice of polygamy and the ‘salaat’ or five daily prayers could be seen as peculiar or abnormal to members of Western Christian cultures. Thus, for legal as well as practice purposes Western social work practitioners must resist the inclination to label spiritual resources simply because they are unfamiliar and/or foreign to secular perspectives. This necessitates worth in the much-heralded Western emphasis upon diversity. Social workers who fail to value diversity not only impair client progress, but they may also alienate spiritual resources in the community, such as imams who could prove invaluable to practice with Asia Pacific Muslim clients.</p>
<p>Lastly, of the Asia Pacific countries where significant Muslim populations reside, those who migrate more often settle in the US, Europe, and elsewhere in the West. The ability of Western social work practitioners to accurately perceive, conceptualize, and interact with Asia Pacific Muslim populations is a necessity in a rapidly changing and complex world. In order to enhance harmony and reduce the threats of chaos, Western social workers must acknowledge that all groups have assets, capacities, and strengths that should be reinforced despite the heinous acts committed by a relative few (Sontag, 2001). Since many of these assets, such as cultural technologies, are derived from cultural legacies, Western social work practitioners must increase their knowledge base considerably and consistently. Otherwise, their lack of education could contribute to the extinction of content, which might prove antidotal to some Western social pathology. Furthermore, at a time of increased contacts between the world’s various populations, Western social workers are confronted by issues and perspectives that did not require intellectual consideration in the past (Shatz, 2001). They are thus challenged to develop treatment strategies less confined to Western and/or traditional norms. Additionally, Western journal editors, book publishers, and other affiliates of the ‘fact’ manufacture industry must be actively receptive to the consideration of alternative views. That consideration must remain constant and viable without interruption from unpredictable events to sustain the integrity and prestige of the social work profession worldwide and at-large.</p>
