<title>Results:</title>
<p>All patients in this study were treated in an acute hospital, described as a bewildering and pressured environment of care. Initial perceptions of palliative care were varied, some interpreting referral as an indication that they were approaching the end of life. However, after palliative care input, patients and carers developed an understanding of their role which they saw as three-fold: physical symptom control, psychological support and a reliable liaison. The theme of cross-cutting interviews was that the palliative care team made time for patients, giving them a sense of value and worth. Feeling their care was a priority and being listened to made palliative care input effective.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The first modern hospice, St Christopher’s, opened in 1967 to address the neglect of dying patients in general hospitals. However, excellent terminal care also needed to be offered to the great majority of dying patients who were (and are) treated in acute hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311425097">1</xref></sup> Hence, hospital palliative care teams have been set up since the medical specialty of palliative care was recognized in 1988 to disseminate hospice ‘best practice’ in all healthcare settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311425097">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311425097"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311425097"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311425097">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>As specialist palliative care services (SPCSs) have expanded, so has research evaluating the impact of these specialist palliative care teams, focusing mainly on patient outcomes. A systematic review by Higginson et al. identified nine studies which specifically evaluated outcomes of a hospital-based palliative care team and a further four studies which included a component of a hospital team although the total intervention was broader.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311425097">6</xref></sup> All studies showed a small positive effect of hospital teams, except for one study in Sweden which documented deterioration in quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311425097">7</xref></sup> However, this was not compared to the rate of deterioration in a control group of dying patients.</p>
<p>Corner et al. explored nursing outcomes for patients with advanced cancer following intervention by Macmillan specialist palliative care nurses across 12 services in the UK using both quantitative and qualitative methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311425097">8</xref></sup> Positive outcomes of care that were directly attributed to the care provided by Macmillan specialist palliative care nurses were found for the majority of patients. Furthermore, the authors felt that quantitative data from quality-of-life measures seemed to reflect inadequately the complex circumstances of patients and families, while qualitative data analysis provided valuable insights into care outcomes. Indeed, qualitative methodology allows greater scope for patients to relay their actual experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311425097">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311425097"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311425097">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>SPCSs have evolved since the above studies were conducted, with increasing involvement of hospital teams in symptom control,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311425097">12</xref></sup> psychological support and discharge planning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311425097">13</xref></sup> for patients who have a life-limiting illness but are not in the terminal phase, through outpatient clinics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311425097">14</xref></sup> as well as referrals for inpatient consultations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311425097">12</xref></sup> This expanding aspect of SPCS input has not been explored specifically in the literature, and this study aims to fill the research gap by exploring patient and carer perspectives of the role of SPCSs in the acute hospital setting, particularly where patients are not imminently dying.</p>
<p>This qualitative study involved patients and carers who were seen as inpatients in an acute hospital by the multidisciplinary hospital palliative care team, and then discharged back to the care of the generalist hospital team. The findings reported here form part of an initial qualitative evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of SPCSs. A responsive approach to evaluation was taken, obtaining perspectives of patients, carers, referrers, and providers of the service with a view to inform developments in the service. The views of referrers and providers have been published elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311425097">15</xref></sup> and the perspectives of patients and carers are presented here.</p>

<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study took place in a large acute hospital trust in England; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311425097">Table 1</xref> for further details of the study setting. The hospital is a specialist cancer centre with a multidisciplinary SPCS established in 1998. There is no palliative care unit within the hospital, and palliative care patients may be admitted to any ward. The SPCS operates an open referrals policy, enabling patients to be referred to the service by health professionals in the hospital, by family members or patients themselves. There is 24-hour access to advice from a consultant in an emergency, and patients are seen on the day of referral where requested.</p>

<title>Patient and carer sample</title>
<p>Patients recruited to the study were adults who had received inpatient care from the SPCS for symptom control or psychological support and were discharged from the SPCS, either to general ward care or to home. A review of referrals for the year prior to data collection showed that the median number of SPCS contacts was three. Therefore in order for an interview about input to be meaningful, we included only those who had received a minimum of three contacts with the Service and were able to participate in a study interview. Consecutive patients who met the study entry criteria were approached to take part until the sample was achieved.</p>
<p>Potential participants were identified by members of the SPCS who gave them a study information pack when they were discharged from the Service. The pack consisted of a letter from the Service Director inviting them to take part in the study, an information leaflet and a reply form with return envelope. Completed reply forms were returned to Ward Clerks who faxed them to the project researcher. This form was simply an expression of interest in hearing more about the study to permit the project researcher to make contact with potential participants. All patients interested in participating were visited on the wards by the project researcher to explain the study in further detail and to obtain written consent prior to interview. If the patient agreed to take part, the family member/friend they designated as their carer was also approached to take part.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269216311425097">Figure 1</xref> shows the recruitment flow diagram. There were 265 discharges from SPCS during the recruitment period, out of which 55 were eligible for the study. A total of 27 patients were invited to take part in the study; three patients declined and another 11 did not reply before they were discharged from hospital and were lost to the study as we did not have permission for follow-up. One of the patients who agreed to take part left the hospital before the agreement form was faxed to the project researcher and so was not interviewed. Twelve patients took part in the study (seven female, five male). They ranged in age from 37 to 72, median age 58.5 years. Eleven of the patients had a cancer diagnosis. A total of 101 visits were made; median number of visits was seven, median total period of visiting 340 minutes. The majority of patients had input for both symptom control and support (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311425097">Table 2</xref> for further details). All patients had a family member or friend as a carer but only 10 carers were interviewed. Of the other two carers, one declined to take part. It was anticipated that an interview with the other carer would take place, but we were unable to proceed with it due to deterioration in the condition of the patient and a change in plan of care.</p>

<title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>Patients and carers took part in separate, short, semi-structured interviews on one occasion only covering three broad areas: how the patient/carer came to be referred to the SPCS and their previous contacts with palliative care services; their views of using the service; and its impact on the patient/carer, particularly in relation to symptom control and psychological problems. Interviews were conducted by the project researcher (GE).</p>
<p>The majority of interviews with patients and carers were done on the ward. One patient and one carer were interviewed at home as the patient was discharged home immediately following discharge from the care of the SPCS but he had provided details for contact at home on the study agreement form. Another carer was interviewed via telephone as this was her preference. Interviews lasted from 10–30 minutes and were audio tape-recorded with the consent of participants. To provide a context to interview data, documents relating to the work of the SPCS were reviewed together with data on referral patterns, service input and activity. Field notes were made by the project researcher (GE) after the interview.</p>
<p>For each patient participant, demographic details, diagnosis and contacts from the SPCS were collated to permit description of the study sample. All interviews were fully transcribed, using a transcription service. Then the transcripts were checked and anonymized by the project researcher (GE). Interview files were entered into Atlas/ti, a software program which facilitates management and analysis of qualitative data. Data were analysed thematically using framework analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311425097">16</xref></sup> Initial reading of the data was done by two people (GE and SB). Both conducted a first-level analysis of issues emerging from the interviews. Then a thematic framework was devised by GE bringing together questions raised as interview topics with issues that were raised by study participants. This framework was applied to the data by GE to identify, label and determine the content of themes. This analysis was reviewed by SB to confirm coding and development of themes and to review any misinterpretations or omissions. To verify the analysis, the data were also read by GY who devised a thematic framework independently. GE and GY discussed and agreed on coding and interpretations of the data. This process allowed for inter-analyst clarification of themes, thus enhancing validity and reliability.</p>

<title>Hospital context</title>
<p>All the patients in this study were treated in an acute hospital. When they first met the SPCS, they were going through investigation of symptoms, receiving a cancer diagnosis or confirmation of spread of disease and prognosis.</p>
<p>On admission, patients described finding themselves in a pressured environment of care where ‘<italic>everything is moving at the speed of light</italic>’ (ID 106). They commented on the many different doctors and nurses seen, fleeting nature of contacts with ward staff and ‘<italic>fragmented</italic>’ care (ID 111). In this busy setting, patients and their family carers were vulnerable – patient ID 102 said she was ‘<italic>up to her eyes in doubts and fear and questions</italic>’. Carer ID 211 summed it up:<disp-quote>
<p>when you come in to the hospital system with somebody who’s very unwell, you don’t know where you’re going, you don’t know who you’re asking for, you don’t know what you’re doing… It’s also very bewildering and at the same time you’re worrying about your family member.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was in this bewildering context that patients were referred to the SPCS team. Perceptions of SPCS were varied, with some interpreting the referral as an indication that they were ‘<italic>on their way out</italic>’ (ID 102). A patient said ‘<italic>If they send somebody like this to me…, that’s it, I haven’t got a chance… I thought it was… a one-way road</italic>’ (ID 107). Prior to their referral most were not aware of who the SPCS were and what services they offered in the hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0269216311425097">
<title>Role of the SPCS team</title>
<p>After input from SPCS however, most patients and carers developed a better understanding of the role of the SPCS team, which they saw as three-fold: physical symptom control, psychological support and a reliable liaison.</p>
<sec id="section16-0269216311425097">
<title>Physical symptom control</title>
<p>Physical symptom control was mainly around pain, but also other symptoms such as nausea and constipation. The SPCS was identified as part of the process of managing symptoms through their focus on assessment and suggestions of medications to control symptoms. Patient ID 110 said <italic>‘[a member of SPCS] came to see me and said she was interested in making sure my pain control was being correctly administered and dealt with’.</italic> What was particularly valued was explanation of how medications worked so as to improve their effectiveness. One carer said,<disp-quote>
<p>… they explained what the patch was about. What was in the patch. (Interviewer: Right. And you weren’t sure of that before?) Carer: We weren’t certain of that at all. And it is, I suppose, difficult sometimes to be able to ask a doctor all the questions, because they’re so busy. (ID 201)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Patients’ physical symptoms had improved and they had a sense of different health professionals, including the SPCS, working together on symptom control.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well they’re trying to work as a team and she said… She suggested I had different tablets… which they all talk together as a team, which I think is a… You’ve got an outsider, it’s not just one lots is it? You’ve got people getting more involved which helps. (ID 101)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, they were less clear about who should take credit for the improvement. Patients who were very engaged with their own symptom management were more aware of the input of the SPCS. One patient explained,<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, so [member of SPCS] made a fairly quick impact in terms of sorting out the new scenario, if you like. Also recommended a different dose of the Fentanyl lozenge which seemed to be more in keeping with the size of the dose of the patch that I’m wearing. So that particular meeting seemed to make a fairly swift impact. (ID 110)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some patients had been so unwell initially that they didn’t really remember who was involved. Others were just glad to have the improvement – Carer ID 211 said <italic>‘It is unclear to me who… who contributed what but I mean, as far as I’m concerned that doesn’t matter. As long as you know, people were contributing and things were happening’.</italic> Family members were often at a distance, both physically and in the sense of not being fully aware of what care the patient was having and who was providing it. Thus most of the carers were much less aware of the whole process of symptom management.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Carer: She hasn’t said much at all because most of the time she’s been either so sort of sleepy or with the morphine and the treatment and everything she doesn’t say much at all. So the answer would be no, I haven’t had much input from her.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Have you had any input yourselves actually from the team? Have they talked to you?</p>
<p>Carer: No. No… I haven’t required it and… I mean if I’m not here then they don’t know I exist in a way. (ID 208)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0269216311425097">
<title>Psychological support</title>
<p>Patients and some carers also received psychological support from the SPCS team. There was an appreciation of basic courtesies like introductions and being treated as an individual whilst in the unfamiliar hospital environment. Patient ID 105 said, <italic>‘It made you feel that you were an individual as well as just a patient. You know, that you were important… that they did… care. I think it makes a lot of different at that time to have that’.</italic> In terms of support, they benefited from ‘<italic>talking with someone who understood</italic> totally <italic>[participant emphasis] really what you were going through and had experience of other people who had been through the same thing’</italic>. (ID 106). This participant described the SPCS team as ‘<italic>someone to lean on</italic>’ and ‘<italic>one steady rock</italic>’.</p>
<p>The approach taken by the SPCS was an inclusive one, achieved mainly through exploring the situation together. Having the opportunity to express feelings and worries, ask questions and be listened to were seen as helpful. For example, Carer ID 203 said, ‘<italic>But after I’ve seen them I felt relaxed and erm… more confident. Yes. Yes. We talked about the situation… about my feelings… about our children… about my job’</italic>. Patient ID 106 said ‘<italic>I know that I can ask any question no matter how daft it sounds. You know, she always takes it seriously’</italic>. One carer in particular appreciated the SPCS team caring about her as well, and not just the patient, which in turn helped the patient ‘<italic>tremendously because he knew that [the carer] was being supported</italic>’ (ID 202). In some instances, there was more specific psychological support for patients and families, for example when young children were involved or with families whose social circumstances were complicated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0269216311425097">
<title>Reliable liaison</title>
<p>The SPCS team was also a reliable liaison for patients, through acting as a ‘<italic>point of contact</italic>’ (ID 106), enabling ‘<italic>communication and consultation</italic>’ between teams (ID 103), and being a source of information.</p>
<p>Giving examples of how the SPCS team acted as a liaison, one patient said: ‘<italic>she also discussed with me what the doctors were intending to do. And just when I had some pains, she would arrange with the doctors that I be given some painkillers’</italic> (ID 109). They were reliable, as another patient described: ‘<italic>She gained my trust immediately… because of the way she said, “I’ll do that”, and she did it</italic>’ (ID 106).</p>
<p>The SPCS team was seen to liaise between teams, and a patient had ‘<italic>the impression that the co-operation was improved when the palliative care team joined in</italic>’ (ID103). The team was also a reliable source of information about a variety of things from chapel services to local accommodation for carers and arrangements for wig fittings.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section19-0269216311425097">
<title>Effectiveness of SPCS team – giving a sense of time and worth</title>
<p>The theme that cross-cut interviews was that the SPCS team ‘<italic>made the time</italic>’ (ID 111) for patients and this made their input effective. This was the case regardless of whether patients had input for physical symptoms or psychological support.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I think in any… in any walk of life, one of the most important things you can do with anybody is spend some time and talk to them. Whatever… whatever job you do or whatever, you know, just giving somebody some time is something we don’t do very well. But it’s a terribly powerful sort of tool (ID 111).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>They gave patients a sense that their care was a priority, that the team was interested in them. Carer ID 203 said, ‘<italic>I have seen that she comes here exactly to speak with him, and with me. It’s the difference. Yes. It’s very important. To feel that somebody comes to see you, to talk to you</italic>’.</p>
<p>Prior to input from the SPCS team, patients and carers were fearful, confused and alone in a busy and fragmented hospital. Outcomes which were clearly attributed to the SPCS team included patients and carers feeling ‘<italic>at ease</italic>’ (ID 104), ‘<italic>more confident</italic>’ (ID 102, ID 203), ‘<italic>comforted</italic>’ (ID 202) and ‘<italic>reassured</italic>’ (ID 105, ID 201).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hospitals play an important role in end-of-life care and the importance of research into hospital-based palliative care teams has been recognized internationally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311425097">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311425097"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311425097"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311425097">20</xref></sup> This study shows that from the perspective of patients and carers, the role of SPCSs in hospital was three-fold – physical symptom control, psychological support and acting as a reliable liaison. Furthermore, the greatest benefit derived from SPCS input was a non-specific improved sense of wellbeing. A similar study in the outpatient setting by Cawley et al. also showed that while patients found attending palliative medicine outpatient clinics valuable, they found it hard to articulate what the perceived value or impact of these consultations was.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311425097">21</xref></sup> Benefit derived could only be described in general terms, and participants were unable to specify how palliative care input helped them. However the notion of ‘peace of mind’ was something that strongly resonated with patients and the improvement following a palliative medicine consultation was mental rather than physical.</p>
<p>Similar results have been obtained from other qualitative studies exploring the role of palliative care nurses from the perspective of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311425097">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311425097"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311425097"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311425097">14</xref></sup> Conner et al. also found that patients felt ‘lost’, ‘distressed’ and ‘confused’ in hospital before they met the palliative care nurse, but felt ‘known’ and ‘cared for’ after input from palliative care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311425097">13</xref></sup> They described the role of the nurse as ‘orchestrating’ and felt the palliative care nurse was one person they trusted to represent them and interpret for them.</p>

<sec id="section21-0269216311425097">
<title>Strengths and weaknesses</title>
<p>The findings presented here complement those from our other paper which described the views of referrers and specialist providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311425097">15</xref></sup> From the perspective of patients and carers, the SPCS was a personal resource which improved their sense of wellbeing. From the perspective of healthcare professionals, the SPCS was an accessible resource for referrers to receive help with problems that they found difficult to manage. These perspectives help us to understand the different ways in which a specialist service contributes to the care of patients in an acute hospital setting.</p>
<p>Patients and carers were not clear about who was responsible for the improvement in physical symptoms, probably because of the multidisciplinary way of working in an acute hospital and their experience of hospital as a busy and confusing environment. On the other hand, from the perspective of healthcare professionals, both referrers and palliative care providers agreed that the role of the SPCS was to ‘provide expertise in managing difficult symptoms and complex psychosocial problems’. Advice from the SPCS team is acted on by the referring team, and this process happens away from the patient, possibly explaining why patients and carers do not always associate this expert input with SPCSs. Moreover, patients and carers may be less interested in who addresses the symptoms as long as they are dealt with. Perkins et al. conducted focus group studies in palliative care patients to explore what their priorities were for research and found that patients gave great emphasis to communication issues and little to symptom control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311425097">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The perception of patients and carers was that the SPCS team made time for patients, giving them a sense of value and worth. The SPCS was also perceived by referrers to have ‘more time available’ than ward-based staff, and the lack of time was often the reason for being unable to provide sufficient input and referring on to the SPCS. From the perspective of the specialist provider, it is not only the amount of time that is given to patients, but also the way in which a ‘really thorough assessment’ is done, that makes SPCS input distinctive. Indeed, the perception of patients and carers was that the SPCS team not only gave them time, but also made them feel listened to.</p>
<p>Taken together, the findings here as well as those from our other paper highlight the importance of attending to the process of how a service is provided rather than just what is done. For referrers, in addition to having expertise in symptom control, being accessible was also important – visibility on wards, timeliness and being approachable were valuable. For patients and carers, it was the sense of feeling like their care was a priority and being listened to that made SPCS input effective.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this study was that participants included this study may not be representative of all patients and carers who receive palliative care input due to the small sample size, and the sample itself being self-selecting. Out of the 55 patients who were eligible for the study, only 27 were invited to take part. Of these, only 13 agreed to be interviewed. The reasons for declining and not replying are not known and non-participation of these patients and carers could have limited the range of information obtained.</p>
<p>It was hard to recruit people who had seen the SPCS team at least three times and then were discharged, particularly as interviews were conducted in hospital prior to being discharged home. The quality of data was limited by the ability of participants to recount an event that was already finished, and the perspective expressed by participants could be influenced by other factors such as gratitude bias that have not been taken into account.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311425097">23</xref></sup></p>

<title>Implications for clinical practice and future research</title>
<p>The three-fold role of SPCSs in physical symptom control, psychological support and acting as a reliable liaison identified by participants in this study can be used as a basis for continuing development of SPCS teams in acute hospitals. Consideration of the patient experience in a bewildering and busy hospital environment, as well as attention to giving patients a sense of time and worth should be a priority in palliative care as well as wider clinical practice.</p>
<p>Studies that focus on outcomes measures such as improvement in physical symptoms rather than process measures may not be able to reflect the full impact of palliative care input as the main effectiveness of SPCS teams may lie mainly in the intangible improvement in the state of mind of individual persons through interaction with the SPCS. Finding a way of adequately measuring the input of SPCSs will be challenging, given that the main benefit that patients and carers derive from SPCS involvement is difficult to articulate. Perhaps a process-orientated approach rather than an outcomes-focused one would be more appropriate for evaluating the effectiveness and value of SPCSs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>What is the role of specialist palliative care in an acute hospital? From the patients’ and carers’ perspectives, the role of SPCSs includes not only physical symptom control but also psychological support and acting as a reliable liaison. These specific ways that participants have identified as areas where the SPCS makes an impact can be used as a basis for continuing development and future evaluation of input by the SPCS team on patient care. Furthermore, the way patient care is provided is as important as what care is provided. A recent white paper published by the Department of Health in the UK stated that the domains of quality in healthcare will span not only effectiveness and safety of treatment and care provided to patients, but also the broader experience patients have of the treatment and care they receive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311425097">24</xref></sup> Our findings suggest that a sense of time and worth has a significant impact on the experience of patients and carers in an acute hospital setting.</p>
