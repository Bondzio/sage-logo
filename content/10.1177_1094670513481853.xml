<abstract>
<p>Information technology (IT)-related service is the strategic management of the creation and delivery of service in which information and communication technology (referred to as IT here) plays a substantial role. IT can serve as a facilitator (e.g., facilitates access to customer information and customer communication) or enabler (e.g., enables value cocreation), serves as the context (e.g., mobile phone market or e-commerce), or is itself service (e.g., social networking sites or information goods). There are three essential characteristics of IT-related service—it is information-intensive, customer-centric, and multidisciplinary. IT-related service is information-intensive. The ability to communicate (firm-to-customer, firm-to-firm, and customer-to-customer) anytime, anywhere, and to anyone, is significantly facilitated by the recent technology trends of big data, cloud computing, and mobile and networking platforms. IT-related service is customer-centric. The use of IT, both by firms and by customers, alleviates the common observation that there is a trade-off between customer satisfaction and productivity improvement for service. Customers are able to talk back to firms with their new communication power and firms are better able to cost-efficiently satisfy their customers. The study of IT-related service is thus inherently multidisciplinary involving such fields as marketing, strategic management, computer science/information systems, and operations management/organizational research. The results of the IT-service transformation are that IT blurs the distinction between goods and service; service is becoming more goods-like and goods are acquiring the characteristics of service. The <italic>Journal of Service Research</italic> special issue on IT-related service brings together all of these elements, and provides rich strategic implications for managers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Information technology (IT, which refers to information, communication, mobile, and networking technologies in this article) plays a critical role in the service economy. Much of the radical transformation of the world economy from an industrial to a postindustrial service society comes from the contribution of IT to service and from IT as service. Service is not new; it is service plus IT that transforms service. IT enables service, and its input and output, information, is central to strategic service decisions and service management.</p>
<p>We view IT-related service as the strategic management of the creation and delivery of service in which IT plays a substantial role. This view is broad; IT can play the role of a facilitator (e.g., facilitates access to customer information and customer communication) or enabler (e.g., enables value cocreation), serves as the context (e.g., mobile phone market or e-commerce), or is itself service (e.g., social networking sites or information goods).</p>
<p>We consider that there are three essential characteristics of IT-related service: (1) it is information intensive, (2) it is customer-centric, and (3) it is inherently multidisciplinary.</p>
<p>As distinct from service in its traditional sense, IT-related service is information-intensive. The ability to communicate (firm-to-customer, firm-to-firm, and customer-to-customer) anytime, anywhere, and to anyone, is significantly facilitated by the advance of IT, such as big data, cloud computing, and mobile and networking technologies. In the digital age, customers’ online behaviors are recorded and tracked, which generates a massive amount of data in a variety of formats that firms can leverage and transform into useful information about customers for strategic marketing planning and service management. With the advances of IT, especially the recent trend in big data, information plays an even more important role in service than ever before.</p>
<p>IT-related service is customer-centric. The advance of IT alleviates the common observation that there is a trade-off between customer satisfaction and productivity improvement for service. Firms will be more able to cost-efficiently satisfy their customers than before since the advance of IT is a one-way trend.</p>
<p>The study of IT-related service is inherently multidisciplinary. The advance in IT has significantly strengthened the service revolution by allowing marketers to store big customer data, analyze distributed customer information remotely, and communicate with customers more ubiquitously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670513481853">Rust and Huang 2011</xref>). The result is that the study of service is inherently multidisciplinary and involves such fields as computer science/information systems and operations management/organizational research.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670513481853">Figure 1</xref> shows our multidisciplinary perspective on the information intensive, customer-centric IT-related service.</p>

<sec id="section2-1094670513481853">
<title>The Framework</title>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670513481853">Figure 1</xref>, we can see that the ability to communicate (firm-to-customer, firm-to-firm, and customer-to-customer) anytime, anywhere, and to anyone, is facilitated by information and communication technology. These digitalized customer footprints are captured by the firm and stored in customer databases, often known these days as “big data” due to the variety in data formats and the sheer amount of data. Because of the size of the data management task, information systems and computer science disciplines are playing an increasingly important role in managing customer data. The data are then processed and analyzed with sophisticated computationally intensive customer analytics and are transformed into useful customer information for strategic marketing and service decisions. These service strategies can be classified into two broad categories: service transformation (services acquire the characteristics of goods) and service renovation (service becomes even more service-like). The customers then respond to these decisions and actions, to the firm directly (e.g., buying more), to competitors (e.g., switching to competitors), and/or to other customers (e.g., word of mouth and referrals). Both customers and firms act and react based on the newly available customer information to reduce uncertainty, and many disciplines meet in this service arena.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1094670513481853">
<title>The Service Information Transformation</title>
<p>IT is transforming service with its information power. Specifically, we observe that IT is shaping service in two opposite directions. In one extreme, IT transforms service by making it more tangible (e.g., digital hybrids and integrated solutions), separable (e.g., e-services), homogeneous (e.g., automation), and storable (e.g., cloud computing). In the other extreme, IT renovates service, enabling firms to capitalize on the characteristics of service. Manufacturing sectors can be servitized (enhanced intangibility), firms can engage customers deeper in production through coproduction and participation (enhanced inseparability), products exploiting rich information from customers can be customized to fit individual customers’ needs (enhanced variability), and time, not just price, can become an important consideration for both firms and customers (enhanced perishability).</p>
<p>The service information transformation further blurs the supposed distinctions between goods and service and implies that every business (or product) is inherently service (see the middle part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670513481853">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1094670513481853">
<title>IT Transforms Service</title>
<sec id="section5-1094670513481853">
<title>More Tangible</title>
<p>IT has blurred the line between goods and service. Both carry each other’s characteristics and, together, they constitute digital hybrids or integrated solutions that firms must offer to maximize customer value. The key is solutions to customer problems, regardless of whether they are goods or service. For example, Dell Computers configures tangible with intangible by incorporating intangible customization attributes, like after-sale and customization services, into the tangible attributes of computers. Amazon.com configures intangible with tangible by pooling together a variety of intangible online services and tangible goods. Google tested market the high-broadband network market by introducing Google Fiber, which is a big cloud push for the home (and business) network that transforms user experience with Google by making itself become more tangible to customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670513481853">Bieler 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1094670513481853">
<title>More Separable</title>
<p>Inseparability looks at the space dimension of service where firms and customers need to be copresent. E-service provides the best example where service providers are not required to copresent with customers. E-service is the provision of service over electronic networks such as the Internet. In the context of e-service, services are separable and portable, which provides great convenience benefit to consumers. Voice mail makes telecommunications separable in time. Digital downloads allow customers to access services remotely. Offshore programming and call centers belie the notion that services lack portability. The most prominent example nowadays is cloud computing, which allows customers to store and analyze big customer data remotely, without the need to be copresent with service providers. Using the term remote service, the article by Paluch and Blut in this special issue looks into the paradox of service separation and customer satisfaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1094670513481853">
<title>More Standardized</title>
<p>Automation commoditizes services. This trend relaxes the heterogeneity assumption and allows services to be identical. This was an early use of IT in service, in which IT is primarily used to automate manual systems and to standardize routine and tactical activities to improve efficiency. For example, telephone service is now created in heavily capitalized facilities much like factories and is not easily called heterogeneous. So far too many companies have focused exclusively on the use of the Internet to increase efficiency and reduce costs. However, the true potential of the Internet lies in using the technology to improve service to customers and drive revenues. The use of self-service technology (SST) typifies the standardized delivery of service. The article by Wang, Harris, and Patterson in this issue addresses the continued use of SST over time when habit has been formed using SST.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1094670513481853">
<title>Less Perishable</title>
<p>Perishability involves the time dimension of service, where services can be kept in storage from consumers’ perspective. Services are not perishable when consumers can buy services in advance for later use. The latest IT development in cloud computing provides an illustration for this service information trend. Cloud computing allows consumers to consume computing and store resources as a service. Consumers share perishable and intangible computing power over the Internet and remote servers are not particularly perishable because they are not unnecessarily left idle. Consumers do not have to engineer for peak load limits. Google’s Gmail is an example of making service imperishable, in which services are provided in the form of storage capability on an annual basis. Thus, e-mail services are no longer perishable and can be accessed and used any time at the consumer’s convenience.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1094670513481853">
<title>IT Renovates Service</title>
<p>This service information transformation path is one in which IT augments service characteristics and makes goods or service become even more intangible, inseparable, customized, and perishable. Among the four characteristics, a higher degree of customization receives most research attention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670513481853">Rust and Huang 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section10-1094670513481853">
<title>Less Tangible</title>
<p>This trend can be characterized as servitization, which is the practice that manufacturers connect physical goods to services such as replenishment, maintenance, spare parts provision, or financing to take the advantages of intangible characteristic of service. Servitization turns physical goods into intangible services that increase the value of the physical goods or make the value more difficult to assess. For example, the car business can now be considered as a service business in which service is an essential part of the car. The business reality is that goods are commodities and it is service that sells the product. More and more businesses enter what is variously called the hosted, on-demand, or software as a service market where software is transacted in the market as a service. In many scenarios in the goods sector and in retailing, service is complementary to the provision of a physical product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094670513481853">Ulaga and Reinartz 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1094670513481853">
<title>Less Separable</title>
<p>The trend and research stream on coproduction takes advantage of service inseparability to enhance the interaction and relationship with customers. Nobody understands customers’ demands better than themselves. The practice is to enhance the degree of inseparability so that a deeper relationship between firms and customers can be established through coproduction or collaboration. Inseparability can also take the form of deepened customer relationship management. With service being driven by repeated interactions with customers, and company actions being informed by big customer data, their relationship is deepened.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1094670513481853">
<title>More Personalized</title>
<p>This enhanced characteristic mainly stems from the information benefit of IT, not just automation, when IT enables two-way information flow and customer communication. As individualized customer information becomes more available over time, a company’s relationship with customers becomes more personalized, deeper, and longer. In early days, IT mainly automated business processes for efficiency, but now IT is also used to customize for effectiveness. The research stream of personalization leverages the heterogeneity of service to fit individual customers’ needs. Big customer data and customer analytics enable personalized customer relationship and thus personalized service. Hence, IT fundamentally transforms service. For manufacturing, quality means standardizing, whereas for service, quality means customizing.</p>
<p>The availability of big data and business analytics on the cloud makes personalization possible and easier. Companies can collect more accurate and detailed customer information at the individual level and use the information for very narrow and specific segmentation of customers that therefore enables mass customization of services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1094670513481853">
<title>More Perishable</title>
<p>Unlike the other three characteristics, perishability is primarily a concern for service providers, not customers. Marketers often enhance the perceived perishability of their products in order to increase the time value of their services, such as limited time offers.</p>
<p>Hoffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1094670513481853">2003</xref>) argues that marketing + management information systems (MIS) = e-service. He argues that as marketing and MIS meet on the field of e-commerce, new business models have been developed that do not specifically cleave to either discipline. It appears that e-services are just such a case. E-services are services, in the sense they fall within the traditional service descriptors of deeds, efforts, and/or performances. However, e-services are also very “good-like,” in the sense they are deliverable, have channels, and are far less intangible, inseparable, heterogeneous, and perishable than other types of services. This article explores the marketing implications of the e-service revolution.</p>

<sec id="section14-1094670513481853">
<title>IT-Related Service Is Information-Intensive</title>
<p>The aforementioned service information transformation constitutes potential IT-related service strategies that a firm can leverage. The common ground underlying these strategies is information.</p>
<p>There are two meanings when we say that IT-related service is information-intensive.</p>
<p>
<italic>First</italic>, information is obtained and used for making strategic service decisions. Information plays the role of monitoring the service environment for firms and customers, so that firms can provide service to customers that better fits customer needs while still being profitable. For firms, information constitutes the basis for formulating service strategies (e.g., the potential service strategies outlined previously).</p>
<p>IT and its output information enable environmental scanning such that firms can better store and analyze customer information and communicate with the customer better. The results of environmental scanning are more informed service strategies and service management. For example, firms can make informed decisions regarding whether and when to introduce personalized services to the market that will maximize their profits over time.</p>
<p>The recent IT advances in big data, cloud computing, and mobile technology have made it easier for a firm to scan its immediate environment. The environmental information collected can be about internal and external customers, and include both current and potential customers. This view to environmental information highlights our customer-centric thinking: It is (current and potential) customers’ actions and reactions to service strategies (not competitors’ actions and reactions) that are our focus. The key to successful environmental scanning is to acquire <italic>relevant</italic> information about customers in a <italic>timely</italic> manner. Such environmental scanning can be informal or formal, reactive or proactive.</p>
<p>Both firms and customers can use environmental information to reduce uncertainty and make informed decisions. Firms use customer information to make production choices, and customers acquire service information to make consumption choices. The precise choices available to firms and customers depend on the choices made by them on the basis of information. In the service economy, the marketplace is a network-based location where information and service can be exchanged anywhere anytime. The ability to access and share information can improve efficiency (the ratio of output to cost) and effectiveness (the quality of service).</p>
<p>
<italic>Second</italic>, information is consumed by customers as service. IT-related service itself is information-intensive. From a firm’s perspective, IT-related service can refer to an integrated solution that provides both technology and service as a holistic solution to resolve issues related to business decisions, processes, and strategies. The emphasis is on IT-enabled value creation, exchange, and realization. It can include (1) the digitization of processes, goods, and services; (2) the incorporation of networked infrastructure integrating digital networks, the Internet, and mobile technologies; and (3) the transformation and innovation of value chains due to sharing business information, maintaining business relationships, and conducting business transactions over electronic systems.</p>
<p>From a customer’s perspective, this is the case of “information for consumption.” It is similar to the “information goods” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094670513481853">Shapiro and Varian 1998</xref>) or “digital products or goods” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1094670513481853">Ba, Whinston, and Zhang 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670513481853">Haltiwanger and Jasmin 2000</xref>) that are used to describe information-based offerings (goods and services). The typical examples of information goods include a CD containing pieces of music, a DVD containing a movie, or a computer file that is a piece of program. New services can be developed with the use of customer information that enhances the firm-customer connection as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1094670513481853">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Below we briefly discuss the current IT trends for connecting with customers via information.</p>
<sec id="section15-1094670513481853">
<title>Ubiquitous Customer Communication</title>
<p>Through mobile technology, the ability for a company to communicate to its customers and to learn from customer communication (customer-to-company and customer-to-customer) has reached an unprecedented level. Customer communications, interactions, and transactions over their mobile devices provide the company with rich, real-time data on not just customer purchasing, but also customer clickstreams and online behavior. Customer-to-customer communications online and on their mobile devices also provide the company with useful information about individual customers. This ubiquitous customer communication results in big customer data that are of great value for environmental scanning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1094670513481853">
<title>Big Customer Data</title>
<p>Big data consolidate many types of data resources with different structures and data models in a massive, distributed storage system. Multiple data sources contribute to the size, variability, and complexity of big data. Examples include weblogs, radio frequency identification, sensor networks, social networks, social data, Internet text and documents, Internet search indexing, call detail records, and large-scale e-commerce. Big data have dramatically transformed a company’s capabilities to store and analyze customer information. Walmart handles more than 1 million customer transactions every hour, and Facebook handles 50 billion photos from its user base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094670513481853">Facebook 2010</xref>). Internet clickstream data that provide information about the sequence of pages or the path viewed by users as they navigate a website become available and possible for customer analysis due to the increased data-storage capacity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1094670513481853">
<title>Customer Analytics</title>
<p>Customer analytics are the techniques of analyzing big customer data, exploratory and confirmatory, that help firms to extract customer information and knowledge for building profitable customer relationship. Big data require new scalable analytics to analyze structured and unstructured data to uncover hidden patterns and correlations that help companies to extract customer insights. However, the existing big data analytics developed by computer science/information systems researchers are exploratory in nature, which is suitable for finding unknown patterns in the data. They are less theory-driven. In service research, we need both data-driven and theory-driven customer analytics that allow us to figure out from big data why customers make the decisions they make and why they behave in a certain way by incorporating our existing theories.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1094670513481853">
<title>IT-Related Service Is Customer-Centric</title>
<p>A customer-centered perspective to service emphasizes the facilitating role of IT in providing service quality and maintaining customer relationships. The benefits of IT are to decrease costs and increase revenues by improving service. Thus, IT can shape service in two polarized directions (service transformation and renovation) that enable firms to satisfy customers while enhancing productivity, building a deeper relationship with customers, and eventually enjoying not just short-term profit, but also long-term customer equity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670513481853">Figure 1</xref> also shows clearly that it is information from customers, used by firms to meet customer needs, that make the production and delivery of IT-related service efficient while also ensuring the customer is satisfied, and from which customer relationships are deepened.</p>
<sec id="section19-1094670513481853">
<title>Productive While Satisfied</title>
<p>It has been traditionally portrayed that there is a satisfaction-productivity trade-off of service. Standardization (or commoditization) enabled by automation leads to productivity, whereas customization (or personalization) enabled by IT advancement over time leads to satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1094670513481853">Rust and Huang 2012</xref>). The current business moral is that we cannot do both well at the same time, so firms need to more or less pick one end to focus on a productivity-focused strategy or a customer satisfaction-focused strategy.</p>
<p>Though the benefits of IT can be both—decrease costs and/or increase revenues by improving service, so far firms are paying attention mostly to the cost side. With sufficient technology advancement, we can foresee that this satisfaction-productivity trade-off will be less a trade-off that firms face; instead, the consideration can be shifted to how to leverage IT to make service improvement financially accountable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670513481853">Hammer and Mangurian (1987</xref>) identify three distinct business values of IT as efficiency (increased productivity, either lowered costs for the existing level of transaction processing or avoided costs for increased volume processing), effectiveness (better management, e.g., IT can help ensure that availability of customer accounts information needed to support effective management decision making), and innovation (improved quality of goods and services, thereby improving the company’s competitive position). Automation links to the viewpoint that IT, since its development, has been seen primarily as a means to automate previously manual systems, and has been used extensively for routine and tactical activities to improve efficiency. Information, the next stage of development, provides increased effectiveness and moves the IT development processes to a higher level of benefit. The transformational stage defines a company with new business operations and practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1094670513481853">
<title>Deepened and Equal Customer Relationships</title>
<p>Another major transformation that IT has brought to service is that it realizes relationship marketing. In the past, relationship marketing was done in a personal-to-personal manner, was costly, and was small scale. IT enables large-scale relationship marketing. Now firms and customers can know a lot about each other through environmental scanning. From the firm’s perspective, communicating with mass customers while still keeping the communication personal is possible through mobile and networking technologies. Storing information and processing information make mass customization possible due to virtually unlimited computing capacity. The cost of personalization is significantly reduced and thus smaller or even individual segments become economically feasible. From the customer’s perspective, the relationship with firms is no longer unequal and imbalanced due to firms’ dominant information power. Customers now have the ability to talk back and actively choose the relationship they want to engage in, not just the type of relationship that is chosen by the firm. For example, search agents provide consumers with information power for making choice, whereas recommendation agents provide firms with information power for a better match (increasing the chance of being chosen).</p>

<title>IT-Related Service Is Multidisciplinary</title>
<p>The previous discussion implies that IT-related service is inherently multidisciplinary. We have witnessed the growing importance of computer science/information systems managers and researchers in handling big customer data and customer analytics. This has created conflict in managing customer relationships within a firm due to the worldview differences between functional executives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670513481853">Huang and Wang 2013</xref>). We can foresee that interdisciplinary competition is unavoidable and that interdisciplinary collaboration is mandated. Service researchers need to develop analytics skill in handling big customer data or to collaborate with information systems and/or operational researchers in order to keep up with the service revolution.</p>
<p>The most manifest demonstration of this multidisciplinary nature of IT-related service is the articles and authorship of this special issue. We have 12 high-quality articles from the United States, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Australia, and China, respectively, roughly representing authors from North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. The authors are from disciplines of marketing, information systems, computer science, human resource management, operations management, service research, and organizational research, and include both academics and practitioners.</p>
<p>Mainly from the discipline of computer science, the article of Haas, Kimbrough, and Dinther in this issue explores how service providers learn consumer preferences in complex service value networks by simulating multiagent systems. Marketing increasingly involves networks of relationships and feedback loops. Agent-based modeling, a computationally intensive method, is gaining popularity in modeling complex service systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094670513481853">Goldenberg, Libai, and Muller 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094670513481853">Rand and Rust 2011</xref>). Agent-based modeling has proven to be very useful for understanding dynamic complex systems that evolved over time, such as are often encountered in marketing. For example, a researcher can set up a model in which customers have decision rules about how they respond to business offers and make choices, and companies make decisions about how to respond to customers. The article of Cavalcante et al. in this issue is collaboration between computer science academics and practitioners. They propose a data-driven analytical tool, the work profile chart, to characterize the performance and quality of incident management systems in IT service factories. This approach addresses the critical issue of productivity and service quality issue in service, which has potential for alleviating the productivity-quality trade-off that is commonly observed in the service sector (i.e., unlike manufacturing, achieving productivity, and quality at the same time is difficult for service).</p>
<p>With a strong information systems background, the article by Wunderlich et al. in this issue investigates customer motivations in service adoption. Adoption is a major issue in the information systems discipline; nevertheless, this study goes beyond that and looks into a public home energy management services and confirms that customer motivations matter.</p>
<p>From the discipline of marketing, the article by Fang, Luo, and Jiang in this issue uses a real-world data set from China’s mobile phone markets to examine the effect of service recovery on customer satisfaction. Service recovery is a mainstream issue in service research, and the e-service context of longitudinal mobile phone market data provides us insights regarding how customer satisfaction fluctuates as a response to different recovery strategies. The article by Bartl, Gouthier, and Lenker in this issue continues the research tradition in marketing and look into the customer delight issue in an online shopping context. They confirm the findings that a delightful customer web experience is critical for purchase intension and brand equity.</p>
<p>The article by Wang, Harris, and Patterson in this issue addresses the role of habit in driving continued use of SST. The use of SST is a major issue investigated in service research, and this study reflects this tradition and adds our understanding about how customers get used to SST after initial trial (reluctant or willingly). The article of Hsieh et al. in this issue is itself a multidisciplinary piece. Authors from both information systems and marketing address an organizational issue of the impact of internal IT service quality on internal customers’ satisfaction with internal IT service.</p>
<p>From the operations management viewpoint, the article by Dey, Sinha, and Thirumalai in this issue shows us that more is not necessarily better for health care delivery. This is a unique position taken by operation researchers since operational efficiency is the default goal of the discipline, unlike marketing, which assumes that there is a trade-off between customer satisfaction and productivity. The article by Breidbach, Kolb, and Srinivasan in this issue looks into the connectivity in service systems for value cocreation. Value cocreation is a mainstream issue in service research, and this article expands our understanding to connectivity that is not just about technology but also about human behavior. The combination of technical connectivity and interpersonal connectivity brings out the hottest issue of social network sites that integrate the two aspects in one. The article by Vock, Dolen, and de Ruyter explores the value position of social networking sites, which is critical for their financial return and sustainability, despite their undeniable popularity.</p>
<p>Two more multidisciplinary pieces in this issue that have a stronger strategic management root are the article by Paluch and Blut, from a collaboration of technology and marketing; and the article by Kuruzovich et al., from a collaboration of technology management, marketing, and information systems. The Paluch and Blue study addresses the paradox of service separation and customer integration, echoing nicely with the service information transformation discussed earlier. The Kuruzovich et al. study tests an interesting Steve Jobs hypothesis that the degree of integration among hardware, software, and service to be a solution influences buyers’ satisfaction.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>IT transforms and renovates service into two seemingly polarized directions; making service more goods-like (more tangible, separable, homogeneous, and storable) or even more service-like (less tangible and separable, but more personalize and perishable) that provide two paths of evolution for service and manufacturing firms to follow that eventually blurs the distinction between goods and service.</p>
<p>IT-related service is information-intensive; customer information monitored, stored, and analyzed by IT is essential for the creation and delivery of service, and information itself can be consumed as service. IT-related service is customer-centric; customer satisfaction is critical while IT can better handle the satisfaction-productivity trade-off for service as technology advances over time, from which a deepened customer relationship in which the customer has more information and more power, can be achieved. IT-related service is multidisciplinary; researchers from diversified disciplines participate in service research that broadens and enriches our understanding about IT-related service. It makes a clear statement that IT-related service is everywhere and the study of it requires interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
