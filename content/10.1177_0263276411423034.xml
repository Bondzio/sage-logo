<abstract>
<p>In the last 20 years the institution of the museum has gone through a period of redefining its role and its functions in society, its forms of representation, its authority in discourses on the past and its objects. The stated aim of many of the ‘memory museums’ which were established during this period is to invite reflection on the aestheticization of memory and on the fact that the exhibition is seen as a narrative which is challenging conventional codes of perception. By granting a voice to what has been left out of the dominant discourses of history and of everyday experience, they try to integrate diversified and sometimes even incompatible narratives – a mode of representation that has so far been the domain of art and specifically literature. This contribution argues that it is not only between the museum and the memorial that distinctions between different memory media are getting blurred: examples such as Libeskind's Jewish Museum, which wants to be read as a text, and W.G. Sebald's novel <italic>Austerlitz</italic>, which he described as an alternative Holocaust museum, indicate that aspects of intermediality gain importance in the contemporary memorial landscape.</p>

<p>ACCORDING TO neurophysiologists our personal memory is not based on information retrieval but on re-imagining – it is elusive, highly selective and cannot be trusted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276411423034">Loftus, 1995</xref>: 47ff.). But in recent scholarship as well as in popular endeavours to ‘come to terms with’ difficult pasts, accounts of personal memories take centre stage, not only because they are seen to be more engaging but because they also seem to provide a democratic and ethically responsible way of approaching the past. Ideals such as disinterested objectivity, detachedness and clear distinction between past and present have been questioned from within historiography by scholars such as Hayden White, but even more importantly they are considered inappropriate in an ever growing remembrance culture in which the emphasis is on emotional investment rather than on historical knowledge. This is based on the assumption that knowledge about atrocities alone does not prevent violent histories from happening again, but that instead a degree of imaginative empathy is being called for in order to ensure moral responsibility. Much of the current popular remembrance culture in western countries is implicitly based on this rather schematic and simplistic opposition between ‘traditional historiography’ and ‘cultural memory’.</p>
<p>But what is ‘cultural’ or ‘collective memory’? The term is very much contested among historians and endlessly discussed by memory scholars: Aleida Assmann attempts to differentiate Maurice Halbwachs concept of ‘collective memory’ which, just like history, is actively constructed by social institutions ‘with the aid of memorial signs such as symbols, texts, images, rites, ceremonies, places, and monuments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276411423034">Assmann, 2004</xref>: 26) and – one might like to add – museums. Museums ‘engender and consolidate social <italic>practices</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0263276411423034">Williams, 2007</xref>: 5) of remembrance. According to Susan Sontag and other critics it would be more accurate to talk about ‘collective instruction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0263276411423034">Sontag, 2003</xref>: 76), which shifts the focus to questions about authority and ideology, that is, who is instructing, who is instructed and for what purpose? The crucial question here is not only what means we deploy to remember the past but what we gain for the present from doing so. To tackle this question it is necessary to investigate recent changes in the ‘basic grammar of the construction of political memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276411423034">Assmann, 2006</xref>: 219) and in the institutions concerned with it.</p>
<p>In the last two decades the museum has gone through a period of redefining its role and its functions in society, its forms of representation and its aims. These changes in museological discourse have resulted in a new type of museum that has made its appearance in diverse cultural, geographical and political contexts: the ‘memory museum’ could be described as an alternative version of the history museum. These museums define themselves not just as sites of academic and institutional history but as spaces of memory, exemplifying the shift from a perceived authoritative master discourse on the past to the paradigm of memory which supposedly allows for a wider range of stories about the past – a claim which needs to be critically interrogated.</p>
<p>Susan Sontag has used the term ‘memory museum’ as a generic term for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC (1993), for the Jewish Museum in Berlin (2001) and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem (redesigned Holocaust History Museum 2005): ‘The memory museum in its current proliferation is a product of a way of thinking about, and mourning, the destruction of European Jewry in the 1930s and 1940s’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0263276411423034">Sontag, 2003</xref>: 77). However, increasingly the genre of the memory museum is not restricted to Holocaust museums but can be seen to address very different historical events and periods. Holocaust iconography is often employed to ensure international attention and the Holocaust museums have provided a frame of reference and a template by which other modern atrocities world-wide are remembered and commemorated. Paul Williams uses the term ‘memorial museum’ to define ‘a specific kind of museum dedicated to a historic event commemorating mass suffering of some kind’ (2007: 8).</p>
<p>I would argue that the genre of the memory museum has diversified into a range of ‘sub-genres’ which see their role both in preserving and embodying memories not only in relation to recent events of mass suffering, but to a much wider range of historical periods and experiences. Both Sontag and Williams categorize the museums according to the historical events they deal with. But more importantly, the memory museums share certain representational strategies. A museum can be described as a multimedia platform on which different medial practices can be combined: an exhibition works with objects, but increasingly also with texts, images and audiovisual representations in a spatial arrangement. The museum is based on a loose association of these medial practices which are sometimes used to comment on each other, sometimes layered next to or on top of each other. The Jewish Museum in Berlin, for example, is not simply an accumulation of several medial practices, but can be described as ‘intermedial’: it attempts to evoke altermedial semiotic frameworks to explore the limitations of different representational concepts and strategies.</p>
<p>Taking into account the different possibilities of medial interrelations and transformations, Wolf defines three widely accepted versions of intermediality which form the basis of current research in intermediality: (1) ‘primary intermediality’ in which the amalgamation (‘Verschmelzung’) of at least two distinct media is constitutive, e.g. a song which is per se partly sound, partly text, (2) ‘secondary intermediality’ as the subsequent transformation of a work into another medium (medium transfer), e.g. a picturization, and (3) ‘figurative intermediality’ which indicates that within the given parameters of a medium the structure is transformed so that it results in the reproduction of another medium, e.g. freeze-frame in a film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0263276411423034">Wolf, 1998</xref>: 238ff.).</p>
<p>This last definition describes a phenomenon which goes beyond the simple combination, conversion or transformation of medial practices – it is the structural repetition of one medium in another medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276411423034">Paech, 1998</xref>: 16). It means that a medium which is normally latent because it is only seen as a transmitter appears in another medium as content and becomes thereby visible. It results in a self-reflexive commentary which, in highlighting medial capacities and restrictions, reflects on the general conditions of media.</p>
<p>The stated aim of many of these ‘new museums’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276411423034">Message, 2006</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276411423034">1</xref></sup> is to probe their limits as media of memory and to invite reflection on the representational and mediated quality of history. Rather than being perceived as remains of a lost past, certifying its demise, museum objects are considered to be the material hinges of a potential recovery of shared meanings, by means of narrativization and performativity. By granting a voice to what has been left out of the dominant discourses of history, diverse and sometimes even incompatible narratives have supposedly been granted a locus in a museal space that claims to aspire no longer to any totalizing synthesis, but to a mode of representation that has so far been the domain of art, film and literature. The Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC (1993), for example, is not so much seen as ‘a history museum in the traditional sense’, but as a ‘narrative museum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276411423034">Pieper, 2006</xref>: 28ff.) whose emotional impact is supposed to resemble that of ‘novels, plays or motion pictures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276411423034">Weinberg and Elieli, 1995</xref>: 17). Tom Freudenheim, the former Deputy Director of the Jewish Museum in Berlin, described the permanent exhibition of the museum in an interview in 1999 as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>About half of the building will be a permanent exhibition, its narrative story. We have written a story and are in the process now of figuring out how to tell that story. Most museums start with material they have and then figure out what the story is that they can tell about the material they have. We are not starting out with objects, we’re starting out with a story. Our narrative has been generally laid out. We look at that story and say, how do we tell that story in the context of a museum? What are the artifacts that we need in order to tell that story? … And, what part of the story can’t be told through artifacts, but may have to be described in some other way – audio, video, models, reproductions, photographs? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276411423034">Freudenheim, 2000</xref>: 40).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Rather than being instigated and set up around a collection, memory museums assume an initiative role in singling out past events which help to address issues around current controversies. The story becomes the object of the exhibition insofar as it is not the objects themselves that are distinctive, but the associated history to which they are attached. The aura of the authentic object is that it is a ‘witness’ and memory repository providing a quasi authentic experience for the re-living and retracing visitor. As remains recovered from destruction and loss, the artefacts also provide evidence. At the same time they are centred around a narrative for which they act as illustrations. The narrative privileges the spectacle and is mainly told through audiovisual props, theatrical displays and visual stimuli. Photographs in particular are used to create a sense of immediacy and reduce the space between the living and the dead. Visitors are invited to a sensory, haptic experience thereby breaking one of the central taboos of the traditional history or art museum. The memory museums thus redefine their functions in and for communities not simply by diversifying the narratives they tell but more importantly by renegotiating the processes of narration and the museal codes of communication with the public. Thus, although the museum is traditionally situated in the realm of ‘political memory’, memory museums want to be seen as forums of the communicative memory of the victims and survivors by collecting and displaying donated memorabilia and oral testimonies of witnesses. Autobiographical storytelling is part of the museum's function of giving voice to individual fate and transforming bystanders into ‘secondary witnesses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276411423034">Baer, 2002</xref>: 87). The key feature of all the memory museums is that they encourage visitors to empathize and identify with individual sufferers and victims, as if ‘reliving’ their experience, in order to thus develop more personal and immediate forms of engagement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276411423034">2</xref></sup> Aiming principally to achieve an emotional impact, memory museums provide people with an experience and confront them with a moral imperative – which more often than not places them at odds with their self-proclaimed objective of self-reflexivity. The stated aim might be to disturb the visitors into a state of active responsibility, yet as a site of moral and national instruction the openness of this ‘text’ is limited, not least by interpellating a predetermined moral subject. In addition, as Susannah Radstone has pointed out, these ‘processes of identification with suffering [also act] as replacements for more traditional modes of political allegiance formation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276411423034">Radstone, 2008</xref>: 34).</p>
<p>These ‘new museums’ try to tread a fine line between history and memory, between transnational and national memory cultures, but also between different memory media such as the memorial and the museum. Paul Williams claims that during the last 20 years a large number of new museums commemorating violent histories which led to mass suffering, such as genocides, wars, dictatorships and displacements, defy these distinctions. This is in part due to massive changes in our remembrance culture: in the 19th century monuments and museums became instruments for defining national identity by interpreting the past in a coherent and often heroic narrative which encouraged pride or at least unequivocal identification with the nation. They were sites of national instruction and established a hegemonic narrative based on the notion of superiority or martyrdom. Jay Winter argues that the First World War marked a shift in commemoration paradigms as monuments and ceremonies became the centre of public mourning, a place for the bereaved to grieve for individual soldiers whose deaths were nevertheless redeemed within a narrative of communal sacrifice for a greater good. It sparked a development towards memorials which would not only commemorate the heroes but also mourn the nation's dead while still serving as sites of shared national values and ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0263276411423034">Winter, 1995</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0263276411423034">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A fairly recent development in the global landscape of remembrance is to acknowledge, remember and mourn those who were victimized by one's own country, although these apologies are usually poor substitutes for concrete reparation: the rituals of an apology indicating an admission of guilt, such as Clinton's apology for slavery (1998) or, ten years later, Australia's prime minister Kevin Rudd's apology to the Aborigines, have become recurring features. These admissions of guilt are often also transformed into permanent structures such as memorials and museums which indicate a change in the global landscape of remembrance and commemoration. They refer to events which are difficult to remember because they can be cast neither in a heroic nor in a martyr-like narrative. As such they form the focus of politically charged transcultural debates and controversies around the ethics and aesthetics of remembrance. And nowhere is this change in the memorial culture more visible than in Berlin's dense landscape of remembrance. Here memorials and museums function as material focus for the most fierce and controversial debates around questions concerning not only the interpretation and aesthetics of remembrance of the Nazi past but also of the legacy of the GDR.</p>
<p>This changed aesthetic of remembrance tries to avoid so-called ‘wreath dumping places', opting instead for ‘counter-monuments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0263276411423034">Young, 1992</xref>) which are supposed to startle onlookers and force them into thinking about the memorial and what it stands for. These memorials are increasingly complemented by more didactically-oriented documentation centres, which provide a narrative that is distilled from the heated public debates surrounding these projects. Thereby the aesthetic ambiguity of the memorial is counter-balanced by historical background information or, as critics would say, its intractable character is thereby compromised: the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe (opened 2005) has such a documentation centre, as has the Wall Memorial Ensemble Bernauer Straße (1998). At the same time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276411423034">Libeskind's building of the Jewish Museum (2001)</xref> is just as much perceived as an (architectural) memorial as a museum. Indeed, it could be argued that two very distinct commemorative functions come into conflict in this institution: we are used to thinking about the commemorative functions of memorials and the ceremonies attached to them as very much akin to burial rites which are supposed to honour the dead and establish a community united in mourning and in the resolve to prevent the cause for such grief in future. Memorials are places for reverent commemoration and passive contemplation; museums, on the other hand, are educational institutions tasked with critical interpretation and historical contextualization. ‘The coalescing of the two suggests that there is an increasing desire to add both a moral framework to the narration of past events and more in-depth contextual explanations to commemorative acts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0263276411423034">Williams, 2007</xref>: 8).</p>
<p>However, it is not only between the museum and the memorial that distinctions between different media of memory have become blurred: Libeskind wants his Jewish Museum in Berlin (2001) to be read like a text and W.G. Sebald claimed that he envisaged his prose text <italic>Austerlitz</italic> (2001) as an ‘alternative Holocaust museum’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0263276411423034">4</xref></sup> This was not a random remark: a few years earlier in an interview with Volker Hage regarding his essays on areal warfare he had already mentioned the museum as a model for his writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276411423034">Hage, 2003</xref>: 268ff.). Sebald (b. 1944) and Libeskind (b. 1946) emerged to prominence simultaneously – both belong to the same generation, both were influenced by thinkers such as Theodor W. Adorno and Walter Benjamin, and both wrestle with the same problem: the ethics of art and representation after Auschwitz. Their respective medium, its qualities and technologies, its characteristics and its limits which co-determine how we perceive what is mediated, are at the centre of those reflections. Obviously the very different cultural and social positioning of their chosen media needs to be taken into consideration: architecture and the institution of the museum occupy a very distinct intersection between political and artistic forms of representation and respond, as such, to a different framework than a literary text. They also have a different context of reception, which in the case of the museum has a social and ritual element not present in the serial readership of books.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these examples indicate that the limits of specific forms of representations of the past are now being tested. They constitute an intricate part of an advanced and self-reflexive memorial landscape. I would argue that there is a trend towards a diversification of memorial culture combined with a hybridization of media which can be read as a response to the ambiguous and sometimes even conflicting demands on these new museums, memorials and on remembrance work in general, especially when the challenge is to speak about what is deemed unspeakable and visualize what is deemed unimaginable.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0263276411423034"><title>The Jewish Museum, Berlin (2001)</title>
<p>The Jewish Museum in Berlin was never supposed to be a Holocaust Museum<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0263276411423034">5</xref></sup> and, in contrast to the expectations of mainly international tourists, visitors (the majority of which are gentile Germans; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276411423034">Chametzky, 2008</xref>: 239) are certainly not encouraged to experience it in this way. The planners originally envisaged an additional wing in the already existing city museum which would be both autonomous and integrative, in an attempt to show Jewish history and culture as a dimension of Berlin's and Germany's historical and cultural landscape.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0263276411423034">6</xref></sup> However, since the building shell of the annex was opened to the public in 1999 (two years before its official opening as a museum with exhibits), Daniel Libeskind's highly symbolic architecture and the architect's accompanying annotations have led many visitors to interpret the very distinct extension as a Holocaust memorial. During the two years in which the still empty building could be visited by the public, it attracted 350,000 visitors, 15,000 in October 1999 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276411423034">Smith, 2010</xref>: 152). The idea was put forward to keep the empty shell of the building as it was, instead of building Peter Eisenman's design of the Holocaust Memorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276411423034">Pieper, 2006</xref>: 242ff.). This in turn caused concern in Berlin's Jewish community and in the Berlin Senate, who saw the museal programme of the institution threatened.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0263276411423034">7</xref></sup> The building's statement has since then been seen to be almost in conflict with the permanent exhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0263276411423034">8</xref></sup> Its architecture refuses to function as a blank and neutral canvas and brings forward its own interpretation. It ‘demonstrates that the line at which the building stops and the museum apparatus begins is becoming ever more occluded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276411423034">Stead, 2000</xref>: 2). But it also calls into question the function of the traditional memorial, encouraging visitors to engage not only on an emotional but also on a visceral level which goes beyond a ritualistic response. Libeskind's design for the Jewish Museum has been interpreted and celebrated as a counter-memorial and a counter-museum in which Libeskind has given expression to the crises in commemoration practices.</p>
<p>It has been claimed that Libeskind's design would be better described as a philosophical program or an architectural manifesto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276411423034">Smith, 2010</xref>: 142): in addition to the architectural code and the visceral experience the completed building itself provides, Libeskind's conceptual writings and annotations constitute a multi-layered matrix. Without taking the architect at his words (which would be naïve) or claiming that the Jewish Museum is identical with Libeskind's design or his theories, it nevertheless cannot be ignored that these ‘epitexts'<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0263276411423034">9</xref></sup> have become an integral part of the building and the museum. On the basis of these epitexts the architecture can be read and experienced on three different levels:
<list id="list1-0263276411423034" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Level of experience: the building creates an experiential space which does not aim for figurative representation or iconographic symbolism, but tries to generate visceral reactions and emotionally as well as psychologically disturbing effects of disorientation in museum visitors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Level of metaphor: the six ‘Voids' which cut vertically through the building, interrupting both representational and temporal continuity along the museum's horizontal axis, cannot be experienced by moving through the rooms; they can be seen, but cannot be entered or put to use and therefore suggest a metaphorical or rather metonymical reading: the ‘Voids’ are created at the intersections between the zigzag line and the disrupted straight line on which it centres, thereby representing the inextricable links between German and Jewish history. According to Libeskind, the empty Voids mark the violent historical rupture and the absence created by the annihilation of people, their community and culture: ‘The Void is the impenetrable emptiness across which the absence of Berlin's Jewish citizens is made apparent to the visitor’ (2009). The visitors’ way through the building is continuously interrupted by empty spaces which are partly closed off or can only be crossed on bridges, in an attempt to break off any linear or coherent reading of the exhibition. In his competition entry Libeskind stated that ‘the museum form itself must be rethought in order to transcend the passive involvement of the viewer, actively confronting change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276411423034">Libeskind, 2001</xref>: 29). It becomes the visitors’ responsibility and therefore also their choice if and how to engage with these spaces on a cognitive and emotional level.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Level of allegory: Libeskind describes the building as an ‘emblem’, which means that there is no intuitive connection between meaning and sign – it cannot be decoded without adequate knowledge. He stresses the constructedness of the building, its assembled parts and the philosophical basis of the design. His naming of different elements of the building, such as the Garden of Emigration and Exile (which is also called the E.T.A. Hoffmann Garden or the ‘upside down’ garden<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0263276411423034">10</xref></sup>), and his explanations of the design – which are frequently quoted in the museum's guide books and publicity material – have become an integral part of how the museum is interpreted, not only by scholars but also by visitors. His comments were continuously modified according to the changes he was forced to make on the design, but also later in response to museum visitors’ reactions, which also meant that the publicity material on the Jewish Museum was regularly amended. However, Libeskind never aimed to provide a logical or linear narrative or transmit a totalizing unity; on the contrary, he seems to be content that his comments are as fragmented as the building itself.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The title of the project – ‘Between the Lines’ – evokes a paradigm in which neither space nor time holds primacy but both are inextricably linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276411423034">Vidler, 2000</xref>: 235). Lines can potentially have a spatial or a temporal meaning: with the help of timelines we organize our individual life and history. A timeline evokes the notion of time as a linear continuity, but a position between the lines suggests that they are potentially asynchronous and that this continuity can be undermined. In a spatial sense lines define and limit different spheres. Lines can separate but also connect. In terms of architecture, the title indicates that it is not the shell of the building but the space which is created between those lines of walls, and especially the voided spaces, which form the core of the design. The space between the lines implies the notion of a gap, an absence, embodied in the idea of the Voids indicating the absence of Jewish life in Berlin after the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Libeskind calls his building an ‘emblem’, which draws attention to the fact that emblems combine media such as image and text and are therefore intrinsically intermedial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0263276411423034">11</xref></sup> The phrase ‘between the lines’ is probably most often used when talking about a text or the reading of a text. Whenever we are asked to read between the lines our attention is drawn to a meaning that cannot be deducted from the words in a literal sense. The building rejects a narrative or visual representation which could be recognized from a privileged vantage point. But how can we read a building between the lines? In this case, I would argue, by following up the various intermedial references: according to Libeskind, he ‘designed the Jewish Museum … on principles that were not necessarily solely architectural but rather para-architectural, using literature, music, and history not as metaphors, but rather as organizational structures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276411423034">Libeskind et al., 2003</xref>: 25), claiming that ‘the museum is not only a building, but it is also an emblematic reading of the city itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276411423034">Libeskind, 1994</xref>: 11). He distilled a cultural map from the cityscape of Berlin by drawing lines between former residences of its composers, writers and poets, connecting Jews as well as non-Jews in an ‘irrational and invisible matrix’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0263276411423034">12</xref></sup> By joining those dots Libeskind also created the image of a compressed and distorted Star of David, fragments of which correspond to the layout of the building. Therefore Berlin's urban space constitutes not just the surroundings of the museum, and equally its history is not just the subject matter of the exhibition, but they form part of the museum's building itself.</p>
<p>In his allusion to the abrupt end of Schönberg's unfinished opera <italic>Moses and Aaron</italic> (1932) and his attempt to complete architecturally what could not be completed in musical terms, Libeskind also reminds us that musical notation is written ‘between the lines’, e.g. by typing his competition entry onto music paper:<disp-quote>
<p>At the end of the opera Moses doesn’t sing, he just speaks, ‘Oh word, thou word, [which I lack!]’ addressing the absence of the Word, yet one can understand it as a ‘text’. This is because when there is no more singing, the missing word which is uttered by Moses, the call for the Word, the call for the Deed, is understood clearly. I sought to complete that opera architecturally and that is the second aspect of this project. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276411423034">Libeskind, 2009</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>With this opera Libeskind evokes the age-old contest between word, image and sound in posing the question of which art form can provide access to the truth (and to God) – the abstract word or the concrete image. In basing his design on the invisible and on the abstract, he ties it in with an aniconism which condemns the urge to worship and adore a man-made fetish which induces man's ensnarement in his own imagination (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0263276411423034">Assmann, 2005</xref>: 3) and refuses to compromise a thought in order to make it more accessible. In the Bible (Deuteronomy, Chp 4, 15ff.) it is the word, not the image, which is the medium of the veneration of God. The image is not questionable because God is unimaginable, but because God's medium of choice in which he speaks is the word. The word is the foundation of the law, of justice, not cult.</p>
<p>The visitors are also invited to move ‘between the lines' as the visual and tactile experience generated by the encounter with the building induces a sensory destabilization and pervasive feeling of fragmentation and incoherence, of a series of disconnected moments. The visitor is led through the underground level on three intersecting axes which do not correspond with the outer zigzag form of the building. They are narrow, windowless and coldly lit corridors: (1) the ‘Axis of Continuity’ is gently inclined and ends at a steep staircase leading to the exhibition on the two upper floors which covers 2000 years of Jewish history in Germany. (2) The ‘Axis of Exile’ leads to the ‘Garden of Exile’: a walled cobble-stoned outdoor square with a sloping floor and 49 tilted concrete columns towering over the visitors’ heads. (3) The ‘Axis of Holocaust’ ends in the ‘voided Void’, as it has been called by Libeskind, which is also outside of the main building and only connected to it on the underground level. It has become known as the ‘Holocaust tower’, a clear indication of how visitors try to concretize Libeskind's more abstract spaces by (re)naming them. In the aisle leading to the tower an information board informs the visitors about this discrepancy, insisting that Libeskind's architecture is open to interpretation.</p>
<p>One can understand how visitors have come to read this space symbolically: the visitors enter the tower through a heavy metal door which falls shut and leaves only a glimpse of light protruding through a corner slice from great height. They find themselves in a bare, concrete space which is not insulated or heated. This very problematic interpretation of the ‘Holocaust tower’ assumes that we can have a physical experience which evokes and helps us to understand the enormity of dying in or living through the Holocaust. This interpretation might also fall short of the space Libeskind has created: the claustrophobic room is completely empty and throws the visitors back onto themselves, encouraging them to contemplate this sensation. Because the façade and the interior and the floor plan of the underground and the upper levels do not correspond, the visitors’ ability to locate themselves is undermined. The insecurity about one's own position denies the visitors a stable viewpoint. Thereby Libeskind's design seeks to subvert the traditional ways in which visitors visually navigate a museum space. The visitors find themselves in ‘unhomed’, ‘uncanny’ surroundings:<disp-quote>
<p>the stabilizing function of architecture, by which the familiar is made to appear part of a naturally ordered landscape, will be subverted by the antithetical effects of the unfamiliar. It is a memorial architecture that invites us into its seemingly hospitable environs only to estrange itself from us immediately on entering. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0263276411423034">Young, 2000</xref>: 2ff.).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The feeling of disorientation and irritation which the architecture wants to invoke in the visitor through slanted halls, diagonal window slits and claustrophobic spaces is not in imitation of the situation of the persecuted Jews, but first and foremost an attempt to undermine the interpretational security of the museum visitor and to evoke that which was once familiar but is now defamiliarized, that of which the nation had voided itself. It does not suggest that it offers an authentic experience or that the visitors could immerse themselves in the victims’ fates. An understanding of the complexities of Jewish-German history can only be achieved through an active and laborious engagement with the interplay between the conceptual levels of the architecture, the exhibition and Libeskind's (as well as others’) accompanying writings which open up endless correspondences between fragmented references.</p>
<p>The museal presentation on the underground level focuses on individual biographies and few, sparsely told family histories of persecution, escape and annihilation, delivering only fragments which defy the urge to produce a grand narrative. Slanting vitrines are recessed into the walls and exhibit changing displays: relics such as photos, letters, postcards and other keepsakes which have been donated by family members and whose presence is the more poignant in that they testify to their owner's disappearance. This is emphasized by a black border in the shape of a passepartout on the glass which could be read as a mourning band. The objects are accompanied by commentaries from survivors or lenders that do not add up to a closed narrative. This exhibition aims to create sympathy for the suffering of others, but denies a passively sentimental or self-indulgent identification with the victim status or a cathartic experience – the responsibility of understanding rests firmly with the visitor. In contrast to Holocaust museums, the exhibition does not show any images or traces of the extermination: the almost complete annihilation of European Jews and their culture has become part of the museum architecture in the form of the Voids. These disruptive, counter-representational strategies can be understood as functional equivalents to the way Sebald has likewise attempted to expose the ‘voids’ in the materiality of language and the continuity of narrative by way of other media and their temporalities: in <italic>Austerlitz</italic> (2001) the sensual evidence of objects, the immediacy of voices, the tangible trace of photographs as emanations of the subject and the life-like presentation of film which are on different levels revealed to be manipulations based on wilful staging and theatricality, all refuse to provide the protagonist with a consistent account of what happened to his parents. Not only do these media refuse to coalesce into a coherent narrative which would enable him to link up with a family history and a cultural tradition that has been violently broken off, their representations also remain elusive, fragmentary and decontextualized.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0263276411423034"><title>W.G. Sebald's <italic>Austerlitz</italic> (2001)</title>
<p>Published in the same year the Jewish Museum was opened, W.G. Sebald's literary experiment <italic>Austerlitz</italic> (2001) is in some ways a very similar memory project – albeit in the medium of writing – concerned with the ethics and the representational limits of memory. It has often been remarked that the Holocaust, which Sebald rarely touches upon directly in his writing, has nevertheless been at the centre of it. This claim is certainly true for <italic>Austerlitz,</italic> in which this void spurs his meandering narrative. <italic>Austerlitz</italic> is not a survivor testimony or witness account: the narrator is a German, born in 1944 and therefore clearly a ‘nonwitness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276411423034">Weissman, 2004</xref>: 20) of the Holocaust. He informs the reader right at the beginning of the fact that he grew up among the perpetrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276411423034">Sebald, 2001</xref>: 13). He is, however, asked to become a ‘secondary witness’ by listening to the protagonist Austerlitz telling his survivor's tale, related to him in instalments on various encounters. The narrator acts not simply as a passive listener and medium, but feels the obligation to testify to the laborious and painful process of recollection, conscientiously conveying the stories that thereby emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276411423034">Baer, 2002</xref>: 89–92). The project of secondary witnessing<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0263276411423034">13</xref></sup> requires a self-conscious documentation which is why the narrator records his own memories and feelings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0263276411423034">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The protagonist Austerlitz, whose life story we are told, was a child on one of the Kindertransports,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0263276411423034">15</xref></sup> an identity that was suppressed and consequently lost to his own memory. He is dispossessed of an event which nevertheless dominates and defines his life, resulting in radical self-estrangement. The text describes how Austerlitz regains knowledge of this event, its place in history and effect on himself, through a range of media: architecture, radio, archive, museum, through texts, film, photographs and objects. <italic>Austerlitz</italic> explores their mediating capacities to relive things observed, but not experienced or – alternatively – experienced but not remembered. It suggests that the only chance to reconstruct what was never fully experienced is via a complex interplay between witness accounts and various media of memory. The text explores how their different medial characteristics promise or indeed provide different ways of accessing the past. The enigmatic objects of a collection of curiosities are contrasted with the structured approach of a modern history museum: visual media such as film and photography compete in Austerlitz's quest for an image of his mother, the access to cultural memory provided by books is complemented with the communicative memory of Austerlitz's former nanny Vera, a purposeful archival search is set off against involuntary memory triggered, for example, by smells when Austerlitz enters his childhood home in Prague. Smells or tactile experiences which form part of our somatic memory and get triggered by rediscovered objects and places have nevertheless to be spelled out in letters and signs (‘signs and characters from the type-case of forgotten things’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276411423034">Sebald, 2001</xref>: 214).</p>
<p>The protagonist delves not so much into the depths of his own traumatized individual memory but through the realms of mediated memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276411423034">Assmann, 2004</xref>: 22). It is this path of discovery which he tells in intervals to the narrator and which the narrator writes down. The relationship between the narrator and the protagonist is constantly reflected: the exact time and place and the context of their encounters are recorded, and the development of their relationship, its interruption and their accidental encounters, are documented. Although this approach bears certain resemblances to the principles of oral history, it also differs by drawing attention to the fact that Austerlitz's access to his own memory is blocked and that we hear his story not from himself but through the German narrator. The narrator acts as a secondary witness who is asked to testify not to the events themselves but to a mediated reconstruction of traumatic memories.</p>
<p>Many critics have commented on the fact that Sebald's texts can be seen as travelogues conveying journeys that transcend time and space. The anachronistic style<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0263276411423034">16</xref></sup> of Sebald's meandering prose has been described as a ‘Poetik der Verlangsamung’ (‘poetics of slowing down’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276411423034">Hutchinson, 2009</xref>: 22): by walking through space, his travellers also roam through time, through the historical layers of the city and landscapes they explore. Just as in the museum the movement through space is also a passage through time. Publicity material for the Jewish Museum repeatedly talks about taking visitors on a ‘time travel’. In the museum objects acquire meaning and a place in history through their spatial positioning, very much reminiscent of the ancient techniques of <italic>ars memoria</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0263276411423034">17</xref></sup> Museums, collections and archives feature prominently in all of Sebald's texts and, according to Jonathan Long, ‘the archive… lies at the very heart of Sebald's narrative project’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276411423034">Long, 2007</xref>: 11). More often than not they have been reduced to the dwindling conservation of themselves and their, as it seems, old-fashioned displays: fusty museums with no visitors, libraries that are replaced by new buildings. But just as in Walter Benjamin's arcades, this state of decline reveals their mythological quality and their as yet unrealized utopian potential. Sebald once described himself, just as Walter Benjamin did, not so much as a writer but as a collector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276411423034">Köhler, 2000</xref>). His texts are repositories, and in an inversion of the classical narratological opposition they are ‘showing’ rather than ‘telling’ (‘<italic>Auf</italic>zählung’ instead of ‘<italic>Er</italic>zählung’): Sebald's writing is based on a poetics of collecting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276411423034">Körte, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423034">Finkelde, 2007</xref>). This has to be taken quite literally – Sebald confessed to being an ardent frequenter of junk shops and his writing is the outcome of a process of creative collecting. He relied on finds, on <italic>objets trouvés</italic>, but their arrangement is based on associative and imaginative correspondences and analogies, on real and virtual connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276411423034">Löffler, 2005</xref>: 135–7). Sebald's meticulous placing of the photographs in the German editions (though not necessarily in the English translations) arranges the text, photographs and the objects in the photographs in a sophisticated structure of cross-references and mutual commentary by which they acquire ‘resonance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276411423034">Greenblatt, 1991</xref>), just like the exhibits in a museum or in a cabinet of curiosities.</p>
<p>The visual reproductions that are inserted into Sebald's texts (and that have gathered so far the most scholarly attention) are not only images: as photographs, paintings, diaries, calling cards or newspaper clips, they are objects reproduced two-dimensionally. They have to be distinguished into images of objects created to aid remembrance (such as photographs) and objects around which remembrance accrues through contextual association. In granting these inconspicuous objects such a prominent position in the text, <italic>Austerlitz</italic> creates an aura which gains particular poignancy through their hidden significance: after transportations, flights and emigrations these mundane objects are often the only tangible traces which are left. The very same kind of objects – family photographs, postcards, treasured possessions – can be found in the underground exhibition of the Jewish Museum: ‘Physically, very little remains of the Jewish presence in Berlin – small things, documents, archive materials, evocative of an absence rather than a presence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276411423034">Libeskind, 1992</xref>: 61). One could argue that both in <italic>Austerlitz</italic> as well as in the Jewish Museum unassuming personal objects are imbued with a mnemonic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276411423034">Klebes, 2004</xref>: 128), but at the same time they mark the voiding of identity which preceded the death of individuals and the void created by the termination of whole communities and their culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276411423034">Fuchs, 2004</xref>: 294).</p>
<p>On his investigation in Terezín, Austerlitz encounters the Holocaust museum which fills him with unease when faced with the museum exhibition's mimicry of the fastidious and meticulous records and lists of the Nazi's administrative machinery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0263276411423034">18</xref></sup> While roaming around the town he stumbles across a shop called Antikos Bazar, a sort of junk shop which is closed, and the shop-windows show just a fraction of what Austerlitz calls a ‘Magazin’, which in German also denotes storage space in the archive or the museum. The displayed objects are in several respects frozen images, and seem to exist beyond space and time, epitomized in a stuffed squirrel in mid-motion and the porcelain statue of a miraculous escape with a rider in full gallop drawing a distressed young girl up onto his horse.</p>
<p>Although he indicates the arbitrariness of the objects, Austerlitz responds to the shop-windows as if they were vitrines in a museum, and as if the objects and their relation to one another could provide him with answers about what happened in the Theresienstadt ghetto when his mother lived there. In fact, during the night after his visit to Terezín, Austerlitz sees before his mind's eye images of the shop windows and the ghetto museum displays indiscriminately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276411423034">Sebald, 2001</xref>: 283; cp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276411423034">Isaac, 2007</xref>: 47). The stories and hidden messages they seem to hold make the objects valuable, but they cannot tell their stories – they need to be read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276411423034">Flagmeier, 2003</xref>: 175). In the attempt to ‘read’ objects, the etymology of the German word ‘lesen’ (reading), which refers back to ‘(auf)lesen, aufsammeln’ (gathering, collecting) and ‘einer Spur folgen’ (‘to follow a trace’), is taken literally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276411423034">Kremer, 2004</xref>: 82). Austerlitz's attempt to read the objects of a shop display as a ‘rebus' is also reminiscent of Benjamin, but just as with Benjamin the reading is elusive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0263276411423034">19</xref></sup> Their stories were lost with their owners – a transgenerational oral history from which Austerlitz is cut off: ‘the history of countless places and objects which themselves have no power of memory is never heard, never described or passed on’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276411423034">Sebald, 2001</xref>: 31). The objects are not signs or tokens but unreadable hieroglyphs; they evoke absence and loss rather than meaning and continuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423034">Finkelde, 2007</xref>: 559). They represent what is not remembered. Austerlitz's alienation from these isolated and enigmatic objects transforms them into a collection of curiosities in contrast to museum exhibits which are supposed to provide an illustration to a comprehensive narrative. Austerlitz's engagement with those objects is based on an empathic and imaginary involvement with which he aims to fill the gaps and voids of personal memory by drawing from the cultural archive – a process which is not only true for the traumatized Austerlitz but also for the narrator.</p>
<p>With <italic>Austerlitz</italic> Sebald does not only face up to the unavoidable question of how we can remember once the generation of survivors and eye-witnesses has passed away, but also attempts to answer the same question which caused so many controversies in the planning phase of the Jewish Museum: how could a representation of German-Jewish history avoid misappropriation? The moral responsibility, and the psychological need to create memory and not just to preserve it, is pitted against the taboo of usurping the memories of the victims as one's own. It seems that both Sebald and Libeskind recur to abstract spatial figures which become emblematic of a temporal disjuncture: the intersecting zigzag lines of the museum which can only be derived by looking at the floor plans and the random encounters on the equally zigzagging trajectories of the protagonists in Sebald's narrative. Whenever they meet the German narrator's story is intersected by Austerlitz's account, which is repeatedly broken off by his traumatic loss of memory, and the resulting omissions are never completely reconstructed but leave the same voids as in Libeskind's architecture. Like Austerlitz himself, we too never learn what exactly happened to his mother in Theresienstadt or what became of his father after he had fled to Paris.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0263276411423034" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Sebald and Libeskind explore not only the limits of the technologies of their media but also the assumptions and restrictions of their medium as a social institution. Libeskind claims that his building aims to incorporate Jewish experience in a space that ‘cannot be described in words or texts’. This is where architecture seems to be able to express more than other art forms based on language, and yet there is also a ‘substance beyond the visible’, dimensions which are ‘not purely in space, dimensions inscribed in time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276411423034">Libeskind, 2001</xref>: 25). Sebald, on the other hand, worked in what is considered to be a temporal medium. But with the photographic reproduction which he introduced in his texts, he also gave them a spatial dimension without falling prey to a naïve belief in images over words. In an interview Sebald stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I think it is sufficient to remind people, because we’ve all seen images, but these images militate against our capacity for discoursive thinking, for reflecting upon these things. And also paralyze, as it were, our moral capacity. So the only way in which one can approach these things, in my view, is obliquely, tangentially, by reference rather than by direct confrontation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0263276411423034">Silverblatt, 2007</xref>: 80)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This is also very much true of Libeskind's project. I would argue that their responses show a lot of similarities: they both refuse the visitor/reader a privileged vantage point and are committed to an aesthetics of labyrinthine open-endedness, of permanent incompletion and perpetual (self) questioning by testing the limits of their respective media and by reinventing them as intermedial art forms. In <italic>Austerlitz</italic>, just as in Libeskind's building, multimediality is reinterpreted as an intermedial dynamic between different media of memory. They focus on the tension that is generated through the complex interplay and interrelations of a range of medial expressions. They do not simply combine texts, photographs, audiovisual media and objects in order to enhance our insight into the past, but create a dynamic in which those media reflect on one another as extensions and external storage of memory. Texts and epitexts destabilize the interpretational authority of their own narrative by highlighting the media filters through which they have passed. They show how different media and their frameworks contribute to a narrative by determining not only what but also how we remember.</p>
<p>Whereas Libeskind has created a textual, philosophical and musical space, Sebald's text engages with the ethics but most importantly the aesthetics which also inform the new museums. Sebald's poetics of memory bears close resemblance to the strategies of remembrance prevalent in Libeskind's museum. In that case the deployment of museal strategies is an attempt not only to blur the line between history and art but also to transgress the medial boundaries of traditional fiction towards a hypertextual network, a non-sequential collage and bricolage which denies the linear and clear-cut progression from the event and its remembering to the mediation of this memory.</p>
<p>Libeskind's museum can be described as a counter-museum in many respects: its architecture refuses to function as a blank and neutral container and background to the exhibition. It has therefore been celebrated as a memorial, but it also draws into question the function of the traditional memorial, encouraging an aesthetic and cognitive process rather than a ritualistic and immersive response. Both Sebald and Libeskind reframe the conventions of their respective media, and weave a net of correspondences and references, cross-linking events, trying to force the reader to see them from new angles and think independently. Both draw the viewers'/readers’ attention to the limits of various memory media, not just because of the figurative use of each other's medial form – after all, the metaphorization of architecture through text and vice versa is not new – but they do so working close to the aporia and dead ends of the other medium: Libeskind's textualization of museum space does not make the latter readable, Sebald's use of photography and the collection refuses to produce ‘evidence’.</p>
<p>Sebald's text and Libeskind's building do not provide a factual testimony or a continuous narrative but instead spur an imaginary engagement with the past as an intractable ‘other’ that cannot be brought to a closure. Instead of suggesting a straightforward access to the past, they insist on the painful dissociation between past and present, experience and memory, seeing and knowing, self and other: the experience cannot be posthumously appropriated through empathic identification or voyeurism. Sebald's and Libeskind's projects of secondary witnessing do not cater for passive spectatorship but ask the reader/visitor to take on responsibility for the act of perception and confront themselves with a loss and pain that ‘does not affirm the centrality of the perceiving subject’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276411423034">Kouvaros, 2005</xref>: 189) and cannot simply be usurped to stabilize one's own individual, social, ethnic or national identity.</p>

<fn id="fn15-0263276411423034"><label>15</label><p>The story of Jacques Austerlitz is based on the history of the ‘Kindertransport’, the lifeline to Britain of some 10,000 unaccompanied Jewish children in 1938–9. It was spurred by Sebald watching a Channel 4 documentary on Susie Bechhöfer, who in mid-life remembered coming to Wales on such a ‘Kindertransport’. It would be interesting to ask why he chose to make this medial transformation from TV to the more old-fashioned radio programme. The character of Austerlitz integrates aspects of several persons who existed in real live and the name can be found in Prague and Paris, where Austerlitz looks for traces of his mother and father: The name Austerlitzová, for example, can be found on the walls of the Pinkas Synagogue in Prague which lists the names of all Jews of Bohemia and Moravia murdered in the Holocaust. The full details read ‘Austerlitzová Anna, 7.5.1894 – 16.11.1941’. On the ‘Wall of Names’ at the Mémorial de la Shoah, Paris (2005) the names of Frank Austerlitz (1906) and Gustave Austerlitz (1880) are listed among the names of 76,000 Jewish men, women and children deported from France between 1942 and 1944.</p></fn>
