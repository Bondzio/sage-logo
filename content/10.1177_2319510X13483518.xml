<abstract>
<p>It is worth mentioning that a great deal of financial liberalisation, privatisation and internationalisation policies in emerging economies have significantly increased the corporate restructuring activities like mergers, acquisitions, share repurchases and stock splits, among others. Indeed, the activity that is investigated in this article is ‘share repurchases’ and its effect on stock returns and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. More deeply, this article will answer the research question—does a share repurchase offer abnormal returns around the announcement? Thus, it is performed in one of the Asian emerging markets—India. To do so, we use event-study method to examine abnormal returns and P/E signalling around the announcement of 64 share repurchases, announced during 2008–2009. It is found that stock performance is not adequate and notices lower as well as negative earnings during post-buyback period. Briefly, we conclude that share repurchases assure short-term returns and observe lower P/E compared to pre-buyback period. In addition, we show some interesting results that derived from industrial and services sectors. The outcome of this article would help financial analysts, financial advisors, corporate enterprises and regulatory bodies in designing policies on earnings distribution, managerial incentives, takeovers and so forth of regulatory aspects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The capital market is a creation of variety of investors who trade pecuniary assets in the form of equities, which is frictionless; however, investor’s perception technically depends on the market outlook (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2319510X13483518">Majumder, 2011</xref>). Therefore, equity market is said to be an efficient in light of corporate event announcements, such as, accounting disclosures, stock splits, share repurchases (buybacks), right issues, bonus issues, mergers, acquisitions, takeovers, open offers, dividend issues and so forth, which encloses new information<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2319510X13483518">1</xref></sup> and dissemination (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2319510X13483518">Machiraju, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2319510X13483518">Weston, Chung &amp; Hoag, 1998</xref>). All these activities in turn–influence the functioning of stock market, which is treated as a signalling effect (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2319510X13483518">Brown &amp; Warner, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2319510X13483518">Fama, Fisher, Jensen &amp; Roll, 1969</xref>). Share buyback is a corporate financial strategy, which involves capital reshuffle decisions (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483518">Benhamouda &amp; Watson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2319510X13483518">Thirumalvalavan &amp; Sunitha, 2006</xref>), takeover defensive mechanism (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2319510X13483518">Denis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483518">Ginglinger &amp; L’her, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2319510X13483518">Liang, Chan, Lai &amp; Wang, 2012</xref>) and puffiness in earnings-per-share (EPS) whilst distributing surplus cash to the shareholders (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483518">Benhamouda &amp; Watson, 2010</xref>). Indeed, undervaluation is the most important reason behind share repurchases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2319510X13483518">Ha, Hong &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>). In a theory, firms frequently make use of equity repurchases to disclose information about stock undervaluation; moreover, it is a tactic for sending a bullish signal to the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2319510X13483518">Jagannathan &amp; Stephens, 2003</xref>). In particular, ‘signaling theory proposes that the credibility of a signal from a repurchase announcement increases when managers of the repurchasing firm are themselves exposed to risk of signalling failure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2319510X13483518">Liu &amp; Gombola, 1998</xref>, p. 30). In the perspective of corporate governance, information relating to share buybacks fully disclosed to shareholders (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2319510X13483518">Hermalin &amp; Weisbach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2319510X13483518">Task Force Report, 2006</xref>). Evidently, most of the early research has documented positive signalling effect around share repurchase announcements (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483518">Comment &amp; Jarrell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2319510X13483518">Gonzālez &amp; Gonzālez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2319510X13483518">Hyderabad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2319510X13483518">Ikenberry, Lakonishok &amp; Vermaelen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2319510X13483518">Kim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2319510X13483518">Padgett &amp; Wang, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Share repurchase activity has developed radically and then fetched a major payment method since many years in the finance education, research and practice (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2319510X13483518">Hung &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2319510X13483518">Stowe, McLeavey &amp; Pinto, 2009</xref>). In our approach, if share buyback causes signalling effect, is it beneficial to the shareholders, or also causes double signalling power on the price-to-earnings (hereinafter, P/E) ratio? To address these queries, we examine 64 share repurchase programmes announced by the Indian companies during 2008–2009. We apply the event-study method to check and investigate the debate that is signalling effect or undervaluation exhibited in India? If it occurred, did Indian investors benefit from share repurchases. We thus describe that share buybacks have been absent in respect of abnormal stock earrings during post-buyback period. We also report that stock behaviour is not being a satisfactory and notice lesser as well negative returns during post-buyback; hence, assure positive returns in the short-term. At the outset, this is an exclusive Indian study from the emerging economies group, which focuses on signalling effect in light of equity buybacks. Of course, we examine P/E behaviour around buyback announcements. In addition, we suggest policy guidelines for strengthening corporate governance framework in view of repurchases.</p>
<p>Conceptually, corporate restructuring is a long-term business strategy to boost shareholder’s value in terms of ownership structure, EPS, accounting earnings and abnormal stock returns, among others (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2319510X13483518">Ray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2319510X13483518">Weston et al., 1998</xref>). It involves in two models: financial restructuring (for example, changes in the capital structure) and operational reengineering (for example, changes in the business model). Therefore, buybacks are part of the finance tactics. Thus, stock repurchase refers to the reversal of equity offerings (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2319510X13483518">Kahle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2319510X13483518">Machiraju, 2007</xref>). Moreover, it is considered as one of the classic methods to lift company’s stock price. In particular, share repurchases distribute cash to the existing shareholders in exchange of firm’s outstanding equity (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2319510X13483518">Ray, 2010</xref>). Consequently, EPS is the major indicator for stock valuation, often higher-EPS leads to increase share price (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483518">Damodaran, 2002</xref>). Further, share buybacks help firms to discover EPS based compensation targets; specifically, number of shares repurchased in a quarter is the purpose of cash flow of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2319510X13483518">Firth &amp; Yeung, 2005</xref>). However, changes in EPS and volatility in stock may influence the P/E. Therefore, we examine both stock and P/E margins in the present article.</p>
<p>Typically, shareholders get an exit opportunity at premium price over the prevailing market price, whilst firms pursue vista to reduce its equity capital. Previous studies exhibit that the motives<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2319510X13483518">2</xref></sup> behind share buybacks are boosting market perception, showing rosier financials, benefitting from tax gains and increasing the promoter’s stake (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483518">Ginglinger &amp; L’her, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2319510X13483518">Webb, 2008</xref>). In the past twenty years, there has been a meteoric rise in employing share repurchases in the U.S. from US$5 billion in 1980 to US$349 billion in 2005. By the end of March, 2010, the authorised buybacks have reached about US$68.5 billion, which is 52 per cent of the US$125 billion in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2319510X13483518">Lu, Ozdaglar &amp; Simchi-Levi, 2010</xref>). Subsequently, U.S. has become the largest market for share buybacks, followed by the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483518">Benhamouda &amp; Watson, 2010</xref>). In the Indian setting, vigorous increase in the inflow of foreign equity investments is the key factor due to the established policies that are equivalent to international markets (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2319510X13483518">Dongre, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2319510X13483518">Reddy, Nangia &amp; Agrawal, 2012</xref>). Consequently, this inimitable rise has accredited the investors, for instance, foreign institutional investors and home-based mutual funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2319510X13483518">Majumder, 2011</xref>). We then forward to present some regulatory aspects of share buybacks.</p>
<p>In India, the financial option of share repurchases has been permitted from October 31, 1998 (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2319510X13483518">Banerjee &amp; Chakraborty, 2004</xref>; [<uri>indiabudget.nic.in</uri>]). There were six buyback offers in 1999, eight in 2000 and then increased to 22 in 2008–2009. Since 1998, roughly 300 firms have been practicing buyback offers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2319510X13483518">Hyderabad, 2009</xref>). According to Thomson Reuters report, India was the fifteenth most active nation in share buybacks globally, for example, Reliance Energy’s US$885.9 million buyback offer, recorded as the biggest corporate event in Asia during 2008–2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2319510X13483518">Economic Times, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is further necessary to comprehend the Indian buyback regulatory system and its consequences as a token of subject coverage. Early 1990s, the economy functioned in an environment that has regimented by government control and regulations, later moved to a market-driven system (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2319510X13483518">Machiraju, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2319510X13483518">Reddy et al., 2012</xref>). Until the enactment of Companies (amendment) act of 1999, no company limited by shares, or no company limited by guarantee having a share capital buy its own securities unless the consequent reduction of capital has affected and sanctioned pursuant to the provisions of sections 100 to 104 and 402 of the act. However, the concept of share repurchases has been proposed in the Companies Bill, 1977. Afterward, the Companies (amendment) Ordinance of 1998 promulgated on Oct 31, 1998 containing the provisions on share buybacks, but it has not been passed. Thereafter, a new ordinance of 1999 was circulated on Jan 7, 1999. The new era of share buybacks has introduced in the Companies act of 1956 by the Companies (amendment) act, 1999 in sections 77A, 77AA and 77B. Accordingly, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued SEBI (Buyback of Securities) Regulations 1998, which is a running enactment (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2319510X13483518">Banerjee &amp; Chakraborty, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2319510X13483518">Ray, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-2319510X13483518">
<title>Motivation and Objective of the Study</title>
<p>We therefore present our motivation and objective of the study. The anonymous revolution in buybacks is considered as an opportunity to study the stock and P/E behaviour around repurchase announcements. Thus, we are strongly motivated by the studies that corroborate diverse issues on share repurchases, for instance, signalling effect, anti-takeover method, earnings performance, information disclosure in light of corporate governance and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483518">Comment &amp; Jarrell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2319510X13483518">Denis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2319510X13483518">Dittmar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2319510X13483518">Fama &amp; French, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2319510X13483518">Grullon &amp; Michaely, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2319510X13483518">Hermalin &amp; Weisbach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2319510X13483518">Hribar, Jenkins &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2319510X13483518">Hung &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2319510X13483518">Hyderabad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2319510X13483518">Jiraporn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2319510X13483518">Liang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2319510X13483518">Padgett &amp; Wang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2319510X13483518">Peyer &amp; Vermaelen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2319510X13483518">Task Force Report, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2319510X13483518">Valenti, Luce &amp; Mayfield, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-2319510X13483518">Weigand &amp; Baker, 2009</xref>). Previous Indian studies (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2319510X13483518">Thirumalvalavan &amp; Sunitha, 2006</xref>) find sturdy signalling influence that reacted more positively around given announcements. Nevertheless, they have not specified any insightful information to the investors, or stock broking firms–whether buybacks assure positive returns? In fact, no Indian study examined both stock volatility and P/E changes around repurchases. Therefore, we aim to test the significant changes in share price and P/E during pre-buyback and post-buyback period. More specifically, we offer policy guidelines on information disclosure and share buybacks in the view of corporate governance practices. In sum, our study adds some contribution to the share repurchases literature from the Asian emerging markets: India.</p>
<p>The remaining article is organised as follows. The second section presents the review of earlier literature. The third section explains method and data. The fourth section discusses signalling results. The fifth section outlines implications for corporate governance. The last section concludes the article.</p>

<title>Review of Earlier Contributions</title>
<p>To understand the consequences of signalling effect around different corporate events, we present extensive literature that is studied in western and emerging economies. Chen and Fraser (2010) estimate stock market prices in view of dividends and earnings during 1965–2006 in 10 global markets. They suggest that expected earnings have significant power in driving stock prices in the markets of the US, the UK, Japan, Korea and Malaysia, while expected dividends have relatively more influence on the indicators of Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia. In the course of share repurchases, most scholars reported on (<italic>in</italic>) developed markets, such as, the US, Canada and Japan, may have different effects in markets with different degrees of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2319510X13483518">Hung &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>). Comment and Jarrell (1991) and Vermaelen (1981) find positive abnormal returns around share repurchase announcements, which they interpret as a signal of undervaluation. In fact, subsequent scholars also indicate that undervaluation is the most frequent rationale for equity buybacks (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2319510X13483518">Dittmar, 2000</xref>). In a similar study, Peyer and Vermaelen (2009) report long-term abnormal returns as a rectification of an overreaction to bad news prior to repurchases. We thus survey both past and recent contributions on share repurchases and then presented in two groups: theoretical debate and signalling effect.</p>
<sec id="section4-2319510X13483518">
<title>Share Repurchases: A Theoretical Debate</title>
<p>Stock repurchases had gained recognition in the United States and then engulfed European countries (for example, France, Germany, Italy and the UK), Australia, New Zealand and Asian countries (for example, China, India, Japan, Malaysia and Taiwan). Thus, it is necessary to debate on various theoretical aspects that contemplate share buybacks: strategic financial decision of capital reshuffle (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483518">Benhamouda &amp; Watson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2319510X13483518">Thirumalvalavan &amp; Sunitha, 2006</xref>), dividend declaration whilst paying excess cash flow to equity investors (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2319510X13483518">Li &amp; McNally, 2007</xref>) and information discrepancy between insiders and outside owners (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2319510X13483518">Kim &amp; Varaiya, 2008</xref>). In particular, it is a takeover defensive tactic (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2319510X13483518">Denis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2319510X13483518">Dittmar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483518">Ginglinger &amp; L’her, 2006</xref>); similar studies include connotation of legal restrictions and governance issues (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483518">Cerveny, Wittlin, O’Brien &amp; Trocchio, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2319510X13483518">Gonzālez &amp; Gonzālez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2319510X13483518">Harris &amp; Ramsay, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2319510X13483518">Hung &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2319510X13483518">Jansson &amp; Larsson-Olaison, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2319510X13483518">Rau &amp; Vermaelen, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Capital structure reshuffle would be an important motivation while designing strategies for repurchases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483518">Benhamouda &amp; Watson, 2010</xref>). Indeed, stock repurchases allow the firm to buy back its own outstanding stock, adjusting the firm’s capital structure as well board composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2319510X13483518">Webb, 2008</xref>). In particular, these programmes are greater news when foreign institutional investors support a firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483518">Ginglinger &amp; L’her, 2006</xref>). In exceptional cases, shareholders do not favour management using surplus cash flows, although it may not distress the net present value of a firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2319510X13483518">Jensen, 1986</xref>). Typically, excess capital utilised to buy back outstanding equity shares thus result in a positive market reaction. A firm usually repurchases its stock through open market at prevailing market value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2319510X13483518">Webb, 2008</xref>). Open market repurchases method is flexible; hence, it becomes an effective tool for administration purposes. These programmes typically take place over a period of one year or more and the firm can buy its own stock when they judge that it is undervalued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2319510X13483518">Stephens &amp; Weisbach, 1998</xref>). Li and McNally (2007) document that most organisations are likely to go for share buybacks, if they have superior free cash flows, lesser market-to-book ratio, weaker prior stock performance and insiders large shareholdings. Therefore, announcement returns strongly related to the private information possessed by company insiders. In this issue, Kim and Varaiya (2008) examine insider-timing assumption by inspecting insiders trading activities during share buybacks trading. They suspect that information discrepancy between insiders and outside owners of a buyback firm would create asymmetric prospects for insiders to do their trades in a period when the firm is truly engaged in buyback trading.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2319510X13483518">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most buyback firms tend to be hefty and have greater disbursement ratio, which may lead to distributing surplus cash to equity owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483518">Benhamouda &amp; Watson, 2010</xref>); thus, Kahle (2002) evidence that larger offers attract superior market response. Firms in the US have become less payout entities, but it has corresponded with a spectacular rise in share repurchases during 1978–1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2319510X13483518">Fama &amp; French, 2001</xref>); hence, firms engage in repurchases trading more actively when the price falls in the issue market. Jansson and Larsson-Olaison (2010) state that Swedish firms do not repurchase stock to distribute excess cash, or fend off takeovers; hence, they do inaddition to dividends but not substitute. In a similar argument, buybacks are typically less profitable as there is no new capital coming into the firm, because they have the longest investment duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2319510X13483518">Cumming &amp; Johan, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2319510X13483518">4</xref></sup> In the subject of defensive strategy, Denis (1990) examines the defensive changes in the corporate payout policy. Repurchase is an effective method for countering the hostile takeovers, as there is a high probability of the target firm maintaining independence. Likewise, buybacks may reduce the likelihood of a takeover and trigger a decrease in firm value, thus likely to strengthen the controlling shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483518">Ginglinger &amp; L’her, 2006</xref>). In a different motive, Dittmar (2000) suggests that buybacks use to counter the dilution effect of management and employee stock options.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gonzālez and Gonzālez (2004) analyse the consequences of legal restrictions on the size of repurchase programme. They suggest that the obligation of a boundary on the amount of common stock favours the use of open market repurchases (OMRs), compared to other methods such as tender offer repurchases (TORs) and Dutch actions (DAs). Hence, TORs and DAs are notably larger than OMRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483518">Comment &amp; Jarrell, 1991</xref>). In the cross-county aspects, Rau and Vermaelen (2002) and Rees (1996) document that UK buyback activities have lesser abnormal returns compared to the U.S. firms. Hence, there are two important factors causing lesser returns: the UK regulatory environment discourages share buybacks to take advantage of an undervalued stock price and many buyback programmes setup to allow pension funds to earn tax credits (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2319510X13483518">Rau &amp; Vermaelen, 2002</xref>). Harris and Ramsay (1995) discuss the implications for regulating buybacks in the Australian market. Conversely, Gonzālez and Gonzālez (2004) describe that prevalence of corporate governance would be a motivation for examining stock reaction around buybacks in the Spanish market. Webb (2008) examines the relationship between the extent of share repurchases and measures of corporate governance in the banking industry. Webb also states that corporate governance plays a vital role in both the market response and strategic decisions. In the relevant issues of regulatory governance, Cerveny et al. (2010) find that changes in legal provisions affect buybacks in various aspects. Generally, in a theory, buybacks are guided by the intrinsic value of the share, which is privileged than the market price, when management purses the shares to be undervalued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2319510X13483518">Hung &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>). However, for some companies, total cash distributions (dividends and repurchases) may be a more practical measure of return to investors than dividends alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2319510X13483518">Stowe et al., 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2319510X13483518">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In sum, repurchase is a strategic finance choice, which is a strong motivational factor in various long-term business decisions: capital reshuffle (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2319510X13483518">Baker, Powell &amp; Veit, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483518">Benhamouda &amp; Watson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2319510X13483518">Dixon, Palmer, Stradling &amp; Woodhead, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2319510X13483518">Webb, 2008</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2319510X13483518">6</xref></sup> signalling share undervaluation (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483518">Crawford &amp; Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2319510X13483518">Ikenberry, Lakonishok &amp; Vermaelen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2319510X13483518">Ikenberry &amp; Vermaelen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2319510X13483518">Wansley, Lane &amp; Sarkar, 1989</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2319510X13483518">7</xref></sup> distributing surplus cash flows (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2319510X13483518">Li &amp; McNally, 2007</xref>), reducing agency costs (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2319510X13483518">Jensen, 1986</xref>), takeover defensive strategy (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2319510X13483518">Denis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2319510X13483518">Dittmar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483518">Ginglinger &amp; L’her, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2319510X13483518">Liang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2319510X13483518">Neuhauser, Davidson &amp; Glascock, 2011</xref>) and avoid dividend taxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2319510X13483518">Baker et al., 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2319510X13483518">8</xref></sup> In Dittmar’s (2000) view, motive behind repurchases depends upon the firm specific situation.

<title>Share Repurchases and Signalling Effect: The Empirical Debate</title>
<p>We thus report our understanding on the signalling effect around repurchase announcements that has examined in various institutional settings. Theoretically, signalling power is the key elucidation for firms’ buyback activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2319510X13483518">Ikenberry et al., 1995</xref>) and information is the most regularly encountered justification for stock repurchases causes signalling hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2319510X13483518">Stephens &amp; Weisbach, 1998</xref>). Signalling effect consists in the swell of positive, or negative, when the investors could not discriminate the value of firm’s outlay opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2319510X13483518">Gonzālez &amp; Gonzālez, 2004</xref>). However, price reactions to the announcement in the last decade appear to be less sympathetic compared to previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483518">Ginglinger &amp; L’her, 2006</xref>). Of course, volatility of stock price is the meticulous risk faced by investors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2319510X13483518">Kim, 2007</xref>) and individual stock return volatility was more than doubled during 1962–1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483518">Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel &amp; Xu, 2001</xref>). We describe the prominent reviews in light of signalling effect (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2319510X13483518">Bartov, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483518">Comment &amp; Jarrell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2319510X13483518">Grullon &amp; Michaely, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2319510X13483518">Kahle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2319510X13483518">Kim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2319510X13483518">Li &amp; McNally, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2319510X13483518">Padgett &amp; Wang, 2007</xref>). In the Indian context, very few scholars focus on stock earnings around equity repurchases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2319510X13483518">CNI, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2319510X13483518">Hyderabad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2319510X13483518">Thirumalvalavan &amp; Sunitha, 2006</xref>). Thereafter, we also have reviewed special studies on bank buybacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2319510X13483518">Webb, 2008</xref>) and the impact on accounting performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2319510X13483518">Evans &amp; Evans, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Bartov (1991) analyzes 150 announcements during 1986–1992, find that buyback firms have higher book-to-market ratio and higher proportion of institutional investors. In particular, Comment and Jarrell (1991) investigate the signalling hypotheses and examine three methods of repurchasing stock, <italic>tender offers, Dutch auction and open market repurchases</italic>. They exhibit that fixed-price tender offers signalling the most information to investors and least in case of open market repurchases. Oyon, Markides and Ittner (1994) examine 41 US offers during 1971–1985, thus firms re-buying their shares do have a raise in earnings in the offer-year and firms that make tender offer, do not have earnings augment in the years following the buyback. Similarly, Ikenberry et al. (1995) hypothesise that stock repurchases primarily serve as a signalling mechanism and thereby provide new information; study 1,239 open market repurchases announced between 1980 and 1990. They indicate that investing in stock repurchase companies evidenced 12.1 per cent abnormal returns over 4 years. For the US, Grullon and Michaely (2002) test the substitution effect between dividends and share repurchases for 15,843 firms during 1972–2000, thus average payout ratio was relatively constant in spite of decline in the dividend-payout ratio. Interestingly, Kahle (2002) examines how stock options affect the decision to repurchases. Kahle finds that managers repurchase to maximise their own wealth and fund employee stock options.</p>
<p>Conversely, Kim (2007, p. 332) study the changes in daily return volatility associated with 905 open market offers during 1990–1992. Thus, firms actively buy back their shares when the price falls that reduce daily return volatility. Li and McNally (2007) inspect the determinants of firms’ repurchase decision and the market reaction during 1987–2000. They find that market reacts more positively when stocks are undervalued and initiates new repurchase programmes. Chua (2010) shows that mean cumulative market-adjusted returns for the period [0, +1] and [–1, +1] is substantial at 1.25 per cent and 1.33 per cent respectively; whereas, weakly-performed firms exhibit the positive and significant for the period [0, +1]. More recently, Liang et al. (2012) studies the 4,285 offers in the US during 1990–2006. They find that motive for repurchases alter depending on the firm’s lifecycle stage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-2319510X13483518">10</xref></sup> Specifically, a firm in the growth stage tends to pursue a buyback plan to signal its undervalued stock; whereas a firm in the mature stage is prone to repurchase to distribute surplus free cash flows. In fact, Liang et al. find five-day abnormal return was about 3.44 per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-2319510X13483518">11</xref></sup> Likewise, Chen and Wang (2012) investigate 4,710 US repurchases between 1990 and 2007. They find that both initial and long run stock price reactions are significantly less favourable for constrained firms than for unconstrained. They also display inferior post-buyback abnormal returns for constrained compared to unconstrained firms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-2319510X13483518">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, for the UK, Padgett and Wang (2007) inspect the short-term signalling power of open market share repurchases during 1999–2004. The 5-day (1.13 per cent) and 11-day (1.21 per cent) abnormal returns are statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-2319510X13483518">13</xref></sup> For France, Ginglinger and L’her (2006) evaluate 363 repurchases during 1998–1999. They find positive market reaction; hence, it depends upon the corporate governance and market structure measures. They also observe overall positive reaction of 0.57 per cent (0, +1). For Spain, Gonzālez and Gonzālez (2004) analyse 58 open market repurchases and 24 sellbacks. They notice 1.74 per cent of abnormal returns (–1, +1), 2.04 per cent (–2, +2) and 1.95 per cent (–3, +3).</p>
<p>Contrary to the above observations, Stephens and Weisbach (1998) observe negative abnormal returns during the period preceding buyback programme, which indicates that firms normally buy back when their stock price is undervalued. For Malaysia, Ramakrishnan, Ravindran and Ganisen (2007) assess share buybacks during 1999–2006 and find positive effects to share prices during buyback and after buyback contrasted to pre-buyback. Firth and Yeung (2005) examine various characteristics of open market share buybacks in Hong Kong. They suggest that firms initiating buybacks have excess cash flow and are undervalued. They also find that market-adjusted returns contiguous the first share buyback are a task of undervaluation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-2319510X13483518">14</xref></sup>. In Taiwanese market, Hung and Chen (2010, p. 109) analyse the undervaluation of 1,145 repurchases during 2000–2006. They explore that higher the upper bound of the declared price range announced, the more undervalued the stock price and the more certainly the market reacts afterward, especially in the long-term.</p>
<p>Particularly in bank-related firms, Webb (2008) has undertaken 224 repurchases during 2002–2004 and exhibits positive signalling. Webb has reported 0.85 per cent of AAR on 0 window, conversely CAR is 0.41 per cent. In the subject of accounting performance, Evans and Evans (2001) compare accounting performance of repurchasing companies and non-repurchasing companies. They notice that performance of repurchasing companies fails to improve in the post-announcement period.</p>
<p>In the Indian context, we found few scholars that investigate share repurchases in the aftermath of SEBI (Buyback of Shares) Regulations, 1998. Thirumalvalavan and Sunitha (2006) test the signalling effect of buyback and dividend announcements for 22 firms during 2002–2004, find abnormal returns across various repurchase levels. Their results describe that market was reacted more favourably to repurchases compared to dividends. An individual research organisation, CNI (2009) examines 22 buybacks during 2008–2009. CNI corroborate that 50 per cent of the companies have reported their post-buyback share prices decline by 50 per cent. In the recent past, Hyderabad (2009) considers 68 repurchases, reports that AAR is 2.83 per cent and CAR is 6 per cent on the announcement date.</p>
<p>However, at the outset, it is our job to find what the knowledge gap in the aforementioned literate is. First, we have not found much empirical work on share buybacks with respect to Indian market; in fact, an extensive literature (we did in this article). Second, both western and emerging literatures do not examine the P/E behaviour around share repurchase announcements. Thus, we study P/E behaviour in our article. In addition, we study sector-wise signalling. Lastly, we try to establish a connection between signalling and corporate governance and offer lawful implications for institutional progress.</p>

<title>Signalling Hypotheses Development</title>
<p>With this literature backdrop, we develop signalling hypotheses to counterpart the objective of the study. In a practice, firms persuade investors in view of undervaluation of their share price; therefore, it is imperative to study the signalling effect of repurchase announcements. The signalling hypotheses<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-2319510X13483518">15</xref></sup> imply new and affirmative information about the firm’s future earnings prospects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2319510X13483518">Hung &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-2319510X13483518">16</xref></sup> For instance, ‘research has shown that equity cash flows–dividends, share repurchases and equity issues–are perceived by investors as signals of management’s assessment of a firm’s performance and prospects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2319510X13483518">Dixon et al., 2008</xref>, p. 889). Earlier scholars have shown that there exist positive abnormal returns around such announcements (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483518">Comment &amp; Jarrell, 1991</xref>). Whereas the majority of earlier research pursued various theories on share buybacks, such as, ‘information signalling hypotheses’ (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2319510X13483518">Ikenberry et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2319510X13483518">Peyer &amp; Vermaelen, 2009</xref>) and ‘free cash flow hypotheses’ (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2319510X13483518">Grullon &amp; Michaely, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-2319510X13483518">17</xref></sup> More specifically, information signalling hypotheses suggests that the firm has an enticement to repurchase their own stock as a better self-investment when their share price is undervalued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2319510X13483518">Liang et al., 2012</xref>).

On the other hand, we also found some recent studies that use market index for estimating expected returns (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2319510X13483518">Reddy, Nangia &amp; Agrawal, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we use BSE-SENSEX Index as a market index to estimate market returns.</p>
<p>We compute simple returns using the following standard formulae (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2319510X13483518">Hyderabad, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics for Stock Returns and P/E</title>
<p>Share repurchases typically regarded as a good signal to the stock market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2319510X13483518">Liang et al., 2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-2319510X13483518">21</xref></sup> Empirically, these announcements report abnormal returns around 2 per cent to 3 per cent (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483518">Comment &amp; Jarrell, 1991</xref>). Most event studies compute simple and market-adjusted returns around repurchase announcements. In the Malaysian market, Ramakrishna et al. (2007) found positive effects of price returns during- and post-buyback compared to pre-buyback period. In case of India, Hyderabad (2009) notices that AAR on the date of announcement is 2.83 per cent, while CAR is about 6 per cent. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2319510X13483518">Table 2</xref> shows descriptive statistics for stock returns (see Panel A) and P/E changes (see Panel B). We find that stock returns during post-buyback tumbled as well negative that can be observed on -3rd window (1.36 per cent) and – 1st window (0.21 per cent) compared to +1 and +3 windows.</p>

<p><bold>Notes:</bold> AAR refers to average abnormal returns and CAR refers to cumulative abnormal returns; NFPR refers to number of firms with positive returns; of course, we have included ‘zero value’; No. (Number) of observations are equal in both stock returns and P/E changes.</p>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Interestingly, a highest stock return (1.36 per cent) is noticed during pre-buyback. Further, we observe AAR and CAR during both the periods. AAR reports extremely a good result on -3rd window (1.49 per cent) and – 1st window (0.31 per cent). It thus infers that stock has greatly performed compared to market returns. In contrast, AAR has fell-down by 0.73 per cent and 1.04 per cent on +1st and +3rd windows respectively during post-buyback. Similarly, CAR results as good as AAR in the respective windows. However, we suspect that the post-buyback investor sentiments have not been sympathetic with buyback offering companies in India, because repurchases strategically help in rebuilding the capital structure to prevent takeovers from rivalry firms and facilitate to increase proprietors stake in the firm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2319510X13483518">Figure 1</xref> shows graphical picture on stock returns, AAR and P/E changes.</p>

</fig>
<p>We therefore discuss P/E changes. Stock performance shows lower returns; similarly, P/E also has affected. We observe that P/E during pre-buyback, which is on – 3rd and – 1st windows report higher change compared to +1 and +3 windows (0.72 per cent, 0.38 per cent, 0.10 per cent and –0.26 per cent respectively). If we observe closely both stock and P/E changes during post-buyback (for example, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2319510X13483518">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2319510X13483518">Figure 1</xref>), thus P/E has seriously affected compared to stock returns. Additionally, we also have shown number of firms with positive returns. Of course, it would be concrete evidence on buyback programmes in emerging nations like India. In other words, a share repurchase also influences the P/E behaviour (not only stock) around a given announcement. Therefore, it is proven that there would be significant P/E signalling during post-buyback.</p>
<p>We then forward to test the hypotheses. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2319510X13483518">Table 3</xref> depicts the results for one-way analysis of variance with respect to stock returns and P/E changes. We further divide the outcome into four panels, Panel A, B, C and D. Panel A describes inference with regard to pre-buyback stock returns. Thus, P-value 0.19607 is greater than the significant α level 0.05 (at 95 per cent confidence level). As a result, we accept the null hypothesis (H1) and interpret that there is no significant mean difference among stock returns during pre-buyback period. Panel B outlines the result of post-buyback stock returns and find that P-value is greater than α level 0.05, that is 0.42976. Therefore, we accept the null hypothesis (H2) and infer that there is no significant difference among the means of stock returns during post-buyback.</p>

<p>Conversely, Panel C and Panel D describe P/E changes in both the periods respectively. Likewise Panel A and B, we observe similar changes for P/E. In the Panel C and D, P-value is greater than α level 0.05, that is 0.82203 and 0.43288 respectively. We also accept the null hypothesis in case of P/E (H3 and H4) and infer that there is no significant difference among the means of P/E changes in both the periods. In this setting, one could conclude that share repurchase programmes not only influence the stock prices but also cause the P/E signalling around announcements. In addition to the above results, we also compute Pearson’s correlation; however, significant results have not been found.</p>

<p>In Group A, we observe that the stock returns in IPM during pre-buyback are healthier compared to postbuyback. It is noticed that 0.96 per cent of stock returns on -3rd window, which is the highest stock return; similarly, P/E turned positively. During post-buyback period, P/E has declined by 29.03 per cent on +70th window, which is noticed a highest collapse in the sector. Group B shows services sector performance during both the periods. Stock returns on – 3rd and – 1st windows, that is 2.14 per cent and 0.82 per cent is higher than +1 and +3 windows during post-buyback; similar results reported for P/E in the respective periods. In addition, we also have shown number of firms with positive returns. Among these results, IT&amp;FS has performed extremely vigorous compared to IPM during both the periods. In brief, share buybacks have affected the industrial sector negatively, though service sector has shown subordinate results especially during post-buyback. Therefore, we confer that services sector repurchases usually outperform the industrial sector. However, our results are strictly restricted to India.</p>

<title>Implications for Corporate Governance</title>
<p>We found few studies that exclusively focus on share repurchases and corporate governance. Hence, we do not establish any object that corporate governance affects share repurchases and vice-a-versa. Thus, we recommend the following studies that are based in Singapore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2319510X13483518">Chua, 2010</xref>), Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2319510X13483518">Jansson &amp; Larsson-Olaison, 2010</xref>) and the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2319510X13483518">Kim &amp; Varaiya, 2008</xref>), which imparts the knowledge on information disclosure, repurchase announcements and corporate governance practices.

<p>To instruct the awareness on share buybacks and corporate governance, Jiraporn (2006) states that firms tend to repurchase less stock where shareholder rights are weaker. The author also argues that firms with weak shareholder rights are better able to develop and preserve more cash within the firm. Kim and Varaiya (2008) describe that insufficient disclosure on open market share repurchases in the US; in most cases, outside shareholders have no knowledge of whether their firm employs repurchase trades. They also evidence that insiders do increase the net number of shares sold in a quarter, when the firm engaged in share buyback trading.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-2319510X13483518">22</xref></sup> Webb (2008) examines the relationship between stock repurchases and corporate governance on 224 firms during 2002–2004. Board structure and executive stock ownership do not influence the market response. In particular, insider equity has less influence on repurchases. In a recent study, Jansson and Larsson-Olaison (2010) suggest that corporate governance affect stock repurchasing behaviour. They suggest that diversity in national and firm-level corporate governance consider in order to accurately assessing the outcomes of regulatory reforms. In a relevant observation, Hung and Chen (2010) explore a weaker signalling power of the legal price range, because repurchasing firms usually set the price range based on their own specific considerations, but not on the legal criteria. More recently, Chen and Wang (2012) describe that buybacks result a decline in corporate liquidity for repurchasing firms, whereas for constrained firms, reduced liquidity can be detrimental to shareholders wealth. Specifically, Hermalin and Weisbach (2012, p. 220) argue that healthier disclosure requirements may exaggerate agency problems and allied costs, including executive rewards. Further, improved disclosure provides benefits, but it also entails costs, for example, executive pay and the distortions in managerial behaviour.</p>
<p>With this literature support, we suggest some lawful policy guidelines for Indian regulatory framework in the view of share repurchases. In the given country perspective, corporate governance related listing requirements are largely based on the recommendations of the Cadbury and Higgs Reports and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Further, improvements in corporate governance practices seem mostly to be a voluntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2319510X13483518">Task Force Report, 2006</xref>). Moreover, this agenda has undergone a stretched drive from ratifying the Companies Act, 1956 through the Companies Bill, 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2319510X13483518">Singh, Kumar &amp; Uzma, 2011</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-2319510X13483518">23</xref></sup> and New Companies Act 2011–2012. The Task Force Report also states that share buybacks must disclose full-information to the given shareholders. We thus observe that buybacks and corporate governance is a new research paradigm observed in the recent years, which has examined by few academic scholars, committees and groups. Therefore, Indian scholars have greater opportunity to focus on the emerging issues that are relevant to governance at large: shareholding pattern, information transparency and disclosure on buyback programmes, insider trading,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-2319510X13483518">24</xref></sup> announcements and stock returns. For instance, the given country should amend key securities laws relating to insider trading, corporate ownership and institutional ownership pattern, among others, which can be similar to Malaysia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2319510X13483518">Kadir &amp; Muhamad, 2012</xref>). In fact, it can be practiced internally and externally while commencing share repurchases, thus may help regulators while investigating scandals, wrong information and insider trading activities. On the other hand, a better corporate payout policy in financial restructuring models like repurchases or dividends, would control insider activity and improve firms’ earnings and managerial incentives, as well (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2319510X13483518">Douglas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-2319510X13483518">Weigand &amp; Baker, 2009</xref>). Lastly, it is important that advanced corporate governance policies, rules or regulations are essential both for high firm performance and for public good (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2319510X13483518">Valenti et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, there must be a ‘comprehensive corporate governance mechanism’ for dealing major financial restructuring events, such as, acquisitions and takeovers (for example, Indian Takeover Code, a review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2319510X13483518">Reddy, Nangia &amp; Agarawal, 2011</xref>), valuation guidelines (for example, as suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2319510X13483518">Reddy, Agrawal &amp; Nangia, 2013</xref>) and related matters of ownership structure, board meetings and corporate disclosures.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Share repurchases have become one of the important research areas in corporate finance discipline, which imparts strong considerations for strategic corporate policy. Since 1998, many Indian firms have announced significant number of share buyback programmes. We therefore examined the signalling effect (both stock returns and P/E ratio) around share repurchase announcements. In our study, we find that buyback offers have not been showed significant abnormal stock earrings during post-buyback period. More specifically, we study the effect of given announcements in both industrial and services sectors. Further, it concludes that lower stock returns are observed during post-event windows of industrial sector whereas similar stock returns are reported in both pre- and post-buyback for services sector. Of course, we strongly accept earlier studies and suggest that Indian buyback announcement results found to be lower as well negative during post-event days but assure positive returns in the short-term (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483518">Ginglinger &amp; L’her, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2319510X13483518">Padgett &amp; Wang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2319510X13483518">Ramakrishnan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2319510X13483518">Thirumalvalavan &amp; Sunitha, 2006</xref>). By contrast, lower abnormal returns and P/E are reported during post-buyback period. We then conclude that buybacks offered by Indian-based listed firms assure short-term returns and observe lower P/E in the aftermath of announcements. Our study has strong implications to the existing literature on share buybacks. In addition (as a part of academic research), we have suggested few legal guidelines for improving the corporate governance framework in the view of information disclosure and insider trading that corroborates the given share repurchases.</p>
<p>Authors thus put forward some limitations to the study. First, the work presented in this article has considered the period of two years, that is 2008–2009. Second, sample is a limitation; due to less number of buyback firms, we have limited scope to generalise the results in industry-wise, though results are reported in sector-wise, that is industrial and services sectors. Lastly, we have not been performed any statistical tests for sector-wise/industry-wise results due to less sample size (for example, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2319510X13483518">Table 1</xref>). However, a strategic intent behind share repurchases in the Indian capital market, factors that affect lower returns during post-buyback period, which deserve future research. In fact, most academic literature on share repurchases does not focus on valuation, thus focusing on institutional features and other important economic issues, such as, agency effect and taxation effects of post-repurchases are some of the thrust areas for doing further research (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2319510X13483518">Stowe et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, scholars can investigate the essential areas in corporate finance, for example, regarding stock signalling which is the most powerful financial restructuring announcement from a given set of activities: accounting disclosures, buybacks, dividends, mergers, acquisitions and takeovers.</p>
