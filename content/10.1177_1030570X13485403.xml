<abstract>
<p>This article critically evaluates what Vatican II taught about other living faiths in four documents: the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (<italic>Sacrosanctum Concilium</italic>, 1963), the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (<italic>Lumen Gentium</italic>, 1964), the Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions (<italic>Nostra Aetate</italic>,1965) and the Decree on the Church’s Missionary Activity (<italic>Ad Gentes</italic>, 1965). Too often those who consider Vatican II’s attention to other faiths consider only <italic>Nostra Aetate</italic>. Beyond question, that declaration was central in importance and impact. Nevertheless, the three other documents just mentioned fill out the Council’s integral teaching on the religious ‘others’. The last and longest text from Vatican II, the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (<italic>Gaudium et Spes</italic><bold><italic>,</italic></bold> 1965), also adds some further, significant considerations. But space precludes examining it in this article.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>It would be a mistake to limit the Second Vatican Council’s teaching on other faiths to what was said explicitly. Right from the first document to be promulgated, the Council showed a mindset that encompassed the whole of humanity.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1030570X13485403"><title>Sacrosanctum Concilium (SC)</title>
<p>From the opening article of <italic>SC</italic>, Vatican II presented its renewal of the Church’s liturgy within the context of the entire human race (<italic>SC</italic> 1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1030570X13485403">2</xref></sup> The second article reflected a similar concern. Through the liturgy and especially through the Eucharist, ‘the faithful express and <italic>manifest to others</italic> the mystery of Christ and the genuine nature of the Church’. As well as feeding their spiritual lives and bringing them to ‘the fullness of Christ’, the Eucharist ‘strengthens their power to <italic>preach Christ</italic> and thus show forth <italic>to those who are outside</italic> the Church as a sign lifted up among the nations under which the scattered children of God may be gathered into one’ (<italic>SC</italic> 2; italics mine).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1030570X13485403">3</xref></sup> From the start, <italic>SC</italic> represented the Eucharist as <italic>also</italic> involving an open desire to ‘preach Christ’ and ‘manifest his mystery’ to the world.</p>
<p>Continuing in the same vein, <italic>SC</italic> quoted the classic New Testament text about God wanting ‘all human beings to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth’ (1 Tim 2:4). It referred then to Christ appearing as ‘the Mediator between God and human beings’ (1 Tim 2:5), and summed up his work as ‘redeeming human kind and giving perfect glory to God’ (<italic>SC</italic> 5). Over and over again the opening chapter of <italic>SC</italic> revealed the same encompassing vision and desire that ‘all human beings should know the one true God and Jesus Christ whom he had sent’ (<italic>SC</italic> 6).</p>
<p>Given the world-encompassing mindset of our document, it is not surprising that it mandated the restoration of the ‘prayer of the faithful’, an old tradition that had never been given up in the East, but that had disappeared in the Roman liturgy, except on Good Friday.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1030570X13485403">4</xref></sup> This prayer was to be restored ‘after the gospel and homily, especially on Sundays and holidays of obligation’. Recalling in a footnote 1 Timothy 2:1–2 (which enjoins a similar form of prayer), <italic>SC</italic> explained: ‘by this prayer in which the people are to take part, intercessions are to be made for the holy Church, for those who lead us politically, for those weighed down by various needs, <italic>for all human beings, and for the salvation of the entire world</italic>’ (<italic>SC</italic> 53; italics mine). This text encouraged Catholics to worship in solidarity with the entire world and become actively concerned about the salvation of all people.</p>
<p>Before leaving <italic>SC</italic>, we should note a text that has largely escaped even scholarly attention. Many experts on Christianity and other religions seem to have remained unaware that an image, with which the Council began its teaching on the Divine Office (ch. 4), is particularly significant for their area of specialization. The liturgy constitution opened this chapter by saying: ‘Jesus Christ, the High Priest of the New and Eternal Covenant, when he assumed a human nature, introduced into this land of exile the hymn that in heaven is sung throughout all ages. He unites the whole community of human kind with himself and associates it with him in singing the divine canticle of praise’ (<italic>SC</italic> 83). Earlier <italic>SC</italic> had taught that the risen Christ is present ‘when the Church prays <italic>and sings</italic>’ (<italic>SC</italic> 7; italics mine). Now the document speaks of singing one ‘divine canticle of praise’, led by the incarnate ‘Cantor’ himself, who gathers together the whole human race to share in this heavenly hymn that he has brought to earth. Christ is pictured here as associating with himself not merely those who know and believe in him but also the entire human community. Together they all form a choir, of which he is the leader. The Cosmic Choirmaster unites with himself the baptized and non-baptized alike. Even those who have never heard his name are mysteriously but, through grace, truly in the hands of Christ the Choirmaster of the world.</p>
<p>As regards other living faiths, the teaching of <italic>SC</italic> remained largely implicit, and was not as dramatically challenging as what came two years later in the declaration on ‘Non-Christian Religions’. Nevertheless, right from the first text promulgated by the Council, we can see how the salvation of all humanity stood high in the vision and agenda of the bishops and their advisors at Vatican II.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1030570X13485403"><title>Lumen Gentium (LG)</title>
<p>Before we come to the key articles in <italic>LG</italic> about the ‘religious others’, we should pause to retrieve two items from chapter 1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1030570X13485403">5</xref></sup> First, in richly biblical language that chapter emphasized the sacramental reality of the Church, from which ‘shines’ the ‘light’ of Christ and which is ‘the sign and instrument of intimate communion with God and of unity among the whole human race’ (<italic>LG</italic> 1). The opening words were obviously meant to evoke the strikingly universalistic texts of Second and Third Isaiah (40–55 and 56–66, respectively) about foreign peoples to whom divine salvation is extended and who join themselves to Israel. It is in these terms that a poem pictures the glorious restoration of Jerusalem: ‘Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you… Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn’ (Isa 60:1, 3). With the two words that became its title (‘The Light of the Nations’), <italic>LG</italic> signalled its universal outlook. The short, opening article pressed on to underline this mindset by introducing five equivalent expressions for ‘the nations’: ‘all human beings’, ‘every creature’, ‘the whole human race’, ‘the whole world’ and – once again – ‘all human beings’. Chapter 7 discloses the same universal mindset; it looks forward to the whole human race, along with the universe itself, being finally renewed in and through the risen Christ (<italic>LG</italic> 48).</p>
<p>Second, when interpreting the way of salvation for ‘the others’, a distinction (but not a separation) between the Church and the Kingdom of God is vital.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1030570X13485403">6</xref></sup> Speaking of ‘the people of God’, the constitution recognized the purpose of the Church to be that of embodying ‘the Kingdom of God which God himself has begun on earth’ and ‘will complete at the end of time’ (<italic>LG</italic> 9). Here and in article 5, Vatican II distinguished (but did not separate) the Church from the Kingdom of God, and so recognized how the Kingdom forms the more encompassing reality and how the Church is there to serve the Kingdom, and not vice versa.</p>
<p>The key responses in <italic>LG</italic> to questions about understanding ‘the religious others’ in the light of Christian faith came with articles 16 and 17. An earlier article (<italic>LG</italic> 13) had framed the scope of what would be said there. Holding in faith that, through Christ’s redeeming work, ‘all human beings are called to the new People of God’, the Council reflected on how, ‘in different ways’, they ‘belong (<italic>pertinent</italic>)’ or ‘are ordered (<italic>ordinantur</italic>) to catholic unity’. This is true, no matter whether ‘they are Catholic faithful, or others who believe in Christ, or lastly all human beings without exception (<italic>omnes universaliter homines</italic>), called by God’s grace to salvation’ (<italic>LG</italic> 16). Thomas Aquinas had prompted this language about all members of the human race being ‘ordered’ variously to ‘catholic unity’ under the universal headship of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1030570X13485403">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In considering how the final group, ‘those who have not yet received the Gospel’, ‘are ordered to the People of God for different reasons’, our document distinguishes (a) Jews, (b) Muslims, (c) other believers in God and (d) all those who, through no fault of their own, have not yet come to an explicit knowledge of God (<italic>LG</italic> 16)<italic>.</italic> For the first time in the history of Catholic Christianity, an ecumenical council spoke positively of Jews and Muslims. Meeting soon after the failure of the fifth and final (major) crusade, the Second Council of Lyons (1274) had described ‘the Saracens’ as ‘blasphemous’, ‘faithless’ and ‘the impious enemies of the Christian name’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1030570X13485403">8</xref></sup> Almost two centuries later in its notorious 1442 Decree for the Copts, the Council of Florence, in an extreme expression of the principle of ‘outside the Church no salvation’, consigned to damnation ‘pagans’, Jews, heretics and schismatics. This council presumed that those who did not accept and follow the message of Christ were guilty and so excluded from eternal salvation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1030570X13485403">9</xref></sup> The Second Vatican Council, however, not only avoided this presupposition but also avoided ever speaking of ‘pagans’, ‘heretics’ and ‘schismatics’.</p>
<p>As regards (a) Jews, <italic>LG</italic> first selected some of the privileges listed by Romans 9:4–5 to speak of ‘the people to whom the covenants and promises were given and from whom Christ was born according to the flesh’. Then it aligned itself with Paul in stating that ‘according to the [divine] election, they [the Jews] are a people most dear on account of the fathers; for the gifts and calling of God are without regret (Rom 11:28–29)’ (<italic>LG</italic> 16). Before Vatican II, no ecumenical council had either cited those two passages from Romans or spoken well of Jews. Now, prompted by Pope John XXIII and other friends of the Jewish people, and aiming to proscribe effectively any anti-Semitism, the Council found its scriptural warrant in the classical texts of Paul about God’s irrevocable election of Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1030570X13485403">10</xref></sup> In the longer treatment of the Jewish people that appeared a year later in <italic>Nostra Aetate</italic> (<italic>NA</italic>), the Council once again quoted Romans 9:4–5 (<italic>NA</italic> 4) and in a reference to Romans 11:28–29 recalled the use of that verse in <italic>LG</italic> 16 (<italic>NA</italic> 4, fn. 11). Beyond question, what is said about Judaism in <italic>NA</italic> is longer and more significant – especially in view of the emerging Catholic–Jewish dialogue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1030570X13485403">11</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the decisive step towards rapprochement had already been taken in <italic>LG</italic>.</p>
<p>Vatican II was likewise the first council of Catholic Christianity to offer some positive teaching on (b) Muslims. It was a teaching that highlighted common ground: the divine ‘plan of salvation also embraces those who acknowledge the Creator, in the first place among whom are the Muslims. They profess to hold the faith of Abraham, and together with us they adore the one, merciful God who will judge human beings on the last day’ (<italic>LG</italic> 16). While describing Muslims as those ‘who profess to hold the faith of Abraham’ rather than simply state that they hold the faith of Abraham, the Council agreed that they ‘acknowledge the Creator’, ‘adore with us the one, merciful God’ and also share with Christians the expectation of a general judgment ‘on the last day’. A year later in its declaration on ‘Non-Christian Religions’, Vatican II would fill out its positive view of Islam (<italic>NA</italic> 3). Nevertheless, <italic>LG</italic> had already taken a first step towards rapprochement.</p>
<p>After the Muslims, <italic>LG</italic> turned to (c) other believers in God: ‘nor is this God distant from others who in shadows and images seek the unknown God, since to all he gives life and breath and all things (see Acts 17:25–28) and [since] the Saviour wishes all human beings to be saved (see 1 Tim 2:4).’ Because God is both the Creator who gives life to all human beings and the Saviour who wishes all to be saved, Vatican II held that the divine presence also embraces all God-seekers, even if it is ‘in shadows and images’ that they seek ‘the unknown God’. Hence ‘those who through no fault [of their own] do not know Christ’s Gospel and his Church and who, nevertheless, seek God with a sincere heart and under the influence of grace try in their actions to fulfil his will made known through the dictate of their conscience – these too may obtain eternal salvation’ (<italic>LG</italic> 16).</p>
<p>We come here to two key biblical passages, one firmly lodged in the tradition and the other making an appearance for the first time. First, 1 Timothy 2:4 had been echoed in a remarkable letter by Pope Gregory VII to a Muslim king of Mauretania,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1030570X13485403">12</xref></sup> quoted by the First Vatican Council in chapter 3 of its constitution on faith, <italic>Dei Filius</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1030570X13485403">13</xref></sup> and then already quoted at Vatican II by <italic>SC</italic> 5. After <italic>LG</italic>, it would be quoted by the Council’s documents twice more and referenced three times more.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1030570X13485403">14</xref></sup> Second, it was in <italic>LG</italic> 16 that Acts 17:25–28 was referenced for the first time by an ecumenical council in the history of Catholic Christianity. Paul’s words about the search for the unknown God helped to shape the thinking of Vatican II about those who follow other faiths. In the last session of the Council, <italic>Ad Gentes</italic> (<italic>AG</italic>) 3 would cite Acts 17:27 and <italic>Gaudium et Spes</italic> (<italic>GS</italic>) 24 would cite Acts 17:26.</p>
<p>Finally, apropos of morally upright atheists (d), <italic>LG</italic> 16 added: ‘whatever good or true is found among them is considered by the Church to be a preparation for the Gospel, and given by him [the incarnate Word] who enlightens all human beings so that they may at length have life’. A year later <italic>NA</italic> was to recognize ‘goodness and truth’ and enlightenment by the Word among Hindus, Buddhists and followers of other religions. <italic>LG</italic> 16 followed the example of Pope Paul VI. In article 107 of his first encyclical, <italic>Ecclesiam Suam</italic> (dated 6 August 1964), by a few months he had anticipated the positive teaching on Islam to come in <italic>LG</italic>. He wrote of Muslims ‘whom we do well to admire on account of those things that are true and commendable (<italic>vera et probanda</italic>) in their worship’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1030570X13485403">15</xref></sup> Here the ‘paired’ blessings acknowledged by the pope may point towards John’s language about the Word being full of ‘grace and truth’ that he has come to share (John 1:14, 17). Even more clearly <italic>LG</italic> picked up this ‘double-sided’ terminology when speaking of Christ, who through the visible community of the Church, ‘communicates truth and grace to all [human beings]’ (<italic>LG</italic> 8). In the same article the constitution pressed into service Johannine terminology when speaking of ‘the many elements of sanctification and truth’ to be found among Christians not united with the Bishop of Rome.</p>
<p>When reflecting on the religious situation of ‘others’ in terms of whatever good or truth is found among them’, the Council suggested two distinguishable but inseparable dimensions of the divine self-communication that has blessed them: salvation (‘good’) and revelation (‘truth’). The Johannine language of revelation and salvation (in that order) followed at once when our passage in <italic>LG</italic> introduced ‘enlightening’ (revelation) and ‘life’ (salvation).</p>
<p>The following year the final documents of Vatican II were to include a similar ‘double’ terminology inspired by the prologue to John, and did so in the order of revelation first and salvation second. In non-Christian religions the Council found elements of ‘what is true and holy’ (<italic>NA</italic> 2). Six weeks later, Vatican II followed the same order, while showing itself to be more critical of other religions. Missionary activity ‘purges of evil associations every element of truth and grace to be found among the peoples’ (<italic>AG</italic> 9). Thus not only in <italic>LG</italic> but also in <italic>NA</italic> and <italic>AG</italic>, John’s language about ‘grace and truth’ enjoyed some echoes, when the Council spoke about ‘the religious others’. In a christological context, <italic>AG</italic> expressly quoted John 1:14) to speak of Christ, ‘the new Adam’, who is ‘the head of a renewed humanity’, being ‘full of grace and truth’ (<italic>AG</italic> 3).</p>
<p>Apropos of John 1:9 (‘he was the true light that enlightens everyone coming into the world’), we saw above that <italic>LG</italic> 16, albeit without referencing this verse, stated that the incarnate Word ‘enlightens all human beings’. The following year and once again without adding a reference, <italic>NA</italic> would also echo the verse when it said of the Church’s attitude to other religions: ‘it is with sincere respect that she considers those ways of acting and living, those precepts and doctrines, which, although they differ in many respects from what she herself holds and proposes, nevertheless, <italic>often reflect a ray of that Truth, which illuminates all human beings</italic>’ (<italic>NA</italic> 2; italics mine). It was left to <italic>GS</italic> to quote from John’s Gospel the words about ‘the true light that enlightens every human being’ (<italic>GS</italic> 57).</p>
<p>All in all, not only in <italic>LG</italic> but also in three other documents (<italic>NA</italic>, <italic>AG</italic> and <italic>GS</italic>), Vatican II effectively appealed to the language of ‘grace and truth’ and ‘the true light enlightening every human being’. No previous ecumenical council had quoted or referenced these words from John. Vatican II made these texts central when it applied the biblical witness to the religious situation of those who follow other faiths.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1030570X13485403"><title>Nostra Aetate (NA)</title>
<p><italic>NA</italic>, with only five articles, may be the shortest of all the 16 documents promulgated by Vatican II. But half a century of post-conciliar history has seen it grow both in theological significance and in pastoral importance for interfaith dialogue and collaboration. It was quickly recognized not only for its contribution to Catholic–Jewish dialogue but also for its fresh approach to relations between Roman Catholics and followers of other religions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1030570X13485403">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we have seen, some items in <italic>NA</italic> (for example, its positive teaching about Jews and Muslims, as well as themes and language drawn from John’s Gospel) were anticipated by <italic>LG</italic>. Even when the declaration on other religions began by observing how ‘in our age’ the ‘human race is day by day becoming more closely united’ and ‘the obligations between different peoples are increasing’ (<italic>NA</italic> 1), such a pronouncement on the state of global humanity had already been anticipated by similar remarks by <italic>LG</italic> (the closing words in both <italic>LG</italic> 1 and 28). In <italic>LG</italic> and, even more clearly, in <italic>NA</italic> such judgements went far beyond merely theoretical pronouncements and flagged serious commitments. <italic>NA</italic> spoke at once of the Church’s ‘duty to foster unity and charity’ between individuals and nations as belonging to its mission to serve the entire human race. This prompted the Council into showing (a) what human beings have in common, and (b) what ‘leads to mutual fellowship’. <italic>NA</italic> produced a brief answer to (a) (<italic>NA</italic> 1). Then in what followed about ‘the various religions of the world’ (<italic>NA</italic> 2–5), the Council engaged with (b): that is to say, religion as a major cause of fellowship among human beings.</p>
<p>As regards (a), the declaration first named three basic reasons for acknowledging what all nations have in common, to the point of making them ‘one community’: their origin in God, the divine providence that extends to all people and their common, heavenly destiny. On the basis of the unity between human beings finding its deepest foundation in what God has done, is doing and will do, <italic>NA</italic> turns next to the common self-questioning that also – but this time, on the human side – bonds everyone. Its eloquent exposé of seven radical questions that haunt human beings has no precedent in the teaching of earlier ecumenical councils (<italic>NA</italic> 1). The theme of ever-recurring human questions was to be taken up by <italic>GS</italic> (4, 10, 18, 21), and then correlated with the answer(s) that come from the crucified and risen Christ (<italic>GS</italic> 22). But <italic>NA</italic> had already initiated this theme.</p>
<p>The seven questions open by probing the human condition: ‘what is the human being?’ They end by asking: ‘What, finally, is that ultimate and ineffable mystery which enfolds our existence, from which we take our origin and towards which we move?’ Making a broad statement about the present and the past, <italic>NA</italic> observes that people ‘expect from the various religions a response to the obscure enigmas of the human condition, which, today as in the past, intimately disturb the hearts of human beings’ (<italic>NA</italic> 1). After its introductory article that climaxed with the <italic>unity</italic> of the human race, <italic>NA</italic> turns to the <italic>manifold</italic> answers offered by the religions of the world, which ‘in various ways attempt to engage with the restlessness of the human heart by proposing’ three things: ‘doctrines’, ‘precepts for life’ and ‘sacred rites’. This triple scheme, which encompasses belief systems, codes of conduct and modes of worship, may be conventional, but it remains enduringly serviceable for analysing what particular religions set before their followers.</p>
<p>In the event the declaration attended only to Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Judaism. It had nothing to say, for instance, about Confucianism, Shintoism, Sikhism and Taoism and, even more broadly, nothing to say about traditional religions to be found in Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Both at the time of the Council and later, commentators have regretted the failure to address, even in passing, ethnic or tribal religion.</p>
<p>When it tackled specific religions, <italic>NA</italic> spoke about the religions themselves rather than about the followers of these or those religions. It concerned itself primarily with the systems they followed. Even then the declaration never attempted to describe fully the different religions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1030570X13485403">17</xref></sup> It said nothing, for example, about various schools of Hinduism, or about any ‘negative’ Buddhist understanding of salvation, or about differences between Sunni and Shi’a Muslims. While acknowledging such limitations, we should recognize that <italic>NA</italic> did something no ecumenical council had ever done before: it reflected explicitly and positively on some aspects of Hinduism and Buddhism, two religious ways of life that existed centuries before the coming of Christ himself. Vatican II was not ‘doing a theology of religions’, but set itself to indicate only some key spiritual values that could set the basis for dialogue. As Siebenrock remarks, the declaration never aimed at a complete treatment; yet lengthy descriptions were not needed to achieve the purpose of the document – to lay the ground for dialogue and collaboration.</p>
<p>By recognizing what is ‘true and holy’ in other religions (<italic>NA</italic> 2), <italic>NA</italic>, as we have seen above, followed the lead of <italic>LG</italic> in using a Johannine, double-sided terminology that distinguishes (but does not separate) the two dimensions of the divine self-communication: revelation and salvation. What, or rather who, has given rise to ‘those things that are true and holy’ in the other religions? The Council responded by pointing to the person of Christ.</p>
<p>Without condemning various ‘ways of acting and living’, as well as various ‘precepts and doctrines’ to be found in other religions but simply saying that they ‘differ’ in many respects from what the Catholic Church teaches, <italic>NA</italic> then acknowledged something extraordinarily positive: the beliefs and practices of other religions ‘often reflect a ray of that Truth, which illuminates all human beings’ (<italic>NA</italic> 2). Since what is ‘true’ among the others reflects ‘the Truth’ that is the Word of God, presumably what is ‘holy’ among them also comes from the Word who is the life of humankind (John 1:4). If Christ is ‘the truth’ for everyone, he is also ‘the life’ for them. This article of <italic>NA</italic> does not expressly state that Christ is both universal Revealer and universal Saviour, but what it says amounts to that. How can he ‘illuminate’ all human beings without conveying to them something of God’s self-revelation and hence also the offer of salvation?</p>
<p>The Council did not, however, attempt to identify precisely what shape the divine revelation has taken in other religious traditions. It is one thing to maintain the origin and common destiny of all people in God, along with the universal revealing and saving impact of the Word of God. But it would be quite another to risk spelling out precisely what is ‘true and holy’ in world religions and how that state of affairs has come about through the revealing and saving activity of God. As we will see below, the decree on missionary activity respected the mysterious ways in which the divine self-disclosure can call forth human faith.</p>
<p>On the basis of what <italic>NA</italic> 1 observed about the growing unity of the human race and of what <italic>NA 2</italic> observed about other religions, the declaration ‘exhorted’ Catholics, while acting ‘with prudence and charity’ and ‘witnessing to Christian faith and life’, to take up ‘dialogue and collaboration with followers of other religions’. Such dialogue and collaboration should involve Catholics in ‘recognizing, protecting, and promoting those spiritual and moral goods, as well as those sociocultural values’ found among the followers of other religions (<italic>NA</italic> 2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1030570X13485403">18</xref></sup> In the aftermath of Vatican II, various official and unofficial initiatives, as well as the practice of Pope John Paul II, showed the fruits of the interreligious dialogue and collaboration that emerged.</p>
<p><italic>NA</italic> devoted an entire article to the Muslims (<italic>NA</italic> 3), first acknowledging major features in their doctrine of God: ‘they worship God, who is unique, living and subsistent, merciful and almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth, who has spoken (<italic>allocutum</italic>) to human beings’. This involves them in ‘submitting themselves wholeheartedly to the hidden decrees’ of God, ‘just as Abraham submitted himself to God’. The declaration added at once that ‘Islamic faith willingly refers itself’ to Abraham – primarily, one presumes to the faith of Abraham and Sarah.</p>
<p>While reluctant to state straight out that Muslims share the faith of Abraham and Sarah, <italic>NA</italic> clearly recognized how Muslims want to share that faith by ‘willingly’ referring their faith to Abraham. In any case the declaration had already indicated how Islamic faith responded to God’s revelation. It was because God had ‘spoken [in some kind of personal self-revelation] to human beings’ and, specifically, to Muslims that they had come to faith in God as ‘unique, living and subsistent, merciful and almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth’. Hence they could truly ‘worship God’, now revealed to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1030570X13485403">19</xref></sup> The divine self-disclosure had made possible not only their worship of the true God but also their submission to God’s decrees. To be sure, <italic>NA</italic> characterized the ‘decrees’ of God as ‘hidden’. But, obviously, they cannot have remained totally and completely hidden. Otherwise how could Muslims have known what they should submit themselves to? God must have partially revealed the divine will to prompt such submission on their part.</p>
<p>The declaration on other religions built on what <italic>SC</italic> and <italic>LG</italic> had already taught and then added some fresh themes of its own (for example, the deep questions that all human beings share and the call to dialogue and collaboration with followers of other faiths). Something similar holds true for the Decree on the Church’s Missionary Activity. <italic>AG</italic> shared common ground with <italic>SC, LG</italic> and <italic>NA.</italic> But it also added at least one very significant consideration of its own.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1030570X13485403"><title>Ad Gentes (AG)</title>
<p>Before examining one remarkable but relentlessly neglected advance made by <italic>AG</italic> (in fact, as we shall see, a retrieval from St Irenaeus) in thinking about the religious condition of all human beings, let me recall four areas in which the decree gave its own accent to themes already enunciated: the Trinitarian missions; the ‘seeds of the Word’; the presence of ‘truth and grace’; and dialogue and collaboration with ‘the religious others’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1030570X13485403">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>While <italic>SC</italic> had little to say about the Holy Spirit (SC 2, 5, and 6), <italic>LG</italic> gave its reflection on the Church a fully Trinitarian face (for example, <italic>LG</italic> 1–4 and 17). <italic>NA</italic> remained silent about the Holy Spirit. <italic>AG</italic> more than made up for this neglect when founding the Church’s missionary activity in the plan of God the Father, whose ‘love’ and ‘goodness’ gave rise to the mission of the Son and the mission of the Holy Spirit. Through these missions, God who ‘in his great and merciful kindness has freely created us [all human beings], graciously calls us to share in his life and glory’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1030570X13485403">21</xref></sup> This Trinitarian vision of the origin of missionary activity leads naturally to three matching images of the goal of that activity, when the whole human race ‘form one people of God [the Father], come together into the one body of Christ, and are built up into the temple of the Holy Spirit’. Then ‘all who share human nature, regenerated in Christ through the Holy Spirit’, will be able to ‘gaze together on the glory of God [the Father]’ (<italic>AG</italic> 7). Thus, in reflecting on the religious state of the entire human race, both Christians and non-Christians alike, <italic>AG</italic> wishes to consider everyone in relationship with the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Second, <italic>LG</italic> echoed the language of Justin Martyr and other early Christian writers when it said: ‘whatever good is found sown (<italic>seminatum</italic>) in the heart and mind of human beings or in the particular rites and cultures of peoples, so far from being lost, is healed, elevated and consummated’ (<italic>LG</italic> 17). Yves Congar who had played his part in drafting that article<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1030570X13485403">22</xref></sup> repeated those words in <italic>AG</italic> when describing the passage to Christian faith, indicating in a footnote their source in <italic>LG</italic>: ‘whatever good is found sown (<italic>seminatum</italic>) in the heart and mind of human beings or in the particular rites and cultures, so far from being lost, is healed, elevated, and consummated’ (<italic>AG</italic> 9, and fn. 52). Once again, while expressing the saving impact on those who move to faith in Christ (through this ‘healing, elevating, and consummating’), the passage in <italic>AG</italic> recognized ‘the good’ already ‘sown in the mind and heart of human beings’ and in ‘their rites and cultures’. Presumably we deal here with a ‘divine passive’ or a sowing that had been carried out by God, and hence with the divine presence in them of a measure of divine self-communication. Even before accepting the gospel, these ‘others’ already enjoy some elements of revelation and salvation. The process of ‘healing’, ‘elevating’ and ‘consummating’ embodies a degree of continuity between what God had already blessed them with and what they become as Christians.</p>
<p><italic>AG</italic> went on to talk expressly of ‘the seeds of the Word’ that are ‘hidden’ in ‘the national and religious traditions’ of various peoples and that need to be ‘gladly and reverently uncovered’. The decree then characterized these ‘seeds of the Word’ as ‘the riches which the bountiful God has distributed to the nations’. The disciples of Christ should ‘try to illuminate these riches with the light of the Gospel, to set them free, and to bring them back to the dominion of God the Saviour’ (<italic>AG</italic> 11). Thus the move to Christian faith involves both a revealing and enlightening process (riches being illuminated ‘with the light of the Gospel’) and a saving liberation (riches being set free). But this happens to people who have already been richly blessed by the grace of God and enjoy some measure of the presence of the Word. Talking of (a) ‘the seeds of the Word’ that have already been sown by God in ‘the religious traditions’ of various peoples and of (b) ‘riches distributed’ by ‘the bountiful God’ prioritizes the divine initiative rather than any human search. To be sure, the language about these riches being ‘illuminated’ and ‘set free’ obviously suggests that, before the gospel is accepted, the religious situation is not yet as complete and perfect as it could be. Nevertheless, <italic>AG</italic> envisages what God has already done in the ‘religious traditions’ of different nations by ‘sowing’ in them the seeds of the Word and by ‘distributing’ to them ‘the riches’ of divine grace.</p>
<p>A later article of the missionary decree takes up again ‘the seeds of the Word’ by stating that ‘the Holy Spirit calls all human beings to Christ through the seeds of the Word and the preaching of the Gospel’ (<italic>AG 15).</italic> This is to picture the process of moving to Christian faith happening through the word of preaching being addressed to people who, through ‘the seeds of the Word’, <italic>already</italic> enjoy, albeit mysteriously, the hidden presence of Christ.</p>
<p>Finally, with an eye on Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim prayer-life and asceticism, <italic>AG</italic> encourages Roman Catholic religious who work in missionary situations to ‘consider attentively how traditions of asceticism and contemplation, the <italic>seeds</italic> of which have been sometimes planted by God in ancient cultures could be taken up into Christian religious life’ (<italic>AG</italic> 18). This last appeal of <italic>AG</italic> to the theological theme of ‘the seeds of the Word’ clarifies what has hitherto taken the form of a ‘divine passive’: it is God the Holy Spirit who sows and plants these seeds. The passage also specifies one form of the ‘good’ that has been sown and ‘the riches’ that have been distributed by God: the ascetic and contemplative traditions that could be incorporated into the lives of Christian religious institutes. This clarification and specification complete the development that <italic>AG</italic> gave to what <italic>LG</italic> had retrieved (very briefly) from Justin and other early church writers, the theme of ‘the seeds of the Word’.</p>
<p>Third, <italic>AG</italic>, when characterizing the religious situation of those who have not or have not yet accepted faith in Christ, picks up the ‘double’ terminology we already saw in <italic>LG</italic> and <italic>NA</italic> but in this case follows precisely the Johannine language (see John 1:14, 17). When ‘the word of preaching and the celebration of the sacraments’ make ‘Christ, the author of salvation present’, whatever elements of ‘truth and grace’, which are ‘already found among the nations’, are, ‘as it were, a secret presence of God’. This may sound like setting ‘the presence of God’ over against the presence of Christ. But the decree at once makes it clear that Christ, ‘the author of salvation’, is also ‘the author’ of these elements of ‘truth and grace’ already found among the nations before they hear the word of Christian preaching (<italic>AG</italic> 9). The ‘secret presence of God’ is equivalently the secret presence of Christ. As the giver of the gifts of truth and grace, Christ comes with the gifts.</p>
<p>‘Truth and grace’ define what ‘the seeds of the Word’ brings. It is a matter of the (a) revealing and (b) saving presence and activity of Christ, with ‘truth’ pointing to (a) and ‘grace’ to (b).</p>
<p>A fourth item to be retrieved from <italic>AG</italic> is the call to dialogue and collaboration that we already saw in <italic>NA</italic>. In lyric language, <italic>AG</italic> describes ‘the sincere and patient dialogue’ with the religious others to be expected from Christians engaged in missionary activity. Thus the disciples of Jesus, ‘profoundly imbued by’ his Spirit, will be able to ‘learn what riches the bountiful God has distributed to the nations’, so that they might ‘try to illuminate these riches with the light of the Gospel, to set them free, and bring them back to the dominion of God the Saviour’ (<italic>AG</italic> 11).</p>
<p>This ‘fraternal dialogue’ should lead Christians to ‘collaborate with all others’, both Christians and non-Christians, ‘in the right ordering of economic and social affairs’. Another lyric passage spells out the collaboration needed in the areas of education, health care, and the work for ‘better living conditions’ and ‘peace’ (<italic>AG</italic> 12). Such collaboration should also include ‘members of international organizations’ (<italic>AG</italic> 41).</p>
<p>In the early 21st century, interreligious dialogue and collaboration may appear an obvious obligation to be embraced by Catholics and other Christian believers. But such interfaith consciousness took centuries to emerge. No previous ecumenical councils of Catholic Christianity ever imagined, let alone encouraged, the dialogue and collaboration with ‘religious others’ inculcated by <italic>NA</italic>, <italic>AG</italic> and, one should add, <italic>GS</italic>. These official conciliar texts have shaped the story of Roman Catholicism in a way from which there is no turning back.</p>
<p>We have looked at four areas in which <italic>AG</italic> developed reflections that concerned those of other living faiths and that had been taught by three documents already promulgated at the Second Vatican Council (<italic>SC</italic>, <italic>LG</italic> and <italic>NA</italic>). The most striking developments involved the second and fourth areas (‘the seeds of the Word’, and a practical dialogue with others). On one key theme, the universality of revelation and faith, <italic>AG</italic> broke new ground.</p>
<p>To explain ‘the preparation for the Gospel’ <italic>(AG</italic> 3), the missionary decree quotes, in the corresponding fn. 2, two passages from Irenaeus: ‘the Word existing with God, through whom all things were made… was always present to the human race’. Hence, ‘from the beginning the Son, being present in his creation, reveals (<italic>revelat</italic>) the Father to all whom the Father desires, at the time and in the manner desired by the Father’ (<italic>Adversus Haereses</italic>, 3. 18. 1; 4. 6. 7). Here <italic>AG</italic> draws on Irenaeus to acknowledge (a) the Word of God as the agent in creating all things (see John 1:1–3, 10; 1 Cor 8:6; Heb 1:2). Consequently the Word has always been present to the entire human race and not merely to certain groups or nations. Granted the Christological origin and character of creation, (b) right from the start of human history the Son has been <italic>revealing</italic> the Father to human beings. In all its 16 documents it is only here that Vatican II explicitly applies the verb ‘reveal’ to the knowledge and experience of God mediated through the created world and its history. Obviously this revelation of God through creation and human history allows for endless variety, as ‘the Son reveals the Father to all whom the Father desires and at the time and in the manner desired by the Father’.</p>
<p>The two quotations from Irenaeus highlight the universal divine activity by which the Word/Son of God prepares people for the coming of the gospel. Using the term ‘reveal’ for the divine activity implies the counterpart of human faith. It is with true faith that human beings, whoever they are, respond to the initiative of the Son of God, who, being present in and through creation, reveals God to them. The decree expressly acknowledges a faith-response to the personal divine revelation made to the non-evangelized: ‘in ways known to himself’ God can lead ‘those who, through no fault of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel to that faith without which it is impossible to please him (Heb 11:6)’ (<italic>AG</italic> 7).</p>
<p>Recognizing explicitly that the divine activity of revelation and the human response of faith also take place among those who follow other religions or none at all occurs briefly in <italic>AG</italic>. But the decree stands apart in being the first text from 21 ecumenical councils to acknowledge expressly that (a) God’s self-revelation reaches all people, and (b) that human beings, no matter who they are, can and should respond with faith.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1030570X13485403" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>What might we draw from this examination of Vatican II teaching on the religious situation of those who follow other living faiths (or none at all)? Six conclusions suggest themselves.</p>
<p>First, from the first document it promulgated the Council showed a universal mindset, concerned with the divine self-communication reaching all people. <italic>SC</italic> manifested this mindset by, for instance, mandating the restoration of the ‘prayer of the faithful’, which includes praying for ‘the salvation of the entire world’.</p>
<p>Second, through its striking picture of the High Priest leading a choir that includes all human beings, <italic>SC</italic> led the way in putting on the conciliar agenda the cosmic presence of Jesus Christ. This involved <italic>LG</italic> (very briefly) and <italic>AG</italic> (more elaborately) in retrieving the patristic doctrine of ‘the seeds of the Word’. Far beyond <italic>LG</italic> 17, the missionary decree developed the theme of ‘the seeds of the Word’, sown everywhere by God and ‘hidden’ everywhere, in particular, in ‘religious traditions’ (<italic>AG</italic> 9, 11, 15, 18). The ‘secretly present’ Christ is ‘the author’ of elements of ‘truth and grace’ found ‘among the nations’ (<italic>AG</italic> 9), the ‘Truth’ that illuminates all human beings (<italic>NA</italic> 2).</p>
<p>Third, <italic>AG</italic> taught, most importantly, that the Son, ‘present in creation’ reveals the Father universally (<italic>AG</italic> 3, fn. 2), and human beings can respond with saving faith (<italic>AG</italic> 7).</p>
<p>Fourth, most emphatically in <italic>AG</italic> the Council presented the divine plan for human salvation in terms of the Trinity and the Trinitarian missions.</p>
<p>Fifth, Vatican II set itself to reflect on the situation of all human beings, the beneficiaries of God’s saving love. <italic>NA</italic> innovated by reflecting on the human condition in the light of seven deep questions that affect all men and women.</p>
<p>Sixth, we can list further innovations introduced the Council. It was the first ecumenical council to retrieve teaching from John’s Gospel that illuminates the religious situation of all human beings, as well as being the first council to allow its teaching on Jews to be shaped by two classical texts from Paul’s Letter to the Romans. Unlike any earlier council, Vatican II offered positive teaching on Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism; this helped to prepare the way for ground-breaking initiatives in interfaith dialogue and collaboration.</p>
<p>Even though I have not been able to include considerations drawn from the final document of Vatican II, the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, four earlier texts yield rich themes for anyone wanting to reflect on the religious situation of the ‘religious others’. It is at our peril that we limit our reading to the Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions.</p>
