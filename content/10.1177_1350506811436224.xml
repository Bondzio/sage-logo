<p>When the <italic>European Journal of Women’s Studies</italic> was first set up, one its main aims was to offer a space in which specifically European takes on and approaches to issues central to feminist praxis and Women’s Studies scholarship could be published and offered as part of an ever more complex but increasingly urgent global conversation. Such a global conversation needed to be built around a conception of feminist praxis as multi-centred and multi-sited in a way that rejected a centre–margin geometry of feminism with the consequent hierarchies of status and import that follow such representational orderings of emancipatory vision and struggle. At the time chief among the journal’s interlocutors were feminist debates and forms of scholarship emerging from the USA, and perhaps also Canada, conceived in an implicit epistolary relation which simultaneously attempted to undermine a privileged position being accorded to feminist thought emerging from the USA, especially in regard to theory, yet which also slightly undermined the attempt to situate European feminist scholarship and practice in a global field of differing yet interconnected gender dynamics.</p>
<p>Despite this tension the aim of the <italic>EJWS</italic> to ‘locate’ European feminisms remains central to the journal’s project, as has been recently emphasized in its pages. Such ‘location’ is multi-dimensional and constituted in an endless dynamic of normative stabilization and contestation across multiple registers but three dimensions of this ‘location’ are worth mentioning here. One kind of location involves situating European feminisms and Women’s Studies in a global frame and dynamic, including their connections to counter-global flows, alliances and visions of which the current Occupy camps and protests that circle the globe are a high profile example. Second, is to locate in time and the temporal, remembering that the temporal is multi-dimensional and involves non-linear movements as well as linear movements of chronological time. As such locating historically will involve biographical (individual and collective), secular, sacred, psychic and embodied time/temporalities as well as political, ideological, productive, technological times/temporalities. Finally, locating also involves the simultaneous and highly complex task of conceiving European feminisms as <italic>a</italic> socio-cultural-ideological formation, i.e. locating it in terms of general patterns, preoccupations, modes of practice, orientations towards that deemed ‘other’ to itself, etc. <italic>and</italic> as a set of highly differentiated and heterogeneous fields of socio-cultural-political-psychic-institutional-ideological formations with varying and shifting constellations of gender, class, ethno-religious, sexual, bodily, aesthetic and moral relations. This poses feminist practitioners, including Women’s Studies scholars, the complex task of identifying, tracing and analysing the broad patterns and their effects, together with their points of conjunction with or reproduction of forms of intra- or inter-European hierarchies and forms of domination or normative subordination. At the same time it also involves identifying, tracing and analysing the points of disjunction and/or subversion of these same hierarchies and normativities of subordination and/or exclusion.</p>
<p>Given the by now long-standing influence of the ‘truths’ of poststructuralist theory on much of European and US feminist thought in which it has become clear that any ‘self’ is constituted in relation to its ‘other’, and given that, in combination with anti-colonial and postcolonial scholarship, we are aware that the practices of any given ‘self’ (or self-defined ‘we’) are often most clearly identified and articulated by the ‘other’, it would be unsurprising if it is from feminisms of the ‘global south’ that the contours and generalized patterns of the specifically European are most clearly articulated. That said, it is also from the ‘close up’ lens that the specificities of European intersectional constellations of gender and Women’s Studies and other forms of feminist practice will be made visible and subject to analysis. This too is an essential aspect of the process of ‘locating’ Europe and its feminisms and the articles in this issue contribute to this aspect of location.</p>
<p>The article by Sarah Bracke is the third in a cluster of articles convened by Jin Haritaworn and published in the previous issue (19/1). Here Bracke picks up the theme of the conditions under which certain kinds of feminist and gay politics can and have been hailed into an alliance with Islamophobic and homonationalist political and ideological projects of the state. She points to the remobilization of the colonial discourse of ‘rescue’ in which some category of brown person is ‘saved’ from the barbarities of another category of brown person by the civilizing impulse, equalities sensibility and modernist vision of some category of European (white) person. This raises profoundly pressing (yet also long-standing) questions about processes, effects and political uncertainties about the constitution of a feminist subject, not only in terms of who can be included in this category but on what terms and by whose authority. Such questions also point to the fluidities and instabilities in processes of identification and disidentification with any given ‘version’ of feminism’s subject/feminist subject, especially in conditions of profound cultural plurality such as exist across the multiple national formations that make up Europe. Here ‘cultural formations’ reference that version of culture signalled in ideas of multiculturalism, that is culture as assumed or actual practices of life, and ‘culture’ as indicating signifying practices and patterns of representation. It is in relation to the former that feminists have to negotiate a path which resists conscription into Islamophobic and other racist projects, as the articles by Clycq, Midden and in a slightly different way Seeberg (as well as Bracke) show.</p>
<p>In relation to culture as signifying and meaning making practice the articles by Gunnarsson Payne and Midden draw attention to the ways in which instruments of European feminist infrastructure such as zines and journals are implicated in the politics of feminist subject formation. This raises the issue of how to found and sustain a rhetoric of appeal and grammar of practice that avoids repeating practices of racialized, homophobic or otherwise reactionary politics but also, and this is key for Gunnarsson Payne, of developing an analytic practice that is able to trace and craft a subject of feminism that is neither socially reductive/exclusive or temporally simplistic in terms of the characterization of generations of feminism. This poses a theoretical task in which it is possible to analyse a ‘logics of Sisterhood’ as manifest in intra-feminist debates.</p>
<p>These are big issues and they also involve a task of identifying (or resignifying?) what concepts are available that speak to and capture the range of human variation that exists within and without Europe but which do not simply (or even complexly!) reproduce or stabilize established hierarchies and oppressive norms of intelligibility, or indeed produce new ones. Closely related is the issue of boundary formation and the grounds on which an ‘us’ and ‘them’ is constituted – a process that is highly contingent, contextual and shifting and which is as much a part of lived experience and everyday life as it is central to institutional practices and state border formation and national belonging. Thus it can be found in the talk of research interview material as much as in public policy documents. This is an issue raised in the article by Noel Clycq.</p>
<p>Central to the process of locating Europe and its feminisms is the issue of intersectionality and how most effectively to work with that notion both theoretically and empirically. Ina Kerner addresses the ‘what’ and ‘how’ aspects of intersectionality, arguing that for intersectional analyses to do their work most effectively requires working with multiple categories of difference (attending to the specific hierarchical constellations that result for any given constituency) and across three dimensions of analysis: epistemic, institutional and personal. She offers a theoretical argument that is developed in relation to the German debates about intersectionality. Seeberg also addresses the issue of intersectional enquiry, alongside an institutional perspective, though this time it is in relation to empirically based studies of migrant careworkers in the context of the Norwegian gender regime. The empirical data are then used to ‘scale up’ and offer an analysis of the ways existing ‘structures may be challenged through the fluidity of situational and relational gendering processes’.</p>
<p>It is probably important to point out that none of the articles here explicitly addresses the issue of locating Europe in the terms I laid out in the first part of this piece. Equally it is important to note that each author writes in the context of specific nation-state formations – the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Belgium. Yet in addressing the issues and dilemmas that they do, they contribute to the task of locating Europe by helping to identify its racialized-gendered-sexualized relational fields; by delineating some of the normativities and contestations that are at work, including in some of the forms of feminist practice occurring at specific national levels. Not only does this add to the archive of scholarship addressing the variety and heterogeneity of European socio-cultural-political-psychic-institutional-ideological formations, it also adds to the available material from which can potentially be provided the basis for an analysis of the characteristics, processes and practices that make for a Europe that is more ‘consolidated’ in its visions and missions. This is something that feminists also need to know and understand if the locating of Europe is to be harnessed to a politics of divesting it of its old and new imperialistic, nationalistic, patriarchal material and ideological dimensions. Finally, it is also points to those parts of Europe that are missing – Europe’s east and south – thus implicitly pointing to the intra-European hegemonies in which the preoccupations, approaches and debates from certain Women’s Studies and feminist constituencies masquerade as, or come to occupy position of, all that is Europe . . . leaving open a challenge to the journal to go in endless pursuit of its goal of being a <italic>European</italic> Journal of Women’s Studies in which the European is but one heterogeneous location in a big and wide world in which feminist enquiry and knowledge is generated from multiple sites.</p>
