<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive pulmonary vascular disease leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, right heart failure and premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812464445">1</xref>]. Signs and symptoms (dyspnea at exertion, palpitation, fatigue, angina, ascites, syncope) are nonspecific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812464445">2</xref>] leading to late diagnosis. Two decades ago, patients with idiopathic PAH were defined as the “kingdom of the near-dead” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812464445">3</xref>] owing to their poor prognosis and a life expectancy of 2.8 years from diagnosis. At that time no disease-specific therapy was available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812464445">4</xref>]. Progression in medical treatment of PAH since that time is unique. Almost 30 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been completed and more than 10 are either ongoing or planned for this rare and severe condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812464445">5</xref>]. Seven drugs (ambrisentan, bosentan, sildenafil, tadalafil, epoprostenol, iloprost and treprostinil), belonging to three pharmacological classes (endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors and prostanoids), have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). These therapies improve symptoms and prolong life in PAH patients but can cause significant burden to the quality of life (QoL) of patients because of inconvenient administration, side effects and costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812464445">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812464445"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812464445">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Disease-specific outcome measures are most effective in determining the impact of an illness on a patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812464445">9</xref>]. The Cambridge pulmonary hypertension outcome review (CAMPHOR) is such a disease-specific measure that was designed to assess pulmonary hypertension (PH)-specific impairments (symptoms) functioning and QoL in people with PAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812464445">10</xref>].</p>
<p>This article describes the adaptation of the CAMPHOR into Swedish and includes results from the translation, cognitive debriefing and validation stages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494812464445" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The adaptation of the Swedish CAMPHOR involved three key stages; translation, cognitive debriefing interviews and a validation survey. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Gothenburg.</p>
<sec id="section3-1403494812464445">
<title>Translation process</title>
<sec id="section4-1403494812464445">
<title>Bilingual panel</title>
<p>A bilingual panel group was employed to produce the first Swedish version of the CAMPHOR. This consisted of a group of Swedish individuals who also had a good competence in English. The purpose of this panel was to suggest translations for the instructions, items and response options. They achieved this by working as a group and coming to a consensus on the most appropriate wordings. They were given the following instructions; to capture the same concepts as in the English items and produce a comprehensible and acceptable formulation of the concepts. Each item was discussed until agreement was reached. When consensus could not be reached, alternative versions of the item were taken forward for consideration by the second lay translation panel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494812464445">
<title>Lay panel</title>
<p>The lay panel consisted of individuals of an average or lower than average educational level, who were considered more typical of the target patient population. The purpose of this second panel was to ensure that the final wording of the items was appropriate and acceptable. Participants were presented with the translations made by the bilingual panel and asked to comment as a group on them in terms of comprehension, acceptability and whether they sounded “natural”. Where necessary changes in wording could be made as long as the original meaning of the item was maintained. The panel was also asked to choose between any alternative translations that the bilingual panel had produced.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494812464445">
<title>Cognitive debriefing interviews</title>
<p>The purpose of these one-to-one semi-structured interviews with PH patients was to test applicability, relevance and comprehensiveness of the Swedish questionnaire. Fourteen patients were recruited at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, outpatient clinic, Gothenburg. They completed the questionnaire in the presence of an interviewer who made a note of any obvious difficulties or hesitations over particular items. After completing the questionnaire, interviewees were asked to explain these difficulties. Respondents were then asked to comment on whether they believed the items were relevant, applicable and comprehensible, and if they thought any important aspects of their experience of PH had been omitted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494812464445">
<title>Validation survey</title>
<p>To establish the psychometric properties of the Swedish version of the CAMPHOR data were collected from 38 patients with PH by means of a postal validation survey. Participants in the postal survey were females and male subjects, aged 18 years and over, with a diagnosis of PAH or chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH). Participants also completed the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). The NHP is a generic measure of perceived distress consisting of 38 items divided in six sections (energy level, pain, emotional reactions, sleep, social isolation and physical ability) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812464445">11</xref>]. Additional data collected included date of diagnosis, age, gender and World Health Organization (WHO) functional classification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494812464445">
<title>The CAMPHOR instrument</title>
<p>The CAMPHOR is comprised of three scales that assess symptoms, activity limitations and QoL. The CAMPHOR was originally developed for use in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812464445">10</xref>] where the scales were shown to fit the Rasch model [12] indicating that they were unidimensional. The scales were also shown to have good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha 0.90 to 0.92) and reproducibility (test–retest correlation 0.86 to 0.92).The scales of the CAMPHOR were also found to exhibit adequate convergent, divergent and known groups validity.</p>
<p>The CAMPHOR symptom scale contains 25 statements relating to PH. Each item has a dichotomous yes/no response format. Participants are given a score of one for items answered “yes” and zero for items answered “no”. An overall system score is calculated by summing the answers to the 25 questions, with higher scores indicative of greater impairment.</p>
<p>The CAMPHOR activity limitations scale requires participants to answer questions about whether or not they are able to complete certain activities. There are 15 items, each with a three-point response format: able to do on own without difficulty (scored zero), able to do on own with difficulty (scored one), unable to do on own (scored two). The maximum total score for the scale is 30, with higher scores indicating poorer functioning.</p>
<p>The CAMPHOR QoL scale consists of 25 statements relating to how PH affects an individual’s need fulfillment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812464445">13</xref>]. Participants are asked to respond “true” (scored one) or “not true” (scored zero) to each item. Higher scores on the scale are indicative of poorer QoL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1403494812464445">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Continuous variables are expressed as mean ±SD. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficients. The criterion of an alpha value &gt; 0.70 was defined as evidence of satisfactory internal consistency reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812464445">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Construct validity was analyzed by examining convergent, divergent and known groups validity. CAMPHOR scale scores were correlated with the NHP domains using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient to examine convergent and divergent validity. Known groups validity was assessed by investigating whether CAMPHOR scale scores were able to distinguish between participants based on their WHO functional class, self-perceived disease severity, general health and overall QoL. Scores on the CAMPHOR were also related to age (above and below the median) and gender. Non-parametric tests for independent samples (Mann–Whitney U-test for two groups or Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance for three or more groups) were employed to test differences in CAMPHOR scores between groups. A <italic>p</italic> value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical program (Version 19.01; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494812464445" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section11-1403494812464445">
<title>Bilingual panel</title>
<p>The bilingual translation panel found the activity limitations and QoL scales straightforward to translate. Some items in the symptoms scale required more extensive discussion. For example, the expression ‘I get very down’ and ‘It does get me down’ (Item 20 and 24, symptoms) led to discussion about the difficulty in finding Swedish words that expressed the appropriate level of intensity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1403494812464445">
<title>Lay panel</title>
<p>The questionnaire was generally well understood by all five participants in this panel and most of the content proved relatively straightforward. However, the panel suggested some item changes to improve the clarity of the Swedish questionnaire. For example, the panel changed the symptoms item ‘Everything is an effort’ to ‘Every little effort is an effort’. The panel felt that this translation would be better interpreted by Swedish patients as it is a more natural Swedish expression. The lay panel also changed the order of the wording in the item ‘I get out of breath when I stand up’ to ‘As I do the movement of standing up I get breathless’. The panel chose to rearrange the wording of the Swedish item ‘I am reluctant to leave the house’, by replacing the phrase ‘leave the house’ with an alternative phrase ‘move from home’. No changes were considered necessary to the activity limitations or QoL scales in the Swedish translation of the CAMPHOR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1403494812464445">
<title>Cognitive debriefing interviews</title>
<p>A local study nurse interviewed 14 PAH patients individually to test the face and content validity of the Swedish CAMPHOR. Two men and twelve women with mean age of 52.9 ± 14.3 years (range 30–73) completed the interview. They had the following diagnoses; idiopathic PAH (<italic>n</italic>=7), PH associated with connective tissue diseases (<italic>n</italic>=3), PH associated with congenital heart disease (<italic>n</italic>=2) and PH associated with portal hypertension (<italic>n</italic>=1). One interviewee had PH associated with sarcoidosis. The CAMPHOR was generally well received and regarded as relevant by the patients. The instructions and the purpose of the interviews were well understood by most patients. As there were no specific items that caused difficulties to more than one or two patients and, as all patients were still able to respond to these items, no further alterations to the Swedish CAMPHOR were necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1403494812464445">
<title>Postal validation survey</title>
<p>A total of 38 patients with PH participated in the validation survey. Mean age was 61.2 ± 13.3 years (range 22–78) and 20 (52.6%) were female. Demographic and disease characteristics of the respondents are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812464445">Table I</xref>.</p>

<p>Clear differentiation was observed in the magnitude of correlations between the different scales of the CAMPHOR and NHP sections. The pattern of associations between the CAMPHOR and NHP sections was as expected. CAMPHOR symptoms correlated most strongly with the NHP energy scale, reflecting the importance of this as a symptom for PH patients. CAMPHOR activity limitations correlated most strongly with the NHP scale to which is most similar; NHP physical limitations. Several of the NHP sections had moderate correlations with the CAMPHOR QoL indicating that multiple factors contribute to patients overall QoL.</p>
<p>The Swedish CAMPHOR scales all correlated significantly with 6 minute walking test (MWT) (symptoms scale <italic>r</italic> = −62, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; functioning scale <italic>r</italic> = −0.53, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008; and QoL scale <italic>r</italic> = −0.62, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001).</p>

<title>Known groups validity (discriminant validity)</title>
<p>Known groups validity of the Swedish CAMPHOR adaptation was assessed by testing the ability of the measure to distinguish between groups of patients that differed according to some factor known or suspected to be a marker of disease severity or QoL. The factors used for the present investigation were age, illness duration, patient-reported general health, patient-reported disease severity, patient-reported overall QoL and WHO functional classification. The symptom scale scores were significantly higher in elderly patients (above median age of 64 years, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028). There were no significant differences between CAMPHOR scale scores for groups divided by duration of disease (above and below median). Patients with associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (APAH) (mainly patients with systemic sclerosis) had significantly higher symptoms scores than patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) (0.032). There were no significant differences in activity limitations or QoL for these different sub-groups of patients. All three CAMPHOR scales were able to discriminate between groups of patients according to their self-perceived general health, self-perceived disease severity and rating of QoL (Table IV). Patients with a higher WHO functional class (III and IV) had significantly worse scores on symptoms, activity limitations and QoL when compared with patients in WHO functional class I and II (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.004; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494812464445">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, psychometric analyses indicated that the Swedish adaptation of the UK CAMPHOR was successful. The new language version exhibited good internal consistency, convergent validity and known groups validity. Similar data have been published for the Canadian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812464445">15</xref>], US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812464445">16</xref>] and Australian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812464445">17</xref>] adaptation of the CAMPHOR. Translations that are conceptually equivalent facilitate the comparison of scores across countries more readily than translations focused solely on linguistic equivalence. The objective in adapting questionnaires is to ensure that items are understood in the same way in different countries. The translation process adopted the dual-panel methodology recommended by Hunt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812464445">18</xref>], which emphasizes the importance of achieving conceptual equivalence of translated items to the original. This methodology has been successfully used in a large number of other QoL questionnaire adaptations (for example, the Rheumatoid Arthritis QoL scale for use in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812464445">19</xref>]). This translation process aims to find phrases that describe the equivalent concept, rather than linguistic equivalence. Additionally, it is vital that the translated items are expressed in common (everyday) language, so that they appeal to future respondents.</p>
<p>The internal consistency coefficients confirmed that items in the three scales were adequately inter-related. Correlations with NHP section scores were as expected, providing evidence of convergent validity. The present study did not investigate the test–retest reliability of the new language version of the CAMPHOR. Previous adaptations of the CAMPHOR have shown excellent test–retest reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812464445">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812464445"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812464445">17</xref>]. Additional testing is needed to establish whether the Swedish CAMPHOR exhibits low levels of random measurement error.</p>
<p>The Swedish CAMPHOR scales were able to distinguish between groups of patients based on their general health, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms, activity limitations and QoL for individuals with fair/poor general health compared with those with very good/good general health. The CAMPHOR was also able to distinguish between participants on the basis of WHO functional class. Despite the small sample size, patients with associated forms of PH (especially those patients with systemic sclerosis) had higher symptom scores. Similar findings have been reported by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812464445">20</xref>].</p>
<p>It is concluded that the Swedish adaptation of the CAMPHOR compares well with the original UK English version. This instrument is a valid and reliable tool for measuring symptoms, activity limitations and QoL in Swedish patients with PH and can be recommended for use in routine practice and clinical trials.</p>
