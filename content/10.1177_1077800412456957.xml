<abstract>
<p>This article presents an application and expansion of the patchwork quilt metaphor for qualitative research. Building upon work by Saukko, I constructed a virtual quilt out of participant interviews. Participants were interviewed about “unlabeled” sexual experiences. Transcripts were analyzed using the Listening Guide, “sewn” into individual patches, and combined into a larger patchwork. This project is a prototype, and is intended to represent one possibility for presenting and organizing research on the Internet. Although the quilt was developed while researching young women’s sexual experiences, it can be used to study many different content areas.</p>

<p>One challenge when conducting qualitative social science research is positioning the self within society. A self must be posited for each participant and there must be an end-point to that self (i.e., the boundary between self and nonself). Each participant must also be afforded a certain amount of agency, history, and context. The limits of agency as they relate to the boundaries of selfhood are unlikely to be understood empirically. The self then is perhaps best understood metaphorically, and an adequate metaphor is one that captures the tensions between the historical Western viewpoint of the self as functioning somewhat independently (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800412456957">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>) and the contemporary social science understanding of the self as at least partially shaped by larger cultural forces. One such metaphor is that of a patchwork quilt.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412456957">Deleuze and Guattari (1987)</xref> described a patchwork quilt as a gathering of disjointed elements. Each patch is a separate and unique element, but patches can be combined to form a whole. Similar to a rhizome, a patchwork quilt has multiple entryways for analysis, no necessary center, and the ability to grow in multiple directions. The metaphor of a patchwork quilt is useful for describing systems that seem to defy traditional linear exposition. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412456957">Sermijn, Devlieger, and Loots (2008)</xref> argue that the patchwork quilt is an appropriate model for the construction of self-narratives in the postmodern era. Rather than describing the self as a linear being evolving along a single narrative timeline, describing the self as a patchwork quilt acknowledges the disparate elements that combine to form what is experienced as a unified identity.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077800412456957">
<title>Use of the Quilt Metaphor</title>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412456957">Sermijn, Devlieger, and Loots (2008)</xref> explain that the patchwork quilt can be used as a metaphor for a single self, I argue that the quilt metaphor is useful when presenting the results of a qualitative research project involving multiple participants. The patchwork quilt metaphor is a means to present participant data as both unique and part of a larger whole. Both a quilt and a data set can be appreciated on its own, but both are better understood by knowing the particular socio-historical conditions surrounding their creation. Similarly, the results of any particular qualitative study are inseparable from the study’s theoretical underpinnings.</p>
<p>Feminist scholars and researchers have suggested that quilt making is a feminine metaphor for scientific inquiry (e.g., Flannery, 2001). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412456957">Warren (1994)</xref> offered, “the metaphor of theory-building as quilt-making—engaged in by particular quilters in particular historical, socioeconomic circumstances” (p. 180). She further explained that this metaphor could be used to challenge abstract and ahistorical forms of theory-building. Thus, Warren suggested a number of “boundary conditions” when constructing a feminist quilt. For example, a feminist quilt “opposes all ‘isms of domination’” (p. 187) and is “structurally pluralistic” (p. 188). The quilt is not merely a hodgepodge of fabric—it has a specific purpose and context.</p>
<p>The quilter is the theory builder and ultimately responsible for the final quilt, but the materials are bounded. Rather than discovering absolute facts, a social scientist can be seen as constructing theory out of disparate information including participant data, pre-existing theory, and self-reflexivity. Theory does not develop out of an isolated mind’s interaction with an inanimate environment; rather, the researcher collects and organizes data and theory. Thus, research is limited by the available data, theory, and context. Similarly, the uniqueness of a patchwork quilt is in its construction; the quilter’s skill level, the available materials, and the assumed purpose of the quilt limit it. The quilt metaphor highlights the important of context for any theory.</p>
<p>Qualitative researchers have utilized the metaphor of a patchwork quilt to study multiple content areas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412456957">Saukko (2000)</xref> described the process of quilting as a way of connecting individual stories to larger cultural discourses. Throughout her manuscript on individuals diagnosed with anorexia, Saukko organized stories according to themes. She also included insights from scholarly work, her own stories of the interview process and her past. According to Saukko, “The metaphor of a quilt draws our attention to the acute specificity of each local perspective and experience. Yet, it also allows us to explore the resonances and disjunctions between each specific angle and the ways in which anorexia bleeds into a vast array of other social issues or formulations …” (p. 313). In addition, quilting allows the researcher to both present and challenge participants’ stories. In her study of older women’s experiences of spirituality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800412456957">Learn (1996)</xref> used the metaphor of a quilt to construct a physical patchwork quilt about her research participants, but she did not explicitly identify quilting as a research method. As a final example, participants in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800412456957">Ball’s (2008)</xref> study about recovery from trauma completed individual quilt blocks, which were later sewn together to form the entirety of the quilt.</p>

<title>The Content Area</title>
<p>Although the focus of this manuscript is on the virtual quilt itself, it is important to locate it within the research project through which it was developed. For this project, the metaphor of a quilt was used to study the experience of women who had experienced unwanted sexual activity, but did not subsequently label this activity as sexual assault or rape. It has been consistently found that some women who have had experiences consistent with the legal/research definition of rape do not label these experiences as rape (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800412456957">Botta &amp; Pingree, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412456957">Kahn, Jackson, Kully, Badger, &amp; Halversen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800412456957">McMullin &amp; White, 2006</xref>, for reviews). Although rates vary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412456957">Kahn et al. (2003)</xref> reported that as many as 50% of rape survivors do not identify their experiences as rape. Multiple factors have been proposed to explain this discrepancy including whether verbal resistance was utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412456957">Harned, 2005</xref>), alcohol use at the time of the incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800412456957">McMullin &amp; White, 2006</xref>), existent sexual scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412456957">Masters, Norris, Stoner, &amp; George, 2006</xref>), and familiarity with the partner/assailant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412456957">Kahn et al., 2003</xref>). This is troubling politically because it suggests that the definition of rape/sexual assault is inadequate, women are unable to apply this definition, or a combination of both. Regardless of the cause, the problem of violence against women cannot be addressed if women are individualizing problematic sexual experiences rather than sharing and organizing with other women.</p>
<p>To address this topic, I interviewed women who reported nonconsensual/unwanted sexual experiences that they did not label as sexual assault or rape. Some of these experiences seemed consistent with common definitions of sexual assault or rape, and others were not. My goal was not to determine if each woman should use the label “sexual assault” or “rape.” Rather, I was interested in exploring the phenomenological experience of the labeling process.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Five participants were individually interviewed using a semistructured interview process. After individual interviews, I transcribed each interview and completed analyses utilizing the Listening Guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412456957">Gilligan, Spencer, Weinberg, &amp; Bertsch, 2003</xref>). My use of the Guide was informed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800412456957">Phillips’ (2000)</xref> work regarding young women’s sexuality. I then provided participants with individual write-ups based on my analyses and met with them again in order to obtain feedback and further information. Participants had the option of participating in a group interview to further discuss their experiences, although only two attended the meeting. Following the group meeting, I constructed a virtual quilt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077800412456957">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Good Woman Discourses</title>
<p>To further understand the virtual quilt, it is necessary to include a brief summary of two important discourses. In <italic>Flirting with Danger</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800412456957">Phillips (2000)</xref> described sets of contradictory discourses regarding young women’s sexuality. One set of discourses makes up the Good Woman Discourses, which describe how women should think, act, and feel. The two contradictory discourses of “good” women are the Pleasing Woman discourse and the Together Woman discourse. The Pleasing Woman discourse suggests, “integral to women’s proper gender roles is the desire and ability to be pleasant, feminine, and subordinate to men” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800412456957">Phillips, 2000</xref>, p. 39). In contrast, the Together Woman discourse is akin to liberal feminism, in that it “accept[s] uncritically the liberal, androcentric ‘ideals’ of total autonomy, self-direction, and entitlement to sex and relationships without personal responsibility” (p. 47). One of my goals was to read my participants’ stories through the lenses afforded by these discourses. Thus, these discourses frame much of the quilt.</p>

<title>The Virtual Quilt</title>
<p>Each woman’s story involved multiple facets and layers. As in a patchwork quilt, each story can be viewed as a complete individual square—a whole in itself—or as part of the larger whole of the quilt. The square itself is composed of disparate elements. Squares from a patchwork quilt can be made in multiple ways, and appliqués are applied to main fabric. Although these women had not met before this study, their experiences connect, and this connection is represent by the patchwork quilt. Feminists have long believed that connecting women with each other is an effective method of social change. To accomplish this, a prototype of a virtual quilt was created. The purpose of this quilt is to suggest a new and interesting way for research to affect and be affected by those outside of the academic community. I began with this metaphor of a patchwork quilt but realized that while it is useful for academic inquiry, it is doubtful that many of the women targeted in this study are part of the tradition of quilting, and unlikely that metaphor will resonate with their experiences.</p>
<p>The Internet, in contrast, is an appropriate metaphor for young women. Like the postmodern self, the Internet is rhizomatic, and is no doubt shaping the selves of those who use it. Like a physical quilt, a website contains layers, connections, and patterns. Instead of creating individual squares/blocks, a woman can provide input for an individual webpage. Rather than layers of fabric and batting, the virtual quilt is composed of layers of hyperlinks that a user can follow to arrive at different portions of the quilt. A physical quilt is held together by threads, and a markup language such as HTML holds a virtual quilt together. Perhaps most relevant to social science, each “block” (participant story) can stand alone as a single webpage yet be connected to the stories of others, similar to squares/block of fabric in a patchwork quilt. Information on the Internet is not linear. Unlike a book or journal article, there is no necessary informational path. Although there is typically one common starting point (or homepage), users can then choose which path of links to follow from that that entryway. Finally, the Internet is different from a physical patchwork quilt in a fundamental way. The particular family or community that owns or displays it can only share a physical quilt. A virtual quilt, one that exists in cyberspace, can be viewed, adjusted, criticized, and built by many.</p>
<p>Currently, this project exists as a prototype. The multiple ethical and practical issues involved in creating an actual website consisting of participant information are still under exploration. Thus, the prototype presented below does not exist in cyber-space, but is intended as an example to highlight the possibilities of virtual quilting as a research method and product. It is also important to note that because the virtual quilt was created in the final stage of this project, the content of the quilt was entirely determined by the researcher and taken directly from the study’s write-up. It is anticipated that the researcher and participant will codetermine the content of an actual virtual quilt.</p>
<p>The images presented throughout are screenshots of the virtual quilt prototype, and they contain the story of one participant, “Trish.” Thus, Trish’s block is intended to represent one of many participant stories that can be connected by the virtual quilt. The first image is the homepage of the quilt, and a user can choose to click on any of the blocks in order to reach a participant’s story:</p>
<graphic id="img1-1077800412456957" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img1.tif"/>
<p>For example, an internet user can click on the block labeled “Trish”: <inline-graphic id="img2-1077800412456957" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img2.tif"/> and arrive at this screen:</p>
<graphic id="img3-1077800412456957" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img3.tif"/>
<p>This is Trish’s story, and can be constructed by Trish and the researcher. Each quilt appliqué (icon) on this patch will direct the user to information and resources related to Trish’s story and the user can decide which path to follow. Thus, Trish’s story is composed of her own subjective experience, but is not limited to this. Users of the virtual quilt can follow links to explore additional threads of Trish’s situation. For example, this icon: <inline-graphic id="img4-1077800412456957" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img4.tif"/> directs the user to this screen:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077800412456957">2</xref></sup></p>
<graphic id="img5-1077800412456957" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img5.tif"/>
<p>which contains legal information and resources about sexual assault. Trish’s story has been influenced by the manner in which sexual assault, rape, and victimhood are conceptualized in her current society. From this page the user can follow each link to pre-existing resources on the Internet. This serves two primary purposes: to highlight the connection between Trish’s story and preexisting discourses regarding sexuality; and to provide information for users of the Virtual Quilt who may have want legal and informational resources about their own problematic sexual experiences.</p>
<p>This icon: <inline-graphic id="img6-1077800412456957" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img6.tif"/> will direct the reader to information about sexual assault and alcohol use. Alcohol use was a central feature of Trish’s story, and this link can connect Trish’s story with existent information about alcohol use and sexual assault.</p>
<p>This icon: <inline-graphic id="img7-1077800412456957" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img7.tif"/> directs the user to quotes from other participants that relate to Trish’s story. In this way, Trish’s story is explicitly woven together with the stories of other participants. The particular quotes chosen are those that relate directly or indirectly to Trish’s situation:</p>
<graphic id="img8-1077800412456957" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img8.tif"/>
<p>Each of the icons described earlier connects to one web page and the user will need to return to Trish’s main page in order to connect to other pages. However, by clinking on the text “Trish’s Story” in the center of the patch: <inline-graphic id="img9-1077800412456957" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img9.tif"/> the user is brought to the “plot” of Trish’s story. This is a linear version of Trish’s story, as told by Trish during interviews:</p>
<graphic id="img10-1077800412456957" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img10.tif"/>
<p>This screen shot contains the beginning of Trish’s story, and a user can continue to scroll down to read the entire story. At the bottom of this page are links to the Good Woman Voices, which connect Trish’s stories to feminist theory about the discourses available to young women:</p>
<graphic id="img11-1077800412456957" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img11.tif"/>
<p>For example, by clicking on “The Together Woman” the user will arrive here:</p>
<graphic id="img12-1077800412456957" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img12.tif"/>
<p>One can find the following link on the Together Woman page: <inline-graphic id="img13-1077800412456957" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img13.tif"/>, and be directed to an explanation of discourses. This section would appeal to users that are interested in an academic explanation of discourses:</p>
<graphic id="img14-1077800412456957" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img14.tif"/>
<p>From this page, a user can click on the icons to the right of the text to receive more information about specific discourses related to this text. For example, this icon: <inline-graphic id="img15-1077800412456957" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img15.tif"/> links to information about discourses of sexual assault:</p>
<graphic id="img16-1077800412456957" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img16.tif"/>
<p>The examples of discourses end this series of links, but a user can always return to homepage in order to continue to explore the website.</p>
<p>All of the web pages described thus far are accessible from Trish’s main patch page. However, by returning to the main screen, a user can click on the borders of Trish’s patch: <inline-graphic id="img17-1077800412456957" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img17.tif"/> to be directed to additional information. The top border links to the main discourse page, as pictured previously. Clicking on the left border of Trish’s patch will bring the user to information about the sexual assault labeling literature. This connects Trish’s story (and by extension the user) to the existent research regarding this specific subject matter. The uniqueness of Trish’s story can be seen as part of a larger phenomenon that puzzles social science researchers. The user can gain a sense of how Trish’s story would be evaluated and understood by experts in the field. The bottom border links to information about the millennial generation and sex and this information historicizes Trish’s story within the context of her generation. The right border directs the user to a discussion board where members of the quilt community can comment.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two links at the bottom of the homepage. The first link: <inline-graphic id="img18-1077800412456957" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img18.tif"/></p>
<p>leads the user to the rationale, which places the research question within a larger discussion of young women’s sexuality and sexual victimization:</p>
<graphic id="img19-1077800412456957" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img19.tif"/>
<p>and goals:</p>
<graphic id="img20-1077800412456957" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1077800412456957-img20.tif"/>
<p>behind the project. Both the rationale and goals are on the same page.</p>
<p>As a prototype, this mock quilt is not intended to represent a final version of the quilt. The screen shots presented throughout this article are static images and only contain a small portion of the text, links, and images contained in the virtual quilt prototype. One goal of creating a virtual quilt was to present a text that is fluid, connected, and accessible. The design on the main page as well as each individual patch can be determined and modified by the researcher and participants. In addition, the entire structure of the quilt may be modified depending on the number of squares/stories and the intended users of the quilt.</p>

<sec id="section6-1077800412456957">
<title>The Metaphor Made Explicit</title>
<p>A physical patchwork quilt is composed of individual patches sewn together. The patches often have appliqués that vary with each patch. The connecting threads between the patches tie them together as a whole. The backing of a quilt is a single sheet of fabric and can generally only be seen if the quilt is turned over, but it is fundamental to the structure of the quilt. In between these two layers is the batting, which helps give the quilt shape and provide warmth. This is perhaps the least visible layer of the quilt, and it is often seen only by the quilter. Those who know quilt structure, however, are aware that the batting is in place and is a fundamental part of the entire quilt.</p>
<p>The virtual quilt is comprised of all these pieces, and the metaphor is extended throughout the following paragraphs. The individual participant stories are represented by the patches. They are varied, can stand on their own, and contain a multitude of images and meanings. The background fabric for the patch squares represents each plot voice (the “what happened”), and the appliqués link to various sources of information and other content. In this sense the individual stories are connected to sources outside of individual participant subjectivities that help shape each subjectivity and story. These individual patches are held together by the research and theory regarding young women’s sexuality. These are the connecting threads between patches. One of these threads is left open for young women themselves to comment on (the Discussion Board section) and the other threads are drawn from academic literature.</p>
<p>The backing of the quilt is the research question/problem. It is the reason that the patches were created and it is behind all of the individual stories. One can look at and appreciate the front of the quilt without seeing the back; however, the backing is always there holding the quilt together. Finally, the batting of the quilt is made up of the many social discourses drawn upon throughout the project, including the Good Woman discourses. Like physical batting, discourses are often rendered invisible, but they are “seen” by those who know they are there (e.g., postmodern theorists). Discourses provide structure to meaning making and add “thickness” to social interactions. In this quilt, the Good Woman discourses provide the thick layer of batting. Participants in this study commented on these discourses, and they noted that the discourses made sense. This suggests that the discourses have “substance” that contributes to the thickness of the quilt.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The virtual quilt is a living text that can be utilized to share research findings and further the research process. The quilt is both a research method and product, and it was developed while studying young women’s sexual experiences. However, the virtual patchwork quilt template can be utilized to further research in many different content areas. It is my hope that this research tool can continue to spark innovation in radical qualitative research, particularly in forms of research where the primary goal is evocation rather than representation.</p>
