<p><italic>Invisible Families</italic> by Mignon R. Moore is an exceptional account of lesbian sexuality and family formation among Black women in New York City. Prior to the publication of this book, the majority of research on lesbian families focused on white, middle-class women and was generalized to all families of color. Moore rectifies the marginalization of Black lesbians by focusing exclusively on their family and community experiences.</p>
<p>In her research, Moore employs both qualitative and quantitative methodology. She engaged in participant observation, conducted focus groups, and completed an extensive survey with 100 women. She also conducted in-depth semistructured interviews with 58 respondents who completed the survey. The use of multiple methodologies enabled Moore to evaluate behavior patterns over time and provides a window into the multidimensional lives of Black lesbian families.</p>
<p>In addition to being methodologically meticulous, Moore’s book is theoretically sophisticated. Moore uses the intracategorical approach to intersectionality theory by articulating how social class interacts with race and sexuality. For example, Moore examines both economic disadvantage and class privilege to explicate the development of sexual identity, pathways to lesbian motherhood, individual gender presentations, and notions of respectability in the context of living as openly gay families within Black communities.</p>
<p>The theme of maintaining respectability within the Black community while simultaneously expressing sexual freedom and autonomy recurs throughout <italic>Invisible Families.</italic> This theme is initially articulated in conjunction with specific behavior patterns that are influenced by the intersection of race and class. In the discussion of what Moore calls “Coming into the Life,” she describes the different processes Black women experienced as they acknowledged their lesbian sexuality. Based on her fieldwork, Moore identifies four groups based on sexual identity among her respondents and describes the different tropes women in each category used in their coming out narratives. Straight-up gays are women who recognized and/or acted on their same-sex attraction as adolescents. Conformists were attracted to women as adolescents but conformed to heteronormative gender identity until adulthood. Hetero-identified lesbians are women whose same-sex desire didn’t emerge until adulthood. Sexually fluid women have an ongoing flexibility in their desire for men and women.</p>
<p>Next, Moore examines the gender presentation of Black women in her sample. She provides a more nuanced understanding of gender presentation than has been prevalent in previous research. She demonstrates that past research focusing on white, middle-class lesbians does not apply to the experience of Black gay women. Based on the findings of her research, she reconfigures the traditional butch/femme dichotomy into three distinct categories of gender presentation. These categories are termed femme, gender-bender, and transgressive.</p>
<p>Through the voices of the women she interviews, Moore illustrates the importance of social context in how Black women choose both their public and private presentation of self. Based on intersectionality theory, Moore articulates the different race (American born or Caribbean born) and economic contexts that influence how women understand and embrace their sexuality and how they choose to present their gender identity. Ultimately, she identifies how differences in race, class, and sexuality affect types of Black lesbian families differently. These categories of gender identity and gender presentation reappear throughout the book and relate to the overarching themes of respectability and sexual autonomy.</p>
<p>Categories of sexual identity and gender presentation also affect the different ways Black lesbians become mothers, how they configure their families, and how they experience motherhood. In addition, these categories influence the ways in which Black lesbians experience gendered relationships within their families and how they negotiate Black community and religious life. Throughout the book, Moore clarifies how cultural and religious differences between American-born and Caribbean-born Black women influence their understanding of respectability and sexuality. In addition, Moore does an exceptional job of illustrating how class background, educational attainment, current occupation, and class position influence how Black lesbian women negotiate the often contradictory nature of respectability and lesbian sexuality within the larger communities in which they thrive.</p>
<p><italic>Invisible Families</italic> represents sociological research at its finest. It is a meticulous piece of scholarship that is well written and theoretically sophisticated. Moore provides clear connections between racial and sexual identity in individuals and their relationship to social structural inequality. Moore’s focus on women who have been historically and contemporarily marginalized, and her detailed account of their lives, makes a significant contribution to our understanding of Black lesbian families. Although Moore does provide much insight into the women’s family lives, I would have liked to see more richly descriptive quotes in some sections of the book. For example, in chapter three, the voices of more women in each category would have been especially moving. Nonetheless, this is clearly a groundbreaking book. I highly recommend <italic>Invisible Families: Gay Identities, Relationships, and Motherhood among Black Women</italic> for scholars and nonscholars alike.</p>
