<p><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> Marc Bigras, <italic>Université du Québec à Montréal, Canada</italic></p>
<p>This collective work presents reflections, experiences and research on the psychology of men from authors from nine countries on six continents. In doing so, the editors hoped to get diverse views of masculinity; however, the theoretical orientations of the contributors are in continuity with the “new psychology of men” (NPM) framework, initiated in the 1980s, when researchers and mental health professionals postulated that masculinity (a) is a central organizing principle for all aspects of the life of a man and (b) is socially constructed, that is, one is not born a man but becomes one. If one develops a deep sense of self as a man by means of historical, social and cultural influences, then, as the editors of this book posit, it is worthwhile to study diverse contexts to better understand the phenomenon of masculinity. Are the differences in the ways in which masculinity is presented due to different cultural contexts? If there is a certain consistency in masculinity, is it the result of the hegemony of a transnational dominant model in which men are encouraged to be aggressive, emotionally insensitive, homophobic and anti-feminine?</p>
<p>Chapters in this book explore the possibility that a stereotyped model that seems to prevail in certain cultures may be detrimental to the mental health of men, especially for those who do not comply or struggle to comply with varying levels of success. The successful internalization of stereotypes may not always be beneficial, especially in contexts where men are not encouraged to express emotions and feelings, to physically approach other men to create intimate relationships, or to withdraw from social interactions based on competition. In addition, some chapters specifically address clinical issues related to the consequences of gender role conflict with abundant and rich case illustrations.</p>
<p>The volume provides a thorough and up-to-date review of theoretical perspectives on the concept of masculinity. This book exposes the evolution of views since the launch of the NPM through efforts in integrating concepts provided by essentialist and constructivist perspectives, focus on positive psychology and new methods of data collection. The book also has a strong clinical perspective reporting experiences of multinational clinical and research authors that extended the notion of masculinity and clinical concerns beyond the usual western-oriented psychology.</p>
<p>The superb introduction by the editors of this book, which focuses on the challenges posed by international analysis of masculinity, is unfortunately followed by chapters of uneven quality. Although the authors of the following chapters come from many different parts of the world, their research and clinical experiences often are not put in social or cultural context. The finding of a high degree of convergence across different nations in stereotypes of masculinity and their adverse consequences on men and their community is particularly striking given the theoretical frameworks discussed in this book, which lead the reader to expect much variability in masculinity across contexts. The psychological and sociological mechanisms responsible for this apparent standardization in men’s values, behaviours and dysfunctions need to be detailed. Alternative hypotheses should be discussed as well, such as biological and evolutionary models that could shed light on this important conclusion. A concluding synthesis of the authors’ contributions would have been of great value. Despite these limitations, the book provides a significant contribution to the international study of masculinity through the multiplicity and the great relevance of theoretical views and clinical experiences of the authors.</p></sec>
