<p><italic>Background</italic>. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a treatment modality for many oncologic as well as non-oncologic disorders. Although the side effects of different chemotherapy regimens have been well studied by several oncology consortiums, limited data is available regarding the late adverse effects of HSCT. Furthermore, pediatric-focused post-HSCT follow-up guidelines for primary care pediatricians do not exist. <italic>Objective</italic>: To provide a summary of the most common late adverse effects of HSCT and give the primary care pediatrician guidance and evidence-based information for the screening and management of this patient population. <italic>Design</italic>: The literature was searched using PubMed using keywords, including pediatric bone marrow transplant, hematopoietic stem cell transplant guidelines, pediatric bone marrow transplant guidelines, and pediatric bone marrow transplant immunizations. The most relevant articles out of the hundreds of results were reviewed. <italic>Results</italic>: Based on 9 review articles from the Pediatric Clinics of North America and 3 articles from the Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplant Journal as well as their original references, a summary of the most common late adverse effects after HSCT was constructed. Pediatric HSCT patients have a high incidence of late adverse effects, with 93% of survivors having at least 1 late adverse effect after 7 years of follow-up. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Late adverse effects after pediatric HSCT are common and require close screening and monitoring, which can be done by the primary care provider along with the oncologist.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in children has widely expanded in the past few years. Currently, pediatric patients are receiving stem cell transplants not only for oncological diseases but also for immune deficiencies, blood disorders, and metabolic disorders. With more patients receiving stem cell transplants and with advances in patient and donor selection, preparative regimens, and supportive care, the number of patients surviving has also increased. As the spectrum of patients undergoing and surviving stem cell transplants rises, the role of the primary care physician in the care of these patients also becomes more significant. Once transplanted, many of these patients are considered “cured” and return for their primary care to the general pediatrician. This article describes the basic principles of stem cell transplantation as well as the adverse effects of this procedure, for the benefit of the primary care physicians who may take care of these post-HSCT patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922813483361">
<title>What Is HSCT?</title>
<p>HSCT is a procedure that involves taking new hematopoietic stem cells (blood cell precursors) and transfusing them intravenously into a patient whose own stem cells are failing or diseased. The goal of this procedure is to have these newly transfused cells travel through the patient’s blood stream and reach the bone marrow. Once there, the new stem cells will completely take over or augment the function of the patient’s failing bone marrow and start to produce newly functional blood cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0009922813483361">
<title>History of Stem Cell Transplants</title>
<p>After the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan in World War II, there was significant interest in the effects of irradiation on the human body. It was found that the bone marrow was the organ most sensitive to radiation and that marrow failure was the cause of death after low lethal radiation exposures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813483361">1</xref></sup> In 1949, Jacobson et al discovered that the lethal effects of ionizing radiation were reduced when mice’s spleen or femurs were shielded by lead.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813483361">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813483361">3</xref></sup> Following this, it was proved that protection from radiation effects was also offered by transfusion of bone marrow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813483361">4</xref></sup> This discovery was initially thought to be a result of humoral factors that stimulated marrow regrowth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813483361">1</xref></sup> However, later in the mid-1950s, it was shown by Barnes and Loutit that radiation protection was a result of transplanted stem cells from the bone marrow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813483361">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813483361">5</xref></sup> This discovery led oncologists to believe that “rescue” of bone marrow via transplant after radiation or higher doses of chemotherapy was possible.</p>
<p>Early studies of bone marrow transplants were initiated by E. Donnall Thomas and colleagues in the mid-1950s, and in 1957, they had somewhat unsuccessful results with human HSCT, with only 1 patient undergoing transient engraftment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813483361">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813483361">6</xref></sup> In their study, the remaining patients died because of progressive disease or graft failure. Although only 1 person had transient successful engraftment, these trials proved that relatively large amounts of bone marrow could be safely transfused intravenously if marrow was carefully screened by removing fat and bone particles before infusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813483361">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>George Mathe was the first to show the survival of an allogeneic bone marrow graft in a patient with leukemia in 1965. The patient later succumbed to graft versus host disease (GVHD). In 1972, the first successful transplantations were reported from Seattle in patients with severe aplastic anemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813483361">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Then, Dausset et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813483361">7</xref></sup> and van Rood et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813483361">8</xref></sup> discovered the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system in the 1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813483361">1</xref></sup> HLA is a system of naming antigens on cell surfaces that are related to immunogenicity. HLA antigens are encoded by a series of closely linked alleles on chromosome 6. The series of HLA alleles on a single chromosome 6 is termed a <italic>haplotype</italic>. A genotype is the combination of the 2 parental haplotypes inherited by an individual. The ability to perform DNA typing of HLA alleles was a breakthrough in HSCT, allowing the typing and matching of HLA donors to be precise and quick. These principles have remained almost the same over the years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922813483361">
<title>Types of HSCT</title>
<p>There are several different types of HSCT named for the relationship between the recipient and the donor. An allogeneic transplant is a transplant from individuals of the same species. These transplants can be further classified into matched and mismatched, and from a related or unrelated donor. The transplant is considered to be allogeneic matched if all the desired HLA antigens are completely matched between the donor and the recipient. If there is incomplete matching or mismatching, it is considered an allogeneic mismatched transplant. Approximately 25% to 35% of potential transplant recipients in the United States will have a matched sibling donor and because of the efforts of the National Marrow Donor Program and worldwide registries, approximately 75% of Caucasian individuals will find a suitably matched unrelated donor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813483361">9</xref></sup> All random and family donors are screened around 30 days prior to their donation for common blood-borne viruses and risk factors for transmission of genetic or infectious diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813483361">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cord blood transplant is a process where stem cells from the umbilical cord of a genetically matched or closely matched anonymous donor are used. More than 185 US hospitals have onsite umbilical cord collection programs. These programs accept donations for public cord banks. A list of participating hospitals is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://BeTheMatch.org/donatecord">http://BeTheMatch.org/donatecord</ext-link>. The national registry list is available for any patient in need. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends cord blood banking in public banks for use by the general population; they discourage private banking for personal or family use.</p>
<p>An autologous transplant uses the recipient’s own stem cells. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813483361">Table 1</xref>, we compare the 3 most common types of stem cell harvesting and describe the procedures and risks and benefits.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a set of stem cells present in the bone marrow along with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These are marrow stromal cells that are able to develop into fibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocyte progenitors. These MSCs provide growth factors, cell-to-cell interactions, and matrix proteins that regulate hematopoiesis. They also promote engraftment of HSCs (in animal models). MSCs are primarily found in the bone marrow, but they may be also found in the periosteum, muscle connective tissue, and human amniotic fluid. Some reports describe MSCs being isolated from peripheral blood stimulated by G-CSF and in umbilical cord blood. Because there is some doubt as to the ability of MSCs to be able to self-renew at the single-cell level, they are now called multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells.</p>

<p>Dextrose citrate is given during apheresis to prevent blood from clotting in the blood cell separator. The citrate binds to the calcium and helps prevent clotting. Low calcium can cause tingling, numbness of lips, toes, and fingers. These side effects are treated with calcium gluconate.</p>

<title>Broad Indications</title>
<p>Indications for HSCT include malignant or nonmalignant conditions that affect the function of the bone marrow. In some patients with malignancies, HSCT is used after the patient is subjected to chemotherapy and/or radiation that destroy not only the patient’s cancer cells but also the patient’s own bone marrow. Thus, after the accepted protocol of chemotherapy and/or radiation, the patient may be a candidate for HSCT to replace the bone marrow.</p>
<p>Autologous HSCT has been used for refractory Hodgkin’s disease, relapsed non-Hodgkin disease, metastatic Ewing sarcoma, relapsed or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma, and high-risk neuroblastoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813483361">11</xref></sup> HSCT can also improve the prognosis in malignancies such as leukemias, lymphomas, myeloproliferative disorders, and myelodysplastic syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813483361">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>One-third of pediatric patients undergo HSCT to treat a nononcological disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813483361">12</xref></sup> Nonmalignant conditions for which HSCT is commonly used include diseases of hematopoietic cell line dysfunction such as sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemia or immune deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813483361">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813483361">14</xref></sup> Also HSCT, has been used in some inborn errors of metabolism and is currently the standard therapy for Hurler syndrome (MPS1H), childhood cerebral x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, late-onset metachromatic dystrophy, and early-onset globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813483361">15</xref></sup> In addition, it can be used in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile idiopathic arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813483361">16</xref></sup> In these nonmalignant conditions, the aim is to introduce cell lines that will produce normal cells and replace the defective cells either totally or partially.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922813483361">
<title>Side Effects</title>
<p>Most of the immediate side effects after HSCT will be addressed by the patient’s transplant team. The late and persistent effects after HSCT are more important for the primary care physician.</p>
<p>Based on 9 review articles from the <italic>Pediatric Clinics of North America</italic> and 3 articles from the <italic>Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplant Journal</italic> as well as their original references, a summary of the most common late adverse effects after HSCT was constructed. Pediatric HSCT patients have a high incidence of late adverse effects, with 93% of survivors having at least 1 late adverse effect after 7 years of follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref></sup> As the primary care physician becomes more involved in the care of the post–stem cell transplant patient, the following effects will be important to recognize.</p>
<sec id="section7-0009922813483361">
<title>Cardiovascular Effects</title>
<p>It is known that there is a high risk of cardiovascular mortality among childhood cancer survivors. Similarly, after HSCT, it has been shown that there is a higher risk of mortality from cardiovascular events as compared with the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref></sup> The Bone Marrow Transplant Survivor Study showed that survivors of allogeneic HSCT were found to be 3.65 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.82-7.32) more likely to report diabetes mellitus than siblings and 2.06 times (95% CI = 1.39-3.04) more likely to report hypertension than siblings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813483361">18</xref></sup> This likely contributes to more cardiovascular events as they age. Long-term screening of cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and hypertension is necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0009922813483361">
<title>Metabolic Syndrome</title>
<p>In addition to the above-described increase in cardiovascular risk, in a study done with 59 patients (23 leukemia patients status post-HSCT, 13 patients in remission from leukemia without HSCT, and 23 healthy age- and sex-matched controls), the following were most common among the HSCT patient group: hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol, and abdominal obesity. Signs of metabolic syndrome were found in 39% of HSCT survivors versus 8% of leukemia controls and 0% of healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813483361">19</xref></sup> Total body irradiation plays a role in insulin resistance. It is therefore important to screen children for modifiable risk factors to reduce the overall cardiovascular risk.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0009922813483361">
<title>Pulmonary Function</title>
<p>Pulmonary function may be affected by preconditioning chemotherapeutic agents such as busulfan or by radiation, which can affect pulmonary function and restrict lung growth. Furthermore, restrictive pulmonary dysfunction is a common late effect after HSCT and has been found in 20% to 40% of childhood HSCT survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813483361">20</xref></sup> After HSCT, pulmonary function declines in the first 1 to 2 years, with some improvement in subsequent years, but never returns to normal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813483361">20</xref></sup> Fortunately, most children have only mild to moderate pulmonary function abnormalities and are asymptomatic, with the impairment diagnosed only on pulmonary function tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0009922813483361">
<title>Endocrine Effects</title>
<p>There is a high prevalence of endocrine diseases in HSCT survivors. Conditioning regimens are the cause for most of these abnormalities. Abnormalities involving thyroid function, puberty, fertility, bone health, and growth and development are all commonly reported.</p>
<p>Thyroid dysfunction has been found in around 50% of survivors and occurs in approximately 15% of patients within the first year after transplant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813483361">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813483361">22</xref></sup> Radiation and busulfan are particularly implicated in thyroid impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813483361">23</xref></sup> Abnormalities include overt hypothyroidism, compensated hypothyroidism, secondary thyroid cancer, and rarely thyrotoxicosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref></sup> Overt hypothyroidism may take years to develop but has been associated with patients younger than 9 years old, patients who received single-dose total body irradiation, and patients in complete remission after HSCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813483361">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813483361">22</xref></sup> For all patients post-HSCT the hypothalamic-pituitary axis appears intact and reacts appropriately and increases the levels of luteinizing hormone and follicular stimulating hormone when delayed puberty, amenorrhea, and/or azoospermia is present. Unfortunately, gonadal dysfunction is observed in 92% of male and 99% of female patients after HSCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813483361">21</xref></sup> Prepubertal girls can tolerate higher doses of alkylating agents because of the higher number of ovarian follicles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref></sup> Girls who receive chemotherapy prior to puberty may enter puberty and progress normally and may have normal ovarian function; postpubertal girls usually have amenorrhea and irreversible ovarian failure. Among male patients, puberty is often delayed, and high-dose chemotherapy and radiation can cause damage to the testicular germinal epithelium. The Leydig cells seem more resistant and are still able to produce normal amounts of testosterone. However, the Sertoli cells are damaged, leading to dysfunctional spermatogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref></sup> For both sexes, infertility is almost inevitable after transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813483361">21</xref></sup> If the patient is considering a family in the future, sperm or embryo preservation should be discussed.</p>
<p>In addition to effects on fertility and the thyroid, preconditioning radiation, especially craniospinal radiation and total body irradiation affects growth. Growth is a multifactorial process, which involves genetics, nutrition, hormones, and psychological factors. HSCT usually has an impact on all these factors and, thus, patients are at risk for alterations in growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813483361">24</xref></sup> In a prospective study among 49 pediatric HSCT patients, the most profound loss of bone mineral density (BMD) was within the first 6 months following HSCT, similar to what has been reported in adults. In this study, some children showed recovery; however, 33% remained osteopenic and 19% osteoporotic at 1 year following HSCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813483361">25</xref></sup> The age at which HSCT takes place has an integral role on growth potential, with children younger than 10 years having more growth problems. This is thought to be a result of multiple insults to the growth process, including decreased growth hormone production and damage to epiphyseal growth plates, leading to premature fusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922813483361">26</xref></sup> Pubertal growth may be affected as a result of poor gonadal function, as mentioned above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref></sup> Treatment prescribed is growth hormone replacement if there is documented growth hormone deficiency; however, this does not seem to result in catch-up growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922813483361">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another endocrine late side effect after HSCT is decreased BMD.

<title>Renal Effects</title>
<p>Both acute and chronic renal failures occur in the setting of HSCT. Factors causing acute renal failure in the posttransplant setting include chemotherapy and radiation, medications used during HSCT (calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine), extreme fluid shift, veno-occlusive disease of the liver, hepatorenal syndrome, sepsis, and the antimicrobial agents used to treat infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref></sup> Chronic renal failure is caused by radiation-induced kidney injury and chronic GVHD (cGVHD).</p>

<title>Gastrointestinal Effects</title>
<p>Most of the patients undergoing HSCT have some amount of gastrointestinal injury. Gastrointestinal involvement is also seen in acute GVHD (aGVHD). Most luminal problems are acute and reversible in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section13-0009922813483361">
<title>Hepatic Effects</title>
<p>Elevated liver enzymes are frequently found both in the acute setting after HSCT and in the long term. Studies in children and adults have shown that 10% to 57% will have persistently or recurrently elevated liver enzymes 1 to 10 years after transplant. Fortunately, in most HSCT survivors with elevated liver enzymes, synthetic and metabolic liver function is preserved, and patients are asymptomatic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922813483361">29</xref></sup> Long-term elevation of liver enzymes can be caused by chronic hepatitis B or C (less common since screening of blood products has been implemented), iron overload, cGVHD, or autoimmune hepatitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922813483361">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922813483361">30</xref></sup> In some patients, the cause of elevated liver enzymes is not found. Also reported after chemotherapy or HSCT is the presence of focal nodular hyperplasia, the second most common benign tumor of the liver. This can often mimic metastases or secondary malignant tumors. MRI is diagnostic, and no malignant transformation or complications have been reported to date, but it is recommended that the patient have long-term follow-up imaging surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922813483361">31</xref></sup></p>

Xerostomia (caused by radiation), gingivitis, abnormal development of teeth (tooth agenesis, hypodontia, microdontia, enamel hypoplasia, malformed roots, and taurodontia), delayed eruption, overretention of primary teeth, and increased caries index have been associated with HSCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922813483361">32</xref>

<title>Neurocognition</title>
<p>As more pediatric patients survive longer after HSCT, neurocognitive development has become a more studied area. It has been shown that there is a small but significant drop in IQ for post-HSCT children, those who received total body irradiation or craniospinal radiation, and those who developed aGVHD. However, many of these studies have been inconclusive because of a high attrition rate and the use of different neurocognitive developmental scales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813483361">17</xref></sup> Socioeconomic status and pre-HSCT IQ were found to be good indicators for post-HSCT functioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0009922813483361">37</xref></sup> Further studies are under way.</p>

<title>Immune Reconstitution</title>
<p>Immune system reconstitution is a slow process that occurs approximately 1 to 2 years after transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813483361">21</xref></sup> The length of recovery of the immune system depends on the conditioning regimen and the type of graft received. Neutrophil recovery occurs at 2 weeks after recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood stem cell grafts, 3 weeks after marrow grafts, and 4 weeks after umbilical cord blood grafts. After neutrophil recovery, production of monocytes, natural killer cells, platelets, and red cells start to recover. Next, CD8 T cell production occurs at 2 to 8 months after HSCT, and then, the recovery of B cells takes place at 3 to 12 months posttransplant. Finally, CD4 T cells recover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813483361">9</xref></sup> Because of this timing, CD4 counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio have been shown to be the most predictive markers for immune reconstitution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813483361">21</xref></sup> Also, because of this slow recovery, infectious risks are highest in the first 2 years after transplant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813483361">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most children require reimmunization after HSCT because they have a “new” immune system. The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplants recommends revaccination at 6 to 24 months, which includes live vaccines at approximately 24 months for patients without signs of GVHD and who are no longer receiving immunosuppressants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813483361">9</xref></sup> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends giving killed vaccines 1 year post-HSCT and live vaccines at 2 years.

<title>Graft Versus Host Disease</title>
<p>A complication unique to allogeneic and cord blood stem cell transplant recipients is graft versus host disease. aGVHD occurs within the first 100 days after transplant. cGVHD appears after 100 days. Donor T cells present in the graft recognize the recipient’s organs as “foreign” and start attacking the tissues of the recipient. The incidence of GVHD is lower in children (20%-50%) when compared with that in adults (60%-70%). Unfortunately, the incidence in children is rising with the use of peripheral blood HSCT and transplant from unrelated donors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0009922813483361">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Acute GVHD usually involves the skin, liver, and GI tract. The severity is determined by the extent of the rash, elevation of bilirubin, the volume of diarrhea (lower GI involvement), and nausea (upper GI involvement). Diagnosis is made through biopsy of skin, liver, or gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Any allogeneic recipient is at risk for cGVHD but those who had aGVHD are at a higher risk. Manifestations of cGVHD include skin fibrosis; joint contractions; eye involvement in 80%, including cataracts or sicca syndrome; mouth sores or dry mouth; change in taste; gastrointestinal upset; and lung toxicity in 30% to 60%. cGVHD is the most significant nonrelapse cause of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic HSCT for malignant disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0009922813483361">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Treatment of GVHD is based on severity and progression of symptoms and may include steroids, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, etanercept, and other immunosuppressants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0009922813483361">40</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>HSCT is now becoming more common, and its use is now being extended to many more childhood diseases. More than 40 000 HSCTs are performed worldwide each year. With this many procedures performed each year, there are tens of thousands of HSCT survivors alive today. As this new way of treating “incurable” diseases becomes more popular and more extensively studied, this patient population will grow in the primary care physician’s practice. Consequently, the primary care physician’s role becomes more central in the future maintenance of health and wellness of this unique patient population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922813483361">Table 3</xref>). Late adverse effects after pediatric HSCT are common and require close screening and monitoring, which can be done in collaboration with the primary care pediatrician and oncologist.</p>
