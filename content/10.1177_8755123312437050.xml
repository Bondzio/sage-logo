<abstract>
<p>This review of the literature presents a systematic analysis of the capabilities and limitations of cochlear implant (CI) recipients with regard to music perception. Specifically, it (a) analyzes individual components of music (e.g., rhythm, timbre, and pitch) as they interface with the technical characteristics of CIs and the perceptual abilities of the recipients and (b) describes accommodations for music instruction that support successful participation of children with CIs. This article consolidates research studies from various disciplines (audiology, hearing science, speech–language pathology, CIs, and music therapy) to provide practical recommendations for educators in fostering the musical growth of children with CIs.</p>

<body>
<p>The cochlear implant (CI) is an assistive hearing device designed for persons with severe and profound deafness, who receive little benefit from hearing aids. While conventional hearing aids essentially amplify sound waves and transmit the signals via the ear canal, CIs support audition through electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. The external components of the CI (microphone and speech processor) pick up sound signals and filter and extract sound waves that are considered important for speech perception. These processed signals are delivered directly to the internal electrode array surgically inserted into the cochlea to stimulate auditory nerves, and then they are transmitted to the auditory central pathway for interpretation. Because the technical characteristics of the CI are different from conventional hearing aids, music perception by CI recipients will differ in important ways from that of hearing aid users.</p>
<p>Although the input of sounds heard through the CI device does not provide an exact replica of normal hearing (NH), the literature indicates that many children derive impressive benefits from the implants in speech and language development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-8755123312437050">Robbins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-8755123312437050">Spencer, Barker, &amp; Tomblin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-8755123312437050">Tomblin, Barker, Spencer, Zhang, &amp; Gantz, 2005</xref>). This has allowed many pediatric CI recipients to attend mainstream schools. As outcomes for speech reception have improved there has been increasing interest in the perception of music, an acoustic signal for which current CI technology is not optimally suited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-8755123312437050">Looi, 2008</xref>). Families are increasingly hopeful that implant benefits can expand beyond spoken communication to include music participation and enjoyment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8755123312437050">Gfeller, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The article reviews studies from the fields of audiology, hearing science, speech–language pathology, CIs, and music therapy, with an emphasis on those studies that include stimuli and task responses required in music instruction. It also interprets the applicability of what are often highly controlled and abstract perceptual tasks in a laboratory setting to typical music listening or production requirements for successful music participation. Consequently, this review provides a practical resource for music educators as they make decisions about appropriate educational and enrichment experiences for pediatric CI recipients.</p>
<p>Music participation for children with CIs is complex, in part because music encompasses a diverse continuum of very simple patterns (e.g., electronically generated pure tones) to highly complex combinations. It is important to systematically analyze particular structural components of music as they interface with the CI in order to determine more clearly the feasibility of specific aspects of music instruction. In addition, response to music is likely to differ from one CI recipient to the next given the variability in hearing history, life experiences, and developmental level in functional areas that support musical skills (e.g., cognition, motor skills, etc.).</p>
<p>A comparison of studies with children and adult CI recipients indicates that children have similar outcomes with regard to the perceptual acuity of the isolated stimuli of rhythm, timbre, and pitch. Thus, studies concerning adult CI recipients provide general trends with regard to the perception of the key structural components of music. However, prelingually deaf children may differ from postlingually deaf adults in their use of contextual cues (e.g., memory of melodic rhythms) in recognition tests using familiar songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-8755123312437050">Olszewski, Gfeller, Froman, Stordahl, &amp; Tomblin, 2005</xref>). Further-more, children whose entire experience with music has been through a CI may have less stringent expectations than postlingually deaf adults about what constitutes aesthetically pleasing sound quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Witt, Spencer, Stordahl, &amp; Tomblin, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The following section summarizes findings with regard to the music perception of pediatric CI recipients. Results of studies with adults have been included if the findings could be generalized to music instruction for children. Accommodations in instructional methods that can support successful participation by children with CIs are discussed.</p>

<sec id="section2-8755123312437050">
<title>Rhythm</title>
<p>Musical tasks associated with rhythm that have been systematically examined include discrimination of changes in tempo, identification of different meters, discrimination of simple rhythmic patterns, recognition of rhythmic patterns held at a steady tempo, and adaptive tests (increases or decreases in the rate of stimulus presentation) that establish a threshold of accuracy for rhythm pattern identification. Excluding the results of adaptive tasks that push perceptual limits (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Woodworth, Witt, Robin, &amp; Knutson, 1997</xref>), CI recipients have shown similar accuracy in rhythm-based tasks when compared with NH peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Christ, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8755123312437050">Gfeller &amp; Lansing, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437050">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-8755123312437050">Kong, Cruz, Jones, &amp; Zeng, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-8755123312437050">Leal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-8755123312437050">Looi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-8755123312437050">Schultz &amp; Kerber, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-8755123312437050">Vongpaisal, Trehub, &amp; Schellenberg, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although research studies typically use more controlled rhythmic patterns than those contained in “real-world” music, the perceptual requirements are similar to several tasks found in music instruction (e.g., differentiating a march from a waltz or imitating rhythmic patterns). Perception of melodic rhythm can also help CI recipients recognize simple melodies such as “Happy Birthday,” which have distinct rhythmic patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Christ, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Turner, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Witt, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-8755123312437050">Hsiao, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-8755123312437050">Olszewski, Gfeller, Froman, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-8755123312437050">Olszewski, Gfeller, &amp; Zhang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-8755123312437050">Olszewski, Gfeller, &amp; Driscoll, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, because CI recipients perform similarly to NH persons on rhythm perception tasks, most children with implants should be capable of successful participation in and enjoyment of music tasks that primarily require the perception of rhythmic patterns. This is especially true if the rhythmic stimuli are not obscured by competing sounds, if patterns are played at a moderate tempo, and if the child’s cognitive skills can support the attention and memory components of the task.</p>

<title>Timbre Recognition</title>
<p>In studies with CI recipients, timbre recognition has typically involved the identification of musical instruments played individually or in blends (e.g., in an ensemble; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Knutson, Woodworth, Witt, &amp; DeBus, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-8755123312437050">Looi, 2008</xref>). Research indicates that CI recipients are significantly less accurate than NH listeners on instrument identification tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437050">Fujita &amp; Ito, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Witt, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-8755123312437050">Looi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-8755123312437050">Schulz &amp; Kerber, 1994</xref>). The CI provides sufficient information to enable discrimination between instruments with contrasting sounds (e.g., flute and piano), though not at an optimal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-8755123312437050">Looi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-8755123312437050">Stainsby, 2001</xref>). Single musical instruments tend to be easier to identify than more complex combinations or blends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-8755123312437050">Looi, 2008</xref>). However, pediatric CI recipients whose educational plans have not included music instruction in school may demonstrate less accuracy in instrument identification because of less exposure to instrumental sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437050">Gfeller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Witt, et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Timbre recognition of CI users can improve significantly as a result of systematic training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437050">Driscoll, Oleson, &amp; Gfeller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Witt, et al., 2002</xref>). For example, children discriminate and recognize timbre sounds better as long as the characteristics of each instrument presented are sufficiently distinct (Gfeller, Driscoll, Kenworthy, &amp; Van Voorst, in press). To ensure success in music instruction, music educators should begin with instruments that have a sufficiently different tone quality for discrimination tasks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-8755123312437050">
<title>Timbre Appraisal</title>
<p>Appraisal involves the evaluation of tone quality on dimensions of pleasantness or the characterizations (e.g., brilliant vs. dull, thin vs. full; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 1998</xref>). CI recipients rate musical instruments as less enjoyable than NH listeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-8755123312437050">Looi, 2008</xref>). Though individuals’ preferences vary, group data indicate that some instruments sound less pleasant through a CI than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Witt, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-8755123312437050">Looi, 2008</xref>). For example, studies have shown that CI recipients ranked the following instruments from most to least pleasant thus: piano, flute, trumpet, and violin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Witt, et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Appraisal is influenced by factors such as onset of hearing loss or individual expectations. For example, children with early-onset deafness may find the tone quality of instruments more satisfactory than some adults whose memory for instrumental timbre prior to hearing loss is still strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437050">Gfeller, 2000</xref>). Music educators who teach children with CIs should experiment with various instruments outside the regular class time to identify the most and least pleasing instruments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-8755123312437050">
<title>Pitch and Melody</title>
<p>Numerous studies indicate that CI users are significantly less accurate than NH persons on a variety of pitch-based tasks such as discrimination (determining if two sounds patterns are the same or different, e.g., frequency difference limens), pitch ranking (determining if one pitch is higher or lower than a reference pitch), recognition (being able to identify a particular interval, a pitch pattern, or a melody), and production (being able to correctly sing an interval, a pitch pattern, or a melody; matching an external pitch by singing or tuning an instrument; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-8755123312437050">Galvin, Fu, &amp; Nogaki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-8755123312437050">Gefeller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Turner, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-8755123312437050">Hsiao, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-8755123312437050">Kong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-8755123312437050">Kong, Stickney, &amp; Zeng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-8755123312437050">Looi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-8755123312437050">Nakata, Trehub, Mitani, &amp; Kanda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-8755123312437050">Stordahl, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-8755123312437050">Sucher &amp; McDermott, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-8755123312437050">Vongpaisal et al., 2006</xref>). Considerable variability has also been found among CI recipients. For example, a small proportion of children with implants may be able to distinguish intervals as small as a semitone across portions of their listening range, whereas many may be unable to detect changes smaller than 3 to 8 semitones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Children with congenital or very early-onset deafness differ from persons with postlingual deafness in that they lack a mental representation for what constitutes pitch and “normal” pitch relations among notes within musical scales. The concept of “high” versus “low” musical sounds, although somewhat abstract even for NH preschoolers, can be particularly problematic for young pediatric CI recipients. For example, a sequence of notes in an ascending musical scale may sound to some recipients like only one pitch. Others may perceive a change in pitch, but the magnitude of pitch change may be compressed or distorted; they may also perceive pitch reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-8755123312437050">McDermott, 2004</xref>). These perceptual difficulties affect everyday musical tasks such as recognition of simple melodies (e.g., “Happy Birthday” and “Twinkle, Twinkle”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Jiang, Oleson, Driscoll, &amp; Knutson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-8755123312437050">Hsiao, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-8755123312437050">Olszewski, Gfeller, &amp; Zhang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-8755123312437050">Stordahl, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most challenging pitch-based task for many CI recipients is accurate production of pitch, as is required when singing a melody, when singing in tune with an external pitch (e.g., an accompaniment or other voices), or when tuning a musical instrument. Objective testing of singing by pediatric CI recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-8755123312437050">Nakata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-8755123312437050">Xu et al., 2009</xref>) indicated that children with CIs were significantly less accurate than NH children with regard to pitch matching, overall frequency range, and production of intervals.</p>
<p>Because singing in tune is especially difficult for many CI recipients, major accommodations are necessary. There are some outliers who may be able to participate successfully within portions of the vocal range or produce partial approximations of the sounds. In addition, at a younger age, many children with NH are not completely accurate in singing melodic patterns. Thus, a CI recipient may still be able to join in on some singing activities without undesirable embarrassment or disruption to the entire class. This accommodation hinges on a flexible attitude of the educator in modifying instructional methods or objectives.</p>
<p>On the other hand, learning instruments, such as the piano or keyboard, that provide a constant pitch and a visual representation of pitches, intervals, and chords is helpful. This allows CI recipients to check their auditory perceptions against a visual model of the sound being produced. As a result, some CI recipients have improved their perceptual acuity for the isolated pitches in a music scale through dedicated practice in playing and listening to the keyboard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437050">Gfeller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-8755123312437050">Yucel, Sennaroglu, &amp; Belgin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, any musical task that requires perception or production of pitch and melody is likely to be quite challenging for many CI recipients. Music instructors should understand that aural limitations for pitch perception are related to the characteristics of the CI and do not reflect lack of effort, intelligence, or compliance with teaching. Keep in mind, however, that individual CI recipients may show greater perceptual accuracy for sounds in different pitch ranges, depending on the specific frequencies presented. It is difficult to predict precisely the extent of success that each CI user will experience in pitch-based music tasks. Some children may show improved pitch perception with considerable practice; for others who show little change as a result of instruction, focusing instruction on other goals is advisable. Accommodations in instructional objectives (e.g., larger intervals or more modest outcomes) can help a CI user participate successfully in music instruction.</p>

<title>Song Lyrics</title>
<p>Although not considered a structural component of music per se, song lyrics are often paired with musical sound patterns. In fact, the lyrics may assist CI recipients in song recognition more than pitches or melodic patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-8755123312437050">Hsiao, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-8755123312437050">Olszewski, Gfeller, Froman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-8755123312437050">Olszewski, Gfeller, &amp; Zhang, 2005</xref>). Research involving recorded music of television theme songs indicates that young CI recipients are able to recognize these songs most effectively when the music is presented in the original version, which may include lyrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-8755123312437050">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-8755123312437050">Vongpaisal et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The extent to which lyrics assist song recognition is influenced by the familiarity of vocabulary in the lyrics, the tempo at which the lyrics are sung, modifications in phoneme production associated with singing (the singer’s formant, changes in production associated with particular vocal styles such as opera, rock music, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8755123312437050">Gregg &amp; Scherer, 2006</xref>), or the masking properties of instrumental accompaniments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437050">Buzzell, Gfeller, Driscoll, &amp; Kinnaird, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8755123312437050">Fetterman &amp; Domico, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, song lyrics can be helpful in perceiving, enjoying, and singing along to music. However, the benefit is likely to be greater if songs have suitable vocabulary, are sung without accompaniment (or quiet accompaniment), and are sung in a clear and natural style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Olszewski, Turner, Gantz, &amp; Oleson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-8755123312437050">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-8755123312437050">Stordahl, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-8755123312437050">Vongpaisal et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, CI recipients as a group perform similarly to NH persons in rhythm-based tasks but less accurately on perception of timbre. Pitch perception is the most problematic listening task for CI recipients, which affects determination of pitch changes, melodic pattern recognition, and singing or playing instruments in tune. These research studies highlight the importance of judicious selection of musical stimuli, response tasks, and environmental conditions for children to achieve satisfying musical instruction.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Though CI recipients tend to be less accurate than NH individuals on perceptual tasks involving pitch and timbre, considerable intrasubject and intersubject variability has been found. For example, one CI recipient may do very well on instrument identification but perform quite poorly on melody recognition. On the other hand, one implant recipient may require very large pitch changes (e.g., two octaves) for pitch-ranking tasks, whereas another may accurately perceive a semitone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, though group data provide some general predictors of which musical tasks are more amenable to children with implants, individualized assessment is important when choosing musical instruction and setting educational objectives for each child. For example, the teacher may conduct informal perceptual testing of music skills, such as the ability to determine the direction of pitch changes or the size of an interval that can be perceived.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges CI recipients face in developing aural skills, children with implants can succeed in many types of musical activities as long as instructional methods and goals are suitably matched to the individual child’s strengths and limitations. Some accommodations to outcome objectives may be required, including less demanding or complex listening examples, extra repetition and time, and alternative tasks or modified expectations that are acceptable for use in the group lessons. A child may be integrated more successfully into music classes if the educator evaluates the relative difficulty of various lesson components and supplements the instruction with additional tutoring.</p>
<p>It is also essential to understand that aural difficulties affecting music perception should not be considered the “fault” or weakness of the child. Music perception is not highly correlated with intelligence or speech perception skills. Thus, a very intelligent child who has excellent speech perception may still find pitch perception problematic. This limitation is primarily a reflection of the technical constraints of signal processing specific to individual components of musical structures such as pitch.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a quiet acoustic environment with little reverberation, quality sound equipment, and music played at moderate volume can enhance music perception and enjoyment for CI recipients. More time spent listening to music and receiving formal training (e.g., music classes or lessons, focused training) may improve accuracy on pitch discrimination, pitch pattern recognition, complex song recognition, solo instrument recognition, and appraisal of solo instruments and complex songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8755123312437050">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-8755123312437050">Galvin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312437050">Gfeller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-8755123312437050">Rocca &amp; Tucker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-8755123312437050">Yuba, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-8755123312437050">Yucel et al., 2009</xref>). Providing opportunities to observe the singer or the instrumentalist for visual cues, written lyrics or musical scores (as appropriate) for tracking, and contextual cues that support recognition (e.g., information about what is being heard), as well as ample exposure to particular songs, can also be helpful in enhancing participation and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Christ, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312437050">Gfeller, Witt, et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, this review of the literature presents a systematic analysis of the capabilities and limitations of CI recipients with regard to music perception. Individual components of music such as rhythm, timbre, and pitch and their interface with the technical characteristics of CIs are analyzed. Because CIs provide poor pitch resolution and atypical timbral quality, successful participation in music instruction will require that music educators understand the technical restrictions of the CI and its influence on the child’s perception of musical sounds. In addition, pedagogical flexibility, such as a willingness to use trial and error, modify the curriculum or instructional methods, and establish more realistic expectations about the individual child’s needs, will also be necessary.</p>
