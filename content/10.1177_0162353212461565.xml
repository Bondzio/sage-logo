<abstract>
<p>This study explored the possible selves of high-ability African American males attending a specialized school for high-ability students. To this end, interviews were conducted with nine students. Results provided details about the hoped-for and feared selves the young men envisioned as well as the strategies these youth utilized to realize and avoid these possibilities for their future. The interviews also demonstrated the impact of family, the specialized school’s culture, their neighborhoods, and racism on the possibilities the young men envisioned for themselves.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212461565">Gill (2003)</xref> explored academic self-concept in a sophomore cohort of high-ability students at a residential academy for students who were gifted and talented in math and science. Consistent with Marsh’s theory that academic self-concept falls for students who attend programs for the gifted and talented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212461565">Marsh &amp; Hua, 2003</xref>), the average value for academic self-concept decreased from 52.02 to 47.13 during the course of their first semester at the Academy. Surprisingly, however, decreases in academic self-concept were the greatest for a group of African American males (and several Latinos), causing the reader to question whether the school setting was especially detrimental for young men of color.</p>
<p>An intriguing new approach to investigating self-concept in African American students is the study of possible selves. When considering possible selves in African American adolescents, several researchers have linked differing academic goals to the possible selves of different ethnic groups and speak to academic possible selves being hampered by racial and gender stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212461565">Anderman, Anderman, &amp; Griesinger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212461565">Kao, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212461565">Oyserman, Bybee, &amp; Terry, 2006</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212461565">Kao (2000)</xref> reported that the fear of being seen as incompetent could comprise the possible selves of African American high school adolescents. Yet, their peers frowned upon going overboard in pursuit of academic excellence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212461565">Kao’s (2000)</xref> findings notwithstanding, much of the research that examines possible selves in African American students generally, and males specifically, focuses on the experience of delinquent youth and youth not identified as gifted. Although these studies offer promising insight, one cannot be sure that the experience of these youth is represented in the experience of high-ability African American males and vice versa. Thus, in response to the severity of the decrease for some African American males in this type of setting, the purpose of this study was the examination of possible selves in African American males attending a specialized school for high-ability youth.</p>

<title>Possible Selves</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212461565">Markus and Nurius (1986)</xref> make the argument that the self is more dynamic than what is presented in the literature. However, distinct from scholars investigating hierarchical, multidimensional selves, Markus and Nurius propose possible selves, or potential future selves. Although the number of future selves that one can generate is infinite, the possible selves one is apt to generate are personal and connected to the self that one is now. Moreover, possible selves are also shaped by comparisons with others: “What others are now, I could become” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212461565">Markus &amp; Nurius, 1986</xref>, p. 954). To wit, a person’s possible selves are the embodiment of her or his aspirations and threats. It is this aspect to possible selves that allows them to be the likely junction between the self and motivation.</p>
<p>Appropriately, then, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212461565">Markus and Nurius (1986)</xref> argued that possible selves serve three cognitive functions. First, possible selves function as personalized representations of one’s fears, and goals. They are selves that one seeks to approach or selves one seeks distance from. Second, an understanding of one’s possible selves provides a context from which to make meaning of events. A person with a hoped-for possible self of a chemist would interpret an F on a chemistry exam differently from a person who does not have that particular possible self. Thus, possible selves are most influenced by day-to-day triumphs and trials. Third, although one may have a stable self that has certain characteristics, being buffeted by positive and negative information could impact possible selves and influence how one sees the self at the present moment. Markus and Nurius combined these three functions for possible selves within a <italic>working</italic> self-concept, or one’s conception of the self that is responsive to the situation, event, or experience of the moment. The self is hypothesized as stable and unstable, static and dynamic.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212461565">Markus and Nurius (1986)</xref> went on to theorize how possible selves foreshadow change. They argue challenges to one’s understanding of the self can usher in a sudden and overwhelming flood of “bad feeling” and trigger personal fears and anxieties. The upswell of emotion elicited by the activation of threatening and feared possible selves is not captured well when the self is conceptualized in general or average terms. Rather, or additionally, the self journeys through momentary insecurities (and upswings) that could potentially predate long-term change.</p>

<title>Possible Selves and African American Students</title>
<p>The theory of possible selves has proven fertile ground in examining the educative experiences of youth of color. Some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212461565">Oyserman, Gant, &amp; Ager, 1995</xref>) have argued that though adolescence is a time when youth are encouraged to try on multiple selves to evaluate fit, the social context of youth could limit the possible selves that are pursued. Youth come to understand possible selves that are appropriate to them based on feedback from the world around them and via the lived experience of those they care about. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353212461565">Oyserman (2007)</xref> then, “motivation is identity based” (p. 432). Possibilities for the self may also be shaped by the personal successes and failures one experiences and the interpretation of those successes and failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al., 2006</xref>). Although a youth is not limited to the immediate environment in constructing possibilities for the self, a critical element in determining possibilities to pursue is the likelihood of attainment of the possible self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353212461565">Oyserman &amp; Fryberg, 2006</xref>). A youth pursuing unusual goals must therefore engage in savvy interpersonal negotiations with influential people who have the power to bolster or impede the strength and direction of goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162353212461565">Oyserman &amp; Saltz, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have examined the possible selves of African American adolescents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162353212461565">Richardson and Eccles (2007)</xref> found that for youth who were exploring possibilities for the self through outside reading, their reading choices allowed them to envision selves that rebutted racial and gendered stereotypes and reaffirmed or coalesced values and beliefs about the world. These findings are similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212461565">Hunter, Friend, Murphy, Williams-Wheeler, and Laughinghouse’s (2006)</xref> findings for 20 teen and young adult men who grew up fatherless. In the course of discussing what the absence of a father meant to their understanding of manhood and the process of maturing into manhood, the young men talked of the possible men they would like to be and the type of man they would like to avoid becoming. The manhood the young men valorized made evident a “sense of integrity and strength of self, a core sense of responsibility, and connections and obligations to family, community, and race, and a sense of faith” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212461565">Hunter et al., 2006</xref>, p. 443). The young men were unanimous in their desire to avoid being “deadbeat daddies.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212461565">Abrams and Aguilar (2005)</xref> investigated whether possible selves development was an effective component of a counseling program for a small cohort of juvenile offenders detained in a residential facility. When the seven youth were asked to generate strategies for approaching their hoped-for selves and avoiding the feared selves, very few strategies were created for avoiding the feared self. Upon follow-up, five of the seven interviewed were unable to identify facets in their environment that could encourage and support the change they envisioned while in the facility. Of the five young men, two had returned to correctional facilities. The researchers recommended that more time be devoted to helping these youth generate concrete, tangible plans for leaving the facility and turning their lives around in positive ways.</p>
<p>Oyserman has been a prominent voice in describing the make-up of possible selves of low-income, inner-city African Americans. She has focused on academic possible selves because she argued that schooling is a significant part of an adolescent’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353212461565">Oyserman &amp; Fryberg, 2006</xref>), and she and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353212461565">Oyserman, Brickman, &amp; Rhodes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353212461565">Oyserman, Terry, &amp; Bybee, 2002</xref>) have conducted several interventions to enhance the salience of positive academic possible selves, assess balance in possible selves (i.e., positive and negative selves in the same domain), and help youth generate strategies to realize positive academic selves. Enhancement in these areas has resulted in better grades, increased school involvement, greater concern for school, enhanced self-regulatory behavior, and more positive evaluations from teachers.</p>
<p>In light of Ogbu’s oft-repeated argument that Black youth struggle in schools due to the worry that academic achievement is perceived as “acting White,” Oyserman and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212461565">Oyserman, Bybee, &amp; Terry, 2003</xref>) weighed in on whether a salient racial identity enhances academic achievement or impedes it. In particular, they argued that gendered, racialized socialization practices ask young men to focus on “action, struggle, and survival” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al., 1995</xref>, p. 1220) as a means of coping with racism while young women are asked to build relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al. (1995)</xref> argued that the emphasis on relationships may be more conducive to academic achievement. As justification for this belief, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al. (1995)</xref> found that connectedness predicted increases in strategy use to attain academic possible selves from fall to spring and resulted in an increase in school involvement from fall to spring for young men. They concluded that

<p>When social context is limiting and group membership functions to subtly or not so subtly shape the selves one “tries on” in the process of adolescent development, we propose that conceptualizing oneself as a group member, becoming aware of stereotypes and limitations, and developing a perspective of oneself as succeeding as a group member, allows a way out.

<title>Possible Selves and High-Ability Students</title>
<p>The analysis and discussion of possible selves in high-ability youth is limited; however, two studies were identified that examined possible selves in this population. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162353212461565">Stake and Mares (2001)</xref> found that a summer science program intervention significantly and positively affected the possible selves, in particular the “self as scientist” possible self, and science self-concepts of high-ability students. Although a decline was observed in scores from the preassessment before the program to the postassessment at the conclusion of the program, significant increases in scores occurred in the 6-month time period following the program.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353212461565">Stake and Nickens (2005)</xref> honed in on the importance of relationships by exploring the impact of relationships with peers on youth coming to see a future in the sciences. Although envisioning a future in science is important for young boys and young girls, the researchers were particularly interested in how well the nature of peer relationships influenced the possible self as scientist for young women. Women are often not welcomed by male peers, their friends are often not interested in exploring science in more depth, and girls participate in fewer science-based extracurricular activities. Therefore, the researchers anticipated that involvement in a science program would be more important socially for females and would have longer lasting effects.</p>
<p>The results demonstrated that peer relationships before and during the program affect the development of possible selves (irrespective of gender); by putting students in contact with other like-minded individuals, the program influenced the development of friendships and also the change in possible self as a scientist. The development of peer relationships was more impactful for girls and girls kept in contact more often 6 months after the program.</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>A limited body of research dissects the academic experience of African American students who excel in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353212461565">Newman, Myers, Newman, Lohman, &amp; Smith, 2000</xref>).

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0162353212461565">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>This study took place in a Midwestern residential school for students gifted and/or talented in math, science, and/or technology, referred to as the Academy. The school serves students in the 10th- through 12th grades. A sophomore class of approximately 200 students is invited to attend every year, and students are invited to return for their 11th- and 12th-grade years based on their academic and behavioral performance during the preceding school year.</p>
<p>The Academy desires to be an exemplar for educative practice, particularly in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas. Many faculty members have master’s degrees or PhDs and have been teaching for a significant length of time. The teaching community prides itself on its unorthodox, nontraditional approach to math and science education. Faculty within the Academy have provided workshops for other educators in the state about their methods, and teachers and administrators from the immediate area and further away (e.g., Korea) have visited to observe their teaching pedagogy in action.</p>
<p>Students apply in their ninth-grade year to attend the Academy. However, a significant percentage of students (28% in the academic year of the study) come directly from the eighth grade (skipping the ninth grade) and some students have been younger. Applicants submit SAT scores, academic records from the previous year, and personal essays. They are also required to submit evaluations/recommendations from teachers and administrators from their homeschool. The average incoming SAT scores for the incoming sophomores was 637 for math and 577 for critical reading. High-ability status is represented via these characteristics of the overall student body.</p>
<p>Sixty-eight percent of the 650 students are from a large city less than 100 miles from the school. However, the students hail from all over the state. Likewise, the socioeconomic status (SES) of students also varies. Thus, students who attended small schools that had a senior class of 25 students commingle with students from schools that had senior classes of 200 and larger, and students’ families represent the entire socioeconomic spectrum. Although fees are assessed to students, they are nominal. Fees range from US$360 to US$2,610 per year and are determined by family income and size.</p>
<p>The student body was very diverse. At 36% of the student body, Asian students are overrepresented (Asians comprise 3.4% of the state population; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212461565">Illinois Economic and Fiscal Commission, 2001</xref>). White students made up 49% of the student population. African American and Latin students are minority students, as they were significantly underrepresented in the student population (7% and 5%, respectively) in comparison with the representation of African Americans and Latinos in the state population (15.1% and 12.3%, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212461565">Illinois Economic and Fiscal Commission, 2001</xref>). Males and females were represented equally in this population.</p>
<p>The students lived in residential halls during the academic year. There are seven halls: three female halls, three male halls, and one coed hall. The students are paired with roommates. Adult staff in each hall supervises the students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0162353212461565">
<title>Description of Participants, Consent Process, and Sampling Protocol</title>
<p>The selection of the setting facilitated purposive sampling of participants. Of the nine African American male students who agreed to be interviewed, four were sophomores, three were juniors, and two were seniors. According to school records, all but one of the students came from communities that surrounded a major metropolitan city. Six of the nine students were from dual-parent homes, and the SES of the communities in which the young men resided varied. In 2009, median incomes for households in the neighborhoods from which the young men hailed ranged from approximately US$41,782 to US$82,091, and per capita incomes ranged from approximately US$17,000 to US$34,000. Citywide poverty rates ranged from 4.8% to 22.1%. Poverty rates for African Americans ranged from 7.5% to 41.8% (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://City-Data.com">City-Data.com</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353212461565">2012</xref>). All of the young men anticipated future college attendance, with both seniors having been accepted into reputable postsecondary institutions, the University of Massachusetts and Carnegie Mellon. The students’ ages ranged between 15 and 18. Of the nine young men, six were anticipating careers in math, science, and/or technology-related fields. One student was preparing for a career in sports management, and two young men were exploring the viability of careers in fine arts areas.</p>
<p>The consent process to interview the students proceeded in three parts. The Academy has its own research and evaluation office that reviews and provides permission for potential studies; a research proposal was submitted to the Academy to garner permission to interview African American male students through this office. Once permission was granted by the Academy, parents of African American male students attending the Academy were sent a consent form by mail to their home address and via email requesting the participation of their son in a study assessing nonintellective aspects of his experience at the Academy. Those students whose parents gave permission were asked to attend a student meeting in the hall commons area of their residential halls. At these meetings, I presented a sketch of the study. Students interested in participating in the study completed an assent form.</p>

<sec id="section8-0162353212461565">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>An overarching critique of closed-ended, self-report measures is that they may not tap salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353212461565">Bryne, 1996</xref>). Moreover, estimations of self-esteem, self-concept, or self-schema, to name a few self-oriented constructs, could be confounded by extremity in responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353212461565">Deutsch, Kroll, Weible, Letourneau, &amp; Gross, 1988</xref>). Oyserman (personal communication, August 14, 2008), a prominent researcher within possible selves as an area of inquiry, maintains that open-ended assessments of possible selves reduces social desirability effects, an additional weakness of self-report instrumentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353212461565">Bryne, 1996</xref>), and necessarily identifies selves that are important and close at hand. As possible selves theory is based on a working self-concept, or a self-concept that incorporates contextual self-appraisals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212461565">Markus &amp; Nurius, 1986</xref>), salience seems integral to the accurate identification of respondent’s possible selves.</p>
<p>In response to these methodological concerns, a semistructured interview protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353212461565">Spradley, 1979</xref>) was used in this study. This type of interview design ensures structure to the conversations, yet allows the interviewer the freedom to pursue areas of interest and to tailor each interview somewhat based on the dynamics of the conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353212461565">Dearnley, 2005</xref>). This style of data collection also taps into salient possible selves and allowed the students to articulate organic and individual aspects of their self-concept.</p>
<p>Two Academy males who were not part of the potential subject pool agreed to pilot an initial version of the interview questions. Based on these pilot interviews, the interview protocol was revised. Example interview questions included the following:
<list id="list2-0162353212461565" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>What do you believe is possible for you? What dreams do you have about who you could become or possibly do? How are you realizing those dreams?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are there people you would avoid sharing these possibilities for yourself with? If so, why?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do you think racism will have an impact on the possibilities of what you hope to achieve and the possibilities you fear? If so, how? Do you have any strategies for avoiding some of these issues?</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The young men varied in how much they wanted to share. Thus, the brevity of Dominique’s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0162353212461565">1</xref></sup> responses led to a more structured interview, despite my desire to conduct semistructured interviews and follow up on conversational leads. Jackson, a second student who was interviewed, was more reflective, leading to our conversation lasting close to an hour. Suffice it to say, the length of time per interview varied, with most interviews being approximately 25 min. Interviews were conducted in May during a lull week between end-of-year activities such as the prom and final exams. All interviews were conducted at the Academy in each student’s residence hall. (The study reported here is the qualitative component of a mixed-methods [Quan–Qual] study examining the self-system in high-ability African American males.)</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Similar to practice by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212461565">Kerpelman, Shoffner, and Ross-Griffin (2002)</xref> and endorsed as a coding strategy by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353212461565">Miles and Huberman (1994)</xref>, theoretical arguments about possible selves were used to frame findings from interviews. Oyserman’s work about possible selves (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353212461565">Oyserman &amp; Fryberg, 2006</xref>) served as the premise for interview protocol development and analysis of the descriptive data. Specifically, Oyserman and her colleagues detailed that youth are able to generate hoped-for selves and feared selves. Students are also able to formulate strategies that enable them to realize their hoped-for selves and to avoid their feared selves. Finally, students are influenced by context when determining whether to maintain possible selves or to abandon them. Race relations, influential others’ success or lack thereof in realizing goals, school environment, and negotiation with loved ones, including peers, close friends, and parents, about atypical goals have a significant impact on possible self development. The a priori codes <italic>hoped-for selves, feared selves, strategies</italic>, and <italic>context</italic> represented the major themes around which subthemes were developed.</p>
<p>All interviews were transcribed and coded. The process that makes up the coding strategy includes examining interview responses within the four major themes for any similarities, patterns, or consistencies. Responses were grouped based on these similarities and codes were created to reflect the nature of the similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212461565">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007</xref>). Any unfamiliar phrasing was noted, as they constituted a separate code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212461565">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007</xref>). The interviews were then searched for material that coincided with the codes that were developed. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162353212461565">Table 1</xref> presents the themes and subthemes identified from the interviews.</p>

<p>The data from the interviews will be reported based on the four predetermined major themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212461565">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>It should be noted that I have an extensive background with the residential school that serves as the setting for the study. Although I was not an employee of the institution at the time of the study, I had been one for several years previously. I worked extensively with the students during my time there, so I was familiar with the day-to-day workings of the institution, particularly as the students experienced it. This familiarity served as one place of common ground during the interviews and may have helped push my developing understanding past a surface understanding of the educational gestalt. However, due to my familiarity, I kept reflective notes to highlight (and hopefully isolate) potential personal assumptions at play. I also used this form of reflection to note missed opportunities during interviews, and preliminary insight in determining meaning across the interviews. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212461565">Bogdan and Biklen (2007)</xref>, the notes served as the foundation for data analysis.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0162353212461565" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The themes and subthemes manifest hoped-for and feared selves, strategies to avoid, or realize these future selves and contextual factors that have a bearing on the realization of these possibilities. Contextual factors will be discussed first, as they may function as the foundation against which hopes, fears, and strategies were developed.</p>
<sec id="section11-0162353212461565">
<title>Context</title>
<p>Four subthemes served to buttress the creation of hoped-for and feared selves: the neighborhood, the family, the Academy, and racism. Interestingly and importantly, these themes are entwined. It is difficult to talk about how students experienced their neighborhood and neighborhood schools without talking about the school they presently attend. Support to be involved with such a rigorous academic community requires support from a variety of people, with family members being some of those sources of support. Racism is not only present in the outside world but also manifest in the stereotypes African American male students wrestle with at the Academy.</p>
<sec id="section12-0162353212461565">
<title>Neighborhood</title>
<p>The first subtheme of the major theme <italic>Context</italic> to be discussed is <italic>neighborhood</italic>. Several young men indicated that there were elements within their neighborhood that were object lessons demonstrating to them who they wanted to become and not become. Clinton noted that his involvement with leadership development programs helped him feel he should continue to pursue leadership opportunities as a student at the Academy. Moreover, there were people in his community, particularly church members, who expressed pride in his achievements to date and were encouraging him to be bold in the pursuit of what mattered to him.</p>
<p>However, for some, there were community elements that too easily demonstrate a path toward ennui and potential hopelessness. William felt that relationships he had developed were trending toward being unhealthy. He believed he needed a change to prevent becoming awash in disaffection. Friends were dropping out of school, and some young men had witnessed or suspected drug use, gang activity, and prostitution among their peers; they were on guard against losing their way:
<disp-quote>
<p>I always see like a lot of people in baggy pants, and I hear about people selling drugs . . . I always fear . . . becoming that type of person . . . selling drugs from my apartment. I don’t want to feel like I have to do that . . . it’s not a really bad neighborhood, but . . . every now and then I’ll see people fighting or police cars coming around, and I just never want to get involved with things like that. (Clinton)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some young men felt pushed out of their homeschools because of some of the above elements, whereas other young men just wanted to feel excited about school. The previous schools that the young men had attended varied in the level of challenge provided, but students who compared their homeschool with the Academy felt their homeschool did not make the demands of them necessary to help them maintain interest in school in general and in their goals in particular. As Lawrence noted, “I wouldn’t say I wasn’t learning anything at the school, but I wasn’t happy there, and I didn’t think that school was adequately challenging me.” Students left their homeschools to pursue rigor and thus “realism,” considering the goals that were important to them. They worried that coasting through school could result in lost ambition or inadequate preparedness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0162353212461565">
<title>Family</title>
<p>Turning to the second subtheme under the major theme <italic>Context</italic>, when talking about family, the young men noted that family members were very supportive of their son’s, nephew’s, and/or brother’s drive. Jackson revealed that his parents had been surprised at the level of intensity he had brought to bear in thinking about his future, but once they understood where his commitments lay, they pushed him to go wholeheartedly after his dreams. Some parents and family members were actively involved in framing where they felt their son’s strengths laid or protecting the direction of their aspirations, and other parents were nudging the more reticent sons to voice what they were considering about their future. For example, Lawrence disclosed that his parents had enrolled him in supplementary classes at a local community college to augment schooling.</p>
<p>Likewise, struggles to realize personal goals influenced how some parents reacted to the goals of their sons. Several young men noted that their parents had not had the same opportunities to transform their dreams into reality. To prevent the same things from happening to their children, they encouraged them to see their future as wide open, to apply to the Academy, and to do their best. Justin gave a generational example:
<disp-quote>
<p>I know that my grandparents on my father’s side, both of them, they didn’t go to college, and, because of that, . . . at least my grandmother, really put in a lot of effort so that all my uncles would go to college . . . and because of that, my father is really passionate about my education . . . I don’t think his dreams are deferred, were ever deferred, nor do I think my dreams will be deferred.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Family members also modeled possibilities, both positive and negative. William noted that his cousins all wanted to be athletes but were consistently diverted by poor decision making and lack of focus. Jackson first learned of the Academy through the involvement of his brother. He does not remember much about his brother’s high school years, but he knows he attended the Academy. His brother used his experiences as teachable moments and a framework for advice about potential mistakes while in attendance. His counsel helped Jackson better understand what to expect from the culture of the Academy, thereby easing his transition into the new learning community.</p>
<p>Family members were examples of eventual contentment with life choices and material success. Parents have also been models for dreams deferred:
<disp-quote>
<p>I know with my mom she went to college in Kentucky for 2 years, but . . . my grandmother wasn’t able to afford it, so she had to drop out, start working with McDonald’s and things like that . . . .I know she said she wanted to do a lot with business, but her not being able to finish college . . . took her away from that. And even though she manages at different jobs, I always felt if she could have made it through college she could have done more with her life . . . she tried going back to school, but I know it was difficult cause she’s a single mom . . . So, seeing my mom not being able to complete college just makes me want to, I want to be able to achieve my dream and then repay her, I guess. (Clinton)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0162353212461565">
<title>The Academy</title>
<p>The third subtheme under the <italic>Context</italic> major theme is the Academy, with the young men who were interviewed talking through the impact of their current schooling community. The young men who were part of the study welcomed their time at the Academy, in part, because the school represented and manifested opportunity. Some of the young men were enabled to do things that their homeschools could not support. For example, Jeremiah noted that the Academy was giving him the money he needed to be involved with an expensive drama camp in the summer. Considering he was wrestling with whether to pursue a career in theater, he seemed grateful for the chance to experiment in this way. Damian noted that other students and faculty members who were part of the school were connected to organizations and programs, such that it made it easier to gain access to and simulate some of the activities that occurred in the professional fields they were considering.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the Academy was the only organization with which the young men were involved in any substantive way that helped them understand what they could achieve. The Academy appeared to be perceived as an important piece of the puzzle in moving toward future selves that mattered. The young men believed that attending the Academy paved the way for admittance into good colleges and universities and was a stepping stone for future careers, particularly in math and science. The residential component helped the young men feel they could or would adjust more smoothly to being away from home during college, and enough variety in classes were offered that the young men could try on different fields to gauge intellectual and dispositional fit.</p>
<p>Moreover, the rigor of the curriculum pushed the students in ways that further revealed their competencies to themselves. Martin came to understand that he was not all that interested in a math or science career. Jackson stated that he enacted certain choices, like doubling up in math courses during a semester, that helped him realize that he could, in fact, be focused and work hard. Furthermore, other young men expressed the sentiment that the academic culture of the Academy helped positively address the worry that they could indeed achieve in areas that were important to them. For example, Damian related,
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, basically, well I guess the only real thing that has changed is that at the beginning I guess I felt like, like it just seemed like, I don’t know how to phrase it. I could be . . . a lot of things but I didn’t, it didn’t actually seem like I could actually do it in reality, but I guess like going here, since (the Academy), now like a lot of things just seem like I could actually do that stuff. Cause you hear like seniors are doing this and like they’re going off to college and studying this, it doesn’t seem like that you could actually do that, but you can.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Implicit within this response is the import of peers. The young men were almost universal in acknowledging the importance of their peers supporting their dreams. As Clinton stated, “we find ourselves always talking about what we want to be in life and why we want to do that.” The young men were surrounded by other young people who were creating and implementing strategies to get into certain colleges and pursue specific careers, a preoccupation that one student noted that he could relate to and felt comfortable with. Likewise, peers (and family, for that matter) have “accepted my dreams, they’re ok with them” (Justin). Their peers were people with “positive minds” and “positive ambitions.”</p>
<p>However, the young men were generally selective with whom they shared possibilities for themselves, thereby potentially strengthening their influence. In reference to peers (and other adults in the community), people that the students could trust or respect were the ones with which they were willing to discuss their futures. For the young men invested in career paths that were outside of the cultural norm established at the Academy, their peers represented a status quo that they struggled to overcome in shaping individual ambitions. As Jeremiah noted, “you kinda feel obligated to say you want to be some kind of doctor or engineer or something like that.” Youth who were considering professions outside of what was expected felt they had to contend with the implication that they were less intellectually competent and were not as able to access some academic resources.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve kinda gone down a different path. I’m the first person to ever go to the University of Massachusetts . . . none of my academic counselors had any idea about the sports management field, so I did all the research on my own . . . they couldn’t really advise me too much. [I]f I tell someone I’m going to study sports management . . . some people think that I might be kind of taking a step back from my full potential . . . it must be because I didn’t do as well academically here, that I’m just settling, but I’ve actually done fairly well here . . . I haven’t really been afraid to tell them [about my goals], but . . . I’ve seen the looks and I realize what it comes from, what they’re thinking. (Jackson)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>True friends endorsed their choices as worthwhile; the young men sought to guard themselves against those who did not truly have their best interest at heart.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0162353212461565">
<title>Race relations/racism</title>
<p>The final subtheme that helped establish the <italic>Context</italic> for the creation of possible selves is race relations/racism. Along with navigating assumptions based on career choice, the young men were also navigating race-based assumptions of their peers, both at their homeschool, but particularly among their peers at the Academy. Some stereotypes about African American students at the Academy include being loud, cliquish, someone who comes from a ghetto, a thug or a gangster, cool, good daters, good at basketball, Oreos, and less intelligent.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Let’s see, people tell me all the time that I got in here because of affirmative action, because that’s the only way a Black person could be smart, and . . . because I’m good at basketball it’s because I’m Black and that’s all Black people can be good at, and . . . if I wear baggy pants, I must be in a gang because I’ve been told that the outfits I wear make me look like a gangster. I don’t know, I’ve never seen a gangster wear a polo. (William)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The young men offered up myriad explanations for the structure of race relations and the composition of stereotypes about African American students at the Academy. According to some, racism was the result of fear, ignorance, or narrow-mindedness. For Jeremiah, the budding thespian, racism was unconscious, maybe even subconscious. Playwrights created their work with certain people in mind, and African Americans are rarely mentally visible during that germinating process. Martin argued,
<disp-quote>
<p>While out-and-out we-don’t-like-your-kind-around-here racism isn’t that big of an issue, . . . unconscious racism and xenophobia will pretty much always be prevalent in behavior. It’s just that sort of primal instinct of ‘One of these things is not like the other.’ . . . it may affect interpersonal interactions, but it does not affect global interactions as much as it did.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With regard to stereotypes, responses varied in describing their impact on the young men’s academic experiences at the Academy. Lawrence, a Nigerian American, was labeled a European African American because he did not seem similar to other African American students on campus. Clinton reported that he resisted exclusively socializing with African American students. That choice would not mesh well with social behaviors he had engaged in at his homeschool. Martin talked of how multiple identities rather than identification with one particular racialized experience, his being labeled an “anomaly,” and his intelligence kept him from caring about race.</p>
<p>Some of the young men felt put upon by negative prejudgments about their character or their potential. Jackson noted that upon first joining the Academy, African American sophomores were engaged in “performing Blackness” (i.e., play fighting, yelling, blasting music) in ways that allowed them to better fit in with peers at their homeschools. He hypothesized that other students who came from suburbs or small downstate towns were not used to and looked down upon these behaviors, and they (as well as faculty and staff) at the Academy enforced different cultural mores. New African American students needed time to adjust to new expectations, and to pursue other expressions of authenticity. In this vein, Damian argued that the small number of African American students enrolled in the Academy prevented a great deal of differentiation. A Black youth behaving in ways that supported a racialized stereotype stigmatized all of the African American students. Justin felt the stereotypes for African Americans were par for the course and akin to stereotypes for Asian, Indian, and White students: Youth playfully trotted out these shorthand explanations for cultural differences as a way to poke fun at their universal experience at the Academy. No harm was intended.</p>
<p>When asked about the potential impact of racism on the possibilities they envisioned for themselves, the responses ran the gamut from expecting racism to impact them, to not being sure, to not expecting racism to hinder options available to them. Clinton referenced advice from his father in navigating racial minefields when seeking a job; Justin contended that his skill set as a mathematician, especially if he was good in his work, would prevent him from being overly hampered by racism. Lawrence said he had never experienced racism in his life to that point and thus did not expect to experience any in the future.</p>
<p>Jeremiah was especially compelling in addressing this question. Most of the interview was taken up with him describing how a playwright’s, a director’s, or the audience’s mental images about characters could serve to limit his options in performing on stage. For example,
<disp-quote>
<p>I was in “Little Shop of Horrors” . . . and I wanted to be like the main role for the guy, Seymour . . . as soon as I walked in the door, the director said, I want you to sing “Feed Me.” That’s the song that the plant sings, and the plant’s supposed to be like this big horrible creature, and it’s supposed to have an Ebonic voice . . . So, as soon as I walk in the door, they were like, “Sing that song.” [I said] I’ve been practicing the song that Seymour sings for like a month now. And then they said you can sing “Feed Me” first and sing the other song later if you want to . . . And then I turned out being the plant . . . I did a really good job, but still, they didn’t give me a chance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Of the young men interviewed, he provided the most striking imagery of the effect of racism on a possible future self. He wrestled with whether he should stay with acting or go for a back-up career in medicine.</p>
<p>For most of the young men who felt racism could potentially influence outcomes in their futures, a common sentiment was the belief that they could behave in ways that could change minds about other African Americans. The young men felt they could be the ones who caused enough cognitive dissonance to be transformative catalysts:
<disp-quote>
<p>If I can change their mind, then maybe they’ll take that and try and change somebody else’s mind, so it’ll just help out Black people, the view that other races have on Black people. So, I just want to be the best that I can so I can show that Black people can be better than what they’re shown to be, what they’re thought to be. (William)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Part of this process involved acting in ways that made a lie of potential stereotypes.</p>
<p>The previous discussion has explicated several components of the milieu that serve as the backdrop for the development of the future selves these young men approached and avoided. In particular, the young men deliberated over the effects of their neighborhood, family, the Academy, and race relations/racism. Their hoped-for and feared selves will now be described in more depth. Strategies that the young men utilized to realize or avoid these future selves will also be discussed.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0162353212461565">
<title>Hoped-For Selves</title>
<p>On three occasions, the young men who were interviewed noted that they felt they could become whatever they wanted as a preamble to relaying possible hoped-for selves. The students envisioned future selves that were college bound, with Clinton specifying pursuing a master’s degree as well as a bachelor’s degree. The students were interested in careers in biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, sports management, acting, nanotechnology, mathematics, computer science, creative writing, marketing, and economics.</p>
<p>Many of the young men were also invested in success. Success in this case was represented as prestige, prosperity, and influence. As Lawrence stated, his future self involved “just being academically successful, winning awards, winning competitions, all-around excellence.” Clinton was interested in becoming the CEO of his own company, and Jackson was striving for a job in a front office of a major NBA organization. Students hoped to be rich or well-off enough to support a family and serve as role models for others.</p>
<p>Three of the students were unwilling to project too far into the future because they were more connected to “the immediacy of now.” Martin argued that “the now is more important, and the sum total of your nows becomes your later,” and Lawrence, a youth who had applied and been accepted into the Academy in the eighth grade, noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>I am starting to see how things could materialize now, because before in my old school [i.e., middle school], college was a far-off dream, and at this point now, it’s an immediate possibility and I need to be able to handle it more efficiently than I would have had I been a middle-schooler. Now that things count towards that, I need to be able to react adequately.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, the students identified personal selves related to personal development and interpersonal relationships. Several of the young man wanted families, intact and healthy relationships with significant others, including spouses and friends; to be men of God; and to be better than they were the year before:
<disp-quote>
<p>Next year, I want to be me. I want to be the same person on the inside, but I want to be smarter, I want to be more, I want to know more about . . . different cultures and stuff, I just want to broaden my horizons for next year. But I still want to be the same person I was when I got here. Just better. (William)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clinton had pursued leadership positions along with participation in the student organization Feed the Children because he ultimately wanted to use his company and the technology skills of his personnel to help people in developing countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0162353212461565">
<title>Feared Selves</title>
<p>Two young men did not seem to have possible selves they feared becoming. Likewise, some of the young men admitted to spending more time discussing who they would like to become rather than who they would not like to become. For those who were able to articulate the nature of future selves they would like to avoid, one was a self who has failed. Dominique had the immediate fear of failing a class and repeating his senior year, and William worried that his propensity to be forgetful could potentially harm him academically at some later date. Other students’ mentions of failure dealt with particular goals they had established, be it academic or career goals.</p>
<p>Two young men sought to avoid becoming involved with illegal activities like selling drugs or having a jail record. Clinton, in particular, said he could see it happening, in part, due to some modeling of such activities in his neighborhood. Similar feared selves were poor, homeless, cut off from additional schooling (either because of dropping out or expulsion), lonely, part of collapsed relationships, or men who have fallen in with a bad crowd.

<title>Strategies</title>
<p>Strategies that the young men identified as attempts to realize their hoped-for future selves took one of two forms. One category of strategies involved studying more, doing their best, improving their grades, and keeping themselves open to meeting new people as a means of becoming more familiar with networking. However, a second strategy was choosing to engage in concrete activities that allowed students to gain insider knowledge detailing some of the skills that they would need to cultivate to be successful in their chosen fields, with the pivotal strategy identified as applying for and attending the Academy. Once in residence, students chose clubs to be involved with that meshed with future goals or maneuvered for leadership opportunities to grow leadership skills. Students were doing research about their fields and were active in or anticipating being active in mentored research opportunities connected to their interests. Students were busy investigating college programs that meshed with their future goals, acting in school plays (for the young man interested in drama), and preparing for summer classes at universities. Lawrence, the student interested in a career in economics, had just completed the Federal Reserve Challenge, in which a team traveled to the Federal Reserve to present an analysis of a current economic problem. As part of this presentation, students would also hypothesize the appropriate response by the Federal Reserve. Justin had joined that math team and a student group that helped other students with their technological problems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The broad argument that Oyserman and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353212461565">Oyserman &amp; Fryberg, 2006</xref>) advanced in their research about African American students and outcomes, coupled with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212461565">Markus and Nurius’s (1986)</xref> theoretical argument of a working self-concept, is that the creation and cultivation of possible selves is reflective of and buffeted by cultural experiences. Youth watch significant others and learn from these people’s life lessons, negotiate with others about which possible selves to avoid and which to pursue, and interpret events based on current feedback. This process bears not only on a self-of-the-moment but is also felt within a more stable understanding of the self. The self is constantly in flux and is receptive to and pushes against influential societal forces as it charts an individual path to and through actualization.</p>
<p>The stories told by the youth who were interviewed in this study exhibited this important work. The young men hailed from a variety of backgrounds; however, they seemed unified in the pursuit of success, careers, additional schooling, and personal and interpersonal development—the minor themes under the umbrella of the <italic>hoped-for self</italic> major theme. Noteworthy is that the collective of their goals coupled with feared selves in roughly the same domains (i.e., becoming entangled in troubling behaviors like selling drugs, disconnecting prematurely from school, a lack of material comforts, enmeshment with crowds that eschew personal development, and poor-functioning relationships with others) represent balance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al. (2006)</xref> contend that this balance is a necessary precursor to self-regulation. The young men in this study were thoughtfully ambitious.</p>
<p>Family, racism, the culture of the specialized school they attend, and lessons learned from their home neighborhood have influenced the formation of hoped-for and feared selves. These elements—family, racism, the neighborhood, and the specialized school—constitute the minor themes within the major theme <italic>Context</italic>. For example, all of the young men noted talking with their parents about their goals. Their families were not only receptive to the possible selves the young men were envisioning, they also cultivated them. Parents and family members encouraged their sons to attend the Academy, thereby supporting their immersion in a rigorous and sometimes stressful intellectual lifestyle. As Marsh and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353212461565">n.d.</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353212461565">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212461565">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212461565">Marsh, Hua, &amp; Craven, 2004</xref>) noted, this is a risky choice, as the fall in academic self-concept for youth attending high-ability schools could reveal itself in lower occupational and educational aspirations. They questioned their sons to have them voice the possibilities they were considering, and they positively endorsed the behaviors that would be needed to realize success in fields that many Americans do not often pursue. The young men trusted and expected their parents to help them find their way, and the entirety of this work was buttressed by love. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353212461565">Allen (1978)</xref> found, families can be sources of inspiration and guidance for African American young men.</p>
<p>The academic customs and traditions of the Academy were also important for the young men in envisioning possible selves. Specifically, and as with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353212461565">Stake &amp; Nickens, 2005</xref>), peers were important in helping the young men consider and hold onto possible selves in nontraditional fields. With the understanding that one sure way of realizing possible selves involves implementing tangible strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212461565">Abrams &amp; Aguilar, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353212461565">Matute-Bianchi, 1986</xref>), students in attendance at the Academy modeled to each other the substantive strategic steps needed to gain entry into their chosen careers, thereby normalizing what “we do” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al., 2006</xref>) to include activities such as conducting extensive research into areas of interest and seeking hands-on experiences that mimic work in fields they are curious about. Peers were also generally supportive of involvement in math, science, and technology disciplines.</p> <p>The strength of these mores was such that some of the African American males who were focused on the “fierce urgency of now” did not perceive applying for college as distinct from the current moment. Interestingly, negotiating this academic community became problematic if students sought out paths that deviated from the norm, with two young men feeling like outsiders because of their interest in fine arts and sports management. They inferred being patronized by some of their peers and sometimes second-guessed by some of their teachers. In particular, Jackson, the young man interested in sports management, was not as able to access institutional supports that smoothed the college application process, and Jeremiah seemed engaged in a profound search for his path. There were supports in place for him through involvement in the drama club, money for additional training during the summer, and commiserations with members of the Academy who were just as passionate about drama. However, he acutely questioned the viability of a possible self that really seemed to matter to him.</p>
<p>Racism was also implicated. When describing the role of stereotypes on their futures, several of them noted that they intended to behave in ways that would reflect well on other African Americans. They were shouldering the task of representing an entire population of diverse people in their engagements with others. This desire is both laudable and heartbreaking, and is similar to high-ability African American youth involved in accelerated classes at Capital High (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353212461565">Fordham, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353212461565">Fordham (1996)</xref> details many forms of resistance used by African American youth attending Capital, the pseudonym for a high school in the Washington D.C. area. One form of resistance involved turning away from activities that could endanger a self who privileged the values of his or her community, activities considered “acting White” or the antithesis to positive self-actualization. A second form of resistance consisted of bucking implicit low expectations for African Americans.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the young men did not speak with one voice about the impact of racism or stereotypes at the Academy. Instead, along with noting that stereotypes are painful and can potentially frame dreams of what is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212461565">Kao, 2000</xref>), the young men discussed whether race was an appropriate referent for self-construals, questioned whether stereotypes were that egregious, and implicated other African American students in part for their perpetuation.</p>
<p>The diversity of opinions about the relevance of racism in explaining aspects of their experience at the Academy may be reflective of the times. At this historic moment in this country, there is an African American president and state-sponsored xenophobic legislation targeting Mexicans. The young men in this study are charting unique paths in uncovering how or whether racism will have any bearing on possibilities they envision. This ambivalence is not well represented in the literature about African American youth, academic self-concept, and possible selves and deserves further study.</p>
<p>Additional research should examine the relationship between schoolwide factors and possible selves directly, with particular emphasis on specialized schools such as the one in this study. One schoolwide factor that could be explored is academic optimism. Academic optimism is described as the combination of schoolwide academic press, collective efficacy of the school faculty to bolster academic achievement, and trust among faculty, parents, and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353212461565">Smith &amp; Hoy, 2007</xref>). Based on my prior experience, these characteristics seem to be hallmarks of the school. Moreover, the comments by the students bear this insight out. A direct empirical assessment of academic optimism and its relationship to possible selves could partially explain the make-up of the possible selves of the young men in this study and in other settings where young people are pushed to strive for academic excellence.</p>
<p>Moreover, a noteworthy finding from the interviews was the salience of peers in the development of possible selves for the young men in the study. Students in attendance were key in developing the academic gestalt of the school, some of the young men were judicious in choosing possible selves to share and friends to share them with, and peers applauded possible selves or served as obstacles to overcome if a possible self went against peer norms. Peer influence on possible selves in this study is in keeping with Oyserman’s prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212461565">Oyserman et al., 2006</xref>) that highlighted the role peers can serve in bolstering a possible self as an academic. Future research should place peer influence at the center of additional exploration of possible selves’ development, maintenance, avoidance, and loss in specialized school settings.</p>
<p>The theoretical framework underpinning my study did not advance an argument about how the young men in the study were experiencing or navigating culture. Instead, my study is reflective of research about possible selves, a manifestation of self-concept. That being said, the young men’s thoughts on race relations point to a need for further study. It can be argued that the young men in the study are striving to wade through the “triple quandary” of navigating three cultural experiences: the mainstream culture, a minority culture, and Black culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212461565">Boykin, 1986</xref>). It would be useful to use Boykin’s theory as a framework for additional research about this population in similar settings.</p>
<p>It is not expected that the make-up of the possible selves for the young men who were interviewed are similar to the possible selves of African American females in residential settings for high-ability youth. Prior research instead points to gender differences in possible selves being an area of needed inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353212461565">Brown &amp; Diekman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162353212461565">Perry &amp; Vance, 2010</xref>). Future research would explore the possible selves and strategy implementations of African American females in this school setting. It would also be beneficial to explore the factors that impact the development of possible selves for these young women.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The expectations that communities hold seem to have a bearing on individual goals young people set:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, basically, well I guess the only real thing that has changed is that at the beginning I guess I felt like, like it just seemed like, I don’t know how to phrase it. I could be . . . a lot of things but I didn’t, it didn’t actually seem like I could actually do it in reality, but I guess like going here, since (the Academy), now like a lot of things just seem like I could actually do that stuff. (Damian)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For these young men, the change from their homeschools to the Academy appeared to have been an important first step in affirming their potential, academic and otherwise.</p>
<p>The sample size is small and the research methodology is not amenable to generalization across similar schools, time, and populations. Thus, readers will need to determine whether these findings are transferable to high-ability African American males in other (residential) settings. That being said, and similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353212461565">Cokley’s (2000)</xref> research with African American college students, a positive academic culture, construed more holistically to include support by different actors in these youth’s lives, appeared to play a significant role in estimations of academic aptitude. Considering the young men in the study plus the other male students in attendance at the Academy hail from a variety of backgrounds, this can be a hopeful thing, especially if expectations for the self grow to encompass nontraditional goals from which many shy. Although by no means a perfect place, the Academy and potentially all specialized schools for high-ability youth may be doing important work that is possibly more egalitarian in its effects.</p>
