<p>Every field benefits from a straightforward and user-friendly introduction to its particular histories, values, practices, and perspectives. Dulmus and Sowers’ new book entitled <italic>The Profession of Social Work: Guided by History, Led by Evidence</italic> admirably fills this role. This work was created largely as a textbook and has been designed explicitly to address core social work education competencies outlined by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). There are two overarching goals in this book: (1) to provide a relevant history and context of social work practice and (2) to point the way forward to a social work profession increasingly driven by evidence-based practices. Thus, readers of the book will learn not only the foundations of social work, but will be equipped with the general knowledge necessary to practice social work in the field.</p>
<p>Dulmus and Sowers bring a great depth and breadth of social work experience to their editorship of this text. In addition, the chosen contributors constitute an impressive group of social work professionals from across various research and practice areas. Over the course of 10 chapters, the book covers a broad range of relevant practice and research areas, including social work history, values, ethics, theoretical frameworks, evidence-based practice strategies, regulations, and contemporary issues. These topics are expertly and concisely woven together, creating an excellent book that is an important contribution to the existing body of social work literature.</p>
<p>The first few chapters of the book lay the foundation for understanding social work. Chapter 1, “The History of Social Work and Social Welfare,” begins by briefly explicating the religious origins of social work and relevant history prior to the 20th century. Next, it provides an in-depth discussion of more recent history, including the settlement house movement and the rise of progressivism. Finally, the chapter concludes with social work post–World War II and leading up to Obama, with particular attention given to the civil rights movement, the war on poverty, and the age of Reagan. International readers should note that this material is heavily U.S.-centric throughout. Chapter 2, “Educating for Social Work,” deals with the development of social work education programs and curricula, with specific attention on the formation and evolution of the CSWE. It outlines core competencies for all levels of social work education and differentiates between BSW-, MSW-, and PhD-level programs. Chapter 3, “Social Work Practice in the New Millennium,” primarily outlines the various concerns of social work practice using a micro and macro practice dichotomy. It concludes by discussing the numerous fields that overlap with, and help provide a context for, contemporary social work. Chapter 4, “Professional Credentials and Professional Regulations,” concludes this foundation with a discussion of issues related to the professionalization of social work such as licensure, regulation, and supervision.</p>
<p>The next chapters in the book provide more depth regarding the nature and perspectives of social work. Chapter 5, “Social Work Organization,” returns to historical background perspectives with a lengthy discussion of the development of social work organizations culminating with the establishment of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW). The narrative carefully balances the considerable successes of social work organizations with an acknowledgement that the profession still struggles to find an identity at times. Chapter 6, “Values and Ethics for Professional Social Work Practice,” expertly discusses values and ethical issues with an eye toward the NASW Code of Ethics and its central position within social work. Key attention is paid to those values that singularly distinguish social work from other fields. Similarly, Chapter 7 entitled “The Strengths Perspective,” focuses on how a strengths-based perspective defines and guides social work. This chapter also introduces the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fourth edition, text revision and discusses how social work professionals often use this resource.</p>
<p>The last three chapters examine the future directions of social work practice and research. Chapter 8, “Putting Evidence-based Practice into Practice,” first defines evidence-based practice and then discusses common obstacles to its implementation. This chapter makes a strong and succinct case for all social work professionals to adopt such practices. Chapter 9, “Improving the Scientific Base of Social Work Practice,” examines the oft-debated “chasm” between research and practice. Both historical contexts and current trends are discussed. This chapter also introduces the reader to the vast world of professional publications. While this discussion does not shy away from noting the difficulties found in translating research into practice, it ultimately takes an optimistic tone in looking forward to a near future where empiricism is embraced wholeheartedly by researchers and practitioners alike. Finally, Chapter 10, “Contemporary Issues in Social Work,” concludes the book with a thoughtful discussion of current issues. Particular attention is paid to the intellectual landscape of the social sciences, globalization, evidence-based practice, and ethics.</p>
<p>In addition to its deft handling of the topics at hand, the book contains a number of other features that facilitate ease of use. The chapters are logically organized and easy to follow for readers of all types. Beginning introductory sections and topic questions in each chapter nicely ease the reader into the subject at hand and set the stage for the discussion that follows. Meanwhile, a helpful concluding section offers a summary key points, key terms, review questions, online resources, and references. All of these features engender an enjoyable and cogent learning experience. Concluding the entire book are helpful and detailed author and subject indices. Throughout the book, discussions, examples, questions and the like are clearly presented and appropriate to the intended audience.</p>
<p>Limitations of the book are relatively minor. In terms of content, some may find the book too focused on direct practice social work. Students and educators looking for more discussion of macro practice issues might want to look elsewhere. One disappointment is the dearth of charts, graphics, and other visual aids that could serve to illustrate key concepts. As such, one finds extended blocks of text throughout the book. Oddly, the book is printed with large, empty margins on both sides of the text. These spaces could have been more deftly used for focus questions, definitions, and the like. The organization of the book is mostly very good, but perhaps the editors could have grouped the 10 chapters until helpful sections for easier use. While each chapter is logically organized, it is not always clear why certain chapters are placed in the sequence that they are. Also, the use of appendices would have been a welcome addition.</p>
<p>Anyone who is beginning their journey as a social work practitioner or researcher will appreciate the content and tone of Dulmus and Sowers’ book. In particular, upper-level undergraduate and beginning graduate level social work educators and students will find much helpful information. This book could also serve as a useful resource for those who are unfamiliar with social work and are looking to become acquainted with the profession. While the book is aimed at beginning social workers, those with more experience in the field will appreciate its strong and consistent use of empirical data to support its perspectives, approaches, and evidence. Throughout each chapter, the contributing authors make excellent use of relevant and recent sources to explicate their topics. This is a book that wholeheartedly embraces empiricism throughout its discussions, rather than paying lip service to the issue. Overall, <italic>The Profession of Social Work</italic> is an exemplary introduction to the field.</p>
