<sec id="sec8-0961203313490434"><title>Purpose</title>
<p>Organ damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients is highly associated with the use of corticosteroids. Doses of prednisone below 6 mg daily are associated with reduced organ damage. We now report on the largest prospective cohort study of predictors of prednisone tapering in SLE patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0961203313490434"><title>Methods</title>
<p>A total of 866 SLE patients (91% female, 50% Caucasian, 43% African-American, mean age 43 years) who consented for the Hopkins Lupus Cohort from 1987 through 2009 were included. The analysis was based on patient visits in which the previously prescribed dose of prednisone was 5 mg/day. We then examined the proportion of times the patient’s dose was reduced to below 5 mg/day (“tapering”). Among those patients who tapered and were followed for at least one year thereafter, we examined the proportion whose prednisone dose remained below 5 mg/day for at least one year (“Successful tapering”). Rates of tapering and successful tapering were calculated for patient subsets based on demographic and clinical characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0961203313490434"><title>Result</title>
<p>The analyses showed that Caucasians, younger patients, patients with a higher level of education, lower disease activity, or absence of urine protein were more likely to have a prednisone taper. However, successful tapering was not dependent on age, ethnicity, or education. As expected, successful tapering was more frequent in those with lower disease activity. Successful tapering was achieved more often after the year 2000.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0961203313490434"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study suggests that successful tapering of prednisone below 5 mg has increased since the year 2000, which may reflect the greater knowledge of the long-term harm of even low-dose chronic corticosteroid use. Caucasians, younger age, higher level of education, and absence of proteinuria predicted tapering, but not successful tapering. Ongoing cutaneous or arthritis activity were associated with unsuccessful tapering. Lack of disease activity, as expected, was the only major clinical variable that significantly predicted successful tapering.</p>

<p>Organ damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is highly associated with the use of prednisone. In one study, 15 years after the diagnosis of SLE, 80% of permanent organ damage was directly or indirectly due to corticosteroids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313490434">1</xref></sup> In an analysis of the role of prednisone that adjusted for confounding by indication, even small doses of daily prednisone above 6 mg increased later organ damage. Doses of 18 mg or more had a hazard rate of 2.5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313490434">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mode of administration, not just the amount, of corticosteroid is also important. Intravenous methyprednisolone pulse therapy leads to the least long-term damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313490434">3</xref></sup> Daily oral prednisone (even at low doses) for prolonged periods is the most damaging, leading to more osteoporotic fractures, coronary artery disease, and cataracts when compared to daily high-dose prednisone or to pulse methylprednisolone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313490434">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tapering prednisone below 5 mg daily would help to prevent long-term organ damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313490434">2</xref></sup> However, adrenal insufficiency might prevent such taper in some SLE patients. Corticosteroid exposure results in a decrease in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the anterior pituitary, suppressing synthesis of glucocorticoids, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEA metabolites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313490434">4</xref></sup> DHEA depletion has significant adverse consequences on sex hormone production, bone health, endocrine and immune system function, and neuropsychiatric status. In fact, SLE patients tend to have lower levels of DHEA. DHEA levels are also significantly lower in patients on corticosteroid treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313490434">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a large SLE cohort, followed prospectively, we determined associates of prednisone tapering and successful tapering to less than 5 mg for one year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203313490434" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>This study included all patients with SLE who consented for the Hopkins Lupus Cohort from 1987 through 2009. The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. All patients gave written consent. Since cohort entry, basic demographic characteristics (date of birth, age at SLE onset, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, years of education, combined annual household income) have been recorded. Patients were seen at regular intervals of three months, or more frequently if medically indicated. At every visit, assessment of disease activity was recorded using the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) and the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI). The SELENA-SLEDAI is a weighted index of disease activity, in which central nervous system (CNS), renal, and vasculitis descriptors are given the heaviest weighting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313490434">6</xref></sup> Laboratory tests included a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum cholesterol, serum creatinine, urinalysis (and since 2006, urine protein/creatinine ratio), complement C3 and C4 levels, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), dilute Russell viper venom time for the lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin. The low C3 range was less than 79 mg/dl; the low C4 range was less than 12 mg/dl. Absent anti-dsDNA was defined as 0 by the Crithidia assay; positive was any positive titer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961203313490434"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The analysis was based on patient visits in which the previously prescribed dose of prednisone was exactly 5 mg/day. We then examined the proportion of times the patient’s dose was reduced to below 5 mg/day (“Tapering”). Among those patients who tapered and were followed for at least one year thereafter, we examined the proportion whose prednisone dose remained below 5 mg/day for at least one year (“Successful tapering”). Rates of tapering and successful tapering were calculated for patient subsets based on demographic and clinical characteristics. These included age, ethnicity, sex, education, type of organ involvement, SLEDAI, physician global assessment, C3, C4, anti-dsDNA, and presence or absence of immunosuppressive drug, hydroxychloroquine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Generalized estimating equations were used to calculate <italic>p</italic> values to account for correlation between repeated measures on the same person. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Analysis Software, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203313490434" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>All patients in the cohort who ever had a prednisone dose of 5 mg/day and who had a subsequent cohort clinic visit were included. This consisted of 866 SLE patients (91% female, 50% Caucasian, 43% African-American, mean age 43 years, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203313490434">Table 1</xref>). These patients contributed 7617 visits in which the previous prescription was 5 mg/day of prednisone. The dose of prednisone was reduced (tapered) in 821 (11%) of the visits.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203313490434">Table 2</xref> shows the relationship between various patient characteristics and prednisone tapering. Gender and year were not strongly associated with tapering. Caucasians and patients with a higher level of education were more likely to have a prednisone taper. Younger patients were more likely to taper. As expected, those with higher activity, by either PGA or SELENA-SLEDAI, were less likely to taper. As for laboratory tests, the absence of urine protein (either 0 by dipstick or normal on the urine protein to creatinine ratio) was predictive of more tapering. Levels of C3, C4, and anti-dsDNA were not predictive of tapering.

<p>The majority of permanent organ damage in SLE is directly or indirectly related to corticosteroids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313490434">7</xref></sup> The effect is, of course, greater for higher doses, but even doses less than 7.5 mg increase later organ damage by 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313490434">8</xref></sup> The most common organ system damaged—the musculoskeletal system—is largely osteoporotic fractures, for which even a small dose of prednisone is a risk factor.</p>
<p>Although there is wide acceptance on the need to reduce prednisone use in SLE, a goal of 7.5 mg of prednisone is often set. Concern about adrenal insufficiency and some acceptance that “low-dose” steroids are “acceptable” in SLE has led to a reluctance to push the taper to lower doses. In our study, we investigated the success of taper to below 5 mg. Of those who tapered and were followed for at least one year, 55% remained below 5 mg. A strength of our study is its prospective database, with all patients followed by protocol. Because the protocol for the Hopkins Lupus Cohort has not changed since its inception more than 25 years ago, it allowed us to collect a large number of evaluable patients.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that successful tapering of prednisone below 5 mg for more than a year has increased since the year 2000. The proportion of successful tapering increased from 46% before 2000 to 61% after the year 2000 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0008). This may reflect the greater knowledge of the long-term harm of chronic corticosteroid use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313490434">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313490434"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313490434">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Caucasian ethnicity (<italic>p</italic> = 0.019), younger age (<italic>p</italic> = 0.029), and higher level of education (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0139) predicted tapering. However, these factors did not predict successful tapering. Absence of proteinuria was associated with tapering (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001). The presence or absence of proteinuria was not a predictor of successful tapering. However, the data clearly indicate that successful tapering is <underline>less</underline> likely in patients with ongoing active mucocutaneous or musculoskeletal lupus. These patients appear to benefit from the small dose of 5 mg of prednisone daily.</p>
<p>Disease activity was the only major clinical manifestation that significantly predicted successful tapering. Logically, the less activity there is, the more room there is to taper prednisone below 5 mg, for the longest duration possible. It did not matter whether the PGA or the SELENA-SLEDAI was used to assess disease activity. On the 0 to 3 visual analog scare, a score of 1.0 is considered mild. A PGA score of less than 0.5 led to the most successful taper (64%), followed by the range of 0.5–1 (48%). Patients with PGA scores of more than 0.5, indicating more disease activity but still in the mild range, were less able to taper prednisone, but a significant proportion of them (43%) still tapered successfully. A similar trend was noticed with SELENA-SLEDAI, with more successful tapering with the lowest scores (0, 1, or 2). In fact, in the previous randomized clinical trial of prasterone for SLE, successful tapering in the placebo arm was common with SLEDAIs of 2 or less.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313490434">9</xref></sup> These data should translate to the clinical trial setting as a possible threshold for “indicated” prednisone taper.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study identified clinical low disease activity (SLEDAI of 2 or less and PGA scores of 0.5 or less) as predictors of successful prednisone tapering below 5 mg in SLE, in the absence of active rash or musculoskeletal involvement.</p>
