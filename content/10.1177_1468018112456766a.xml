<p>Since 1990 a number of countries have attempted to convert their public pension liabilities into mandatory private savings in order to limit welfare state costs and boost financial markets. A frequently neglected problem in this process is the emergence of so-called transition costs: in order to redirect part of the public pension contributions to private savings, the government must finance the temporarily lost revenues to the public pillar. The international financial and economic crisis underlined the limits of this transformation: the public and the private pillars suffered from the contraction of GDP and the drop of stock prices, respectively. Some governments reduced the contributions flowing to the private pillar in order to make room for anti-cyclical stimulus measures. The Hungarian government has not only suspended this flow but raided the accumulated capital in individual accounts.</p>

<title>Building up the private pillar</title>
<p>Following the 1994 advice from the World Bank, the Hungarian government, in 1998, carved out a mandatory funded private pension (second pillar) from the mandatory pay-as-you-go public pension (first pillar), thus creating a mixed system. Members of the pension funds were to pay about a quarter of future pension contributions to a private account. The government made the mixed system mandatory for beginners and offered two possibilities to those already working: either to stay in the reformed monopillar system, or to enter the mixed system and renounce a quarter of the pension rights already acquired. About half of those affected joined the second pillar voluntarily in 1998–1999 and another quarter of the workforce entered mandatorily between 1998 and 2010.</p>
<p>The Hungarian private pension schemes did not function as real funds. Rather, they were more comparable to associations, with members as the proprietors of their own funds as in a genuine cooperative. In fact, the majority of members joined one of five associations, each managed by a large, international financial institution (i.e. a bank or insurance company). The operating costs of these funds were very high, and the resulting (real) yields were rather low. For example: an investment made at the beginning of the new pension programme would have, by May 2011, earned a real gain of only 10% over 13 years. Neither governments nor the participants in these pension funds paid much attention to problems inherent in the funds; even the issue of the unisex life annuity was not solved until after the system had been shut down.</p>
<p>There was also a more fundamental problem with the 1998 reform. The reformers were not in a position to raise the already very high contribution rates (31% of gross wage); nor were they able to reduce pension benefits significantly. As a consequence, the shortfall in incoming contributions to the monopillar public pension system was made up by an increase in the government deficit and debt. Some reformers naively assumed that this solution would constrain other public expenditures, but this expectation proved faulty: budget deficits ran between 4 and 9% of GDP. Until 2008, these deficits were easy to finance; with the arrival of the international financial and economic crisis, however, everything changed. After October 2008, the Hungarian government was finally forced to reduce its public expenditure, further contributing to the pain caused by a sharply contracting economy.</p>

<title>The elimination of the private pillar</title>
<p>In April 2010 a populist ‘conservative’ party won a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections. With its super-majority, it was capable of instituting sweeping changes, including to the constitution. When the EU declined the request of the Hungarian government, along with others, to deduct the flow and stock of transition costs from the official budget deficit and from government debt (1.3% and 11% of GDP, respectively), the Hungarian government chose a ‘revolutionary solution’: it effectively closed down the private pillar.</p>
<p>Rather than explicitly eliminating the private funds, the Hungarian government simply made its citizens an offer they couldn’t refuse. Participants in private funds were given a choice: they could either return to the public monopillar system and cash the positive real yields accumulated in the account; or stay in the private pillar and accept that future contributions to the public pillar (24%) would not earn any new returns. It is a small wonder, therefore, that only 3% of the members stayed – representing about 10% of the total capital.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that only half the pension funds’ capital was used to diminish the government’s explicit debt, and that even this reduction has been partially eliminated by irresponsible economic policy. In 2012 the Hungarian public finances are as bad as they were in 2010, but with no private pillar. In a typical move, the government decided one year later that there would no longer be any choice in the matter of personal pension funds: it simply forbade anyone from making further contributions to the private pillar. Most likely, it sought to gain access to the remaining 0.2% of GDP flowing annually to the funds, and also wanted to acquire the remaining pension capital (1% of GDP).</p>
<p>Since the funds are not allowed to use their members’ capital to finance operating costs, they will almost certainly have to be closed down. At the same time, the government reinstated accrual rights from the public pillar for those who had stayed in the private pillar. Using the language of game theory, because future governments could return the lost rights to the public pillar of the remaining members, the government’s original threat was not credible. However, the two-stage strategy probably did serve its aim: to completely eliminate the second pillar while maintaining the illusion of free choice. The ‘only’ loss is an intangible one – the Hungarian people trust their government even less than they did before. Accordingly, they will be more likely to cheat, and will probably pay fewer taxes and contributions. Unfounded rumours that the government will seize bank accounts further contribute to this deep distrust. It remains to be seen what the government’s new pension policy will be.</p>
