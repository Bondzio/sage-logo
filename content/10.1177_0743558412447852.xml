<abstract>
<p>American college housing is beginning to introduce gender-neutral housing, or the housing of students in the same room regardless of gender. This study provides a descriptive overview of gender-neutral housing from 148 universities and documents central areas of debate in current policy discussions. Information regarding gender-neutral housing policies and practices at each of these campuses was collected. Results suggest that gender-neutral housing is currently an uncommon occurrence as a formalized housing option for most students. However, almost half of the schools sampled are currently engaging in formal or informal policy discussion regarding the addition of gender-neutral housing. Important future questions and priorities for both college administrators and scholars are suggested.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>College housing has been an integral part of most college students’ university experience for much of the last 100 years. With U.S. college enrollment exceeding 20 million students in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0743558412447852">National Center for Education Statistics, 2011</xref>) and many of these students living in on-campus housing, college residential life is becoming an increasingly important aspect of the college experience and the lives of millions of emerging adults. Scholars have noted that studies on both general college housing trends and the effect of housing on developmental and behavioral outcomes are sorely lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0743558412447852">Willoughby &amp; Carroll, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0743558412447852">Willoughby, Carroll, Marshall, &amp; Caitlin, 2009</xref>). Pointing to research that suggests college housing environments have an impact on many aspects of emerging adults’ lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0743558412447852">Roudsari, Leahy, &amp; Walters, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0743558412447852">Zamboanga et al., 2009</xref>), recent efforts to document and explore college housing have largely focused on the impact of coresidential halls where men and women live together in the same building. While this work has yielded an important understanding of how this type of housing environment impacts students, these studies have largely been documenting a housing shift that began between 40 and 50 years ago and is already a staple of college housing in the United States.</p>
<p>Recently, another shift has begun to occur at American colleges and universities that has the potential to have a similar impact on the development of tens of thousands of emerging adults. Some universities have begun to implement gender-neutral housing, or housing that allows men and women to share the same room. While local and national media coverage has highlighted this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0743558412447852">Gordon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0743558412447852">Marklein, 2004</xref>), no data currently exist on how prevalent gender-neutral housing is or how it is being implemented at universities today. With this study, we sought to systematically document the current prevalence of gender-neutral housing at universities in the United States. We attempted to assess the number of universities that have implemented gender-neutral housing, how many universities have considered doing so, what factors are being considered in these decisions, and how this type of housing is typically structured and implemented.</p>
<p>We believe that the advent of gender-neutral housing may represent a new wave of change coming to college housing. We thus document this change so that developmental and sociological scholars, as well as college administrators, may focus on the potential impacts of this emerging trend. Scholars have noted that documenting historical and current changes to university policies are an important first step because without such information, “. . . university and housing officials will not be able to create informed and beneficial programs to encourage healthy emerging adult development” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0743558412447852">Willoughby et al., 2009</xref>, p. 34).</p>
<sec id="section2-0743558412447852">
<title>College Housing and Emerging Adult Development</title>
<p>Based on recent work by emerging adult scholars, a significant link has been identified between the type of university housing a student resides in and individual academic and developmental outcomes. Overall, scholars have found that living on-campus as opposed to living off-campus tends to have positive effects on students’ social development and academic achievement. Studies have shown that students living in on-campus housing are more likely to be involved in student organizations, and, to a limited degree, that a small portion of students benefit academically by living in residence halls while attending college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0743558412447852">Schroeder &amp; Marble, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0743558412447852">Turley &amp; Wodtke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0743558412447852">Winston &amp; Anchors, 1993</xref>). Research has also shown that living on campus while attending college increases the likelihood of degree completion and post-first year student retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0743558412447852">Bozick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0743558412447852">Velez, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0743558412447852">Winston &amp; Anchors, 1993</xref>). However, on-campus living has also been found to be associated with elevated student risk taking behavior. Researchers have found that, even after controlling for age, students who live on campus possess more positive attitudes towards alcohol consumption, are more likely to participate in binge drinking and show increased levels of sexual behavior than students who live off campus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0743558412447852">Bourgeois &amp; Bowen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0743558412447852">Wechsler, Dowdall, Davenport, &amp; Castillo, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0743558412447852">Willoughby &amp; Carroll, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, scholars have also discovered a link between risk taking behavior and the gender make up of housing units. Beyond an increased risk taking potential for students living on campus, students living in coed housing are even more likely to participate in risk taking behavior than those living in gender-specific housing units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0743558412447852">Cross, Zimmerman, &amp; O’Grady, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0743558412447852">Willoughby &amp; Carroll, 2009</xref>). Specifically, studies have found that drinking behaviors increased in coed living arrangements, particularly for females. This likely occurs as college women are more fully exposed to the elevated drinking and risk taking behavior of their male peers.</p>
<p>These trends suggest that the close proximity of men and women in college housing has an influence on student behaviors and outcomes. This provides a basis to hypothesize that rooming men and women in the same room would also likely influence student behavior. Scholars have already noted that gender-neutral housing may impact gender behavior and beliefs, with some researchers suggesting that currently existing gendered housing policies are heterosexist and promote outdated gender ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0743558412447852">Bieberg, 2003</xref>). Given that student housing is linked to numerous outcomes such as risk-taking behavior, academic behavior, and satisfaction with the college experience, documenting the prevalence and context of gender-neutral housing serves as an important first step in understanding this new form of college housing and will serve as a stepping stone for future outcome-based research.</p>
<p>The goal of the present investigation was to document the current status of gender-neutral housing in the United States by exploring both its prevalence at major universities across the country and describing how it is currently being utilized by campuses where gender-neutral housing exists or is under serious consideration. We hope this may serve as a roadmap for future scholars who desire to explore and examine the potentially positive or negative effects of this recent shift in university housing policy. For the present study, we chose to follow the strategy of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0743558412447852">Willoughby and colleagues (2009)</xref> with their documentation of the transition to coed housing. Our study was guided by the following three key research questions:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0743558412447852">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Two unique samples of universities were utilized in this study. First, a list of the largest 100 universities by enrollment in the United States was obtained from the National Center for Educational Statistics. This initial sample was then screened and only universities that offered on-campus student housing were retained. This left us with an initial sample of 88 schools. We then continued to add schools from the same source based on enrollment until we reached a sample size of 100 universities. These 100 universities represent the largest schools, by enrollment, in the United States that offer on-campus student housing.</p>
<p>Our second, smaller sample consisted of universities who currently offer gender-neutral housing on their campus, but were not included in our initial list of 100 universities. This list was created in order to examine a wide variety of universities which have already implemented gender-neutral policies at their campus. This list was generated via a referral, snowball sampling method where schools that were contacted for having gender-neutral housing were asked to identify other universities that offered gender-neutral housing. Universities that responded to our initial inquiries and indicated that they offered gender-neutral housing were asked what other campuses they were aware of that also offered such housing. This method resulted in a sample of 48 additional smaller universities in addition to the schools already sampled in our initial list of 100 universities. While likely not an inclusive list of all universities with gender-neutral housing in the United States, this sample included schools of various sizes, locations, and affiliations and is likely representative of most schools that offer gender-neutral housing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0743558412447852">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Data from our initial sample of 100 universities were gathered through two main mechanisms. First, descriptive data on the type, number, and structure of housing options at each university were gathered from university housing websites. Next, emails were sent to housing directors at each university asking a series of questions pertaining to how gender-neutral housing was implemented or if it was being considered in any way on each campus. In some cases where our original emails were not responded to, phone calls were made to university housing offices to obtain this information. Of the 100 universities who were sent emails or were called requesting information, 98 responded for a response rate of 98%. For the other two universities, general housing information was gathered via housing and university websites. All information obtained was centralized to one spreadsheet that the research team examined for common patterns and themes.</p>
<p>Universities which currently offer a form of gender-neutral housing were contacted and asked a series of questions regarding what policies pertained to gender-neutral housing, the number of students which utilized gender-neutral housing and the reasons why gender-neutral housing was introduced. These questions were open-ended and responses from each school’s housing director were collected via either email or phone conversations. This information was likewise centralized and analyzed for common patterns and themes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0743558412447852">
<title>Survey Measurement</title>
<p>The emails that were sent to the housing offices of the 100 large universities asked a series of five questions requesting information about the presence of gender-neutral housing on their campuses. These questions included, Does your university provide any type of official gender-neutral housing (i.e. housing where individuals of the opposite gender are allowed to share a room)?; Could you briefly describe (or provide a link or document) outlining what type of gender-neutral housing is provided and who is allowed to utilize it?; Are there any special policies pertaining to this housing that are different than typical housing policies (such as limiting it to juniors/seniors or having specific housing agreement policies)?; Has there been any formal discussion about adding or changing gender-neutral housing policies at your university?; And has there been any informal discussion or interest (from student leadership groups, student newspapers, etc.) to add or change gender-neutral housing policies at your university? Those schools that answered affirmatively to the questions about the presence of gender-neutral housing were then administered a second email asking them for more specific information about their housing policies as well as the number of students participating in general-neutral housing each academic year. Universities which offered only married student housing or graduate student apartments were not counted as offering gender-neutral housing.</p>
<p>A separate email was administered to the 48 other universities we identified as having gender-neutral housing programs outside of the 100 large universities. This email included the second and third question from our original email, as well as two more questions regarding the reasons why these universities chose to implement gender-neutral housing. Finally, these schools were also asked about the number of participants in their gender-neutral housing programs.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section8-0743558412447852">
<title>Prevalence of Gender-Neutral Housing</title>
<p>Overall, we found that the actual formalized and official practice of gender-neutral housing at large American universities to be rather limited. Of the 100 large universities surveyed, 16 indicated they offer some form of gender-neutral housing. Two common themes emerged based on the responses from these universities. First, many of the schools (seven) implement gender-neutral housing on a case-by-case basis and do not have a widespread program in place. These universities indicated that this type of gender-neutral housing was assigned by assessing both the student’s needs and the housing options at the universities. Additionally, some universities (three) allowed gender-neutral housing to only a limited portion of the student population (typically for transgender students).</p>
<p>Follow-up inquires regarding the procedures used in these case by case determinations and the number of students that utilized gender-neutral housing indicated a lack of both written policies and tracking of students in gender-neutral housing. Every university that currently utilizes gender-neutral housing on a case-by-case basis indicated they do not keep track of the number of students currently using the program. Results did suggest a notable geographical distinction for those schools who offered gender-neutral housing. Almost 50% of the schools with current gender-neutral housing were located in the Northeastern United States with the rest being located about equally in the Midwest and on the West coast. Universities in the southern areas of the country reported virtually no gender neutral housing. Of those schools who currently offer gender-neutral housing, about two thirds were private universities and colleges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0743558412447852">
<title>Informal and Formal Discussions About Gender-Neutral Housing</title>
<p>Despite finding that relatively few large universities currently have an official form of gender-neutral housing, findings regarding the formal and informal discussion currently taking place at universities revealed what is likely an upcoming wave of transition in the college housing landscape. Of the 98 universities that responded to our inquiry about the status of discussions regarding gender-neutral housing on their campuses, 41% responded that some form of formal or informal discussion had already taken place regarding introducing gender-neutral housing on campus or expanding it. Of those 40 schools, 27% indicated that administrators were currently engaged in serious formal discussion about introducing or expanding gender-neutral housing. Taking away universities that already had a form of gender-neutral housing implemented, 13% of universities who do not currently have gender-neutral housing indicated that some form of formal discussion was currently taking place to introduce gender-neutral housing on their campus in the near future. Additionally, 50% of the largest 10 universities in the country by enrollment either had a form of gender-neutral housing or are formally discussing adding it in the near future.</p>
<p>Geographical findings considering the formal and informal discussion of gender-neutral housing found additional interesting geographical differences in the distribution of informal and formal discussions at the university level. While the East and West Coast schools were more likely to have gender-neutral housing policies, findings regarding the discussion of gender-neutral housing suggested that most new policies may occur in the Midwest portion of the country. Of the 26 schools currently engaged in formal discussions about adding or expanding gender-neutral housing, 11 (42%) were schools in midwestern states such as Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, and Michigan. Expansion of gender-neutral housing also appeared evident on both coasts where another 35% of formal discussions were taking place. Again, universities in the southern portions of the country indicated very little movement toward gender-neutral housing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0743558412447852">
<title>Case Study—University of Colorado at Boulder</title>
<p>A case study is often useful in illustrating general themes via a specific example. The University of Colorado at Boulder currently does not offer any form of gender-neutral housing. However, one resident hall is currently in the process of seeking formal administrative approval to transition a coed resident hall to a gender-neutral resident hall. Proposal documentation obtained by the research team may illustrate many of the common issues currently being considered as universities begin piloting gender-neutral housing at their universities. In this document, seven points were given in the proposal documentation in favor of implementing gender-neutral housing. These seven points can be summarized into three general themes; breaking down traditional gender stereotypes, giving men and women experience with each other, and pragmatic housing issues.</p>
<sec id="section11-0743558412447852">
<title>Breaking down traditional gender stereotypes</title>
<p>Three of the seven points in the proposal were related to breaking down traditional gender barriers and allowing students to gain exposure to people and groups that may be new to them. Gender-neutral housing was proposed to do this in two ways. First, by promoting the idea that gender differences are minimal or perpetuated by cultural norms. For example, the proposal states:
<disp-quote>
<p>It supports the idea that men and women should be treated the same and thus should be able to room together if they please. It stays away from the idea that men and women are different and thus should be segregated from each other. . . . Gender roles where women act in their own certain way and men do as well are binaries creating certain roles or actions that are assigned based on gender, such as all men like sports, are all dirty and that all women like shopping and make up. The implementation of gender-neutral housing would provide students with real life experiences in which these binaries don’t always hold up. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0743558412447852">Peguero, Hoffman, &amp; Beaver, 2011</xref>, p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gender-neutral housing was also suggested as a way to give heterosexual students more exposure to the LGBT community that would give these students a more broad understanding of gender and gender identity. Other universities sampled were even more explicit about the focus of gender-neutral housing for the LGBT student population. One college required all students utilizing gender-neutral housing to sign a special housing agreement that included the language:
<disp-quote>
<p>I understand that the purpose of gender-neutral housing is to allow transgender, transsexual, gender nonconformist, and non-heterosexual students to be more comfortable in their living environment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0743558412447852">McGee, Smith, &amp; Rago, 2008</xref>, p. 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0743558412447852">
<title>Giving men and women experience with each other</title>
<p>Two points in the proposal highlighted that gender-neutral housing would allow men and women to gain experience interacting with each other in ways that may be beneficial after college. For example, the document stated that
<disp-quote>
<p>In the real world people are going to interact with people of different genders all the time. Our world is not separated into same-sex spheres. Men and women need to learn to relate to each other, especially in the work place, and sharing a dorm with a person of a different sex can be good practice. . . . By offering gender-neutral housing as an option we are encouraging different communities to coexist with each other, and are enabling people to learn more about each other. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0743558412447852">Peguero et al., 2011</xref>, p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gender-neutral housing was proposed to increase interaction between the sexes and allow for students to practice essential cross-gender interactions in a college housing setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0743558412447852">
<title>Pragmatic housing issues</title>
<p>Finally, the document also highlighted two pragmatic rationales for gender-neutral housing. The proposal suggested that gender-neutral housing gives students more options for living on-campus. Gender-neutral housing in this case was conceptualized, not as a replacement for other forms of housing, but as another option that students who wish to do so may select. The document also suggests that males and female have the same basic needs and thus no structural or procedural changes would need to take place to implement gender-neutral housing.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that another argument included in the document was actually a counter argument for the claim that gender-neutral housing may increase sexual activity by allowing men and women close, proximate access to each other. The document claims that
<disp-quote>
<p>Just because men and women share a room together doesn’t mean they will be sexually active with each other. Common concerns are that shared rooms would result in promiscuous sex. However, there is no evidence supporting this idea . . . (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0743558412447852">Peguero et al., 2011</xref>, p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Across all the large universities we sampled, no universities have any clear or overt policies regarding the sexual behavior of students in gender-neutral housing or any official policies regarding romantically paired couples utilizing gender-neutral housing to live together on campus. Indeed, the norm across universities sampled seemed to be a general discouragement of romantic couples utilizing gender-neutral housing without any formal policy. For example, one university states the following in their FAQ document regarding gender-neutral housing in response to the question of if romantic couples can apply, “Gender Neutral Housing is not intended for romantic couples. However, we respect and honor the privacy of our students, so current open housing procedures do not require students to disclose the reason for their roommate requests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0743558412447852">Rutgers University, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, while compiling gender-neutral housing polices across several universities, we discovered that three universities utilized the following statement, verbatim in regards to romantic relationships within gender-neutral housing: “[university name] discourages students of any sexual orientation who are in a relationship from living together in a residence hall housing unit, although we do not question the student’s motives for wanting to live in a gender-neutral housing option.” Despite a lack of specific policies regarding sexual or dating behavior, several university policies suggested a desire for gender-neutral housing to not be utilized by romantic couples.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0743558412447852">
<title>Policies for Implementing and Practicing Gender-Neutral Housing</title>
<p>The 48 schools in our second sample provided an important cross section of universities who have already established gender-neutral housing on their campuses. These schools had a similar geographical layout as the schools that had gender-neutral housing from our initial sample, with most being located in the Northeast (42%), West Coast (17%) or Midwest (23%). Information obtained from these schools revealed a rather consistent pattern of how gender-neutral housing seems to be implemented. Many policies echoed those found amongst the largest 100 universities in the country who also had gender-neutral housing. Many schools with gender-neutral housing only offered it on a case-by case basis and a handful only offered it to transgender students. When asked about the number of students which utilized these programs, many universities in the second sample of schools likewise had no internal data on how many students lived in a given year in gender-neutral housing. When universities did have anecdotal information, most universities suggested that less than 50 students a year utilized gender-neutral housing. Beyond these reoccurring themes, three consistent patterns emerged in our second sample.</p>
<p>First, gender-neutral housing was typically closely connected with sexual minority groups on campus. Many universities offered gender-neutral housing in one centralized location or resident hall that explicitly linked gender-neutral housing to the campus LGBT student organization. In many cases, gender-neutral housing was discussed as specifically servicing the needs of LGBT and transgender students. Universities reported that many LGBT students felt more comfortable rooming with a member of the opposite sex. Thus, gender-neutral hosing provided an important service to this specific student minority population. Typically, these universities would advertise and discuss gender-neutral housing in conjunction with providing a safe living space for sexual minority students or students who wanted more exposure to that student population.</p>
<p>Second, most of the schools which offered gender-neutral housing had in place a screening policy which allowed them to closely monitor students selecting this housing option. Almost all schools with gender-neutral housing required more documentation and evaluation for students than traditional student housing applications. In most cases, this involved additional paperwork or application material. Two of the schools sampled required one-on-one interviews as a part of the application process to access gender-neutral housing. However, none of the schools sampled indicated that this additional screening was about omitting students or precluding them from living in gender-neutral housing. Instead, most universities discussed these additional screenings as a means of being able to match students with a housing option that fit their needs and university housing availability.</p>
<p>Finally, almost all universities that currently offer on-campus gender-neutral housing placed specific restrictions on which students could access gender-neutral housing. By far, the most common restriction mentioned was related to age. In almost every case of gender-neutral housing documented, universities restricted access to only returning or non-freshman students. Although none of the universities contacted gave an explicit reason for this restriction, is it likely this widespread policy exists to prevent underage students from sharing a mixed-sex room together. Location was another common restriction implemented by universities. Most gender-neutral housing was centralized into one resident hall or one location on campus.</p>
<p>A few schools sampled mentioned other restrictions. Three of the schools sampled had specific policies regarding romantic couples. In two cases, romantic couples were banned from utilizing gender-neutral housing and in one case they were “discouraged” from living on-campus together. However, none of the universities documented how such a ban was enforced or monitored. Other universities presumably circumvented this issue by requiring students living in gender-neutral housing to be assigned roommates by lottery and not by their own choice or preference. One university also required students who wanted to live in gender-neutral housing to present documentation that their parents were “aware of their living situation.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results from our survey of large universities in the United States indicated that gender-neutral housing is becoming a more common housing option for many students. In line with recent media attention focused towards the increase of gender-neutral housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0743558412447852">Gordon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0743558412447852">Marklein, 2004</xref>), 16% of the largest universities in the United States already have some form of gender-neutral housing in practice, while another 13% of universities are currently conducting some form of formal discussion or investigation into the implementation of gender-neutral housing on their campuses. Between universities who either already offer gender-neutral housing or are currently formally considering it, nearly one million students (965,299) enrolled at these universities may soon have access to gender-neutral housing. Combined with universities which have begun to have informal discussions about gender-neutral housing, almost half of the largest universities in the United States are currently poised to continue or to start transitioning a portion of their housing to be gender-neutral.</p>
<p>We note that our findings suggested a strong geographical split in the implementation, practice, and discussion of gender-neutral housing. Most current gender-neutral housing tended to be located on the east and west coast, as well as the Midwest. Schools in this area were also the most likely to be discussing expanding or adding such housing options. These areas of the country have traditionally been associated with more liberal political leanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0743558412447852">Gastner, Shalizi, &amp; Newman, 2011</xref>) and less general religiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0743558412447852">Unger, 2005</xref>), both of which may suggest more tolerance for gender-neutral housing policies. Other scholars have noted the so called “blue states” may be more open to alternative family forms and hold more nontraditional values about relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0743558412447852">Monson &amp; Mertens, 2011</xref>). Results indicated that the southern regions of the country included virtually no universities with current or future plans for gender-neutral housing. This is likely due to the unique political and social conservatism of these areas which may hinder such housing policies from being implemented. It is unclear then if more traditional and religious areas of the country, such as the southern states, will eventually welcome a transition to gender-neutral housing in the future.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that this transition closely mirrors that of coresidential halls that began in the 1960’s and 1970’s. As documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0743558412447852">Willoughby and colleagues (2009)</xref>, coed housing was first tested with pilot programs and small portions of campus until student demand led to an accelerated expansion of these programs. Coed halls were largely first organized due to the needs of an expanding college minority group (women) and the transition was largely undertaken with little to no formal evaluation, research, or documentation. Likewise, results from this study suggest that many universities currently practice gender-neutral housing in limited ways in order to serve a minority population (LGBT students), perhaps in reaction to currently perceived heterosexist housing policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0743558412447852">Bieberg, 2003</xref>). Although the specifics of informal and formal discussions at each university were not gathered for the present study, none of the universities contacted indicated they had conducted any evaluation of these programs or documented how students are utilizing them.</p>
<p>Given the results of our study and this impending change, we offer several suggestions to both college administrators and developmental researchers for future consideration as gender-neutral housing becomes more prevalent in the future and the need for continued work in this area increases.</p>
<sec id="section16-0743558412447852">
<title>Priorities for College Administrators</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0743558412447852">Willoughby and Carroll (2009)</xref> noted that the transition from gender specific to coed residence halls happened with little to no formal evaluation on the part of individual universities or academic scholars. It was noted that administrators at the time did not take into account the full range of impacts that coed dorms might have for their students. Likewise, early indications suggests that the transition to gender-neutral housing may be happening with little to no formal evaluation, but is instead being driven by the same factors as the transition to coed housing, namely student demand and the desire to service a small and select student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0743558412447852">Willoughby et al., 2009</xref>). Given numerous studies that have indicated coed resident hall living impacts student outcomes and risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0743558412447852">Cross et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0743558412447852">Wechsler et al., 1995</xref>), this should be a top priority of college administrators and housing officials. Additionally, none of the universities contacted were able to provide detailed information about how college students felt about gender-neutral housing options. It would be informative to understand what types of students desire this type of housing to better direct future policies toward these targeted populations.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest implication for college and housing administrators regarding gender-neutral housing is also one that was largely absent from the responses given by universities. Heterosexual romantic relationships were seemingly a neglected part of formal gender-neutral housing policies or as a consideration during the discussion of implementing gender-neutral housing. Currently, only 3 of the 64 universities with gender-neutral housing offered a specific policy about romantic couples rooming together. Of those three, one policy involved only a recommendation to students, a common practice among universities that offer gender-neutral housing.</p>
<p>Although most gender-neutral housing is currently being provided or intended for a sexual minority student population, as gender-neutral housing becomes more widespread and available to more students, heterosexual couples will likely see on-campus housing as a financially cheap and convenient option for rooming together. Other scholars who have commented on the possibility of gender-neutral housing have likewise noted that heterosexual couples will likely want to utilize gender-neutral housing policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0743558412447852">Bieberg, 2003</xref>). Research on heterosexual cohabitation over the last two decades has consistently shown that cohabitation is linked to numerous negative couple and individual outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0743558412447852">Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0743558412447852">Goodwin, Mosher, &amp; Chandra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0743558412447852">Rhoades, Stanley, &amp; Markman, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0743558412447852">2009</xref>). Regardless of if gender neural housing promotes variations of cohabitation that may hinder long-term relationship progression, the utilization of gender-neutral housing by romantic heterosexual couples may increase the potential administration strain on housing arrangements as housing officials balance the needs of stability in housing assignments with the potential fragility of romantic relationships among college students.</p>
<p>Another priority for college administrators is to consider the implication of proposing a campus environment that deemphasizes gender differences. Although breaking down gender barriers and stereotypical gender beliefs was a common rationale given by universities for proposing gender-neutral housing, scholarship on young adult behavior has long shown strong gender differences in academic, risk-taking and coupling behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0743558412447852">Cho &amp; Span, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0743558412447852">Randolph, Torres, Gore-Felton, Lloyd, &amp; McGarvey, 2009</xref>) Many prominent social science scholars in areas such as sexuality have also noted that differences clearly exist between men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0743558412447852">Peplau, 2003</xref>), which may run counter to the type of environment that some universities are hoping to achieve. Additionally, past research has suggested that when gender differences do diminish through coresidence, this tends to be due to women increasing risky behavior to mirror that of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0743558412447852">Cross et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0743558412447852">Willoughby &amp; Carroll, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0743558412447852">
<title>Priorities for Researchers</title>
<p>Perhaps the most pressing goal for empirical researchers interested in college student behavior and housing is to understand the impact gender-neutral housing may have on outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0743558412447852">Cross and colleagues (2009)</xref> found that when women are living in close proximity to men, they tend to increase their drinking behavior. This may suggest that gender-neutral housing may not alleviate gendered behavior, but instead pull female behavior closer to typical male behavior. Given that male college students have typically been found to have elevated risk-taking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0743558412447852">Grello, Welsh, &amp; Harper, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0743558412447852">Wechsler et al., 1995</xref>), it is possible that gender-neutral housing may have the unintended side effect of increasing student risk-taking by driving up higher levels of female risk behavior. It is also possible that gender-neutral housing may be associated with healthy and positive behaviors or that previous findings, which have largely been with heterosexual student samples, may not hold up with the largely LGBT populations which utilize gender-neutral housing options. Regardless of the directionality of outcomes, scholarship is needed to understand how gender-neutral housing may influence risk-taking behavior, a major concern for most university campuses.</p>
<p>Scholars should also invest time in understanding how other student outcomes may be influenced by the introduction of gender-neutral housing. For example, some universities cited that gender-neutral housing should reduce gendered behavior and gender stereotypes by putting men and women in close proximity. Scholars should investigate these claims to see if empirical evidence supports them. Additionally, sexual behavior may be assumed to increase when men and women share the same room. Research is needed to see if increases actually occur or if most male/female roommate pairings are able to maintain a plutonic, nonsexual relationship. Finally, given that housing has traditionally been linked to many academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0743558412447852">Turley &amp; Wodtke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0743558412447852">Winston &amp; Anchors, 1993</xref>), scholars should investigate how gender-neutral housing may influence outcomes such as GPA, study habits and school involvement.</p>
<p>One other area of note for scholars was the lack of attention to larger family and parental issues that may have an impact on the effect of gender-neutral housing. Only one university sampled had any specific policy regarding parents and the housing decisions of their children. Although this is hardly a unique omission of gender-neutral housing policies, given that parents still play a strong role in the lives of young adult college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0743558412447852">Padilla-Walker, Nelson, Madsen, &amp; Barry, 2008</xref>), scholars should investigate how the implementation of gender-neutral housing may affect parent-child relationships. This may be an especially salient issue if parents have markedly different preferences, beliefs, and attitudes regarding gender-neutral housing than their children. If these differences exist, decisions to live in gender-neutral housing may be a potential area of conflict between some parents and their young adult children.</p>
<p>The present study has some limitations that should be considered. First, the sample obtained does not reflect all universities in the United States and thus percentages and other findings should be interpreted as illustrative of larger trends and not as actual population frequencies regarding gender-neutral housing. Although the sample obtain allowed for patterns in gender-neutral housing to be described, variations and omissions likely exist. Second, the data presented here represent only a brief overview of gender-neutral housing policies and practices. Because our focus was to present an overview of this transition, the nuances and specific aspects of these policies were not fully examined.</p>
<p>Results from this study strongly suggest that gender-neutral housing may become a more prominent and common housing option for many students in the near future. The fact that this transition is still in its early phases suggests that both scholars and college officials have time to undertake this transition with systematic evaluation regarding the effect it may have on their student populations.</p>
