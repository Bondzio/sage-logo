<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470320313489206">Figure 1</xref>) in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) via proteolysis of angiotensin I (Ang I) to the vasopressor angiotensin II (Ang II), and by degradation of the vasodilator bradykinin (BK). The importance of these activities is emphasized by the extensive use of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. ACE also exhibits several roles not directly involved in blood pressure homeostasis, including roles in immunity, fibrosis and hematopoiesis. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320313489206">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>ACE is an integral membrane protein, with a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region and a large, 1249-residue, highly glycosylated extracellular region that consists of two homologous, catalytically active domains (known as the C and N domains), which likely originated from a gene duplication event.</p>
<p>Although the catalytic domains share around 55% sequence identity, they exhibit important physical and functional differences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320313489206">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320313489206">3</xref></sup> The C domain is more dependent on chloride activation and less thermally stable than the more highly glycosylated N domain. Crucially, the two domains exhibit different substrate specificities. The two domains cleave BK with similar efficiencies, whereas the C domain is more efficient at cleaving Ang I. The in vivo importance of the C domain with regards to Ang I cleavage was established in mice models (see below).</p>
<p>Several substrates are predominantly cleaved by the N domain under in vitro conditions, including the tetrapeptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP), GnRH and the amyloid-β peptide. Of these, AcSDKP is of particular interest because of its role in hematopoiesis and tissue fibrosis, suggesting possible additional applications of ACE inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320313489206">4</xref></sup> N domain-mediated cleavage of AcSDKP has been shown to be relevant in vivo by the observation that plasma levels increase with N domain-selective, but not C domain-selective, ACE inhibitors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320313489206">5</xref></sup> and in studies with N-domain knockout mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320313489206">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Pharmacology of C domain-selective ACE inhibitors vs. transgenic mouse models</title>
<p>The pharmacology of RAAS inhibitors is complex despite decades of use in the clinic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320313489206">7</xref></sup> This is particularly true for ACE inhibitors. Although acute administration leads to a predicted decrease in circulating Ang II and an increase in BK, this is not true for chronic treatment, during which there are compensatory increases in renin and Ang I, and Ang II concentrations often return to pretreatment levels. Despite this, the cardiovascular benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy are generally maintained. Clinical efficacy has been attributed to organ-specific RAAS inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320313489206">8</xref></sup> Also important is the notion that RAAS peptide levels are appropriate for hemodynamic loading in settings such as hypertension and heart failure. Thus, at abnormal arterial, atrial or intra-renal pressures, ACE inhibition will lead to decreases in Ang II, but Ang II levels will tend toward pretreatment levels as pressures are normalized and feedback loops are activated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320313489206">9</xref></sup> Thus, analysis of the pharmacology of RAAS inhibition needs to shift from looking only at absolute levels of Ang II and BK to looking at ratios of important peptide metabolites (such as Ang II/Ang I or BK(1–9)/(1–7)).</p>
<p>Significant insights about the biological role of the two ACE domains have been achieved with genetic studies in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320313489206">1</xref></sup> Early studies with ACE null mice confirmed the central role of the enzyme in blood pressure regulation and renal development, as well as nontraditional roles in hematopoiesis and immunity. Subsequently, more targeted studies involved restricted or ectopic tissue expression of ACE or selective inactivation of the N- or C-domain active site. These studies confirmed that tissue expression of ACE is required for its cardiovascular effects and that conversion of Ang I to Ang II is driven primarily by the C-domain active site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320313489206">1</xref></sup> However, some of these effects are subtle and reveal RAAS compensation; for example, while selective C- or N-domain active site disruption produces mice with normal blood pressure, the C-KO mice are only able to maintain normal pressures under basal conditions because of substantial up-regulation of renin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320313489206">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results of mouse transgenic and knockout studies reveal both the power and limitations of this approach. Since these genetic changes are introduced into the germ line, compensatory changes may occur during embryonic and fetal development that are not necessarily seen during pharmacologic inhibition; similarly, subtle allosteric or interdomain cooperativity effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320313489206">11</xref></sup> may be lost when the ACE amino acid sequence is altered. Therefore, independent evaluation of the effects of domain-specific targeting with pharmacological tools is extremely informative in assessing the physiological relevance of mouse genetic studies and the likely translatability into human therapeutics. To this end, the discovery of the RXP series of phosphinic tetrapeptides has been invaluable, most notably RXP407 and RXPA380, which are highly selective N- and C-domain inhibitors, respectively.</p>
<p>Administration of RXP407 in the mouse revealed that the N domain, as expected, is required for the hydrolysis of AcSDKP, and, strikingly, that the N domain plays no role in the acute hypertensive effect of an intravenous bolus of Ang I, suggesting that this is mediated mainly by the C domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320313489206">12</xref></sup> This notion was supported by a later study showing that RXPA380 blocks the conversion of a bolus of Ang I to Ang II in the mouse,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320313489206">13</xref></sup> although in this model RXP407 had a similar effect. In a study of isolated porcine and human arteries, vasoconstriction responses to Ang I were inhibited by RXPA380 but not by RXP407, while relaxation responses to BK were inhibited equally by both inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320313489206">14</xref></sup> Similarly, we have found that the novel C-selective lisinopril analog Lis-W lowers blood pressure comparably to lisinopril in a renin-driven model of hypertension in the mouse (Touyz R, Burger D, and Sturrock E, unpublished results).</p>
<p>Taken together, a substantial body of work in mouse genetic and pharmacological studies indicates that the N- and C-domain sites are differentially active in vivo, with AcSDKP exclusively hydrolyzed by the N domain, Ang I mainly by the C domain, and BK by both.</p>

<title>Domain-selective versus current ACE inhibitors</title>
<p>Current ACE inhibitors are effective in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction and diabetic nephropathy. However, the efficacy is not as good as we would like and side effects can be troublesome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320313489206">7</xref></sup> This has led to the use of combinations of two or more RAAS inhibitors, but additional efficacy has generally been modest and at the cost of increased side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320313489206">9</xref></sup> Clearly, new approaches are needed. One possibility is to explore the use of domain-selective ACE inhibitors. A C domain-selective inhibitor will likely inhibit ACE-dependent Ang II formation while allowing continued BK metabolism by the N domain. This should lead to an improved side effect profile (ACE inhibitor-related cough and angioedema are thought to be BK driven) but may reduce efficacy if the effects of current ACE inhibitors are due in part to BK accumulation, a point that remains controversial.</p>
<p>Aside from predicted effects on the balance of Ang II and BK levels, a C-selective inhibitor may have additional effects that are not readily apparent and yet could be clinically useful. In a rat model of post-MI heart failure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320313489206">15</xref></sup> administration of the C-selective inhibitor Lis-W led to a significant reduction in the Ang II/Ang I ratio but also to substantially higher plasma Ang I levels than treatment with lisinopril (Sharp S, Davies N and Sturrock E, unpublished results). Since Ang I levels following ACE inhibition reflect renin activation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320313489206">8</xref></sup> treatment with a C-selective inhibitor may produce RAAS feedback responses distinct from current ACE inhibitors, which may prove to be pharmacologically useful.</p>
<p>The crystal structures of the C and N domains, together with those of the C domain in complex with various C-selective compounds, have clarified the molecular basis for domain selectivity. The ketomethylene, phosphinate and carboxylate C domain inhibitors all rely on hydrophobic interactions with the S<sub>2</sub>′ pocket of the C-domain active site for their domain selectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320313489206">16</xref></sup> Thorough pharmacological studies are still required to confirm the efficacy of C-selective inhibition in the treatment of hypertension and whether the bradykinin and substance P-dependent side effect profile will be improved.</p>

<title>Dual-enzyme inhibition</title>
<p>A number of “vasopeptidase inhibitors” (compounds that inhibit both ACE and neprilysin (NEP)) have been developed with varying success in terms of efficacy and side effect profiles. Their kinin-mediated adverse effects have hampered their progress in the clinic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320313489206">17</xref></sup> Thus, the C-selective ACE inhibitor/endothelin-converting enzyme dual inhibitor 8F2 is an attractive alternative combination drug that does not affect NEP activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320313489206">18</xref></sup> Insights from the crystal structures of the two targets enabled the design of the phosphinic acid peptide inhibitor with a bulky isoxazoline P<sub>1</sub>′ moiety that was accommodated by the S<sub>2</sub>′ pocket of ACE and endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), but not by NEP. 8F2 caused a significant decrease in blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.</p>

<sec id="section6-1470320313489206">
<title>Dual-enzyme/receptor antagonists</title>
<p>The combination of an enzyme inhibitor and receptor antagonist is widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The most recent addition to the plenitude of drugs that target the RAAS is LCZ696, a single molecule composed of a neprilysin inhibitor (AHU377) and an angiotensin receptor blocker (valsartan). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320313489206">19</xref></sup> Compared to monotherapy with valsartan, treatment with LCZ696 was associated with lower blood pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320313489206">20</xref></sup> and decreased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), the primary endpoint, in patients with heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320313489206">21</xref></sup> At present there are no C-selective/receptor antagonist drugs. However, aldosterone receptor antagonists (ARA) are often used in combination with ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320313489206">22</xref></sup> and thus it is conceivable that a C-selective ACE inhibitor/ARA dual-action drug could be effective and benefit patients who are susceptible to the adverse effects of conventional ACE inhibitors. Another possibility is a C-selective ACE inhibitor/endothelin receptor antagonist, but considering the side effects that have plagued drugs like bosentan (ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub> antagonist) and darusentan (ET<sub>A</sub> antagonist), this combination is less likely to gain traction.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Future direction and ongoing challenges</title>
<p>The diversity of the RAAS, connections to other peptide networks, and therapeutic potential continue to surprise us. Just when we thought we knew everything about this system, unexpected findings force us to re-examine our dogma. One feature that remains unexplored therapeutically is the two-domain structure of ACE and the distinct and evolving biological roles of the N and C domains. Recent successes in solving the crystal structures of the isolated domains in combination with selective and non-selective inhibitors have enabled rational design of domain-selective inhibitors. C-selective inhibitors are currently being evaluated in preclinical disease models and, with further optimization, may become ready for advancement into the clinic. Many challenges remain, but C-selective ACE inhibitors may eventually offer additional therapeutic options, both as monotherapy and in combination with other RAAS and non-RAAS inhibitors of vasoactive peptides.</p>
