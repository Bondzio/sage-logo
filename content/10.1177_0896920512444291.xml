<p>Brueggemann’s <italic>Rich, Free, and Miserable</italic> provides a concise and fairly comprehensive examination of the consequences of unregulated markets on the moral life of America. The focus here is not on the poor or working poor and neither is it on the economic and social elite; rather, the focus is on what Brueggemann refers to as the middle classes enjoying a high degree of relative autonomy but who also systematically make poor choices pertaining to individual and collective well-being. I think most hard-bitten Marxists will find <italic>Rich, Free, and Miserable</italic> unsatisfying to a certain degree. Brueggemann is no radical calling for the overthrow of capitalism; his conception of class is alloyed with <italic>petit bourgeois</italic> notions of status, and there are a couple of moments when the author comes off like a pipe-smoking Fred MacMurray praising the virtues of church attendance. However, while this may not appeal to orthodoxy I think the book’s thrust is in line with today’s post-ideological students and is actually much more realistic than the standard fare offered up by ideological puritans who demand everything and risk nothing.</p>
<p>Both the left and the right are wide of the mark when it comes to contemporary social problems. The right preaches the paradox of market freedoms and demonizes poor character, bad choices, and immorality while the left reduces all problems to the existence of capital at the expense of culture and values (norms). I think Brueggemann is sensible in assuming that capitalism is not going away any time soon, that markets and rationalization are here to stay, and that most unhappy folks would take a satisfying, meaningful, and fairly-compensated job over the nebulous uncertainties of a post-capitalist utopia. It is this pragmatism that drives <italic>Rich, Free, and Miserable</italic>. It is divided into eight chapters and, after the introduction, assesses the terrain of the debate, offers a good historical mapping of significant changes in US history, and examines the rise of market hegemony where foundational institutions (church, unions, media, education, and state) have become muzzled, outgunned, corporatized, and overgrown without providing for the common interests of the citizenry. The fifth chapter on economic life analyzes the imbalance of production, distribution, and consumption where a now-standard litany of pathologies are marched out: fear of failure, wage stagnation, growing inequality and polarization, crushing debt, unrestrained spending, faddishness, gluttony, vanity, waste, self-destructiveness, electronically-mediated atomization, the abstraction of relations, incivility, etc. In the chapter on civic life Brueggemann does a nice job in charting the antinomies of the failure of institutions to meet the needs of groups and individuals; all the while we see the simultaneous multiplication of the actual number of such organizations. Before the final chapter on ‘resetting the moral compass’ the focus turns to family structure and dynamics. The message, here, is mixed: while the family as we knew it is gone, the postmodern family can still function despite the permeation of the spirit of organizational rationalization within the fabric of family life. Here, we see what is best in this book: the paradox of autonomy that is taken up most clearly in the chapter on social change.</p>
<p><italic>Rich, Free, and Miserable</italic> projects a model of the balanced society (post-WWII) where an accord existed between capital and labor, where a rich and dense network of countervailing forces functioned to mediate excesses. The America of the New Deal and post-war equilibrium started to dissolve in the 1960s and 70s where all forms of authority were increasingly experienced as an insult to the ascendant ego. But where the self (and self-expression) was elevated to deified status, its logic was manifested in contradictory ways, including hyper-conformity. While this book is insightful, well written, and comprehensive it does fall short in a few places.</p>
<p>The book is almost exclusively descriptive and driven by an historical framework at the expense of penetrating theoretical critique. For a topic as quintessentially Durkheimian as this (deregulation and disequilibrium) the engagement with Durkheim borders on nominal. Of course, for teachers with a theoretical bent the dearth of precision-guided concepts can be compensated for in lectures. Indeed, the book is so committed to the concrete I would be tempted, for this reason, to assign it in some classes (even theory) as a supplemental companion to historically dated but theoretically relevant works such as Durkheim’s <italic>Suicide</italic>. Also, curiously, the opening Death Zone metaphor and ‘Everest psychology’ (what Durkheim would have called ‘will mania’ or ‘hypertrophy of the will’ to describe the ridiculous level of disregard for others and obliviousness toward the reality principle) is not taken up again until the conclusion. Further, what Brueggemann commonly refers to as ‘individualism’ and the problem of unrestrained individualism would have been better grasped as ‘egoism’ (excessive individuation or the insufficient presence of the other within the self) because actual individuality is (a) only developed within a rich network of institutional particularity and is therefore (b) not a problem but a goal. Individualism is not a problem; egoism (i.e., relative deficiency of sociological altruism) is a problem. Here, and in a few places, the use of concepts is imprecise and does not move beyond generic determinations. With these slight reservations, however, <italic>Rich, Free, and Miserable</italic> is a good book and one I recommend as a less-sensationalist companion to Derber’s well-known book on ‘wilding’ and it would work very well in American Society and Social Problems undergraduate courses.</p>
<p>A suitable companion to <italic>Rich, Free, and Miserable</italic> is <italic>The Autonomous Animal</italic> by Claire Rasmussen. As noted above, where Brueggemann’s book draws out, partially, the paradox of autonomy and conformity, Rasmussen explores the deep polar relation between autonomy and heteronomy. The opening chapter presents a solid overview of modern conceptions of autonomy from Rousseau and Kant through Habermas, Castoriadis, and Foucault. Generally, the overall problem is the paradoxical nature of modern liberal freedom where one is autonomous only by virtue of subordinating oneself to impersonal social norms summed up in the Kantian dictum that one is free to choose insofar as one makes the right choice (p. 6). In order to be recognized as an autonomous person one has to provide continuous evidence to others (both empirical and imaginary) of one’s ability to self-rule via subordination to impersonal rule (p. 169). The stakes are high because the foundation of liberal democratic politics presupposes the autonomous and ‘sovereign subject’ capable of rational decision making free of compulsion. One senses the futility of the project when, toward the end of the book, Rasmussen lands on masochism as the sublimated unity of autonomy and heteronomy where submission transforms obedience into pleasure which was the target of elimination by commanding authority (p. 156). If you think that masochistic submission is a poor strategy for subverting authority (p. 155) then <italic>Autonomous Animal</italic> might not be your kind of book. Rasmussen takes readers on a tour through physical education, teen sexuality, the cult of fitness, drug addiction, animal rights, and the body as a battleground where the self wages a continuous struggle against otherness. The main weakness for some readers will be its paradigmatic optic: Rasmussen is a political scientist and I don’t know how postmodernism came out in the wash in political science but, with few exceptions, critical sociologists were, at best, reluctant dabblers in Baudrillard, Derrida, Nietzsche, et al. The structure of the book, where a geometry of myth-like discourses flow through power networks colliding into bodies engaged in negotiations, will wear thin for entrenched modernists. While <italic>Autonomous Animal</italic> does have the feel of being produced amidst the intellectual trends of 20 years ago, it is nonetheless a serious work chock-full of good insights and worth reading.</p>
