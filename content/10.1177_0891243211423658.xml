<p>Sex trafficking has taken contemporary scholars, state officials, policy makers, nongovernmental organizations, and religious organizations by storm. However, by tracing the construction and diffusion of the very first national and international antitrafficking movement from its beginnings in Great Britain to key European countries and their colonial territories, Limoncelli reminds us that sex trafficking is not a recent phenomenon. <italic>The Politics of Trafficking</italic> examines historical archives of the International Abolitionist Federation and the International Bureau, two competing voluntary associations involved in the trafficking movement, as well as the League of Nations to uncover debates that took place more than 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Limoncelli poignantly argues that the expansion of prostitution markets was not the result of spontaneous entrepreneurship but <italic>rather</italic> was produced by concerted state efforts to regulate and control women’s bodies. At the intersection of national, ethnic, and classed divisions, states engaged in nation-building projects to maintain their white superiority by constructing racial hierarchies in relation to their colonized subjects. She provides a critical analysis of the International Abolitionist Federation and the International Bureau. The International Abolitionist Federation sought to mobilize women by creating international alliances on the basis of their common gender identity. They engaged in efforts to abolish prostitution and sex trafficking (regardless of whether the women moved voluntarily or forcefully) and worked against increased state regulation of prostitution. In contrast, the purity reformers who comprised the International Bureau worked closely with state officials and sought to institutionalize the antitrafficking movement in order to maintain state sovereignty, legitimate their authority, and <italic>regulate</italic> rather than abolish prostitution to protect the state from undesirable women. The League of Nations, founded in 1919, was an intergovernmental organization that worked closely with the International Bureau, raising the ire of the abolitionists. However, working closely with International Bureau, the League of Nations focused mainly on controlling the movement of bodies between nations, repatriating foreign women, and maintaining the right to regulate women’s sexual behaviors.</p>
<p>Although Limoncelli briefly discusses the tensions within the International Abolitionist Federation and the International Bureau, I would have liked to see an extended analysis of these tensions. It is clear that the two organizations are inherently gendered. The International Abolitionist Federation’s push to reach women across national borders outside of state regulation aligns with feminist ambitions while the International Bureau’s alignment with the state makes it structurally masculine. However, I would like to see a deeper analysis of the individuals involved in the two associations. I find it troubling that Limoncelli only refers to the women aligned with the abolitionist perspective as feminists. Are the women who disagree with a staunch abolitionist perspective not feminists because they are constrained within a masculinist association? What about the feminists who did not align with either the abolitionists or the regulationists?</p>
<p>Chapters five, six, and seven are the most empirically rigorous as Limoncelli not only examines the Netherlands, France, and Italy where feminists and the state played different roles in the trafficking movement but also critically extends her analysis to each country’s colonial territories. The International Abolitionists Federation in the Netherlands developed an antitrafficking movement led by women that was autonomous from the state. As such, the Netherlands effectively abolished state-regulated prostitution and was able to uniformly apply abolitionist antitrafficking measures in the colonies. France, on the other hand, had a long history of state-regulated prostitution, coupled with differing feminist views, which weakened the abolitionist movement, thereby allowing the French government to enforce an agenda that favored regulation rather than abolition. In their colonies, French officials defended the implementation of brothels to provide services to French troops abroad. Like France, Italy adopted a system of state-regulated prostitution in 1860. However, Italy’s top-down fascist government made it difficult for both the International Abolitionist Federation and the International Bureau to advance their respective agendas. The Italian government did little to combat prostitution in their territories and promoted state-regulated prostitution of European and Ethiopian migrant women. The comparative reach of Limoncelli’s analysis provides the reader with a deeper understanding of the successes of women’s organizations to abolish prostitution and the constraints they faced in countries with heavy state involvement.</p>
<p>This is the first book to provide a rich analysis of the history of trafficking and is therefore a must-read for undergraduate and graduate students in sociology, gender studies, and history. Limoncelli’s multicountry analysis in the metropole and its colonial territories is impressive. As one of the first books to provide us with a historical backdrop to the contemporary debates occurring between scholars of sex work and sex trafficking, the book is extremely timely.</p>
