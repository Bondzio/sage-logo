<p><bold>Dear Editor:</bold></p>
<p>A recent report in <italic>The American Journal of Sports Medicine</italic> by Oh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512452405">5</xref></sup> used combined in vitro and in silico approaches to examine the effects of combined frontal and transverse plane moments on the relative strain of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The authors performed a series of impact tests on aged male cadaveric limbs with the 4 possible combinations of (approximately) 25 N·m of internal or external rotation and (approximately) 50 N·m of varus or valgus torque. The authors then created a generalized knee model, which they claimed to validate against their cadaveric data for the first 80 milliseconds after impact. The reported model validation used data from sagittal plane kinematics, quadriceps force, and relative strain of the anteromedial band of the ACL and demonstrated strong agreement between the model and the empirical data for these 3 variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512452405">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The authors come to several potentially erroneous conclusions that are not supported by either their empirical cadaveric methodology or their computer-based modeling approach. The authors state the following: “Our study suggests that an internal tibial rotation induced by an internal tibial torque plays a primary role in increasing the ACL strain and that a knee valgus moment increases the ACL strain by augmenting internal tibial rotation until a medial joint opening occurs.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512452405">5</xref>(p580)</sup> However, no empirical data are presented regarding the amount of ACL strain induced by “isolated” internal rotation, nor was any actual measurement made to quantify the medial joint space opening that they assume to be caused by “valgus” loading of the joint.</p>
<p>This study used male cadaveric specimens with an average age of 70.4 years, which is ill suited to address an injury mechanism that primarily occurs in highly active adolescent female and male athletes. In their limitations, the authors state that they “do not expect the qualitative results would change had [they] used female specimens.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512452405">5</xref>(p580)</sup> Although there is a paucity of cadaveric data dedicated to comparing sex differences in lower extremity biomechanics, and thus any such claim is entirely speculative, another recently published article by the same group titled “Morphological Characteristics Help Explain the Gender Difference in Peak Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strain During a Simulated Pivot Landing”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512452405">3</xref></sup> highlights dramatic sex differences in response to similar testing. Hence, we have grave concerns regarding the validity and interpretation of these findings, especially with regard to the young female athlete. As these investigators’ own prior work shows,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512452405">2</xref></sup> neuromuscular control of the lower limb is quite different between male and female patients. The risk prediction factors appear to be as well. Hence, it likely follows that the predominating mechanisms of injury differ somewhat between the sexes as well.</p>
<p>From a modeling standpoint, the authors fail to validate their model with regard to the primary independent variables of interest to the study. The authors state that “the 3D dynamic knee model was built and validated by replicating the in vitro experiment.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512452405">5</xref>(p579)</sup> However, while the validation data presented (Appendix 3, model fit to sagittal plane kinematics, quadriceps force, and anteromedial bundle of the ACL [AM-ACL] strain) make a case for their model’s accuracy to these factors, the remainder of the article is exclusively focused on the frontal and transverse planes. The authors state that the “model simulation suggests that the knee valgus moment would have to be 3 times as large as the internal tibial torque required to cause ~8.5% AM-ACL relative strain.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512452405">5</xref></sup>
<sup>(p580)</sup> This reported “relative insensitivity” of the ACL to frontal plane moments fails to consider that the relative abduction moment has typically been reported to be several times greater than the internal rotation moment in live patients during sports movement simulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512452405">6</xref></sup> A critically analyzed modeling study must consider these factors before making inferences regarding actual injury mechanism. Even if a knee abduction moment were required to be multiple times the internal rotation moment to produce a given level of ACL strain, it is not unreasonable or improbable to assume that this occurs in vivo during high risk landing and cutting maneuvers.</p>
<p>As the authors themselves point out, multiplanar loading does not create an additive response with respect to soft tissue strains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512452405">5</xref></sup> Nor from their experimental design can they determine which of these planar loads are most representative of, more determinant of, or more important to the actual in vivo ACL injury mechanism in young athletes. Hence, it seems blatantly incorrect that a uniplanar validation should suffice for a triplanar modeling approach. We recognize that prioritizing model validation criteria can be a difficult and subjective process; however, the applicability of any model is also limited by its level of validation. In this case, the authors’ validation does not permit the frontal, transverse, and multiplanar inferences they present.</p>
<p>The detrimental effects of age on soft (and hard) tissue mechanics are well documented; thus, the use of the youngest available specimens is a critical component of any cadaveric study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512452405">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512452405">4</xref></sup> Until it can be demonstrated from in vitro biomechanics that no qualitative sex differences are present, authors should either include equal proportions of male and female anatomic specimens or limit their interpretation to the population they have chosen to analyze. Computational modeling plays an ever-increasing role in our approach to understanding complex biomechanical phenomena. However, every model’s utility is limited by the context of its validation. Future attempts to model the biomechanical complexity of the knee and its many passive structures require a more thorough validation than the one presented in the aforementioned article and a validation that puts the dependent outcome variable(s) clearly in the context of the independent variables of interest.</p>
<p>Overall, the major flaws in these authors’ conclusions are largely due to the absence of an appropriate experimental design to test the questions posed and the significant overextension and overinterpretation of the study findings. Observable phenomena in a controlled laboratory setting and computationally extrapolated trends require extensive validation before they can be considered as feasible reflections of reality and “suggestive” of a valid and reliably testable biological system. This study lacks in its consideration of higher level in vivo evidence for the role of frontal plane loading in noncontact ACL injury mechanisms. These highlighted methodological shortcomings and the absence of a focused validation to the modeling approach preclude the authors’ ability to draw most of the suggested conclusions that they put forth.</p>
<p>We remain confident that the abundance of prospective, longitudinal data and numerous analyses of injury events put forth in the literature demonstrate a significant, although potentially sex-dependent, role for frontal plane loading in the multiplanar noncontact ACL injury mechanism. We commend the authors’ multifaceted approach to their desired questions but question their interpretation of the data given the aforementioned clear and critical flaws in the study.</p>

<p><bold>Authors’ Response:</bold></p>
<p>We thank Dr Hewett and Mr Wordeman for their interest, and we respond to their points below. The correspondents question our conclusion that “an internal tibial rotation induced by an internal tibial torque plays a primary role in increasing the ACL strain and that a knee valgus moment increases the ACL strain by augmenting internal tibial rotation until a medial knee joint opening occurs.” Specifically, they seek empirical data regarding the amount of strain induced by “isolated internal rotation.” Such data exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512452405">1</xref></sup> but are of limited value because isolated internal rotation loading of the tibia never occurs during a jump landing; this is because transknee muscle forces, which induce knee compression and shear, as well as the external compression force and flexion moment induced by the ground reaction also load the knee during a jump landing. If out-of-sagittal plane moments also act, as considered in our article, these can be added. Next, the correspondents state, incorrectly, that no “actual measurement [was] made to quantify the medial joint space opening caused by ‘valgus’ loading of the joint.” Measurements of medial joint space opening were made from our in silico model, as indicated by the blue shaded zones shown in Figure 4. It is notable that our study demonstrated that a knee valgus moment can increase AM-ACL strain even without medial joint space opening, corroborating and extending the findings of others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512452405">4</xref></sup> We therefore stand by our conclusions.</p>
<p>We disagree that the 70-year-old male cadaveric specimens are “ill suited to address an injury mechanism that primarily occurs in highly active adolescent female and male athletes.” Anterior cruciate ligament injuries can occur at any age, as evidenced by a retrospective review of 4485 ACL reconstructions in women up to 65 to 69 years old and in men up to and over the age of 70 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512452405">2</xref></sup> So, the mechanisms of ACL injury are of interest at any age. Our results are also consistent with previous reports using female cadaveric specimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512452405">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512452405">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512452405">9</xref></sup> The relative effect of the internal tibial torque on the peak AM-ACL relative strain was similar for both male and female specimens. Hence, the correspondents’ “grave concerns regarding the validity and interpretation of these findings” appear unfounded.</p>
<p>The inclusion of both experimental and modeling studies in our article left little room to discuss how we validated the in silico 3D knee model in the 3 orthogonal planes. We ran qualitative in silico model validations using our in vitro experimental data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512452405">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512452405">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512452405">9</xref></sup> To compare the study results, the peak AM-ACL relative strain values in each study were normalized by its baseline AM-ACL relative strain value to show the relative increase due to the addition of the knee valgus moment, internal tibial torque, and combination of both. The normalized peak AM-ACL relative strains were then superimposed on the in silico simulation result plots (ie, Figure 4A and Appendix 4 [Figure A-4a]), which were normalized in the same manner. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512452405">Figure 1</xref>, our 3D in silico knee model shows good predictions of ACL behavior under multiplanar loading conditions.</p>

</fig>
<p>As the correspondents point out, valgus moments are indeed several times larger than internal tibial rotation moments in maneuvers such as side cutting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512452405">7</xref></sup> That is why in our in vitro study, we used a valgus moment that averaged 1.6 times larger than the internal tibial rotation moment. Under that loading condition, we demonstrated an insensitivity of AM-ACL strain to valgus loading but a sensitivity to internal tibial rotation moment. Then, in our 3D in silico model, we increased that valgus moment to 150 N·m or 5 times the internal tibial torque applied in vitro, and we still found an insensitivity of the AM-ACL strain to a valgus moment. What the current study suggests is that a knee valgus moment augments an internal tibial rotation, via the coupling mechanism we demonstrate, and thereby increases AM-ACL strain until the knee valgus moment overcomes the threshold for the medial joint space opening, a threshold that increases with the magnitude of the transknee muscle forces.</p>
<p>Our results underscore the importance of internal tibial rotation in the causation of ACL injury, and they help explain why an algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512452405">5</xref></sup> based primarily on valgus moment was ineffective in predicting ACL injury in a prospective study of 2508 female athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512452405">8</xref></sup> We recognize that our findings need to be replicated by others and that further research is needed to achieve a thorough understanding of noncontact ACL injury mechanisms.</p>
