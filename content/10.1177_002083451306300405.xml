<p>63.4398 ALLEMAND, Frédéric; MARTUCCI, Francesco — <bold>La nouvelle gouvernance économique européenne (The new European economic governance)</bold>. <italic>Cahiers de Droit européen</italic> 48(1), 2012: 17–100.</p>
<p>The end of the euro is no longer a taboo subject, but overtly discussed in circles that are no longer restricted to Euroskeptics. At the legal level, two viewpoints come to the fore: (1) what is instituted by a Treaty may be undone by another one, including on the EMU; (2) the monetary union is irreversible and the transfer of sovereignty thus final. This article analyzes the reach of the Stability Pact, EU economic governance, the limits of default and monetary sovereignty.</p>
<p>63.4399 ANDREWS, David — <bold>Merged into one: keystones of European economic governance, 1962–2012</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Integration</italic> 35(3), 2013: 315–331.</p>
<p>I assess the views of the European Commission on key subjects related to Europe's economic governance. My examination is framed by a close reading of two documents, one issued in 1962 (“the Action Program for the Second Stage”) and the other in 2008 (“EMU@10: successes and challenges after ten years of Economic and Monetary Union”). The resulting comparison reveals a pattern of intellectual flexibility on certain policy issues combined with almost dogmatic commitments on others. For example, the views expressed by the Commission regarding financial liberalization have changed significantly over the past half century; at the same time the Commission has insisted tenaciously on the necessity of moving towards (or later consolidating) a European monetary union.

<p>63.4400 AXT, Heinz-Jürgen — <bold>Griechenland: trotz europäischer Fördergelder nicht wettbewerbsfähig — Die EU muss ihre Kohäsionspolitik überdenken (Greece: not competitive in spite of European subsidies — the EU must rethink its cohesion policy)</bold>. <italic>Südosteuropa Mitteilungen</italic> 53(1), 2013: 6–25.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is overlooked that Greece has benefitted from EU transfers for years, in fact since its accession to the former European Community in 1981. From that date till 2008, Greece received net transfers which totaled 133.5 billion euros. As Greece obviously has not become competitive in the last decades it must be analyzed why these transfers did not show more positive results. The article reveals that corruption and clientelism played an important role in preventing Greece from performing better. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4401 BAUER, Sibylle — <bold>Developments in the Nuclear Suppliers Group</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 376–386.</p>
<p>At the 2011 Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) plenary meeting, in the Netherlands, participating states discussed and revised the NSG guidelines and debated its relationships with India, among other topics. The revised guidelines imposed additional conditions on the transfer of sensitive nuclear fuel cycle materials, equipment and technologies for use in uranium enrichment and reprocessing of spent fuel (ENR) to states that do not already possess them. The NSG also discussed developments in national and international strategic trade controls, where discussions, decisions, and implementation efforts have broadened from the traditional focus on controlling exports to encompass a wider range of activities, including the control of transit, trans-shipment, financing, and brokering. Other issues discussed included adherence to the additional safeguards protocol.</p>
<p>63.4402 BERGER, Axel, <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>China-Europe relations in the mitigation of climate change: a conceptual framework</bold>. <italic>Journal of Current Chinese Affairs</italic> 42(1), 2013: 71–98.</p>
<p>Despite the large-scale investments of both China and the EU in climate-change mitigation and renewable-energy promotion, the prevailing view on China-EU relations is one of conflict rather than cooperation. In order to evaluate the prospects of cooperation between China and the EU in these policy fields, empirical research has to go beyond simplistic narratives. This paper suggests a conceptual apparatus that will help researchers better understand the complexities of the real world. The relevant actors operate at different levels and in the public and private sectors. The paper [shows] that combining the multi-level governance and value-chain approaches helps clarify the multiple relationships between these actors. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4489]</p>
<p>63.4403 BROMLEY, Mark; MCDONALD, Glenn — <bold>Limiting the military capabilities of others: developments in arms export control</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 425–430.</p>
<p>During 2011, efforts to improve controls over the export of items specially designed, developed or modified for military use included those in the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-use Goods and Technologies as well as in the EU. Meanwhile, ongoing efforts to reduce the risks associated with the proliferation of small arms and light weapons (SALW) — including attempts to improve export controls — continued in the OAS, the OSCE and at the UN. However, a common approach to assessing acceptable risk remains elusive, beyond general guidelines agreed in the 1990s.</p>
<p>63.4404 BROOME, André — <bold>The politics of IMF-EU co-operation: institutional change from the Maastricht Treaty to the launch of the euro</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Public Policy</italic> 20(4), 2013: 589–605.</p>
<p>This article addresses how regional changes affect global governance by examining how the IMF responded to the challenges presented by EMU between the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the launch of the euro in 1999. Based on primary research from the IMF archives, the article illustrates how the IMF's efforts to reconfigure its relationship with European institutions evolved gradually through a logic of incremental change, despite initial opposition from member states. The article concludes that bureaucratic actors within international organizations take advantage of informal avenues for promoting a new agenda when this fits with shared conceptions of an organization's mandate. The exercise of informal influence by advocates for change within an international organization can limit the options available to states in formal decision-making processes, even when these options cut across state preferences.

<p>63.4405 BUNEA, Adriana — <bold>Issues, preferences and ties: determinants of interest groups’ preference attainment in the EU environmental policy</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Public Policy</italic> 20(4), 2013: 552–570.</p>
<p>Some interest groups are more successful than others in translating their policy preferences into policy outputs at the EU level. This study investigates why this is the case by testing an explanatory framework emphasizing the impact of the policy environment on interest groups’ preference attainment during the policy formulation stage of EU legislation in the environmental policy. The findings show that preferences having a median positioning on the policy space and demands for no regulation are more likely to be translated into policy outcomes. The type of interest a group represents, as well as its organizational form, are also found to be strong predictors of preference attainment. [R]</p>
<p>63.4406 CHANG, Michele — <bold>Fiscal policy coordination and the future of the [EU] community method</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Integration</italic> 35(3), 2013: 255–269.</p>
<p>The global financial and sovereign debt crises led to the creation of numerous new agreements and institutions to contain the current crisis and prevent future ones. These measures reinforce the historical trend towards the predominance of intergovernmental decision-making in EMU, going so far as to re-intergovernmentalize cooperation that had previously been decided upon by the Community method. Using principal-agent analysis, this contribution looks at fiscal policy cooperation since the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis and considers how the impact of re-intergovernmentalization is manifested largely in the policy process rather than the policy outcome. However, this is still cause for concern given the precarious nature of EMU's legitimacy and the loss of efficiency that delegation typically provides. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4410]</p>
<p>63.4407 CHATZISTAVROU, Filippa — <bold>Les États de l'Union européenne, moteurs d'une forme de gouvernance inédite: le trio de présidences (The European Union states, as</bold> <bold>drivers of an unprecedented form of governance: the trio of presidencies)</bold>. <italic>Revue du Marché commun et de l'Union européenne</italic> 568, May 2013: 275–286. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>This article identifies the role of the rotating Trio group presidency in the post-Lisbon era, taking into account the new responsibilities of the Presidency of the European Council. It provides a theoretical insight into the issues that emerge on the academic level. It suggests another use of the intergovernmental and neo-institutionalist approaches mobilized so far in the analysis of the EU presidency. The issue of Trio Presidency collegiality acquires great importance, especially in relation to political effectiveness and institutional sustainability. A Trio Presidency with a string sense of collegiality can play a complementary role as an intergovernmental integration vector. [R]</p>
<p>63.4408 COOPER, Andrew F. — <bold>Civil society relationships with the G20: an extension of the G8 template or distinctive pattern of engagement?</bold> <italic>Global Society</italic> 27(2), Apr. 2013: 179–200.</p>
<p>I ask whether the relationship between the G20 summit process and civil society is path-dependent on the template built up with respect to the G8. Or, alternatively, does the G20-civil society relationship move towards a distinct autonomous pattern? Through the perspective of the G8 template, it is the differences as much as the basic similarities that stand out with respect to the G20. Civil society recognized the significance of the G20 as a site both of delivery and resistance far quicker than they did with the G8 — although the process of engagement did not take place as quickly as might have been expected given the scale of the impact of the global financial crisis.

<p>63.4409 CRONIN, Bruce — <bold>Reckless endangerment warfare: civilian casualties and the collateral damage exception in international humanitarian law</bold>. <italic>Journal of Peace Research</italic> 50(2), March 2013: 175–187.</p>
<p>This article examines how military organizations that are generally committed to following the laws and customs of war exploit what the author terms “the collateral damage exemption,” by employing legally-sanctioned war-fighting strategies that result in significant numbers of civilian casualties. This exemption shields combatants from legal liability for “incidental” or “inadvertent” civilian losses and the destruction of civilian objects that may occur during lawful actions. The author argues that military strategies which promote the use of overwhelming force under conditions that are likely to adversely affect the civilian population on a significant scale push the boundaries of legal behavior. Under these conditions, collateral damage is not inadvertent, but the calculated results of policy decisions. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4410 DYSON, Kenneth — <bold>Sworn to grim necessity? Imperfections of European economic governance, normative political theory, and supreme emergency</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Integration</italic> 35(3), 2013: 207–222.</p>
<p>This contribution examines the Euro Area crisis and European economic governance reforms through a less technocratic lens. It argues for the need to reframe debate around foundation issues in normative legal and political theory. The defining issue is supreme emergency. The credibility of its capacity to act in supreme emergency is of existential significance for the Euro Area. It involves ultimately contentious requirements for supranational executive discretion, including credible contingent commitments to take exceptional measures. Meeting these requirements exposed a power vacuum within the Euro Area, consequent on domestic political constraints. This vacuum was filled — if reluctantly — by the European Central Bank. However, difficult legitimacy issues remain. They leave open the credibility of the ECB contingent commitment to act in supreme emergency.

<p>63.4411 EGEBERG, Morten, <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>Parliament staff: unpacking the behaviour of officials in the European Parliament</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Public Policy</italic> 20(4), 2013: 495–514.</p>
<p>This study, based on an online survey, shows that political group staff are primarily committed to the concerns of their respective political groups, but also to the arguments of those external actors which have similar party affiliation. Since most group officials are, in addition, affiliated to a particular committee, they also emphasize sectoral interests, including the concerns of affected interest groups. EP secretariat officials, on the other hand, give priority to sectoral and expert concerns. Both groups of staff rank European concerns above national ones, and pay more attention to the arguments of the European Commission than to the arguments of any other institution. This study thus suggests that officials in the EP contribute to the spanning of ideological and sectoral cleavages across EU institutions. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4412 EVANS, Gareth — <bold>Responding to atrocities: the new geopolitics of intervention</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 15–39.</p>
<p>The new normative commitment to civilian protection is alive and well and the world has been witnessing not so much a major setback for a new cooperative approach as the inevitable teething troubles associated with the evolution of any major new international norm. There are some challenges that may affect the future applicability and effectiveness of the related concepts of protection of civilians. The 2011 intervention in Libya and the implementation of Resolution 1973 pose two specific questions. (1) Was the intervention a case of overreach? (2) Given the shifts in the geopolitical environment since the intervention, is there potential for a new consensus? A set of policy approaches that could make the path back to effective consensus significantly easier to tread is thus necessary.</p>

<p>One of the most important but least discussed consequences of the Arab Spring was the new strategic partnership between the Gulf Cooperation Council states (GCC), Indonesia, and Malaysia. Starting in late 2010, Gulf, Indonesian, and Malaysian leaders visited each other's countries, announced massive investments in initiatives to strengthen political and military ties, and coordinated assistance for the Rohingya. GCC nations sought new international partners after the fall of longtime Arab allies, alternatives to Western nations for education and tourism, and to limit Tehran's influence in Southeast Asia. By contrast, Indonesian and Malaysian officials hoped that the GCC would provide funds to balance China's growing economic influence in their region and a valuable new market for Southeast Asian companies, investors, and workers.

<p>63.4414 GEORGIEV, Vihar — <bold>Too much [EU] executive power? Delegated law-making and comitology in perspective</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Public Policy</italic> 20(4), 2013: 535–551.</p>
<p>The post-Lisbon Treaty institutional mechanism of the EU has been significantly altered by the introduction of a formal hierarchy of legal acts. This article outlines some very important, unanswered questions for the future institutional setting of the Union and the distribution of powers. I argue that the European Commission is likely to enjoy substantial discretion in delegated law-making. This loss of control by member states over the adoption of delegated acts is not compensated for by other adequate mechanisms for ensuring accountability. In addition, the Commission has been successfully positioning itself to diminish the influence of comitology committees on the adoption of implementing acts. The possible outcomes of this new institutional shift are analyzed in the context of the new challenges to the Community method. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4415 GOCAJ, Ledina; MEUNIER, Sophie — <bold>Time will tell: the EFSF, the ESM, and the Euro crisis</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Integration</italic> 35(3), 2013: 239–253.</p>
<p>The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), a slim and temporary bailout fund created by the EU in May 2010 to quell a growing sovereign debt crisis in Europe, became the foundation for a permanent, more powerful institution, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), adopted in March 2011. Did the creation of the EFSF constrain policy-makers and narrow the path of options subsequently available to them? This paper assesses whether the euro crisis of 2010–2012 provides an instance of historical institutionalism in action, whereby the institutional creation decided at the critical juncture of the initial reaction to the crisis transformed the path of options available at later attempts to tackle the crisis, sometimes with unintended consequences. Through careful process tracing, we analyze the temporal sequences of reactions to the crisis. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4410]</p>
<p>63.4416 GRIP, Lina — <bold>Limiting conventional arms for humanitarian reasons: the case of cluster munitions</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 417–424.</p>
<p>The 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) is an example of an agreement based on the principle that, even if a given weapon delivers some military advantage, it should still be limited or banned because the humanitarian consequences of use outweigh any military benefit. The parties to the 1981 Certain Conventional Weapons Convention failed to agree on a protocol defining rules for the use of cluster munitions and banning those with particularly harmful effects. The international community is now polarized between a group of states that have committed themselves to a total ban on cluster munitions through a separate convention negotiated among themselves and a group of states that are not bound by any shared rules at all, apart from the laws of wars.</p>
<p>63.4417 HART, John — <bold>Biological weapon arms control and disarmament</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 393–396.</p>
<p>The principal activity in 2011 in biological arms control was the Seventh Review Conference of the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in December and preparation for it, which included considering relevant topics and drafting background text. Lack of consensus continued to affect the parties’ ability to consider possible specific compliance concerns regarding past, current and planned activity by states, or specific consideration of known or suspected bioterrorist activity. The parties also remained divided on the question of whether and how to put in place permanent or legally binding mechanisms to encourage a more substantive exchange of view on such concerns. Two new parties joined the BTWC in 2011: Burundi and Mozambique. A further twelve states had signed but not ratified the convention.</p>
<p>63.4418 HART, John — <bold>Chemical weapon arms control and disarmament</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 397–405.</p>
<p>As of 31 December 2011, 188 states had ratified or acceded to the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC); a further two states had signed but not ratified it; and six states had neither signed nor ratified the convention. No state joined the convention in 2011. The activity of the Organization or the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in 2011 was, with the notable exception of the Director-General's advisory panel report, largely process-oriented. The CSP was marked by political tension between Iran and (mainly) the US. Of the states that had declared chemical weapon stockpiles to the OPCW, only Albania, India, and South Korea had destroyed all their declared chemical weapons and Category 3 chemical weapons, whereas Iraq, Libya, Russia, and the US still had not.</p>
<p>63.4419 HODSON, Dermot — <bold>The little engine that wouldn't: supranational entrepreneurship and the Barroso [European] Commission</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Integration</italic> 35(3), 2013: 301–314.</p>
<p>This paper evaluates and explains the degree of supranational entrepreneurship shown by the European Commission following the global financial crisis. Focusing on the period 2007–2011, it finds that the Commission used its right of initiative and/or mobilized ideas and information to pursue a supranational EU economic policy in few cases. These findings are explained with reference to strategic entrepreneurship, that is the Commission's reluctance to support integrationist initiatives unless they stand a chance of success, and by the fact that partisanship took precedence for the EU executive over the pursuit of integration in some cases. The Commission's actions in this period call for greater attention by scholars to preference-formation by supranational actors as well as a reconsideration of what it means for the EU executive to lead.

<p>This article examines the unintended consequences of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act — a political agreement among the 35 participating states in the CSCE. The article explains the unintended consequences of the CSCE security regime in terms of path-emergence. “Path-emergence” is presented as a conceptual apparatus to explain the emergent properties exhibited within a complex adaptive system. The path-emergence theory highlights four explanatory metaphors: morphogenetic fields, self-organized criticality, social resonance, and co-evolution. These metaphors serve as conceptual linchpins for the case-analysis of the unintended consequences of the CSCE security regime. This article suggests that the CSCE embedded within it the properties of path-emergence, which in turn contributed to the end of the Cold War in Europe. [R]</p>
<p>63.4421 HOWARTH, David; QUAGLIA, Lucia — <bold>Banking on stability: the political economy of new capital requirements in the European Union</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Integration</italic> 35(3), 2013: 333–346.</p>
<p>The Basel III Accord on a “Global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems” was issued in late 2010 as the cornerstone of the international regulatory response to the global financial crisis. Its adoption into EU legislation has, however, been met with considerable member state reticence and intra-EU negotiations are ongoing. This paper investigates the political economy of new capital requirements in the EU, arguing that the institutional features of national banking sectors convincingly account for the divergence in EU member state preferences on capital rules.

<p>63.4422 HUNEEUS, Alexandra — <bold>International criminal law by other means: the quasi-criminal jurisdiction of the human rights courts</bold>. <italic>American Journal of International Law</italic> 107(1), Jan. 2013: 1–44.</p>
<p>Although the regional human rights courts have no criminal jurisdiction and cannot find individual responsibility, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights regularly orders states to investigate and punish gross human rights violations, and monitors the progress of the resulting prosecutions. Today, it is monitoring the progress of fifty-one prosecutions across fifteen states for acts that amount to international crimes. The article explores the evolution of such quasi-criminal jurisdiction in the regional rights courts, and juxtaposes this development to the work of the international criminal tribunals. [R]</p>

<p>The news media [are] a major forum for the discursive legitimization of the EU. This article analyzes media debates in the context of three attempts at reforming EU primary law in the past decade: the Nice Treaty; the Constitutional Treaty; and the Lisbon Treaty. Focusing on four member states — the UK, Ireland, Germany and Austria — our study shows that the EU's legitimacy is discursively constructed according to distinct patterns, most of which are remarkably similar across countries and stable over time. In the context of the EU Constitution, legitimization debates became more intensive and more critical; however, these developments were largely reversed when the Lisbon Treaty was debated. This suggests that, in the media arena, the much-discussed politicization of European integration is an episodic occurrence, rather than a unidirectional trend. [R]</p>

<p>The adoption of sanctions by the EU, either under resolutions of the UN Security Council or the Sanctions Committee or independently, has raised the issue of protection of fundamental rights of individuals affected by these measures.

<p>This study examines when and why MEPs use parliamentary questions as a form of fire alarm oversight. We argue that the multilevel nature of the EU political system allows MEPs from national opposition parties to use parliamentary questions to alert the European Commission to governments’ failures to implement EU policy. Representation in the EP provides the only avenue for such oversight for national opposition parties. Using a new sample of EP parliamentary questions, we demonstrate that MEPs from national opposition parties are more likely to alert the Commission to violations of EU law in their own member states. These parliamentary questions may lead the Commission to take legal action against member-state governments. [R]</p>

<p>In the post-World War II era, regional organizations have proliferated. The accompanying literature focuses on analyzing the drivers and effects of regionalism, but has, to date, largely neglected a series of puzzling macro-phenomena: the marked spatial and temporal clustering of regional organizations, as well as similarities in their institutional design. This contribution argues that the existing approaches analyze regional organizations primarily as independent phenomena, whose genesis and design are seen as being determined either by dynamics internal to the region itself or by external forces such as powerful hegemons and globalizing pressures. Against this background, this research note argues for the broadening of existing analytical perspectives and sketches a diffusion-oriented research agenda that instead conceives of regional organizations as being interdependent.

<p>The article argues that problem-based learning, through the creative use of simulations, can raise student engagement and enhance student performance. Specifically, it discusses two simulations that were used in a recent European Union Politics course, one involving a Council Simulation of the Chocolate Directive and the other a simulation of the EP. The simulations were assessed through a combination of reflective student essays, pre-post tests and other in-class student work. [R]</p>

<p>Whereas a new and influential view holds that German ordoliberal ideas were the driving force behind the emergence of European competition policy, I argue that such ideational explanations are theoretically unconvincing, methodologically biased and substantively wrong. Based on a careful observation of the most relevant actors’ preferences, the terms of their interaction during the Paris negotiations of 1950–1951, and the institutional context of their operations, I conclude that French planners’ preferences, German reactions and US policy must all be examined together to produce a more convincing account of the emergence of the most supranational of all European policies. The finding that European competition policy emerged out of an acrimonious bargaining episode between pro-competition French bureaucrats and anti-competition German politicians challenges ideational theories, liberal-intergovernmentalism and delegation-for-credibility theories alike.

<p>The negotiation between the EU and Mercosur to set up a strategic biregional partnership and a trade agreement has been stagnant since 2004. Even with the interruption of the negotiation. Trade flows between the two regions have nevertheless increased substantially, and the EU has consolidated its position as the main source of foreign direct investment in the Mercosur countries. One of the consequences of the global crisis is the reduced role of multilateral institutions, particularly the WTO. In this relatively new world configuration, the adoption all EU members of the Lisbon Treaty introduces changes in the European institutional design of regional integration. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>On 20 April 2011, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1977, which extended by ten years the mandate of the committee established to monitor and facilitate states’ compliance with Resolution 1540. Resolution 1977 affirmed that the 1540 Committee should prioritize efforts to enhance the capacities of states to implement Resolution 1540, rather than highlight compliance shortcomings. At a meeting in May 2011 in Deauville, France, the G8 countries announced that they had agreed to extend the Global Partnership for an unspecified period beyond its 2012 expiration and would encourage additional countries to participate in its activities. At another meeting in June-July 2011 in Paris, France, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council discussed multilateral arms control.</p>

<p>We address the literature on EU lobbying and the issue of biases in interest representation by examining the fate of the food-labeling regulation. NGOs initially succeeded in framing the issue and dominated the process of drafting the Commission's proposal. However, NGOs lost the fight in the EP, where industry's preferences largely prevailed. Our explanation centers on opportunity structures and highlights three dimensions that interfered with a successful mobilization of votes in the EP: strength of the frame; size of the lobbying coalition; and the identity of the rapporteur. Once the proposal was in the EP, NGOs found it difficult to rally the public and lost control of framing. The food industry was keen to minimize labeling requirements, constituted the dominant lobby, and enjoyed enormous resources and political connections. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The European Convention on Human Rights, the true Magna Carta of the 47 members of the Council of Europe, may be considered the foundation for protecting rights and liberties within the European constitutional law. But this affirmation needs to be qualified. What unites the peoples of Europe is a substantial and not a formal concept of the rule of law, i.e., not legal positivism which exalts the existing legal situation but that which links the legal order to a liberal view including values and rules to which the government and public authorities are subject.</p>
<p>63.4433 MANNERS, Ian — <bold>European communion: political theory of European union</bold>. <italic>Journal of European Public Policy</italic> 20(4), 2013: 473–494.</p>
<p>I argue that understanding the projects, processes and products of European union, based on “sharing” or “communion,” provides a better means of perceiving the EU as a political object rather than terms such as “integration” or “co-operation”. “European communion” is defined as the “subjective sharing of relationships,” understood as the extent to which individuals or groups believe themselves to be sharing relations (or not), and the consequences of these beliefs for European political projects, processes and products. By exploring European communion through an engagement with contemporary political theory, using very brief illustrations from the Treaty of Lisbon, the article also suggests that European communion embraces three different readings of the EU as a political object: the EU as a constellation of communities; as a cosmopolitan space; and as an example of cosmopolitical co-existence.

<p>This article examines the role and use of discourse as a means of affecting EU cohesion policy reform. A discursive shift is traced to a place-based narrative, which sought to re-legitimize and reconnect the policy with its foundational principles during the post-2013 policy review. It is argued that the impact of the narrative on the Commission's proposals has been only partially effective owing to deep-rooted ideational, interest-driven and organizational resistance and tensions relating to the policy's objectives, governance and relationship with Europe 2020. Implications are drawn for ideational analysis in the EU. [R]</p>

<p>There is a widespread belief that a credible threat of governmental intervention was necessary to prompt industry to intensify its self-regulatory efforts. However, using the example of self-regulation in the European intermodal transport industry, this article suggests that this belief needs to be refined. The European Commission's threat to tighten the regulatory framework directly led to the failure of self-regulation and, somewhat paradoxically, also triggered a political process at the end of which the existing regulatory framework was relaxed. Based on the theory of policy-image and venue-shifts, the article provides an explanation of the counterproductive und unintended effect of the shadow of hierarchy. [R]</p>

<p>The two institutions forming the bicameral EU legislature, Council and EP, are composed of representatives who belong to national political parties. In traditional European bicameral systems, parties are the main factor linking the different chambers. Do national parties similarly provide a linkage mechanism between chambers in the EU, by coordinating voting behavior of ministers and MEPs? For example, do MEPs unite with “their” minister against a proposal if sincere national or party-political interests are touched? Based on a dataset combining Council votes with EP roll-calls, the analysis reveals that voting behavior might differ considerably between institutions. While ministers are subject to the logic of Council consensus, MEPs are influenced by their transnational EP groups. Internal party co-ordination across institutions is thus rare. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The article discusses four principled concerns about democracy-saving EU interventions in Member States: that an institution which is itself largely undemocratic cannot credibly protect democracy; that there are in fact no common European standards which could be used to determine whether a Member State is departing from a shared European understanding of democracy; that interventions are per se illiberal; and, finally, that only small States will be subject to intervention, a form of EU hypocrisy which delegitimizes Brussels both in the States concerned and possibly across the EU as a whole. The article counters all these concerns and argues that the problem with intervention is not to be found at a theoretical level, but on a practical plane: the EU lacks a tool kit to intervene effectively in Member States.

<p>In the last 15 years, the link between identity and regional institutions has received considerable academic attention, especially from EU scholars. By contrast, IR has been strikingly silent on the question of the identity of regional institutions. However, studying an institution's identity can highlight important aspects of its “quality of life;” not least its ability to interact with other international actors and with its own constituent parts. This article argues that a clear identity is necessary for the organization to project itself internally, internationally, and temporally. The question of institutional identity — and the risks of failing to construct one — is explored by looking at the case of Mercosur, an association which suffers from identity crises in its three main identity dimensions: political, economic and external.

<p>The article develops a two-dimensional typology of political reasons for governments to pledge referendums on European integration when they are not obliged to do so: the first dimension is about the political level at which the strategic use of referendum pledges is targeted and it distinguishes between domestic and European reasons; the second dimension attends to the strategic mode of governments when pledging EU referendums which can either be about avoiding political losses (the defensive mode) or about realizing political gains (the offensive mode). In combination, the typology yields four ideal types of reasons for governments to commit to EU referendums: the depoliticizing; plebiscitary; red-line; and internationalist EU referendum pledges. In the empirical analysis, the article applies this typology to classify 28 cases of discretionary government commitments to EU referendums. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>While WTO members apply tariffs on imports at roughly comparable levels, the maximum levels allowed on these tariffs vary dramatically, leaving some members with far more flexibility to raise trade barriers overnight. Countries [differ on the impact of] such “binding overhang”. This paper empirically assesses the effect of binding overhang on trade flows. I argue that the mere existence of binding overhang has a strongly negative effect on trade, through the way in which it muddles expectations. Using data at the 4-digit harmonized system product level, covering the WTO membership from 1995 to 2008, I demonstrate that the cost in terms of lost trade resulting from the ability to legally raise a tariff by one point is tantamount to nearly half the cost of having done so.

<p>Trade politics in the EU vary a great deal across different dimensions. This article develops analytical categories to organize this empirically observable variety of trade politics and identifies the conditions under which different patterns of domestic trade politics are likely to emerge. I first suggest that trade politics in the EU can be organized conceptually along two dimensions of variation: configurations of state-society relations, and the logic driving actors’ behavior. The interaction of these two dimensions leads me to distinguish four types of EU trade politics: pressure politics, executive politics, civil politics and deliberative politics. I [then] develop hypotheses in order to account for variation across these types of trade politics. Empirically, I show why EU trade politics in the WTO Doha Round varied. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The ICJ, as the principal judicial organ of the UN, plays an important role in peaceful resolution of international disputes. Traditionally, relations between Islamic law states, international law, and courts have been relatively tense due to the inherent link between Islamic law and the Islamic faith. Yet, several Islamic-law states recognize the ICJ's compulsory and compromissory jurisdiction. Why do some Islamic law states extend support to the ICJ, while others turn away from the Court? I argue and empirically demonstrate that specific characteristic of Islamic law can explain variation of Islamic-law states’ preferences towards the ICJ. After providing original data on the characteristics of Islamic legal structures, I systematically compare pertinent rules of international law and Islamic law, focusing on similarities and differences between the two.

<p>The paper critically examines post-Cold War relevance of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), drawing a premise on the significance of Tehran Summit, held in August 2012, in revitalizing the Movement in the changing context of 21st c. The Summit adjudged the continuing importance of NAM as an alternative platform for international cooperation and reinvigorated a commitment to promote a multi-centric world and to establish just global governance by rebuilding international order. On the other hand, the Summit failed to uphold the collective concerns of the developing countries and was more of a reflection of the political realities of the Middle East, predominantly Iran-West confrontation over Iran's nuclear program and Iranian backings for Syrian regime.

<p>This article examines the EU's external economic governance in the G20 during the Great Recession using a principal-agent framework. It argues that although the terms of delegation in the G20 are incomplete and open to the agents’ interpretation, two important sources of agency-control limit the discretion of the EU delegation. The system of multiple agents with its inherent inter-institutional rivalry and the presence of the G20/EU members ultimately increase the control of the collective principal at the cost of presenting a unified EU position. At the same time, the current design of the EU's external economic governance has fueled tensions between the EU and underrepresented developing countries. I argue that the large and powerful EU/G20 member states are likely to oppose the increased delegation that would enable the establishment of an external economic governance.

<p>While members of the EP are elected in national constituencies, their votes are determined by the aggregation of MEPs in multinational party groups. The uncoordinated aggregation of national party programs in multinational EP party groups challenges theories of representation based on national parties and parliaments. This article provides a theoretical means of understanding representation by linking the aggregation of dozens of national party programs in different EP party groups to the aggregation of groups to produce the parliamentary majority needed to enact policies. Drawing on an original data source of national party programs, the EU Profiler, the article shows that the EP majorities created by aggregating MEP votes in party groups are best explained by cartel theories.

<p>The renewed interest in conventional arms control in Europe that was in evidence in 2010 could not be translated into substantial progress in 2011. On the contrary, after the 2010 Astana Summit of the OSCE failed to adopt a comprehensive Framework for Action because of disagreement over subregional conflicts, particularly in Georgia, the same issue contributed to the suspension of negotiations on conventional arms control in May 2011. By the end of 2011, NATO member states had decided to stop sharing information related to the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe with Russia. Decisions in 2011 signaled that the main actors no longer believe that the implications of modern military-technical developments can be discussed regionally.</p>

<p>This paper analyzes multilateral aid allocation in the EU. We argue that EU members can influence the aid-allocation process toward their national interests if they form powerful coalitions that bias the European Commission's development policies. When EU members’ preferences over aid-allocation are heterogeneous, the Commission can implement multilateral aid according to its programmatic goals. Greater homogeneity of EU members’ goals, however, increases the likelihood that members can form powerful interest coalitions and induce the Commission to allocate aid according to their own national interests. The empirical analysis provides robust support for our theoretical argument, and the findings generally indicate that interest coalitions play an important role in multilateral aid-allocation.

<p>This article explores the extent to which the EU has responded effectively to the rising powers of Asia, Latin America and Africa, and whether the Union has been able to construct an effective diplomacy for dealing with them. The EU's diplomatic apparatus since the Lisbon Treaty is largely directed towards establishing a negotiated order at the regional and global levels. The article identifies a number of tensions and contradictions that arise from the EU's status and role in the global arena and that feed into its quest for negotiated order. It assesses the challenges to EU positions and strategies that arise not only from the emergence of new powers in the world arena, but also from the changes in global structures and processes that accompany this development.

<p>The use of force is prohibited under the UN Charter, [although] Article 51 allows a state to conduct an act of self-defense. This study explains why only some states invoke it. The author claims that the baseline probability of claiming the right remains low because explicit reference to Article 51 accompanies the uncertainty of justification success and poses legal and diplomatic costs. However, balanced escalation and no alliance relationship negate those costs and increase the likelihood of self-defense justification. Moreover, under the strict conditionality, minor powers receiving American military aid frequently and promptly claim self-defense. [R]</p>

<p>The sovereign debt crisis made it clear that, to be sustainable and serve its initial purpose (notably price stability), EMU would require enhanced policy coordination, increased sovereignty- and risk-sharing and further centralization at the EU level of various competencies. In the crisis context, the ECB has emerged as an anchor of stability and confidence within a highly fragmented political system. It started to focus on the sustainability of EMU as its foremost objective, engaging in more active (and non-standard) policies and wider economic policy debates than otherwise required from a traditional central bank. This article examines the ECB's rationale to act strategically and its quest to legitimize its strategic political role through a renewed monetary dialogue with the EP.

<p>This article asks: (1) Was the EU's accession conditionality conducive to better governance in Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) or was it designed to pick up already committed reformers? (2) During which period was the EU more influential on governance quality in CEECs: accession or membership? To address these questions, we propose a simple model of moral hazard and adverse selection, and draw on survey-based governance quality data to test its predictions. We report that the EU has offered candidate status to countries that already had better governance quality relative to their peers before 1997. Nonetheless, EU conditionality also had some positive effects on CEEC governance during the accession period, but this effect tended to disappear during the membership period. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The EP has often been accused of its inability to link to European citizens. This article employs quantitative measures to investigate levels of congruence between individual MEPs and their voters on core policy issues following the 2009 EP elections. Operationalizing congruence as a “many-to-one” relationship, it suggests that on socio-economic issues, the correspondence of policy preferences tends to be higher between voters and MEPs belonging to right-wing and liberal parties than for leftist MEPs. On socio-cultural issues, MEPs generally tend to have more liberal views than their representatives. Tobit models show that, depending on the issue, the strength of voter-MEP opinion congruence can be linked to the frequency of contacts and MEP seniority in office. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Towards the end of the last decade, the EU passed a regulation banning seal products from the European common market. The final legislation deviated from the European Commission's more flexible proposal on key issues, and was therefore not an obvious outcome. Why did the Commission choose to support a conditional ban on seal products in the original proposal, and then why did the EP later reverse the proposal in the second round. To explain the two different outcomes, I identify four ideal-types of arguments adhering to one of four logics — appropriateness, justification, arguing, or consequentiality — [and] illustrate how arguments made following the logic of arguing were the most effective in the Commission, while arguments pertaining to a logic of appropriateness were most important in the Parliament.

This article critically analyzes whether the newly elected government in its first year managed to break with old patterns of Croatian foreign policy and implement a “new,” consistent “European” foreign and good-neighborhood policy. It argues that the “Kukuriku” government showed a new foreign policy style of patience, conviction and pragmatism, thus managing to keep on the European course and the neighborly relation vivid — despite serious external irritations and internal skepticism towards neighbors and the EU.

As the end of NATO's Afghanistan mission approaches, the alliance is once again confronted with the question, “What next?” Increasingly miniscule European defense budgets and the 2011 military operation against Libya illustrate that NATO is now almost entirely underwritten by US power. Meanwhile, the US is focused on the security of the Asia-Pacific region and its untenable budget imbalance, meaning that choices must be made. NATO may continue to endure, but is NATO still relevant?

<p>Focusing on the ability of financial markets to discipline state economic performance, EU fiscal federalism specifies three conditions that need to be met for it to work effectively: clear market signals, no bailout, and corrective action driven by central rules and implemented by domestic populations. While some conditions have obviously not been met in the European response to the Greek sovereign debt crisis (2009–2012), evidence suggests the explanatory power of fiscal federalism is surprisingly robust. The study raises concerns with risk-sharing in EU economic governance and has implications for theories of EU institution-building. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4410]</p>

<p>Africa's and South America's rich endowments of resources and great need for infrastructure development make them perfect candidates for China's “infrastructure-for-resources” loans. Over the past decade, such an arrangement for pursuing China's resource-security goals overseas — securing long-term supply contracts and accessing exploration rights — has proved more effective in Africa than in South America. This article discusses the reasons for this regional variation by providing a comparative study of China's economic statecraft in Angola and Brazil, focusing on the deployment of infrastructure-for-oil deals.

<p>The latest progress report of the European Commission rightly addresses the major flaws in Turkey's reform process. Domestically, Prime Minister R. Erdogan is following a new <italic>Realpolitik</italic> that endangers the ongoing process of creating a new constitution. The EU with an incoherent and ineffective policy towards Turkey has heavily contributed to the stagnation. More specifically, France and Cyprus have shown a destructive and hostile attitude towards Turkey's EU aspirations. The author calls for a clear and coherent policy, mainly of Germany, towards Turkey, an honest language, giving Turkey a timetable or deadline for accession, and, most importantly, clear steps for visa liberalization. Failure to achieve a solution will further frustrate the affluent Turkish middle class who will turn their backs on the EU. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4510]</p>

<p>After a decade of Aid for Trade (AfT) allocations, we can assess whether this new development strategy has been effective. Focusing on the short-term goal of export growth, we examine whether AfT from the US government promoted exports within recipient national economies over the period 1999–2008. Our results suggest that a $1 dollar increase in total US AfT has been associated with about a $69 increase in recipient exports 2 years later. We also show that the export effect of US AfT has not been confined to the US market and is driven primarily by exports to the rest of the world. In addition, we show that US AfT has been effective in reaching more needy countries, as the substantive effect of US aid for trade has been larger in lesser-developed, landlocked, and more distant recipient countries.

<p>The tectonic shifts in the Middle East and North Africa triggered by the “Arab Awakening” have presented both opportunities but also challenges for Ankara. In the civil war tearing apart Syria, Turkish foreign policy has encountered the most formidable obstacle in projecting its soft power across the neighborhood. On the contrary, violence has threatened on occasion to spill over into Turkey itself and has furthermore exacerbated existing political tensions. Turmoil in the Middle East has pushed Turkey closer to its long-standing allies in the West, particularly NATO and the US. But the constraints facing Ankara's neighborhood strategy, coupled with the short and long term challenges with respect to economic development and especially democratic consolidation, are also a welcome reminder of the crucial role played by the EU in shaping Turkish politics and society.

<p>Competition and conflict in the South China Sea involves many nations due to its resources and vital sea lanes. China increasingly serves as a common denominator of intensifying anxiety for its South China Sea maritime neighbors due to the aggressive scope of its claims to the sea and its islands. Among those states, Vietnam is most affected, as it is first in the path of Chinese ambitions — ambitions which authorities fear would give China significant tactical military and economic advantage. For China, there are similar fears over threats to the sea lanes and seabed resources. This article discusses the motivations and strategies of both states as well as the consequences of such and applies realism, its tenets of defensive and offensive realism, and neoliberalism to examine their security concerns and perceptions.

<p>Although there is dissatisfaction in China with the nature of the current global order, it is hard to find a clear Chinese vision of an alternative world. This is partly a result of conflicting understandings within the country of the benefits and drawbacks of taking a more pro-active global role and perhaps undertaking more leadership functions. But it is also a consequence of how elites frame Chinese interests and demands in different ways for different audiences. Furthermore, the existing order has in fact served China quite well in its transition towards becoming a global power. So while at times China appears to be the main driver for reform and change, at other times (or to other people) the emphasis is on China as a responsible stakeholder in the existing system.

<p>The countries included in the official data on the financial value of states’ arms exports in the years 2001–2010 are those that provide official data on the financial value of “arms exports,” “licenses for arms exports” or “arms export agreements” for at least six of the ten years and for which the average of the values given exceeds $10 million. National practices in this area vary, but “arms export” generally refers to the financial value of licenses for arms exports issued by the national export licensing authority, and “arms export agreements” refers to the financial value of agreements signed for arms exports.</p>

<p>While the UN imposed an arms embargo on Libya and the EU and the Arab League imposed arms embargoes on Syria, no other multilateral restraints were imposed on arms transfers to states affected by the Arab Spring. An overview of the immediate reactions of major suppliers to the Arab Spring allows for an analysis of the debates on whether their governments had struck the right balance between security, commercial and human rights concerns when deciding whether to permit or deny arms exports. Despite widespread criticism by civil society and parliamentarians within many Western states and discussions between states, the impact of the Arab Spring on states’ arms export policies appears to have been limited.</p>

<p>Brazilian foreign policy is framed around the idea of a value-creating actor, while in reality there are significant value-claiming characteristics at the core of its approach to regional and global affairs. The key for Brazil is its position as a “bridge” between the South and the North, [both] as a critical coalition-organizer and ideational leader for southern actors, and a central interlocutor for northern actors trying to cope with pressure from the South. Brazil focuses more on an improved relative position, rather than a complete reformulation of the international system. The article focuses on Brazilian engagement with Africa and South America, as well as the country's approach to the Doha Round, the Free Trade Area of the Americas and regional governance mechanisms.

<p>Why does the US as a third party intervene abroad in responding to humanitarian crises? While liberals argue that the purpose of an intervention is to protect victims of human rights violations, realists contend that interventions have little relation to humanitarian concerns and aim, instead, at certain national interests such as securing an oil supply. Making scientific progress, in explaining the determinants of US humanitarian intervention, requires confronting these theoretical positions with data. Drawing on a cross-national, time-series data analysis of 153 countries for the years 1981–2005, the quantitative research presented is the first of its kind to evaluate the relative importance of these competing theoretical perspectives. This study finds evidence that the US is likely to use force in a manner consistent with the theory put forth by liberals. [R, abr.]</p>

The article argues that this transition deserves a large part of the blame for the difficulty which the risk-averse State Department displayed in embracing first the web and then the full range of qualities associated with Web 2.0.

<p>This article studies the ideational underpinnings of the UK Coalition government's “liberal conservative” foreign policy. It suggests that an Iraq-centric account of T.

[It then] contends that the G. Brown years 2007–2010 and, since the end of New Labour, Coalition foreign policy, can be seen as a response both to the substance and style of Blair's highly personalized stewardship of foreign policy post-9/11 [2001]. The war on terror and the invasion of Iraq were accompanied by a seemingly open-ended democracy-promotion around the globe, which was quite out of character with past British practice. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article is a study of Canada's foreign policy towards Africa from the earliest beginnings after the Second World War until 2012. The argument is that Canada has tried to ensure it is well regarded by Africa as a player, partner and friend. This would permit Canada to (1) build constituencies of support with Africans when interests converge on issues of common concern; and (2) ensure Canada is not alienated from Africa, and African states are not alienated from the West. Since 2006, however, Prime Minister S. Harper has over-emphasized the trade (player) aspect of the Africa policy, with potentially serious consequences for Canada's reputation and position in Africa against competitors like China.

The changes throughout history in the Federation of Malaysia's policies regarding Muslim minorities in Asian countries illustrate the variable external use of Islamic themes by Malaysian officials. In order for Malaysian governments to reconcile opposing positions whose configurations emphasize the ambiguities inherent to their actions, throughout history these governments have been obliged to continually re-evaluate their positions according to the relevant contingencies. However, Malaysia's diplomatic positions toward the Muslim world have been guided by an underlying search for the legitimization and international recognition of the country's broad domestic socio-political model.

<p>A total of 52 peace operations were conducted in 2011, the same number as in 2010 and the second lowest in the period 2002–2011, confirming a downward trend that started in 2009. However, the number of personnel deployed on peace operations was the second highest of the period, at 262 129, just 700 fewer than in 2010. The slight increases in the personnel numbers of some operations were due in part to temporary reinforcements to allow them to assist their host countries to hold elections. These increases were balanced by decreases due to personnel withdrawals related to the actual or upcoming closure of UN missions in Nepal and Timor-Leste. The UN, which was responsible for 38 percent of the operations, remained the main conducting organization.</p>

<p>South Sudan's proclamation of independence on 9 July 2011 led to a significant reconfiguration of the UN presence in the former territory of Sudan. Sudan's opposition led to the closure of UNMIS (UN Mission in the Sudan), which represented the nominal withdrawal of over 10 000 military and police personnel and 965 international civilian personnel. In practice, the majority of the personnel were redeployed to the new UN mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS) and to the new border-monitoring mission, the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA). Other significant peace missions in 2011 included NATO's Operation Unified Protector and the UN Support Mission in Libya as well as the Arab League Observer Mission to Syria.</p>
<p>63.4482 FANCHINI, Claire — <bold>Regional developments in peace operations</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 106–111.</p>
<p>New operations in Libya, South Sudan, and Syria and expanded operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Haiti and Somalia were balanced by the closure or drawdown of missions elsewhere. The rise in personnel numbers in Africa was linked to the expansion of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the temporary reinforcement of the UN Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI). The UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) operated at a reinforced authorized strength of 12 500 personnel. Eight peace operations were active in Asia and Oceania in 2011. There were 15 operations in Europe. The Arab League's deployment of an observer mission to Syria, albeit briefly, wars perhaps one of the most significant developments for peace-keeping in 2011.</p>

While most of these were led by North Atlantic institutions — including the EU, NATO and the OSCE — regional organizations outside the transatlantic space have also become more politically and even militarily involved.

<p>South Asia has long been under direct and indirect interventions and policy influence by major powers. The colonial legacy that South Asian states carried is embedded in their political structures and socioeconomic fabric. Coupled with structural problems and inter- and intrastate conflicts, the undermining impact of the confounding shifts and turns in international politics, particularly since the Cold War era, culminated in challenges to peace and security in the region. Consequently, security architecture of the region remains vulnerable to violence and stability, security and development appear to be unlikely scenarios. The assessment of the role of extra-regional actors and its deteriorating impact on the security and politics in South Asian politics form the basic premise of this paper. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Syria played a key role in the “strategic depth” foreign policy pursued by the Turkish AKP government and was considered a model example of “zero-problem policy” with the neighboring states. The civil war in Syria, however, affected strategic calculations and the Turkish claim to become regional and global leader. Moreover, the Syrian civil war has both economic as well as domestic implications concerning Turkey's unsolved Kurdish conflict and the PKK question, thus increasing the already existing domestic polarization. Finally the civil war influences the power structure in the region and the relations to the neighboring states, above all Iran, Russia and Iraq. The AKP government so far responded flexibly to the challenges of adjustment with a policy mix of pragmatism and commitment. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper assesses the “competitive pressure” that China's growing presence in Africa exerts on the European development policy regime. Drawing on interviews conducted in China, Ethiopia and Europe between 2008 and 2011, the paper analyzes Ethiopia as a case study. Ethiopia is one of the most important countries in Chinese as well as European cooperation with Africa. Yet, Chinese and European policies toward Ethiopia differ greatly. The EU mainly engages Ethiopia as an aid-recipient, whereas China has developed a comprehensive political and economic partnership with the East African state. China has thereby become an alternative partner to the Ethiopian government, a development that both sheds light on the gap between European rhetoric and policy practice and puts pressure on the EU to make more efforts to reform its development policy system.

<p>Armenia and Azerbaijan have both identified the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict as a key national security priority. While both sides stress a commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict, each accuses the other of violating the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and of pushing them into an arms race. During 2010–11 Armenia made declarations that indicate that it is seeking to procure greater quantities of weapons in response to Azerbaijan's arms procurement. In 2011, several observers noted particular pressures in the two countries that could push them into war in the near future. It is therefore necessary to examine Armenia's and Azerbaijan's arms-acquisitions in the period 2007–11 in order to understand the stated policies underlying those acquisitions.</p>

India established its position as the largest recipient of arms, while China continued to fall down the ranking in the list of recipients. The five largest suppliers in 2007–2011 — the US, Russia, Germany, France, and the UK — accounted for 75 per cent of the volume of exports of major conventional weapons, down from 78 per cent in 2002–2006. 44 per cent of imports of major conventional weapons were made by states in Asia and Oceania.</p>

<p>Turkey has attained political, strategic and economic critical mass over the past decade, elevating its status on the international arena, and placing itself at the center of issues important to the West. But this does not mean that Turkey has attained the capacity to be the principal player in the region. Meanwhile, the “Arab Spring” made a sham of the government's much touted “zero problems with neighbors” policy, leaving Ankara with strained ties with almost all of its immediate neighbors. The fact that Turkish foreign policy has become an extension of domestic politics, which in Turkey can be abrasive, has also blurred well defined lines in Ankara's traditional foreign policy approach. Clearly, events continue to be the principal determinant in Turkey's foreign policy orientation. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4510]</p>

<p>The increase in military expenditure in Africa in 2011 was the largest of any region, at 8.6 per cent in real terms, reaching an estimated $34.6 billion. The annual increase was almost exactly equal to the increase of the region's largest spender, Algeria. The picture of the rest of Africa was mixed, with the spending of another 10 African countries increasing or decreasing by more than 10 per cent in real terms. The total for sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to have been unchanged in 2011. The factors driving military expenditure in Africa include civil conflicts, regional ambitions, economic growth, and rising oil revenues. In some areas, the threat of terrorist activities by Islamist groups has increased, drawing considerable interest from external actors, especially the US.</p>
<p>63.4494 JACKSON, Susan T. — <bold>Key developments in the main arms-producing countries</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 219–229.</p>
<p>Many countries outside Western Europe and North America, such as India and some countries in the Middle East, are maintaining large arms procurement projects and as a result many West European and North American companies are adopting strategies that prioritize marketing of their arms in these countries. Similarly, Japan's announcement in late 2011 that it is to lift its ban on arms exports is indicative of increasing prioritization of arms exports in the Global North. Overall, the budget uncertainty that persists in many places contributes to general uncertainty regarding future arms sales. Various developments in the US and Western Europe are reducing the rate of increase of the arms sales of the SIPRI Top 100 arms-producing and military services companies.</p>
<p>63.4495 JACKSON, Susan T.; GRINBAUM, Mikael — <bold>The Indian arms-producing and military services industry</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 239–246.</p>
<p>By the government's own reckoning, half of India's domestically produced equipment is obsolete and only 15 per cent is considered state-of-the-art. In order to achieve a reversal of the current situation, the Indian arms industry would need to double its production output every year for five years. This is unlikely to be achieved due to the expense of building and maintaining a domestic arms industry and external barriers to transfer of knowledge and technology by foreign arms exporters. Nevertheless, pressures on global arms producers to find export markets, especially at a time of reduced public spending in the Global North, give India growing leverage in negotiating purchasing conditions and more opportunities to offer economic incentives for foreign technology transfers.</p>

<p>While the UN Standardized Instrument represented an important improvement in the availability of data on military spending when it was first introduced in 1981, the gradual decline in reporting has been a matter of concern to many UN member states. It was against this background that, in response to a joint German-Romanian proposal in 2007, a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) was established in November 2010 to review the operation of the UN Standardized Instrument and its further development. Their report was presented to the UN Secretary-General in June 2011. A discussion of the UN system of reporting and trends in reporting for the period 2002–2011 allows for the better understanding of the 2011 report's findings and recommendations.</p>

<p>63.4498 KILE, Shannon N. — <bold>Iran and nuclear proliferation concerns</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 266–273.</p>
<p>The international controversy over the scope and nature of Iran's nuclear program intensified following the release in November 2011 of the most comprehensive review and assessment to date by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of information about Iranian nuclear research and development activities with possible military dimensions. The general conclusions and timelines contained in the IAEA report were consistent with the official testimony about the findings of the most recent US National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iran's nuclear program. There was thus growing international concern about Iran's expansion of its uranium enrichment capabilities, in continued defiance of the UN Security Council's demands, set out in five resolutions, that it suspend all enrichment and other sensitive fuel cycle activities.</p>
<p>63.4499 KILE, Shannon N. — <bold>North Korea's nuclear programme</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 374–375.</p>
<p>On 24 August 2011, after a meeting between Russian President D. Medvedev and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, North Korea reportedly indicated that it would be willing to observe a moratorium on the production and testing of nuclear weapons and missiles in the context of resumed talks. On 17 December 2011 there were unconfirmed media reports that North Korea had agreed to suspend its uranium-enrichment program in exchange for food aid from the US. As the year ended, however, the uncertainties created by Kim Jong-il's death appeared to halt, at least for the time being, further North Korean-US talks.</p>
<p>63.4500 KILE, Shannon N., <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>Russian nuclear forces</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 315–321.</p>
<p>As of January 2012, Russia maintained an arsenal of approximately 1800 deployed nuclear warheads, all of which were either placed on long-range strategic missiles or located on bases with operational forces. This reflects a recalculation based on New START aggregate data and adjustment of the bomber weapon count. Because of technical and financial constraints, Russia has not introduced new or modernized delivery systems at nearly the same rate as it has retired the older systems. The force-reductions have been accompanied by a doctrinal shift away from the Soviet requirement of “nuclear parity” with all potential adversaries towards a posture of minimal deterrence vis-à-vis the US.</p>
<p>63.4501 KILE, Shannon N. — <bold>Russian-US nuclear arms control</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 355–362.</p>
<p>A new chapter in strategic nuclear arms control and Russian-US relations was opened on 5 February 2011, when the Russian Foreign Minister, S. Lavrov, and the US Secretary of State, H. Clinton, exchanged the ratification documents to bring into force the 2010 New START. The implementation of New START proceeded apace against the background of the ongoing dispute between Russia and the US over US plans to develop and deploy a new missile defense architecture that will include radar and missile interceptors sites in Europe. In addition to the long-running dispute over missile defense, Russia and the US continued to disagree about the focus and timing of the next steps in bilateral arms control.</p>
<p>63.4502 KILE, Shannon N. — <bold>Syria and nuclear proliferation concerns</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 363–365.</p>
<p>In 2011, Syria came under renewed international scrutiny by refusing to dispel suspicions that it had carried out work on a suspected undeclared nuclear facility. The suspicions centered on a facility located at al-Kibar, a site in Deir Ez-Zor governorate in eastern Syria. In February 2011, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yukiya Amano, reported to the IAEA Board of Governors that Syria's lack of cooperation since June 2008 in providing access and requested information meant that the agency was unable to confirm Syria's statements about the non-nuclear nature of the Deir Ez-Zor site. A subsequent report to the board, issued in May 2011, contained evidence that had led inspectors to conclude that Syria had been building a covert nuclear reactor.</p>

<p>In the 2010 Strategic Defense and Security Review (SDR), the British Government made a commitment to retain a submarine-based nuclear deterrent force for the indefinite future. In 2011, the Ministry of Defense announced the completion of the “initial gate” phase for the replacement submarine program. The 2010 SDR also revealed plans for cutting the size of the British nuclear arsenal. The UK has launched a long-term investment program aimed at sustaining key skills and facilities at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston. In 2011, the Ministry of Defense confirmed that it plans to build a new facility at Aldermaston to store and handle enriched uranium components for nuclear warheads and reactor fuel for nuclear-powered submarines.</p>

<p>China is gradually expanding its nuclear arsenal as part of a long-term modernization program aimed at developing a more survivable force and strengthening its nuclear retaliatory capabilities. Its forces have long been the least transparent among the legally recognized nuclear weapon states. It is estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 200 operational nuclear weapons for delivery mainly by ballistic missiles. A small number of gravity bombs are believed to be available for delivery by aircraft. Additional warheads may be in reserve, giving a total stockpile of about 240 warheads. The March 2011 Defense White Paper, released by the Chinese Government, reiterated China's commitment to the policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons, yet provided no information about the size or structure of China's nuclear forces.</p>

<p>India is estimated to have an arsenal of 80–100 nuclear weapons. This figure is based on calculations of India's inventory of weapon-grade plutonium as well as the number of operational nuclear-capable delivery systems. India's weapons are believed to be plutonium-based and the country continues to enrich uranium to produce highly enriched uranium for use as naval reactor fuel. India's nuclear doctrine is based on the principle of a minimum credible deterrent and no-first-use of nuclear weapons. In May 2011, the Indian Prime Minister, M. Singh, convened a meeting of India's Nuclear Command Authority (NCA), the body responsible for overseeing the country's nuclear arsenal, to assess progress towards the goal of achieving an operational “triad” of nuclear forces.</p>

<p>Israel continues to maintain its long-standing policy of nuclear opacity, neither officially confirming nor denying that it possesses nuclear weapons. It is estimated that Israel has approximately 80 intact nuclear weapons, of which 50 are warheads for delivery by ballistic missiles and the remainder are bombs for delivery by aircraft. Israel may have produced non-strategic nuclear weapons, including artillery shells and atomic demolition munitions, but this has never been confirmed. The country continues to develop advanced long-range ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads. There has also been considerable speculation that Israel may have developed a nuclear-capable sea-launched cruise missile for its current fleet of three Type 800 Dolphin class diesel-electric submarines that were purchased from Germany.</p>

<p>At the end of 2010 North Korea was estimated to have roughly 30 kilograms of plutonium separated from the spent fuel of its 5-megawatt-electric graphite-moderated research reactor at Yongbyon. This would be sufficient to construct up to eight nuclear weapons, assuming that each weapon used 4–5 kg of plutonium and depending on North Korea's design and engineering skills. North Korea may have obtained weapon design assistance from the A. Q. Khan network. According to a leaked report prepared in 2011 by the UN Security Council's panel of experts on North Korea, the country has pursued a long-term uranium enrichment program.</p>

<p>Pakistan is estimated to possess 90–110 nuclear weapons that can be delivered by aircraft and missiles. Pakistan's current warhead designs are believed to use highly enriched uranium (HEU), but there is evidence that it is moving towards an arsenal based on plutonium. Warheads using plutonium could be lighter and more compact than those using HEU to achieve the same yield. Some experts have estimated that Pakistan's nuclear stockpile could double within a decade based on increased military plutonium-production capabilities. As of 2011, Pakistan was estimated to have a stockpile of 2.35–3.15 tons of 90 per cent HEU. The enrichment is believed to be taking place at the uranium centrifuge facilities at Kahuta and Gadwal.</p>

<p>As of January 2012, the US maintained an estimated arsenal of approximately 2150 operational nuclear warheads, consisting of roughly 1950 strategic and 200 non-strategic warheads. In addition to this operational arsenal, about 2750 warheads are held in reserve, for a total stockpile of approximately 4900 warheads. Another 3100 retired warheads are awaiting dismantlement for a total inventory of roughly 8000 warheads. The US will only have to offload 100 additional warheads over the next seven years to meet the New START limit by February 2018. However, it will have to dismantle 243 launchers to meet the limit of no more than 700 deployed and 100 non-deployed launchers.</p>

<p>The basic structural pattern of Turkish-Western relations is characterized by a dominance of Turkey-US relations and a diminishing importance of Turkey-EU relations. The uncertainties about future developments in the Middle East, especially the political fall-out of the Syrian civil war, demand close political coordination between Ankara and Washington. This coordination will most likely persist in spite of numerous issues that could have negative impacts on the relationship, such as Turkish-Armenian conflicts. Relations between Brussels and Ankara will hardly go beyond (intensive) political dialogue given the inability of the EU to develop comprehensive strategic foreign policies in the framework of its Common Foreign and Security Policy. Furthermore, EU-Turkey relations will be severely constrained by the continuing deadlock of accession negotiations.

<p>Complementing the effectiveness of US sanctions debate, the US government often prods US investors to disinvest from targeted countries, hoping to pressure sanctioned countries to back US foreign policy goals or face economic costs for their actions. Missing from the effectiveness of sanctions debate is the impact US sanctions have on third-party FDI. Using panel data for 171 countries from 1969 to 2000, we present the first empirical study on the effect of sanctions on global FDI. We find strong evidence that when US firms disinvest during US sanctions, global FDI significantly increases, providing the target country with a reliable source of capital replacement. The results suggest the limited effectiveness of sanctions for restricting capital flows to targeted countries and that US firms may ultimately bear the highest costs from US-imposed sanctions.

Furthermore, this atmosphere enabled the authoritarian regime in power in Mexico to develop and entrench itself, establishing itself as the frame of reference for political struggle and contributing to the redefinition of nationalism as a third way between communism and capitalism.

<p>This article investigates India's negotiation behavior as a rising power and [addresses] a polarized scholarly debate that sees India as either a “natural ally” of the West, or as an unreformed and revisionist Third Worldist power. The key to understanding India's behavior lies in examining with whom it is negotiating. Rising India resorts frequently to distributive negotiation strategies, uses moralistic framing and resists bandwagoning. Its relations with the rising powers, too, reveal some degree of distributive bargaining, and it plays hardball with multinational companies and within international organizations. India's pattern of behavior is different when dealing with smaller players. The differences in behavior suggest that India is perhaps not reluctant to be a responsible power per se, but that it sees itself as owing its responsibility to different constituencies.

<p>In 2011, discussions on military expenditure were dominated by the impact of the austerity measures enacted by governments in an effort to reduce budget deficits that resulted from the global financial and economic crisis that started in 2008. On the one hand, acute debt crises in Greece, Italy, and Spain have led to the imposition of particularly severe austerity measures in some cases as a condition of international bailout packages. On the other hand, countries such as the UK that have not faced such imminent debt problems have also cut public spending, based on the belief that reducing deficits is the overwhelming economic priority following the crisis. Total military expenditure was, however, essentially unchanged in real terms compared with 2010, at $407 billion.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the data on military expenditure is to provide an easily identifiable measure of the scale of resources absorbed by the military. Military expenditure is an “input” measure, which is not directly related to the “output” of military activities, such as military capability or military security. Long- and short-term changes in military spending may be signs of a change in military output, but interpretations of this type should be made with caution. Military expenditure data for the period 2002–2011 is presented in local currency at current prices, constant (2010) US dollars and as a share of GDP for the 166 countries covered by the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database.</p>
<p>63.4519 PERLO-FREEMAN, Sam; SOLMIRANO, Carina — <bold>Global developments in military expenditure</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 149–155.</p>
<p>Between 1998 and 2010, total world military expenditure increased every year in real terms, but that growth stopped in 2011 as spending reached $1738 billion. The list of the top 15 military spenders worldwide in 2011 includes the same countries as in 2010, but the order has changed somewhat. In contrast to most of the 2000s, 9 of the 15 countries cut military spending in real terms in 2011. Four countries increased their military burdens, with the largest increase being by the US. Over the period 2002–11 there were significant increases in military spending in all regions and subregions other than Western and Central Europe, where there was virtually no change. The increases were especially pronounced in North Africa and Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>The two wars have involved — in addition to their great human costs — substantial and continuing economic costs both to Afghanistan and Iraq themselves and to the countries participating in the invasions and subsequent occupations of these countries. A number of issues are involved in estimating the costs to Afghanistan and Iraq. One problem is the lack of available data under the regimes of the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq: no military expenditure data is available in either case. Another problem is the choice of counterfactual as Afghanistan was already in conflict before the US-led war and the Iraqi economy was subject to severe sanctions. There is surveys available information, however, on the costs to the US and a number of allied countries.</p>

<p>The UK's National Security Strategy states that it will maintain ‘a commitment to collective security via a rules-based international system and our key alliances, notably with the US. But what should the UK do when the US is accused (as during the Iraq crisis) of circumventing the procedural norms of the UN? This article examines the normative foundations underpinning what it calls Blairite Atlanticism. This supports the US unilateralism not simply because it is in the national interest to do so, but because ultimately the US acts as a custodian of the international common good when the UN fails to do so. Drawing on Chr. Reus-Smit's critique of “liberal hierarchy,” the article challenges the claim that this approach meets the criteria of a progressive foreign policy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Contrary to general belief, Iran lacks the capability to accurately and reliably deliver a weapon to targets beyond 1,000 kilometers. In addition, a pre-emptive attack on Iran's nuclear installations would very likely miss its target and entail significant risks and major negative consequences. Hence, as Iran is several years away from developing operational nuclear weapons, a pre-emptive attack would not only provoke the above-mentioned repercussions, it would also be completely unnecessary. Therefore, there is a need for an alternative approach to the Western community's policy of political pressure, threats and sanctions in its dealings with Iran. History shows that, despite historically burdened relations, contradictory interests and ideological antagonism, conflict de-escalation is not only possible, but urgently necessary.

<p>The moaning about Turkey's purported “shift of axis” has given way to the complacent assessment that Turkey is “again in the Western fold”. As Turkey has closed ranks not only with the US but also with Qatar and Saudi Arabia, it is seen as the mere member of a Sunni-Muslim coalition in the region today. Ankara is deprived of its nimbus of being a uniting power in the Middle East, able to bridge the sectarian divide — the main threat for all states in the region. Reasons for this development, the article argues, are not only the effects of the “Arab Spring” but also Turkey's limited understanding of democratization that, for a great deal, until now exhausted in the integration of conservative Sunni-Muslim actors in the realms of politics, economy and education.

<p>The US budget deficit has soared since the global financial crisis in 2008, and the resulting political crisis over how to deal with it has a significant impact on the US debate on military spending in 2011. During the 11 years following September 2001, US federal outlays on national defense increased by 84 per cent in real terms. After a decade of sharp rises in military spending, the debate, particularly in the US Congress, shifted to cuts in military spending. In late July 2011, agreement was reached on legislation to reduce public spending over the next 10 years, which will also have an impact on future US military spending (unless legislation is repealed in subsequent years).</p>

<p>Scholarly debates about the changing nature of international power and its distribution have been an ongoing feature of the years since the end of the Cold War in 1991. Most of these have focused on the position and role of the US in a unipolar world. In contrast, there has been relatively little discussion about the concept of multipolarity and its various possible meanings. To the extent that such debates have been evident, they have developed to a more significant extent in Russia than in other states. In these Russian debates, three distinct strands of thinking about multipolarity have become apparent. These can be termed the “confrontationalist,” “competitive,” and “concert-based” views of multipolarity in the post-Cold War world. [R]</p>

<p>The study examines how Azerbaijani decision-makers evaluate their situation within the structure of the international system. It applies the theory of power preponderance to analyze the record of bilateral diplomatic instruments concluded with the US, Russia, Turkey, Iran and the EU from 1991 to 2011. The results indicate that while Baku has interacted with Russia more than any other major power, this has produced the fewest agreements on high-salience issues. At the same time, its intimate relationship with Turkey has been based more upon military aid than political cooperation and institution-building. Further, it maintains a roughly equal level of security and economic cooperation with the US and Iran, thus remaining neutral between the global preponderant power and its primary rival. Finally, Azerbaijan's interaction with the EU remains in its early stages. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The author argues that the democratic reform in Myanmar is rooted in profound internal and external factors. Since the beginning of the reform, the changes in Myanmar have taken tolls in a series of China's existing interests inside the country. Economically, Chinese investments have come under increasing scrutiny, criticism, and even oppositions, threatening the viability of strategic projects such as the oil and gas pipelines. Politically, the initial success of the democratic reform in Myanmar raises questions about Beijing's continuous resistance to reform. Strategically, the changes in Myanmar undercut China's original blueprint about the strategic utilities of Myanmar for China at ASEAN, in the Indian Ocean and more broadly in the region. In light of the changes, China has adjusted its policy toward Myanmar. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article examines how the US manages the challenge to its position of primacy in the global order. It appears that the US wants to share the burdens of governance with emerging powers, encouraging them to play the role of “responsible stakeholders”. However, it does not wish to relinquish its ability to act unilaterally or to be the main voice in established institutions, such as the UN Security Council or the IMF. For this reason, the US has preferred to encourage the involvement of emerging countries in governance through informal settings like the G20, while resisting the reform of formal governance structures. If the US continues to pursue this strategy, global order is likely to become more fragmented, with formal institutions increasingly losing their power and relevance; this will diminish US power and influence.

<p>63.4531 VICKERS, Brendan — <bold>Africa and the rising powers: bargaining for the “marginalized many”</bold>. <italic>International Affairs</italic> 89(3), May 2013: 673–693.</p>
<p>This article explores Africa's recent negotiating behavior in relation to [those] actors that animate the current shifting global economic order: rising powers, established powers and international organizations. Most African countries are still reactive to the bilateral overtures of Brazil, China and India and unable to set the terms of engagement. Nonetheless, the rise of these new powers provides alternative negotiating partners to the established powers. By comparison, at the multilateral level, the African Group has been far more active and assertive in contesting global governance in the pursuit of greater distributive justice, particularly in the climate, trade and security regimes. African countries require judicious negotiating strategies, improved deliberative capacities and coalitions with local/continental/global civil society and business networks in order to reshape the terms of their engagement with their international partners.

<p>63.4532 WANG Duanyong — <bold>The safety of Chinese citizens abroad: a quantitative interpretation of the “special notices for Chinese citizens abroad” (2008–2010)</bold>. <italic>Journal of Current Chinese Affairs</italic> 42(1), 2013: 167–198.</p>
<p>In recent years, the security risk to Chinese citizens overseas has become an increasingly prominent issue owing to a rapid increase in the number of Chinese citizens moving and travelling abroad. Protecting the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens abroad has become a key priority within the overall field of protecting China's overseas interests. This article uses an alternative sample analysis to perform a quantitative interpretation of the “Special Notices for Chinese Citizens Abroad” issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China from 2008 to 2010. It analyzes the distribution characteristics of the risks posed to Chinese citizens overseas in terms of geographical distribution, various risk categories. It [summarizes] the main features and causes of security risks to Chinese citizens overseas. [R]</p>
<p>63.4533 WEZEMAN, Siemon T. — <bold>The maritime dimension of arms transfers to South East Asia, 2007–11</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 280–285.</p>
<p>The volume of arms-transfers to South East Asia in the period 2007–11 was almost 200 per cent higher than in 2002–2006, a significantly bigger rise than the global average increase of 24 per cent. The increase in the volume of imports was particularly significant for Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Viet Nam, all of which acquired or ordered quantitatively or qualitatively significant naval platforms and advanced combat aircraft in 2007–11. A closer look at the background to and motives for the acquisitions, followed by detailing acquisitions in 2007–11, allows for an analysis of imports and orders placed with foreign suppliers by these four countries and two other states on the South China Sea (Brunei Darussalam and the Philippines) related to maritime security.</p>
<p>63.4534 YAHUDA, Michael — <bold>China's new assertiveness in the South China Sea</bold>. <italic>Journal of Contemporary China</italic> 81, May 2013: 446–459.</p>
<p>China's new assertiveness in the South China Sea has arisen from the growth of its military power, its “triumphalism” in the wake of the Western financial crisis and its heightened nationalism. The other littoral states of the South China Sea have been troubled by the opacity of Chinese politics and of the process of military decision-making amid a proliferation of apparently separately controlled maritime forces. The more active role being played by the US in the region, in part as a response to Chinese activism, has troubled Beijing. While most of the ASEAN states have welcomed America as a hedge against growing Chinese power, their economies have become increasingly dependent upon China and they don't want to be a party to any potential conflict between these two giants.

<p>63.4535 ZAPF, Uta — <bold>Turkey and the European Union: a complicated relationship</bold>. <italic>Südosteuropa Mitteilungen</italic> 53(1), 2013: 95–98.</p>
<p>The author reflects on the stagnation of EU accession negotiations and the inconsistent policy of German political forces towards Turkey. The EU's recent “positive agenda” and the opening of a visa dialogue are seen as appropriate steps to overcome the standstill in EU-Turkey relations. On the other hand, rage in Turkey is rising over the bad treatment by the EU that eventually, with the crisis in Syria escalating, needs Turkey as an ally. Turkey for its own interest should better cooperate with NATO. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4510]</p>
