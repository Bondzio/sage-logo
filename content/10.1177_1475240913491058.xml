<p><italic>Higher Education and the State: Changing Relationships in Europe and East Asia</italic> brings together contributions from across the globe, mainly from the northern hemisphere, in an attempt to present an overview of the relationship between the state and higher education systems in six national contexts. The book is divided into four main parts. The first is an introductory section comprising three chapters. These chapters set the scene and provide background information regarding the role of higher education and its relationship with the state. In Chapter 1, John Taylor describes in a deep level of detail how the relationship between the state and higher education changed due to, among other things, forces of marketization of higher education, which meant a move away from traditional models. Taylor’s analysis is indeed very thorough and enlightening, although reference to the context in which the changes took place is sometimes vague. Chapter 2 presents historical perspectives from Japan, Korea and the UK. Roger Goodman explains that the interest that eastern higher education institutions have in western systems comes from western universities’ positions on the league tables and their impact on the economy in their countries. Goodman describes how the reduction of state funding for higher education meant that the system had to police itself by peer evaluation of research which has become increasingly more valuable than teaching. Goodman warns that East Asia’s move towards what resembles the old UK system is problematic due to the huge differences in context and the nature of higher education in the east. In the last introductory chapter, Chapter 3, Fumi Kitagawa discusses the role of universities in economic development and growth in the UK and Japan. Kitagawa describes governments’ attempts to link universities to industrial innovation (through regional innovation systems) and the increasing transnational links with Europe and across East Asia. Kitagawa emphasizes the increasingly significant role of universities in local and regional contexts in the UK and Japan promoted by national governments, which seems contradictory to the rise of a globalized (rather than localized) knowledge economy.</p>
<p>The second section of this book includes two chapters describing and analysing changes in the relationship between the state and higher education in the UK. Ivor Crewe, in Chapter 4, describes the UK government’s goals of mass education, invading universities’ autonomy and facing practically no resistance. The move towards mass education, Crewe argues, and the objectives attached to that entailed some trade-offs that made it difficult to achieve those goals. The key effects this had on higher education were decreasing the funding as expansion became less affordable to the state, and increased regulations in the state’s attempt to maintain quality of provision. The government’s relationship with higher education has shifted from providing for its purpose to micro-managing recruitment and admissions. In Chapter 5, David Watson reiterates the rapid and uneven development of the UK higher education system from elite to mass, describing the distinctive pattern of advanced autonomy and centralization. The changing relationship of higher education with the state meant creating institutional diverse ‘types’ with contradiction between world class league tables requirements (e.g. research) and state requirements (e.g. teaching quality). Watson argues that the lines dividing institutions should be based on management quality, not on historical status.</p>
<p>In the third section of the book, an examination of the changes in the relationship between the state and higher education in continental western Europe is presented. In Chapter 6, Christian Galan explains that investment in higher education in France was the reason for changes in higher education autonomy, competitiveness and funding to serve the knowledge economy. Galan describes how as funding from the government was not received, universities resorted to ‘freezing’ teaching positions in order to postpone expenditure, leaving universities today in a critical financial situation. Hubert Ertl, in Chapter 7, focuses on higher education reforms in Germany, describing the ongoing influence of the Bologna Process (1999) on German higher education. Ertl illustrates how the state’s position towards higher education changed, from financing the system as duty and protecting its autonomy while universities played an important public role, to the shift in power from local to federal government and the delay of reforms and funding during the unification of Germany. Ertl then argues that the negative consequences of this delay (a large proportion of students changing subjects, long duration of studies, high drop-out rates) were detrimental in pushing the reforms forward leading to more hierarchical structures and managerial practices. The Bologna Declaration is seen by Ertl as a catalyst for change in Germany. Chapter 8 deals with the policy reforms in Italy. Paola Mattei describes these reforms as paradoxical, and focuses on the resistance to reform and factors affecting their implementation in the Italian higher education system. Mattei argues that despite the rise in the private spending on higher education in Italy, reform has been slow and difficult due to what Mattei describes as ‘dynamic conservatism’, or the tendency to resist change. Mattei believes that the institutional conditions and legacies in Italian higher education do not allow change. Again, the familiar themes of moving from an elitist to mass higher education, public funding cuts and increasing differentiation are presented in this chapter. Italian universities seem to be seen as tools of national goals, and their relationship with the state has been shaped by their autonomy, private sector management practices and public evaluation.</p>
<p>The fourth section of the book covers higher education’s relationship with the state in Japan and Korea. Chapter 9 presents the key features of Japanese higher education. Motohisa Kaneko summarises these as the high rate of participation, the high ratio of private undergraduate institutions, and the small financial support by the state which, nonetheless, has a significant impact directing change. Kaneko describes how the state’s funding of higher education in Japan decreased as economic growth dropped, resulting in pressures affecting the relationship between them. The reforms resulting from these pressures led to, among other things, incorporating national universities which were at the same time evaluated by the Ministry of Education, and promoting institutional differentiation and centres of excellence in research. Aya Yoshida, in Chapter 10, takes a slightly different perspective on the Japanese context, exploring the relationship between the state and private institutions in particular. The changes in this relationship were in the nature of support to and control of these institutions by the state, from strict control to non-interventionist policies, to support to weaker institutions. Yoshida explains that private higher education in Japan is bigger than the public sector, thus receiving more attention from the government, despite the fact that private universities are treated selectively. Further issues with the relationship between higher education and the government in Japan are again presented in Chapter 11, in which Takehiko Kariya uses data from a longitudinal survey to present and analyse access to and quality of higher education in Japan. Kariya describes the challenges facing Japanese higher education in terms of balancing the conflicting goals of equality by expanding opportunities, quality of higher education with limited investment, and financing higher education by the state. Kariya warns that the expansion of higher education without enough investment from the state makes it difficult to maintain quality and it does not address the above challenges. The relationship between the state and higher education in South Korea is presented in Chapter 12. Terri Kim provides a critical review of this relationship, maintaining that although there has been continuous growth in public spending on higher education in Korea, there has also been strong government control of funding patterns. Kim explains that the Korean context is characterized by a non-changing relationship between the state and higher education, in the sense that higher education has always had a practical purpose and there has been an over-emphasis on its usefulness.</p>
<p>The book concludes with an ‘Afterword’ by Ronald Dore, who describes the dramatic changes in higher education in general. Higher education, Dore argues, and its relation to the state, has been influenced by political hegemony and increased competition caused by globalization, and so it has moved away from traditional models. Dore suggests two areas of investigation inspired by the chapters in this book, one is comparing the policymaking process internationally; the other is exploring the motives of those policymakers. Dore finishes with a nostalgic recall of the purpose of education as the ‘inclination and ability to serve’.</p>
<p>To conclude, the book discusses contemporary issues of institutional, social, educational and political significance for higher education systems today, and the concept of change (or lack of it) in its relationship with the state. By putting these issues in a historical context, we are able to see extraordinary similarities between the six national contexts examined. It is clear from the chapters of this book that societies across the globe aspire to have that perfect higher education system, trying to learn from each other (east and west) or standardise (Bologna Declaration) despite different contextual, cultural and social factors affecting the change in traditional approaches and methods. It would seem that in many of the contexts described in this book, attempts have been made to learn from others’ lessons, but the risks need to be more carefully calculated, not only in financial terms that appeal to the state. The comparisons presented are illuminating, although the analysis of the national contexts discussed does not lend itself at times to being impartial as the coverage is not equally distributed. Higher education as a tool to serve the economy is a common theme in this book. It would be interesting to see the flow of influence between northern and southern hemispheres as there are bound to be more lessons to learn.</p>
