<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Paresis of the arm post stroke remains an important clinical problem with fewer than 50% of people post stroke recovering some degree of movement or function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511434575">1</xref></sup> Underutilization of the affected limb can occur after stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511434575">2</xref></sup> and people tend to compensate with the intact limb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511434575">3</xref></sup> Virtual reality is a computing technology that presents simulated information to allow individuals to experience and interact with or within three-dimensional environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511434575">4</xref></sup> Virtual reality may hold some solutions to these problems. It has been shown to be an interactive and enjoyable medium that, with sufficient use, may improve upper limb motor function in adults with stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511434575">5</xref></sup> Virtual technologies can be used to produce environments in which intensity of practice and feedback on performance can be manipulated to provide tailored motor training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511434575">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511434575">7</xref></sup> However, reviews have indicated that although very promising there are still problems relating to the limited quality of methodologies used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511434575">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511434575">9</xref></sup> The majority of evidence has been based on single-case or uncontrolled designs. Recent studies continue to report the variety of set-up and design of the technology. Examples of such are a novel upper limb system consisting of three-dimensional tracker, custom forearm support, workstation and library of three-dimensional exercises<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511434575">10</xref></sup> and a haptic master–slave system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511434575">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two randomized controlled trials have compared virtual reality-mediated therapy for the arm to no intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511434575">12</xref></sup> and to alternative digital applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511434575">13</xref></sup> In the trial reported by Jang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511434575">12</xref></sup> significant improvements were found in the Box and Block Test; the Fugl-Meyer Assessment and manual function test. This study also reported a novel demonstration of virtual reality-induced neuroplastic changes associated with motor recovery as indicated through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Fischer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511434575">13</xref></sup> reported significant changes on the Box and Block Test and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, along with a significant change in Wolf Motor Function Test score. However, the authors indicated that overall gains were small. One further clinical trial has compared conventional therapy to virtual reality-based therapy with little detail as to the content of the conventional therapy sessions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511434575">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of virtual reality-mediated therapy compared to conventional physiotherapy in the motor rehabilitation of the arm following stroke. Objectives were (1) to identify the pattern of recruitment and retention; (2) to pilot the methodological procedures; (3) to provide data to inform a power analysis to determine sample size for a future trial; and (4) to assess the effects of virtual reality-mediated therapy on the arm impairment and activity levels of people with stroke.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215511434575" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Data were collected over an 18-month period. In this pilot randomized controlled trial participants were assigned into groups by an independent colleague, using a computer-generated randomization table. Group allocation cards were concealed in opaque envelopes to be opened by the treating research therapist, following assessment and screening by the blinded independent outcome assessor. Ethical approval was obtained from the Queens University Belfast Research Ethics Committee and from the Office of Research Ethics Committees in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The records of those who had been admitted to two local hospital stroke units for rehabilitation in the preceding 6–12 months were examined for potential participants who met the selection criteria. Volunteers were also sought from local stroke support groups. People were contacted by letter and telephone follow-up and then screened for recruitment into the trial. History taking and screening were completed on first contact by the independent outcome assessor to ensure the participant fulfilled the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>All participants provided written informed consent. Inclusion criteria were that the potential participant was medically stable; an adult aged 18–85 years; 6–24 months following a first stroke and able to follow a two-step command. Potential participants were excluded if they presented with a mental score test of less than 7/10,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511434575">15</xref></sup> a star cancellation score of less than 48/52,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511434575">16</xref></sup> scored less than 25 out of 100 on the upper limb Motricity Index,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511434575">17</xref></sup> had comorbid conditions affecting their rehabilitation potential (e.g. cardiac, respiratory or arthritic problems) and reported arm pain on a visual analogue scale of &gt;6/10. A score of 0–25 on the Motricity Index is deemed to indicate very severe motor loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511434575">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following medical advice it was agreed to also exclude anyone with a cardiac pacemaker as the electromagnetic motion tracker used within the virtual reality system might interfere with such devices. The length and timing of the virtual reality intervention was derived from a detailed review of existing evidence published in this area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511434575">8</xref></sup> The system comprised a desktop computer, a head-mounted display unit, a motion tracking system and sensors. The therapist could navigate through the data input and graphics by means of drop-down menus. The head-mounted display facilitated the participant’s immersion in the virtual environment. Three sensors were applied to the shoulder, elbow and hand of the participant, who could then manipulate objects and carry out upper limb tasks within a 3D environment. The virtual tasks were designed to simulate a range of upper limb tasks related to reach to target, reach and grasp and game tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511434575">19</xref></sup> As the participant’s performance progressed the tasks could be made easier or more difficult by means of changing the distance or height of objects or the speed of stimulus. The experimental group underwent a three-week training period using virtual reality-mediated upper limb therapy. This was delivered over three sessions per week of 30–45 minutes duration, which consisted of participant set-up and physical practice focusing on specific upper limb tasks. Each person in the virtual reality group received nine treatment sessions (three per week for three weeks).</p>
<p>The control group received therapy, focusing on the upper limb, to control for any dose effect in terms of the amount of intervention between groups. Conventional therapy followed an evidence-based approach. This was delivered by a physiotherapist, experienced in stroke rehabilitation, and followed a programme of techniques, which included muscle facilitation, stretching exercises, strengthening activities and the inclusion of the more affected upper limb in functional tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511434575">20</xref></sup> The content of therapy was recorded for each session, using a treatment checklist. A sample of these sessions was video-recorded to allow the content to be checked by an independent physiotherapist, also experienced in stroke rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the treatments it was not possible for the treating therapist and the participants to be blinded. Therefore only the outcome assessor was blinded to group allocation. Non-compliance was defined as receipt of less than three out of a total of nine treatments, but such participants were included in subsequent follow-ups for the purposes of intention-to treat analysis. Participants were requested to continue with their normal activities. If they included any additional upper limb exercise or activities during the duration of the study they were asked to record this in a treatment diary. Both the virtual reality-mediated therapy and the conventional therapy were administered by the same physiotherapist.</p>
<p>The upper limb Motricity Index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511434575">17</xref></sup> and the Action Research Arm Test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511434575">21</xref></sup> were used to assess motor impairment and function. These have been validated for use in the stroke population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511434575">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511434575">23</xref></sup> These were completed at baseline, post intervention and six weeks follow-up. An exit questionnaire was completed by each participant at the end of intervention. This evaluated the conduct of the trial and the participants’ perceptions of the interventions and their satisfaction with the treatment received</p>

<title>Data analyses</title>
<p>All variables were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Intention-to-treat analysis was carried out by an investigator blinded to treatment allocation. Missing data were dealt with by the simple mean imputation method, whereby the missing value is replaced with the mean of the group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511434575">24</xref></sup> As the data were not normally distributed non-parametric tests were conducted. The Mann–Whitney and Friedman’s test are the non-parametric alternatives to the <italic>t</italic>-test for independent samples and the one-way repeated measures analysis of variance, respectively. The impairment and activity scores were compared to the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the outcome measures used (i.e. the minimum level of change of an outcome measure that is considered to be clinically relevant).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511434575">25</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Seventy-seven potential participants were contacted (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511434575">Figure 1</xref> for flow diagram of study according to CONSORT statement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511434575">26</xref></sup>). Three people were deceased at time of contact. Fifty-six people were excluded for the following main reasons: unwillingness to participate (<italic>n</italic> = 23), non-response (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and ineligibility according to the inclusion criteria (<italic>n</italic> = 29). Of the 23 unwilling to participate 15 gave no specific reason; the remaining 8 identified concurrently attending formal rehabilitation (3); personal time constraints (2) and problems with travelling to the research setting (3), as reasons for not participating. Thirty-eight per cent of potential participants did not meet the inclusion criteria: comorbidity (<italic>n</italic> = 15); more than 85 years (<italic>n</italic> = 2); Motricity Index score of less than 25 (<italic>n</italic> = 3); longer than 2 years post stroke (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and having a history of more than one stroke (<italic>n</italic> = 3). One participant dropped out after baseline measures and one treatment session, despite efforts to reschedule appointments and to acquire further outcome data.</p>

<p>The baseline range for all participants on the upper limb Motricity Index was 29–100 points (virtual reality group 71–100, conventional group 29–100), and on the Action Research Arm Test was 0–57 points (virtual reality group 32–57, conventional group 0–57). There were no significant or clinically important differences between the groups at baseline (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511434575">Table 2</xref>). Outcome data were obtained from 95% of participants at the end of treatment and at follow-up. One participant withdrew consent after one virtual reality session. Compliance in both groups was high, with all 17 participants completing all nine therapy sessions.

<p>Group median scores indicated an improvement in upper limb Motricity Index scores for both of the groups, the virtual reality group by 7/100 points and the conventional groups by 8/100 points, at discharge. The improvement in Motricity Index scores was maintained in the virtual reality group at follow-up, whereas in the conventional group it decreased to the baseline level. Research has indicated that a change of 10% in an outcome score is clinically relevant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511434575">27</xref></sup> This would be a change of 10 points on the Motricity Index. Thus the trend in these results would not be clinically significant.</p>
<p>For the Action Research Arm Test there was a positive trend in favour of the conventional group at discharge from intervention, with a change of 3/57 points. At follow-up the virtual reality group had improved their performance on the Action Research Arm Test by 3/57 points. The minimum clinically important difference for the Action Research Arm Test is 6 points,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511434575">23</xref></sup> and likewise the results in the current study were not clinically significant.</p>
<p>Exit questionnaires from 4 of the 9 virtual reality group participants reported that movement of the more affected arm had improved and they could undertake some tasks that they had not been able to do previously (e.g. driving a car; opening kitchen cupboards). The virtual reality-based therapy appeared to have been acceptable to participants. Seven of the 9 in the standard therapy group said that the movement in their more affected arm had improved and 8 reported they could undertake some tasks that they had not been able to do previously.</p>
<p>Participants indicated their satisfaction with the conduct of the trial, with only one person in the virtual reality group stating they did not enjoy the experience. The majority of participants in both groups would have liked the therapy they received to have been part of their original rehabilitation programme. The virtual reality-based therapy appeared to have been acceptable to participants.</p>
<p>The current data were used to calculate numbers required to detect significant differences for impairment and activity scores between groups. For impairment using an estimated within-group SD of 25 points, an minimal clinically important difference between groups of 10 Motricity Index points, alpha of 0.05 and power 85%, a total of 21 participants would need to be recruited in a future trial. For activity using the same power and alpha level, an estimated within-group SD of 18 points, and a minimal clinically important difference between groups of 6 Action Research Arm Test points, a total of 29 participants would be needed. Therefore allowing for a 30% attrition rate it would be necessary to recruit a total of 78 participants (39 per group).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reports that conducting a randomized controlled trial of virtual reality-based therapy for the upper limb compared to conventional therapy is feasible; and is the only known randomized controlled trial to have been conducted in Ireland and the UK comparing these two treatments. The trial design and methodology were acceptable to participants, with minimal drop-out at the six-week follow-up (control 0%; experimental 10%).</p>
<p>Recruitment patterns were disappointing, although not unexpected given the nature of the sample. The pattern of recruitment to our study reflected patterns in other trials involving people with stroke. For example, our referral rate was 31%, similar to that of Stewart et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511434575">27</xref></sup> (38%) and slightly lower than that for Hill et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511434575">28</xref></sup> (48%). Another main reason for non-participation was the presence of comorbidity as an exclusion criteria (with 20% excluded on this basis). On reflection, it may have been possible to relax these criteria to include people with respiratory or cardiac problems. Revision of selection criteria for a future study would not exclude participants on the basis of comorbidity, apart from those with a cardiac pacemaker.</p>
<p>Another factor limiting recruitment was refusal to participate. Schulz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511434575">29</xref></sup> recognized that recruiting participants with chronic disabling conditions into research studies is a complex process. Unfortunately, 30% of people contacted did not specify a reason for their unwillingness to participate. It might be that this diagnostic group of participants would require longer than 24 hours to consider participation in this intervention involving computer technology, which may be unfamiliar to a predominately older age group. It might have been worth using a short video of a participant using the equipment as a reassurance for those who may have felt technologically naive.</p>
<p>Our study adds to the limited evidence base for virtual reality-based therapy for the upper limb, as indicated by two systematic reviews in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511434575">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511434575">9</xref></sup> This study has shown that it is feasible to conduct a main trial comparing virtual reality therapy to a well-designed conventional therapy programme for the upper limb following stroke. Although a previous trial has been reported which compared virtual reality to conventional care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511434575">14</xref></sup> it was unclear whether the conventional care followed best evidence and carefully controlled the dose between the two groups, as in this study. Two other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511434575">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511434575">12</xref></sup> have compared two forms of virtual reality and are therefore less relevant to the question of how virtual reality compares to current best evidence-based practice in stroke rehabilitation. It would be important for future studies to consider what the most appropriate form of control intervention might be, either an active control, such as conventional therapy, or a no intervention group.</p>
<p>In terms of our feasibility testing we identified an important aspect that would need to be addressed in a main trial. With the outcome measures we chose it was not feasible to show clinically important differences between each group, which suggests that the measures we used were not sensitive enough. It was disappointing not to have recruited participants with a wider range of disabilities, with most scoring towards the ceiling of both the Motricity Index and Action Research Arm Test at baseline. Although it was not the intent to exclude the more disabled participants (upper limb Motricity Index &lt;25/100) unfortunately the sample recruited tended to be the more mildly affected participant, with the majority scoring highly on both measures from baseline.</p>
<p>These particular measures were not sensitive enough to detect small to moderate changes with these higher functioning participants. At inception of this trial the literature strongly recommended the use of the Action Research Arm Test as an outcome measure for this population. It would have been useful to incorporate a timed measure (e.g. the Wolf Motor Function Test,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511434575">30</xref></sup> the Jebsen Hand Function Test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511434575">31</xref></sup> or the Nine Hole Peg Test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511434575">32</xref></sup>). The timed elements in these tests may be more likely to detect the level of change amongst the type of participants recruited to this trial.</p>
<p>Further limitations include the use of opaque envelopes following group allocation by a computer generated randomization table. This was conducted by an independent colleague outside of the research team. However, the use of opaque envelopes has been suggested to still be open to bias. In this study group allocation was verified post trial and was found to match the original randomized list. The outcome assessor was blind to group allocation and the research therapist delivering the intervention was blind to outcome scores. The outcome assessor conducted all participant screening and baseline scores and is another limitation of this study. In a main trial it would be advantageous to have separate individuals conduct these elements.</p>
<p>There may also have been some element of bias as the same therapist delivered both interventions, perhaps then favouring one intervention over the other. However, this potential weakness was counteracted by the video recording of a sample of six participants from the conventional group. This allowed an independent and experienced physiotherapist to monitor the content of these sessions and to verify that practice recorded did not vary from that which would be deemed equivalent to usual practice in stroke rehabilitation units in the UK.</p>
<p>A larger trial would require at least 39 participants in each arm in order to have the power to demonstrate statistically significant changes in both impairment and activity of the more affected upper limb. Using the same method of sample size calculation a similar number would be required when employing the Wolf Motor Function Test. In such a trial we would anticipate recruiting from multiple stroke units across Belfast. Although drop-out rate in this particular study was low, it would be more prudent to estimate for a drop-out of 30%.</p>
<p>Based on these preliminary results, with a small number of participants, it is not possible to definitively advocate virtual reality-mediated therapy over conventional therapy for the rehabilitation of the upper limb. The literature to date suggests that virtual reality-based therapy may be more appropriate for people following the acute phase post stroke. The length of virtual reality intervention period may have been insufficient to detect clinically significant changes. The three-week dose was determined from a review of the existing literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511434575">8</xref></sup> at the time of the study inception, which was inconclusive. The team in this case made a decision to use the mean length of exposure from the published studies reviewed. In addition, the study was based in a research clinic and there may be value in proposing to conduct a larger trial in a stroke unit or clinical outpatient setting.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial in this area, if careful consideration is given to the recruitment methods and outcome measures. Larger trials are needed to provide high-quality evidence for the specific effect of virtual reality-mediated therapy in upper limb stroke rehabilitation. It may be that there are advantages over conventional therapy for people with stroke-related disabilities, in terms of improving the level of motor impairment or activity. Its value may lie in providing an alternative method of therapy delivery and potentially a useful source of additional practice, particularly after the subacute phase, when people tend to have limited access to further rehabilitation.</p>
