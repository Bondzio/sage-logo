<abstract>
<p>The National End-of-life Care Strategy for England identifies that a lack of open discussion about death and dying can be a barrier to achieving good quality end-of-life care. South Asians constitute the single largest ethnic minority group in the United Kingdom, yet little is known about their attitudes and expectations towards the discussion of death and dying. In this study, set in East London, five focus groups and 29 in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a total of 55 older adults aged between 52 and 78 years. Participants from six South Asian ethnic groups were recruited from 11 local community organisations. A constructivist grounded theory approach was used to analyse the data. Findings revealed two key themes which capture the perspectives of older South Asian study participants towards end-of-life care discussions. The theme ‘avoidance as a cultural norm’ relates to the relative absence of discussions around death and dying experienced by participants. Participants neither expected to have discussions about their own death and dying within their family, nor to assume any involvement in decision-making. The second theme ‘avoidance as protection’ relates to beliefs and experiences about the delegation of decision-making to family members. Future research should explore the perspectives of second-generation adult children towards end-of-life care discussions.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987113490712" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The National End-of-life Care Strategy for England identifies ‘the lack of open discussion between health and social care staff and those approaching the end of life and those who care for them, as one of the key barriers to the delivery of good end of life care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987113490712">Department of Health, 2008</xref>: 50). There is some evidence that lack of discussion may result in patients receiving end of life care which is out of step with their wishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987113490712">Cohen-Gogo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1744987113490712">Wright et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, the concept of advance care planning (ACP) has been introduced, which means a ‘voluntary process of discussion and review to help an individual who has capacity to anticipate how their condition may affect them in the future and, if they wish, set on record choices about their care and treatment … in the event that they lose capacity to decide once their illness progresses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987113490712">Department of Health, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent evidence about the outcomes of ACP shows that it can help to avoid unwanted hospitalisation and achieve better end-of-life care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987113490712">Detering, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1744987113490712">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). ACP is dependent upon the willingness of patients, family carers and staff to talk about difficult subjects. However, evidence suggests that end-of-life care discussions between patients, carers and professionals remain uncommon and very little is known about the initiation, timing, nature and quality of such discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987113490712">Almack et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987113490712">Momen et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987113490712">Almack et al. (2012)</xref> have shown that both patients and health professionals tend to wait for the other to initiate conversations and that this can result in missed opportunities.</p>
<p>Health professionals providing care in multicultural environments have been shown to experience several dilemmas, such as ambivalence, ignorance or uncertainties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987113490712">Gunaratnam, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1744987113490712">Vydelingum, 2006</xref>) due to their lack of cross-cultural end-of-life care knowledge and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987113490712">Diver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1744987113490712">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>). In such situations, health professionals may adopt a ‘culturally distant position’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1744987113490712">Randhawa and Owens, 2004</xref>). In palliative care contexts when working with people of an unfamiliar culture and background, this stance may hinder their ability and confidence in initiating end-of-life care discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987113490712">Diver et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1744987113490712">Owens and Randhawa, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1744987113490712">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec2-1744987113490712"><title>Background</title>
<p>Asians, primarily South Asians, constitute the single largest ethnic minority group in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744987113490712">ONS, 2012</xref>). Most of the older South Asians living in the UK are first generation immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987113490712">Ballard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987113490712">Hatton, 2005</xref>). Although there are traces of acculturation in such communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987113490712">Gilbert and Khokhar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987113490712">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1744987113490712">Robinson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1744987113490712">Smith, 2000</xref>), older South Asians may prefer to retain or refer to their original cultural beliefs when faced with critical life events such as death and bereavement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1744987113490712">Spruyt, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987113490712">Blakemore (2000)</xref> highlights that growing older in a ‘foreign country’ is associated with multiple social disadvantages such as poverty, inadequate health care and poor housing; these may render immigrants ‘vulnerable’ members of society. This may lead them to either hide or fail to disclose their wishes and preferences for care, or lead them to push themselves to learn to live in an ‘ethnocentric society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1744987113490712">Vydelingum, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Research demonstrates that older people from ethnic minorities tend to under-use available palliative and end-of-life care services (Ahmed et al., 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987113490712">Jones, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987113490712">NCHSPCS, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1744987113490712">Worth et al., 2009</xref>). Some argue that there is a lack of ‘cultural transferability’ in existing Western palliative service models which may make them unacceptable to some non-western people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987113490712">Gunaratnam, 2001</xref>). In addition to this, language barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987113490712">Diver et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987113490712">Jack et al., 2001</xref>) may be a barrier to access to reliable information about end-of-life care services, such as hospice and cancer care facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987113490712">Elkan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1744987113490712">Randhawa and Owens, 2004</xref>). This may significantly impede awareness and uptake of palliative care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987113490712">Gaffin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987113490712">Jones, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987113490712">NCHSPCS, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1744987113490712">PRIAE, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1744987113490712">Smaje and Field, 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987113490712"><title>Study purpose</title>
<p>This paper reports one aspect of a larger study and focuses on the perspectives of older South Asians living in East London towards talking about death and dying. Existing research has already explored the views of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1744987113490712">Samsi and Manthorpe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1744987113490712">Singer et al., 1998</xref>) and different health care professionals on end-of-life care discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1744987113490712">Seymour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1744987113490712">Taubert and Nelson, 2010</xref>). Although there are policy and legal directives aimed at embedding discussion about end-of-life care within routine clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987113490712">Department of Health, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987113490712">2010</xref>), concerns about initiating end-of-life conversations with ethnic minorities remain under-explored. This paper seeks to extend the very limited evidence regarding initiation of end-of-life care conversations among older South Asian ethnic minorities living in East London.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1744987113490712" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This study adopted a constructivist grounded theory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987113490712">Charmaz, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987113490712">2000</xref>). According to this methodological orientation, our social world consists of ‘multiple realities’ that can be elicited by obtaining views of people and their common shared beliefs about social events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987113490712">Charmaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987113490712">Mills et al., 2006</xref>). The application of grounded theory in palliative and end-of-life care research has been used to discover the main concerns of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987113490712">Elgan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987113490712">Kylma et al., 2001</xref>), families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987113490712">Carter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987113490712">Holtslander and Duggleby, 2008</xref>), health professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1744987113490712">Verpoort et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1744987113490712">Willard and Luker, 2006</xref>) and the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744987113490712">Payne et al., 2008</xref>). The adoption of a grounded theory approach in this study has been used to: (a) explore little known topic areas; (b) elicit experiences and preferences and (c) challenge existing or develop new theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987113490712">Payne, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec5-1744987113490712"><title>Recruitment</title>
<p>We recruited older South Asians to the study through local community organisations based in the East London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney or Newham. Members of these organisations were eligible to participate if they self-classified as being of South Asian ethnicity; were aged 50 years or over; could speak Tamil, Malaylam, Telugu, Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati, Bengali or English; were able to give written and informed consent and had not been bereaved in the previous six months.</p>
<p>Following discussion with community organisation leaders, open meetings were conducted to inform members of the nature and purpose of the study. Interested individuals were able to seek further information from MV. Community leaders publicised the study by displaying posters and giving study invitation letters to their members, which included a card to return to indicate their interest to participate. MV approached potential participants to determine whether they met the study inclusion criteria. For those who did meet the criteria, and remained interested in participating, an information sheet was provided and explained and written consent requested.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987113490712"><title>Fieldwork</title>
<p>Five focus groups were conducted with a minimum of six and a maximum of 12 participants. Participants were allocated to focus groups on the basis of their ethnicity. Men and women were interviewed in separate groups. Four groups were conducted in community halls and one in a participant’s home, at the request of group members. Four focus groups were facilitated by MV in the preferred language (Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi and English) of the participants. An interpreter assisted MV in facilitating one focus group of Bengali speakers. In most cases, participants used a mixture of their own language and English. The focus groups lasted between 44 and 90 minutes. Focus groups were used to access and explore people’s experiences, expectations and beliefs about end-of-life care in their own terms and to generate data to inform the subsequent interview phase of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987113490712">Kuo and Fagan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987113490712">Merrell et al., 2006</xref>). A preliminary aide memoire guided the discussions that included experiences of, and thoughts about, end of life and end-of-life care. Focus groups usually started by attempting to build a rapport with the participants by talking about their life history, country, cultural festivals, local temples and religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1744987113490712">Seymour et al., 2002</xref>). In turn, this enabled a transition into a discussion of more sensitive topics, including the experience of growing older in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Individual interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 29) were conducted, depending on the participant’s wishes, in their own home, in the home of a family member, or in the community group from which they were recruited. Interviews were conducted in the participant’s preferred language (Tamil, Malayalam or English). The interview aide memoire was refined on the basis of the findings of the earlier focus groups (providing end-of-life care at home, caring for dying relatives, the importance of gender in end-of-life care, end-of-life care discussions and decision-making). Recruitment was discontinued once three consecutive interviews raised issues which were similar to those elicited in earlier interviews, i.e. theoretical saturation was achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987113490712">Charmaz, 2006</xref>). As there was a risk that discussion about late life, end-of-life and loss could be upsetting to participants, they were all given information about how to access bereavement support services. Ethical committee approval was gained prior to the start of the study (Camden &amp; Islington Community Local Research Ethics Committee, London: 08/H0722/10).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987113490712"><title>Data management and analysis</title>
<p>Data confidentiality was preserved by giving unique pseudonyms for each participant, which was used throughout the study to prevent individuals being recognised in the research documents. The audiotapes were initially transcribed into the languages spoken by participants and then into English. To enhance accuracy of the transcription process, the transcripts were verified by a second translator and also checked against field notes taken at the time of data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1744987113490712">Twinn, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Data analysis conformed to the set of flexible principles and practices described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987113490712">Charmaz (2006)</xref>, which involved three steps. The first step was constructing initial codes by using line-by-line coding in Nvivo version 8. This resulted in identification of 627 initial codes. The second step involved grouping the initial codes into 14 themes, which were then reduced into six sub-categories. Finally, the six sub-categories were reduced into three categories and then into one core category in the hierarchal structure. MV and his supervisors (AA and JS) met at frequent intervals to discuss and agree the development of the analysis. This paper reports the category the ‘meaning of end-of-life care discussions’.</p>

<p>In this study, many participants reported that they were not used to discussing death and dying or aspects of decision-making, either for themselves or for others. Our data analysis revealed two themes relating to ‘avoidance’ which together help to explain the relative absence of discussions around death and dying reported by participants: ‘avoidance as a cultural norm’ and ‘avoidance as protection’.</p>
<sec id="sec9-1744987113490712"><title>Theme 1. Avoidance as a cultural norm</title>
<p>There was a clear absence of experiences of discussions related to death and dying among the older South Asians who took part in this study. This included participants who were quite willing to express in the interview context some end-of-life care preferences. However, these individuals reported that it would be ‘highly unusual’ in their community to have discussions about such issues or to make any future plans and decisions concerning death and dying:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Yes, discussing and planning would be fantastic. But there is hardly any such planning in my community. We don’t plan for death. Today, it is highly unusual for me to be talking about death</italic> (Kamruz, Bangladeshi male aged 58)<italic>.</italic></p></disp-quote>Living as part of an extended family was claimed as a rationale for a common perception that it was unnecessary to have discussions about death and dying. Many believed that their family would ‘know what to do’ and would do what they could for them when it was their time to face death and dying. Moreover, it was clearly indicated by some that pre-planning is unnecessary, since any decisions will depend on ‘family circumstances’:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>No I never thought of discussing my death. Because the reason is, it all depends on their circumstances. My family lives with me, and according to them, they know what to do. They will do what they can</italic> (Prakash, Gujarati male aged 76).</p></disp-quote>Participants described various beliefs with regard to discussing death and dying, including waiting until the end of one’s life to discuss such things, the uncertain nature of death and family preferences for not engaging in any decision-making discussions. In addition, participants reported how they expected that discussing death and dying would bring illness and death forward. Importantly, some described how their family had asked them not to ‘think about it yet’, perhaps when they had attempted to discuss it. Those participants who had experienced this communicated that they perceived that such family restrictions were helpful to them in the sense that they avoided causing distress and helped them to keep a positive attitude:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>MV: You said that you want to be kept at home when you are dying. Did you ever think at any time if such decisions needed to be discussed with someone?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Kanjana: When the time comes, I will. My daughter told me that I shouldn’t think about it yet. When you start thinking about it, you get very sick. We don’t know when, or what will happen to us</italic> (Kanjana, Bangladeshi woman aged 58).</p></disp-quote>Others argued that positive thinking in late life (with the hope of living longer) might act as a barrier to thinking about one’s own death and dying. They claimed that initiating discussions and making decisions usually takes place within the family when the health of older individuals deteriorates towards the final stages of their life. Interestingly, some acknowledged their own preferences in relation to the last days of their life, which included their preference of dying in hospital and the use of life-prolonging treatments. However, until a ‘ripened stage’, there was a preference not to hold discussions with the family:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>MV: So, did you inform your son that you have plans concerning the end of your life?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Ramalingam: I have not reached that stage yet. Because I feel, I will be living for more years. In that ripened stage, I will discuss these types of things with my son. So that stage has not yet arisen</italic> (Ramalingam, Sri Lankan Tamil male aged 78).</p></disp-quote>Similar to this participant, most in this study highlighted that not only the culture of avoiding discussion, but also a tendency not to accept death even in old age would also impede such discussions. Others refused to talk about death in their interview demonstrating this. They described instead how they trusted their children to ‘carry out everything’ for them:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>MV: Could you tell me why you do not like to talk about such topics?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Neela: I think you don’t want to die. You know (laughs) you don’t want to die, or even think about it.</italic></p>
<p><italic>MV: If not, what will happen?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Neela: My children will carry out everything for me.</italic></p>
<p><italic>MV: Is it belief or expectations?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Neela: It is trust</italic> (Neela, Indian Malayalee woman aged 74).</p></disp-quote>Other participants stated that generally children in South Asian families would avoid discussing death and dying, or involving older relatives in any such discussions. They said that the family would come forward to take responsibility and make any necessary decisions on behalf of their older relatives, and thus shelter their older relatives from topics perceived to be unpleasant:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I don’t think people ask where you die. I think the family makes that decision</italic> (Simrita, Punjabi woman aged 72).</p></disp-quote>A few participants reported that although they would trust children as decision makers, they expected these decisions to be based on their preferences, which they would share with their children when they became terminally ill:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>MV: Have you spoken these decisions to anyone?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Malar: No. I never spoke [laughs]. I used to keep it in my heart. I did not tell my daughter. Yesterday, I gave some money to them and told them to keep the money, and if anything happens to me, they should use that money.</italic></p>
<p><italic>MV: So, you made some decisions?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Malar: No. I did not. I have my children with me to decide. When the stage comes, I will tell them about my preferences. When I go to their house, I will tell them that I want to go back to India and die, like my husband</italic> (Malar, Indian Malayalee woman aged 68).</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec10-1744987113490712"><title>Theme 2. Avoidance as protection</title>
<p>Our data analysis also revealed that another barrier to discussions about death and dying was the perception among participants that such discussions would upset family members. In turn, participants reported how their families would try to protect them from the perceived adverse effects of discussing death and the end of life. In addition, some participants reported that discussion was also hindered because of language barriers.</p>
<p>Participants indicated that discussions around death and dying with their family were difficult to initiate. Some reported that they had had opportunities to discuss with their family members; however, they said that their family refused to discuss these issues with them and encouraged them to think positively:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>MV: What discussion did you have about this?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Baseema: I haven’t yet decided [she laughs].</italic></p>
<p><italic>MV: So you haven’t had any discussion with anybody?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Baseema: No. I try to talk to my son. But he does not like to discuss these things. He says that you have only turned sixty. He is soft and he is a completely different type of child. He doesn’t want to discuss things related to death. He doesn’t even want to listen</italic> (Baseema, Bangladeshi woman aged 64).</p></disp-quote>Some took a positive stance towards the idea of planning and talking about end-of-life issues but said that they could not discuss any issues that could impact on the occurrence of any auspicious or religious events at home. This reflected a culture in which talking about death and dying is a taboo subject within the family and customs in South Asian culture whereby people would prefer not to use words related to death and dying at home:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>MV: You said you didn’t want to discuss your preferences about the final stages of your life. Could you tell me what stopped you thinking that way?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Archana: I don’t know when I am going to die. Whether I will be here or in India at the time? Yes. It is good to plan these things, but it would be better to start planning now, although it may not be a good plan in the future. But I don't want to discuss anything now.</italic></p>
<p><italic>MV: OK?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Archana: Yes, because, my daughter is getting married this year. So I don't want to upset her</italic> (Archana, Gujarati women aged 74).</p></disp-quote>Some participants argued that early discussions within their family would be unproductive, as their children would refuse to listen if they initiated any discussion about their death and dying. They said that instead they preferred to discuss these issues with their friends or people in their age group who had similar concerns:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Rajendran: May be another person of my same age, with the same concerns might be more suitable to discuss these things with. See for example, if I go and tell my son that I am talking about the end of my life, they ask me if I don’t have anything else to do? That is the answer.</italic></p>
<p><italic>MV: So you don’t discuss anything with your family then?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Rajendran: No. They’re not interested. They won’t want to. They see me the way I am, and won’t understand why I’m thinking about things that haven’t happened yet. Do you understand what I am saying? The thinking stage will come in its own time. But the companion of similar this one will be good.</italic></p>
<p><italic>MV: Have you ever discussed anything?</italic></p>
<p><italic>Rajendran: No. we always thought think positively, not negatively</italic> (Rajendran, Indian Malayalee man 65).</p></disp-quote>In contrast, some participants claimed that practical difficulties were the reasons for avoidance. They reported that language difficulties prevented them from being involved in any discussions or decisions with doctors about end-of-life care when their loved ones were ill. They assumed instead that the doctors had discussed with their children any decisions that needed to be made during the last days of their loved one’s life:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>No he did not say anything to me or my husband. But, because he too was not able to speak English, the doctors might have been able to discuss this with my children. But they did not tell us because we felt very bad. But from the way they spoke and their faces, I was able to understand that my husband was serious. But he did not know what the doctor said</italic> (Chitra, Indian Malayalee woman aged 67).</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec11-1744987113490712" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study sought to examine the attitudes and beliefs expressed by older south Asians towards the discussion of end-of-life care issues. Initiating or being involved in any end-of-life discussions within their family was neither expected, nor was any involvement in decision-making assumed by the study participants. Instead, they placed trust in their families to discuss their needs with health care professionals when the time comes, and take any decisions required on their behalf. The findings of this study are consistent with existing literature that has reported limited open discussion of death and dying among South Asian Sikh and Muslim patients with life-limiting illness in Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1744987113490712">Worth et al., 2009</xref>). More generally, a National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987113490712">Dying Matters Coalition, 2009</xref>) reported a decreasing trend of public engagement in end-of-life discussions in the UK, with less than one-third of people (29%) compared to 34% in 2006, reporting some sort of end-of-life discussions either with their family or friends.</p>
<p>One of the reasons reported by the participants in this study for avoidance of discussion was their preconceptions concerning death and dying. For example, they reported a belief that thinking about death and dying would bring death closer to them and was thus an inauspicious topic for discussion. Similar beliefs have also been reported among Muslim participants in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1744987113490712">Rashid and Sheikh, 2002</xref>), while in a survey of ethnically diverse people aged over 65 years, ethnic minority elders were more likely than white elders to express extreme fears about death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987113490712">Bowling et al., 2010</xref>). This finding about ‘fear’ was echoed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1744987113490712">Worth et al. (2009)</xref> in their study of South Asian Sikhs and Muslims living in Scotland.</p>
<p>In this study, participants also reported that they believed younger family members wanted to protect them from engaging in conversation about subjects perceived to be distressing. Participants reported that their family would encourage them to focus on what were considered more positive aspects of life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1744987113490712">Worth et al. (2009)</xref> also reported that such resistance was a manifestation of common coping mechanisms to avoid feeling negative, by using positive thinking, denial and humour techniques.</p>
<p>This study finding suggests that there is some ambiguity about the role of family in contributing to the avoidance of end-of-life care discussions among members of South Asian ethnic minority groups. While some participants expressed their preference to have discussions with their family and perceived that their family members are to be the final decision-makers, others reported that such end-of-life discussions with their family members remain culturally inappropriate. This is in contrast to previous studies, which reported that people tend to prefer to discuss any issues related to end-of-life with family members rather than with health professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987113490712">Kahana et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987113490712">McDonald et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1744987113490712">Salmond and David, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings also highlight that preferences towards the discussion of death related issues are dynamic and are likely to depend on the family circumstances. A review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1744987113490712">Cox et al. (2013)</xref> has highlighted that public attitudes towards death, dying and bereavement are highly contextual, contradictory and shift according to the circumstances and past experiences. In the study reported here, participants seemed to use the interviews and focus groups to construct and reconstruct their perspectives and beliefs about death and dying, through narration of their past experiences and through consideration of their current living conditions.</p>
<sec id="sec12-1744987113490712"><title>Methodological limitations</title>
<p>Exploring such a sensitive topic by a relatively inexperienced qualitative interviewer was a crucial limitation of the study. Our initial inclusion criteria were broad, to include any older South Asian residents in the selected boroughs of East London; this study attracted some people with dominant voices in those communities. This may have influenced the quality and richness of the data. The ethnic subgroup identity of the interviewer (MV) could potentially have influenced the way the participants responded. As MV comes from a particular South Asian ethnic subgroup, we observed that some participants from other South Asian subgroups distanced themselves from him. Such distance was evident both in the level of involvement and depth of information that was given during the interview. The interviewer, being younger than the participants, may have inhibited respondents in their ability to freely discuss sensitive subjects in the interviews and focus groups. In addition, gender was another factor important in considering the process by which our data were generated. Being male, MV felt some women participants were reticent during the interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1744987113490712"><title>Implications for clinical practice</title>
<p>Some evidence is available about the issues faced by health professionals responsible for caring for older South Asian people in hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1744987113490712">Vydelingum, 2000</xref>) and in palliative care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987113490712">Gunaratnam, 2001</xref>). The findings from the study reported here provide insights into issues of relevance when caring for older South Asians at the end of their lives. Practitioners need to consider a number of factors when engaging in end-of-life discussions with older South Asian people. Although the willingness to discuss such matters should not be assumed, equally the opportunity for discussion should not be denied to this group. Therefore initiating such discussion will require great sensitivity and tact. Family structures may be complex and hierarchical and the involvement of the family in discussions needs to be negotiated with the individual in order to maximise support without losing sight of the older person themselves. The expectations of individuals about end-of-life care may not always align with those of their families or practitioners. These need to be gently explored to avoid potential conflicts. Availability of, and access to, end-of-life services may need to be explained carefully.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1744987113490712" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As in many cultures, older South Asian ethnic minorities in our study preferred to avoid any discussions around death and dying, mainly because they place trust in their family members to hold such discussions and make decisions on their behalf. Furthermore, as this study is based on the reports of attitudes towards end-of-life care discussions, further research is needed to observe end-life-care discussions in ‘action’ among these ethnic minorities. In addition, since the study shows the importance to older people of their adult childrens' involvement in their end-of-life care, further exploration of attitudes of second generation children towards end-of-life care discussions in South Asian communities is needed.</p>
