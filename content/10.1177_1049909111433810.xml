<abstract>
<p>This was a prospective descriptive study of hospice physician home visits (HVs) conducted by Hospice and Palliative Medicine Fellows. Our objectives were 1) to improve our knowledge of hospice care at home by describing physician HVs 2) to identify the indications for physician HVs and the problems addressed during the HV. Data was collected on 58 consecutive patients using a standardized form completed before and after the home visit. More than half of the persons were women. Most were Caucasian. Median age was 75 years; 57% had cancer; 77% were do-not-resuscitate. 76% HV occurred in the home. The median visit duration was 60 minutes; median travel distance and time 25 miles and 42 minutes, respectively. A hospice nurse case manager was present in 95%. The most common issues addressed during HVs were: health education, symptom management, and psychosocial support. Medication review was prominent. Physicians identified previously unreported issues. Symptom control was usually pain, although 27 symptoms were identified. Medications were important; all home visits included drug review and two thirds drug change. Physicians had unique responsibilities and identified important issues in the HV. Physicians provided both education and symptom management. Physician HVs are an important intervention. HVs were important in continuity of care, however, time-consuming, and incurred considerable travel, and professional time and costs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hospice is a holistic interdisciplinary approach to care in terminal illness. In 2009, an estimated 1.6 million patients received services from hospice in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111433810">1</xref>
</sup> This estimate includes 1 million patients who died under hospice care. Most hospice care in the United States is provided at home<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111433810">2</xref>
</sup> but may also be provided in hospice inpatient centers, nursing homes, and other long-term care facilities where the patient normally resides. Home visits (HVs) are particularly important in hospice and palliative care to provide continuity of care and psychosocial support for patients and their caregivers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111433810">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The hospice interdisciplinary team (IDT) ideally offers an individualized care plan to address the medical and psychosocial needs of the patients and their caregivers. The IDT typically comprises a hospice physician, hospice medical director, nurse case manager, social worker, home health aide, and chaplain/spiritual care counselor. The patient and family form a plan of care along with the IDT. The IDT meets regularly to create and update the plan of care. The hospice physician and hospice medical director oversee the plan of care delivered by the nurse case manager.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111433810">4</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111433810">5</xref>
</sup> The hospice team who work with the patient’s physician should make regular HVs to assure adequate care and the best quality of life (QoL). The physician role in hospice includes symptom management, health education of patient and caregivers, and the hospice team, certification of terminal illness, participation in IDT meetings, and HVs. A physician HV is typically on an as-needed basis. Follow-up HVs may be indicated for acute problems or deterioration in clinical status.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111433810">6</xref>
</sup> A hospice physician HV can change the plan of care and might prevent unwanted or inappropriate hospitalization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111433810">7</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111433810">8</xref>
</sup> Home visits are also associated with an increased likelihood of dying at home, as opposed to a hospital.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111433810">9</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111433810">10</xref>
</sup> As a result, HV reduce medical service consumption and costs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111433810">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111433810"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111433810"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111433810">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Some residencies and fellowship programs have established HV or long-term care rotations as a part of their curriculum.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111433810">14</xref>
</sup> For example, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) required hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) fellows to participate in a minimum number of 25 HVs during their 1-year clinical training.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111433810">15</xref>
</sup> As members of the IDT, fellows are expected to share their knowledge and expertise on health problems during IDT meetings and HVs. A previous retrospective chart review of our hospice population used a case study approach to evaluate hospice physicians’ HV effectiveness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111433810">3</xref>
</sup> This study provided preliminary evidence of the activities and learning experiences of a hospice physician fellow. The objectives of this current study were to describe the clinical features of hospice physicians’ HVs and explore its role in continuity of care. It was hoped to improve our knowledge of hospice care at home and assist future planning and implementation of hospice physician HVs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049909111433810" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a prospective study of consecutive hospice physician HVs made by HPM fellows in 2 consecutive academic years. The study was conducted by an academic hospital palliative medicine program which includes the Medicare-certified Hospice of the Cleveland Clinic. This hospice serves rural and suburban populations with a daily average census of 180 to 200 individuals. As there were no patient identifiers on the data collection form, a waiver of informed consent was obtained from the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>All persons who received as a physician HV were enrolled in Hospice of the Cleveland Clinic. The minimum requirement for inclusion in the study was completion of the data recording form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049909111433810">Figure 1</xref>). There were no refusals. Assessments were made only in the first physician HV. Follow-up visits were excluded. The need for a physician HV was identified by the hospice medical director, Cleveland Clinic palliative medicine physician, primary care or community physician, hospice nurse case manager, patient, or family member. The HPM fellow was notified to conduct a HV by communication with the IDT. From February 1, 2009 to June 30, 2009, 3 HPM fellows completed the data recording form on 18, 7, and 5 patients each. After the interim analysis of these first 30 eligible HVs, some data recording form items were revised to ease the data collection process. These included extent of disease, medication review, HV indications, and travel time and distance. An education session on data completion was conducted for all the HPM fellows in the following academic year to achieve consistency between data collectors. From July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, 4 more HPM fellows completed the forms on 16, 4, 4, and 4 patients each.</p>

</fig>
<p>A standard data recording form was developed empirically in our research meetings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049909111433810">Figure 1</xref>). Before the visit, the demographic data, diagnosis, code status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) graded as 0 to 4, and reasons for HV were documented. After the visit, physician fellows recorded the problems addressed during the visit, estimate of prognosis, medication changes, travel time and distance, and their personal opinions about whether the HV was necessary and/or helpful. Estimated prognosis was subjective. Physicians used the electronic medical records or charts, patient or caregiver interview, and physical examination to complete the data recording forms. MapQuest (MapQuest, Inc, Denver, Colorado; 1996), a Web-based map system, was used to define the 1-way travel distance and time for each HV.</p>
<p>Study data were collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) tools (REDCap, Version 3.5.4, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee; 2011) hosted at the Cleveland Clinic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909111433810">16</xref>
</sup> REDCap is a secure, Web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies. The results were analyzed with JMP statistical software (JMP, Version 7. SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina; 1989-2007). Data were then extracted into descriptive tables. Continuous variables were summarized as median and range, and categorical variables as percentages. All percentages were rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049909111433810">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Sixty HVs were conducted. Two follow-up visits were excluded. Data recording forms were complete with the exception of diagnosis (n = 1), code status (n = 5), and extent of disease (n = 33). Patient demographic characteristics are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049909111433810">Table 1</xref>. More than half of the HV individuals were women. Most were caucasian. The median age was 75 years (range 60-86). Nearly two thirds (67%) of the persons were 65 years of age or older; one third of all were 85 years of age or older. All were in various stages of terminal illness. Most (two thirds) of the persons had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status (PS) of 3 or 4. In the great majority, estimated prognosis ranged from weeks to months and with a code status of do-not-resuscitate (DNR). Two thirds had a cancer diagnosis which was representative of the Hospice of Cleveland Clinic population. Cancer and noncancer diagnoses are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049909111433810">Table 2</xref>. The commonest cancer primary site was lung. Multiple metastases were common. Chronic debility and end-stage dementia were the most common noncancer diagnoses.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049909111433810">Table 3</xref> describes the HV characteristics. Most HVs were in the patient home. The remainder occurred at an alternative living facility, including nursing homes, assisted living, and residential hospice units. Most HVs were requested by a hospice nurse case manager, followed by patients themselves or their families. A hospice nurse case manager was present during all HVs, except for 3 HVs. The hospice attending physician, social worker, home health aid, and chaplain (spiritual care counselor) were also present during 9, 6, 2, and 1 visits, respectively. The median visit time was 60 minutes (range 20-120). The median travel distance and time were 25 miles (range 5-80) and 42 minutes (range 10-120). Five HVs were designated as urgent, that is defined need for a same day visit. During the HVs, 4 recertification visits turned out to be a same day visit, because all cases required medication adjustment and prescriptions. Five HVs resulted in admission to either an inpatient hospice unit or a hospital with hospice.</p>

<p>The common reasons for physician HV requests were health education (69%), psychosocial support (31%), and symptom management (28%), see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1049909111433810">Table 4</xref>. Multiple reasons for 1 visit were recorded. Family meetings were coordinated by the hospice social worker prior to HVs primarily to discuss the goals of care and prognosis. The specific areas of education identified both before the HV and accomplished during HV are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1049909111433810">Table 4</xref>. Symptom assessment was provided by the following: patient (57%), caregivers (26%), and caregiver assisted (17%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1049909111433810">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1049909111433810">6</xref> report the specific symptom/symptoms and sign/signs identified before HVs and addressed during HVs, respectively. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1049909111433810">Table 7</xref> lists the components of a HV intervention. Medication was reviewed in all instances (except for 2 HVs) and changed in two thirds. Family emotional support and discussions about goals of care also featured prominently during HVs. The median number of symptoms identified before HVs and identified and managed during HVs were 3 (range 0-22) and 4 (range 1-28), respectively. A median of 1 (range 0-3) problem was identified before HVs and 1.5 (range 1-3) afterwards. After the HVs, 42 (72%) HVs were deemed medically necessary by the HPM fellows and 53 (91%) helpful to the patient and/or family.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of studies have described physician HV programs to provide care to homebound frail older adults or multiple chronic diseases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111433810">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909111433810">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049909111433810"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049909111433810">19</xref>
</sup> These studies from various settings indicated that they enhanced the quality of care and patient/caregiver satisfaction. There is little in the medical literature that describes physician–patient encounters in hospice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111433810">3</xref>
</sup> This pilot study identified some of the indications for a hospice physician HV and described HV characteristics in the United States.</p>
<p>Our findings support the importance of the physician’s role in hospice care. Physicians provided not only symptom management but also education. Education about symptom pathophysiology and disease progression usually entailed discussion about the natural history of the primary disease process. Most frequently encountered diseases included cancers, end-stage heart and lung disease, severe neurological disorders, and organ failure. The education about medication focused on rationale, correct administration, and therapeutic compliance. Both patient and caregiver education were frequently needed. A study reported that caregivers who received a physician HV were further empowered in their role, and better informed about the medical condition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049909111433810">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our data suggested that most physician HVs identified previously unreported patient and caregiver needs. Physicians spent their time addressing issues which might not be relevant to the initial HV request, but were of great concern to the patients and their caregivers. Physicians identified a median of 4 symptoms and 1.5 signs or clinical problems to address during the HVs. Symptom management was dominated by pain, although 21 disparate symptoms were identified across our study population. Treatment plans and medication management were a central part of the physician HV; except for 2 HVs all included a medication review. It is noteworthy that most (two thirds) HVs resulted in medication changes which also confirmed our previous report.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111433810">3</xref>
</sup> We concluded that physician HV provided opportunities for medication revision and symptom education. It would be useful to compare the type and the number of drugs affected by dose and route changes before and after a physician HV.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049909111433810">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Most HVs addressed the multidimensional nature of home hospice care. One out of every 5 HVs was conducted as a family meeting. The hospice social worker was present during only some HVs. This is noteworthy, given the prominent role that psychosocial issues and family concerns played in both the HV reason and issues managed. Although not present during most physician HVs, social workers are an integral part of hospice team. A physician HV would likely often be enhanced by inclusion of a social worker. A quality improvement project for home care practice in hospice should address these issues.</p>
<p>Although there is no prior literature, our study confirmed what most hospice physicians already know: HVs are time consuming. They are longer than a typical office visit to a primary care provider. The visit time ranged from 20 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes). This is consistent with published data about a hospice nurse’s average visit time of 60 to 80 minutes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049909111433810">21</xref>
</sup> Not only are HVs time consuming, but there is also considerable additional travel time and inherent cost. Medicare reimbursement for hospice home care does not cover the travel expenses. Only 5 HVs resulted in admission. There was consistent evidence to support reduced visits to emergency department and shorter hospital length of stay among people receiving hospice care at home.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111433810">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111433810">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111433810">12</xref>
</sup> It would be of interest to also study whether physician’s assessment and management in the home affected these clinical end economic outcomes. Physicians also identified extra needed home services. For example, during several HVs home safety evaluations were performed to facilitate ambulation and prevent falls.</p>
<p>Home visits are an important formal educational component of a Hospice and Palliative Medicine Fellowship.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111433810">15</xref>
</sup> Home visits support the continuity of care with all other palliative care clinical settings. The fellow is expected to be competent in the medical direction of an appropriate plan of care. Education of family members on health problems and prognosis is an important educational activity for the fellow. Our post-visit physician survey confirmed general agreement with the visit requestors (most of whom were hospice nurses), about the medical necessity and appropriateness of the HVs. All the physicians believed the reasons for HVs were relevant to hospice home care practice. Most were deemed helpful to optimum patient care and family support.</p>
<p>There were some weaknesses with our study. The study used a cross-sectional design, although the data were collected from consecutive HVs. Data collection included 6 physicians, but 2 completed 50% of the data recording forms. Despite efforts to ensure consistency, there was likely some variability in physician interpretation of questions. Furthermore, some clinical terms used were ambiguous, like “disease progression” and “psychosocial issues.” There were 5 missing data points with regard to code status. The great majority of these patients were DNR, as expected. Extent of disease was often incomplete for 3 reasons:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>many hospice patients with cancer diagnoses had not been formally investigated for some time.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>symptoms and PS were considered to be more predictive of prognosis by our physicians.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>many patients did not have a cancer diagnosis.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The study population was representative of our Cleveland Clinic Hospice census. Unlike many community-based hospice programs, ours is integrated with a cancer institute which skewed our study population to cancer diagnoses. The findings, therefore, should not be generalized to other hospice settings. In future research, it would be interesting to know the source of patient referrals; community, hospital acute palliative medicine unit, cancer center, and so on. Previous involvement with a palliative care specialist, either in- or outpatient, may also influence whether a patient will receive a physician HV at a later date. Our data revealed that the need for a physician HV was often identified by the hospice nurse case manager. Palliative care nurses could also assess and facilitate referrals.</p>
<p>Our data suggested that physician HVs are an important hospice intervention. Physicians who worked as part of the interdisciplinary hospice team have unique responsibilities and roles and identified important issues on HVs. Specific expertise in home hospice care is necessary for physicians so that they can fully assist with plan of care and address unreported needs. Identification of the elements of an effective hospice physician HV and appropriate team members present during HV could improve the delivery of care. The HPM Fellowship programs should formulate a standard HV protocol to improve physician training. Future research should also evaluate the impact of physician HVs on clinical and economic outcomes and examine the cost-effectiveness of this model of care.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Little is known about the physician’s role in a hospice home care setting. This study represented an important first step to describe hospice physician HVs. The physicians functioned skills as a member of the Interdisciplinary Hospice Team. Physician HVs identified previously unreported clinical issues. These resulted in symptom management, education, and psychosocial and emotional support to patients and their caregivers. Physicians typically care for patients in the community with a model of care that is distinct from that of our mainstream medical system in the United States. The physician HV is an important model of care for people receiving hospice care to ensure continuity of care. This study should serve as a springboard for additional investigations both about the needs of the home hospice patient and about the role that physicians play in their care. By further identifying patients’ needs, hospice care and QoL can be improved.</p>
