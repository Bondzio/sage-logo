<abstract>
<p>The active ‘doing’ of gender and sexuality in and through social interaction has been a topic of academic inquiry for several decades. This study examines the cultural reproduction of that ‘doing’ through the onscreen discourse of the animated television sitcom. A conversation-analytic approach to various excerpts from two popular series reveals the ways in which the situated interactions of these programs make gender and sexuality overtly relevant to viewers through polarization of ‘the norm’ versus deviations from it at the level of talk. In temporarily deviating from their everyday, normative speech practices, characters tap into viewers’ preconceived notions of the behaviors of different gendered and sexual identities in interaction. These non-normative actions are then oriented to as such in the onscreen discourse, thereby making gender, sexuality, and the conduct associated with those identities simultaneously salient for the at-home viewer. It is hypothesized that, while these gender-/sexuality-based associations can be used as a tool through which to offer critiques of the social stereotypes that they parody, they can also serve to re-create those hegemonic divisions at a discursive level through homogenization of the complex range of human identities being represented.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In describing how everyday talk-in-interaction routinely establishes heterosexuality as the societal norm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1750481312472971">Kitzinger (2005</xref>: 478) explains that ‘Heteronormativity is embodied in what people do rather than in their beliefs, values, ideologies, or faiths’, and therefore ‘[it] – like other social norms – is embodied and displayed endogenously, in the details of conduct, and may be studied empirically as such’. The present study aims to examine the cultural <italic>reproduction</italic> of these details of conduct – or stereotyped performances thereof, as the case may be – in the animated family sitcom, a televised genre which has grown significantly in popularity since it first made its debut in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Analysis of concrete examples reveals the crucial role that interactional and behavioral practices play in ‘doing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1750481312472971">Sacks, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1750481312472971">West and Zimmerman, 1987</xref>) gendered and sexual identities and norms on television. In particular, here we present cases in which characters are in some way oriented to as having deviated from a gendered/sexual ‘baseline’ or, to once again borrow a description from Kitzinger, their ‘normal, natural, taken-for-granted’ discursive practices – be it momentarily or for the remainder of the episode. In including such scenes in their episodes, these shows are not only depending on, but are making active use of, viewer familiarity with interaction-based stereotypes in order to create these different identities and thereby achieve their intended comedic effect.</p>
<p>We begin our discussion by ethnographically situating the two specific animated series used in this study before moving on to describe the qualitative, discourse-based methodology employed in analyzing the interactions of those series. Excerpts from various episodes are presented and examined in detail with relation to the ways in which they make gender and/or sexuality relevant to viewers, namely through initial, onscreen reactions to a character’s gender-/sexuality-atypical or non-normative behavior in interaction. We aim to illustrate that, while such shows’ liberal plotlines indeed serve to critique stereotypes and notions of heteronormativity by progressively tackling more ‘macro’ political issues (e.g. gay marriage or the gendered labor force; see various studies cited later), the polarizing conversational practices used in creating character identities may also serve to <italic>reestablish</italic> social heteronormativity at the micro-interactional level by re-creating behavior-based stereotypes in communities of viewers.</p>

<title>Animating families for American primetime television</title>
<sec id="section3-1750481312472971">
<title>The genre and two popular examples</title>
<p>The history of the animated family sitcom in the so-called ‘primetime’ slots of American television schedules dates back over half of a century. First appearing in 1960, <italic>The Flintstones</italic> was the first instance of a cartoon airing at a time other than Saturday morning and which was not directed solely at young viewers. It was not until the debut of <italic>The Simpsons</italic> in the late 1980s, though, that animation truly rose to center stage, its success inspiring more than a dozen other animated shows over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1750481312472971">Turner, 2004</xref>: 50–55).</p>
<p>The data for this study come from two comedy series which piggyback on the popularity of <italic>The Simpsons</italic>: namely, <italic>Family Guy</italic> (created by Seth McFarlane in 1998) and <italic>American Dad!</italic> (created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman in 2005). We have chosen this particular duo as the basis for our analysis for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>First is the sheer popularity of these programs amongst US viewers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750481312472971">1</xref></sup> Both of these series currently debut episodes on the FOX network, in addition to airing reruns on other network and non-network channels such as Adult Swim and TBS. Although space considerations prevent us from presenting Nielson<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750481312472971">2</xref></sup> ratings for each of their hundreds of episodes, the number of viewers – particularly in the demographic of adults aged 18–49 – is massive. As a simple illustration of this fact: even when scheduled during the same timeslot as Game 1 of the National Basketball Association playoffs on ESPN (17 April 2011), a new episode of <italic>Family Guy</italic> secured the highest ratings of the night with 6 million viewers tuning in (which was actually down from the previous week’s ratings) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750481312472971">Kenneally, 2011</xref>). This figure indicates that, of US households with televisions, a little more than one out of every 20 was watching <italic>Family Guy</italic> from 9:00 to 9:30 p.m. that night – for a <italic>single</italic> airing of a <italic>single</italic> episode. Moreover, while ‘live’ viewers such as these (of an episode’s first showing) are most often used in calculating ratings, they fail to take into account those viewing episodes elsewhere. Past episodes are readily available online in the form of free (e.g. Hulu) as well as pay-per-view (e.g. Netflix) websites, and season DVDs are also compiled and sold; thus repeat viewing cannot be ignored when describing the number of times each episode is seen by the public. Furthermore, <italic>Family Guy</italic> has also received a variety of awards, including Primetime Emmys (for which <italic>American Dad!</italic> has also been nominated). In sum, then, these series have a history of popularity with viewers and thus ‘interact’ (a term to which we will return in the following section) with a large number of Americans on quite a regular basis.</p>
<p>Second, these two shows are widely known (and often criticized) in the US context for their decidedly liberal social and political agendas, each frequently and explicitly tackling controversial, taboo and socially charged topics through their overall plotlines and momentary satires/cut-aways (see much research on <italic>The Simpsons</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750481312472971">Alberti, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1750481312472971">Keslowitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1750481312472971">Turner, 2004</xref>). Issues as widespread as the economy, gay marriage, gun control and assisted suicide consistently manage to find their way into the lives of these cartoon families. Compared to <italic>The Simpsons</italic>, these two particular series also represent a timeline of progressively more ‘outrageous’ plotlines and topics, with the youngest, <italic>American Dad!</italic>, being the most ‘edgy’ of the three, following the terminology of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750481312472971">Booker (2006</xref>: xi). Given such an intentionally socio-politically liberal point of view, how issues of gender and sexuality are intertwined into the everyday discourse of these series merits further study.</p>
<p>One final reason for choosing these specific animated sitcoms is their boasting of the ‘typical’ American family structure, including its traditional gender roles, to which we now turn.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1750481312472971">
<title>Breakdown of the families</title>
<p>Again taking their cue from <italic>The Simpsons, Family Guy</italic> and <italic>American Dad!</italic> share the same portrayal – and parody – of the notion of the ‘traditional’ American family and household. That is, in each case the viewer is presented with a White, American, blue-collar, heterosexual married couple and their census-normative ‘2.3’ children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750481312472971">Chow, 2004</xref>: 108–109). Each episode provides a snippet of their lives together, allowing the audience to bear witness to the various ridiculous shenanigans that they participate in on a daily basis. Furthermore, despite the range of comedic moments and numerous plotline twists which unfold during each episode, and which have the potential to shake the very foundation of these familiar family structures and values, the traditional household is routinely restored by the end of every half-hour installment, conveniently just in time for the closing credits; and the next episode starts again from this familiar standard.</p>
<p>The depiction of these households as ‘traditional’ is further evidenced by the gendered roles assumed by husband and wife. The fathers are the sole breadwinners, each leaving for work on a daily basis as the children leave for school (note the opening credits of <italic>American Dad!</italic>). This father-as-breadwinner identity is in direct contrast with their female counterparts, the mothers: housewives who interact primarily within the confines of the home/neighborhood (except, of course, for ‘gender-specific’, out-of-home activities such as grocery shopping or attending the children’s school functions). When a plotline finds a mother taking up a new non-domestic pursuit (employment, martial arts lessons, etc.), these are always abandoned by the episode’s conclusion in order to return to the traditional gendered family roles and structure.</p>

<title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>Research in a range of academic disciplines and subfields – linguistics, sociology, communication, cultural and media studies – has worked to illuminate aspects of the relationship between the discourses of television and society more generally. Thus the specific methodology to be employed here merits some discussion before we begin to apply it to the animated sitcoms just described.</p>
<sec id="section6-1750481312472971">
<title>Two levels of interaction</title>
<p>In scripted television programming – animated or otherwise – language is used to create contextualized social interaction which is put on display for an observing audience. In this respect it quite closely resembles news interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481312472971">Allan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481312472971">Bell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750481312472971">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750481312472971">Greatbatch, 1988</xref>) or courtroom discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750481312472971">Atkinson and Drew, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750481312472971">Drew and Heritage, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750481312472971">Heritage and Clayman, 2010</xref>, chapter 12) between participants who are engaging in situated talk with one another on one level, but who are also knowingly doing so for the purposes of observers not directly participating (vocally, at least) in the conversation. We therefore have both the layer of interaction that is unfolding between the participants on the screen, as well as another layer which is the interaction that the viewer has <italic>with</italic> that interaction as s/he interprets what s/he is viewing. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1750481312472971">Scollon (1998</xref>: ix) puts it: ‘While media practitioners ‘‘carry on their social interaction as a spectacle for the consumption of the reader or viewer, those readers and viewers are using the spectacle as an active component of the construction of their own social environments and social interactions’” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1750481312472971">Talbot, 2007</xref>: 4). Precisely because there is an audience of viewers receiving and interpreting these televised interactions, what occurs discursively on the screen necessitates study from an interactional point of view. What specific approach to take in pursuing this discourse-based goal is nonetheless a debated issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1750481312472971">
<title>Scripted television discourse and conversation analysis (CA)</title>
<p>As the discourse which will be analyzed in this study comes from televised programs, it is scripted, performed by voice actors and edited before reaching viewers’ (and analysts’) television sets. Although research in literary and cultural studies, as well as in (critical) discourse analysis ((C)DA), has previously made use of such data samples, strict conversation analysis (CA) has been reluctant to incorporate this type of talk into its investigations. This is due first to CA’s demand for naturally produced, unedited data, the objective being to better understand how humans, as social beings, interact in real life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750481312472971">Heritage and Atkinson, 1984</xref>). The problem with using scripted, edited or otherwise ‘un-naturalistic’ or invented data for such a pursuit is that the results will not necessarily be representative of <italic>actual</italic> human social interaction. The present aim in adopting a CA-based approach, however, is not to use these shows to draw conclusions about how real humans interact in daily life, as is the method’s traditional goal. Rather, we view these examples as illustrating society’s own interpretation and indexation of the socio-interactional practices of different groups and individuals – put on display. That is, regardless of whether or not these programs accurately depict how certain individuals engage in naturalistic conversation in reality, the fact remains that they do indeed put forth a <italic>representation</italic> – a rehearsed and acted-out representation – thereof, which is taken in and subsequently interpreted by viewers. What is it that these scripted interactions assume at a discursive level from society in order to produce the gendered and sexual practices portrayed in the shows? What are these interactions actively re-creating – discursively – with their viewers?</p>
<p>Second, and crucially, CA focuses its attention on that which is ‘demonstrably relevant’ to the participants in the actual interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1750481312472971">Schegloff, 1997</xref>). This vehemently bottom–up approach to sociality serves to guard against analyst-imposed interpretations of the talk which may have little to do with the understandings of the actual speakers themselves. Particularly with identity-related themes such as gender and sexuality, the conversation-analytic method maintains that those specific pieces of identity be consequential for and attended to by co-participants in talk if they are to be incorporated into the analysis. That is, they must be ‘talked into being’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750481312472971">Heritage, 1984</xref>) at the ground level in order to form part of the account the analyst is putting forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1750481312472971">Schegloff, 1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750481312472971">Billig and Schegloff, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1750481312472971">Stokoe and Smithson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1750481312472971">Wetherell, 1998</xref>). Here, we explore how this foundational principle of conversation analysis can provide a window through which to (re)examine a topic of interest to cultural analysis and media studies, namely the representation of behaviors as linked to specific genders and sexualities. Particularly in light of the difficulty that can arise in producing a straightforward, objective analysis of fictional/cultural works which may be open to individual viewer interpretation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750481312472971">Fiske, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750481312472971">Hobson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1750481312472971">Hodge and Tripp, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1750481312472971">Sunderland, 2004</xref>), we posit that adopting such a perspective serves to systematicize and ground the analysis in objectivity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1750481312472971">Swann, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1750481312472971">
<title>The data</title>
<p>Although there is extensive overlap between the groupings, in this study we divide our examples into two main types: those which orient discursively to genders and those which orient discursively to sexualities. In the excerpts analyzed here, the onscreen co-participants in talk themselves attend to some bit of speech as embodying practices/actions specific to a certain gendered or sexual identity, often the result of a deviation from the speaker’s (and society’s) behavioral norms. This ‘demonstrable relevance’ of gender and sexuality therefore makes those behaviors salient not only at the level of the onscreen scripted discourse, but also for the at-home viewer witnessing the interaction unfold.</p>
<p>The focus of the immediately following sections will be a presentation of the data excerpts themselves to give a concrete sense of how gender and sexuality are accomplished interactionally in the series. We reserve more overarching discussion for after all of the data have been provided.</p>
<sec id="section9-1750481312472971">
<title>Orienting to gender in interaction</title>
<p>Our first example of interactional behavior working to characterize <italic>genders</italic> comes from the <italic>Family Guy</italic> episode ‘I am Peter, Hear Me Roar’. In this episode, the father character, Peter, is charged with sexual harassment by a female coworker. He is subsequently sent to a Women’s Retreat where he learns ‘‘what it means to be a woman’’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750481312472971">3</xref></sup> after falling out of a tree and catching his bottom lip on a branch, stretching it over his head. Earlier in the Retreat, a woman had claimed that this exact type of pain was equivalent to that which is experienced by women during childbirth. Thus, having experienced the same level of pain as a woman, Peter is able to understand the error of his sexist ways and fully embraces his ‘‘feminine side’’. Upon his return home from the two-week retreat, we see Excerpt (1) below:</p>

<p>In this initial post-Retreat interaction, we have a clear depiction of various features of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750481312472971">Lakoff’s (1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750481312472971">1975</xref>) classic ‘women’s language’. Despite criticism of Lakoff’s work over the years as anecdotal rather than empirical, its illumination of <italic>stereotypes</italic> about gendered linguistic practices is useful given our examination of the cultural <italic>representation</italic> of gendered discourse – not of actual gendered talk itself. In this example we see diminutive words such as ‘‘babies’’ and ‘‘munchkin’’ for teenage children (lines 4 and 5), along with the compounds ‘‘freshen[ing] up’’ and ‘‘rins[ing] out a few things’’ (lines 11–13). In addition there is the substitution of the more polite ‘‘fudge’’ in place of the vulgar interjection ‘‘fuck’’ in line 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750481312472971">Lakoff, 1973</xref>: 49–51). Furthermore, it can be reasonably argued that ‘‘breaking a nail’’ is a concern more often expressed by and attributed to females than it is to males. Finally, there is a dramatic jump up in pitch at the end of this line, paired with a wave of fluttered fingers.</p>
<p>Note that, in line with the conversation-analytically grounded method promoted here, Peter’s turns alone would not have been sufficient to definitively evoke a newly female identity in the character. This requirement separates the present methodology from other approaches to media discourse that do not call for the same sense of ‘demonstrable relevance’ which we described above. In a scene including just Peter’s turns 2–6 and 8–16, one could claim that it is the responsibility of each individual viewer to interpret the interaction as making reference to gendered speech norms, and that perhaps only a sensitive viewer would make such an interpretation. In this case, however, it is the scene-closing assessment in lines 17–19 that brings the topic to the forefront by showing that gender is relevant to the participants involved in the interaction. (Note also what appears to be the launch of an earlier assessment by Brian in line 7. This turn-at-talk, however, is abandoned with the onset of Peter’s turn in line 8.) Chris’s explicit categorization of his father as ‘‘a chick’’ unambiguously evaluates the interactional behavior that his father has just produced as subscribing to feminine norms – atypical for male use. In doing this, the gender association is simultaneously made overt for the viewer: <italic>men don’t talk like that, women do</italic>. Enhancing this assessment further are the wide-eyed stares of surprise by the rest of the family after Peter’s departure into the house (line 20). Thus even if a viewer were not familiar with one or more of the specific behavioral stereotypes Peter produced, s/he would nonetheless be presented with their direct connection to male and female identities through co-experiencing the situated interaction with the onscreen characters. The viewer is then expected to find the sudden identity switch a comical one due to the absurdity of Peter, the ‘everyman’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750481312472971">Chow, 2004</xref>), behaving like ‘‘a chick’’, a shift which is immediately accomplished via discursive practices and explicit assessment thereof.</p>
<p>An additional point merits clarification here before moving on. These speech changes may indeed be exaggerated behaviors which are included by writers and voice actors to ensure quick uptake by the audience of new, plot-consequential identities. In fact, this is quite probable. This does not undermine the present analysis, however. On the contrary, the fact that these discursive practices <italic>can be</italic> and <italic>are</italic> used to index gender so effectively, regardless of their accuracy when compared to real-life discourse, only furthers the present claims. That is, Chris’s assessment in the interaction in Excerpt (1) does not challenge the existence of the association of features of Peter’s previous talk with features of female talk. Rather, what is problematized – explicitly in the onscreen talk – is the fact that Peter, a <italic>male</italic>, is <italic>using</italic> those practices; and thus gendered ways of speaking are overtly put on display for the viewer.</p>
<p>Once gender has been evoked as relevant, the audience is primed to use that as a framework of interpretation in subsequent exchanges. In the episode just referenced in Excerpt (1), Peter’s female identity continues through many interactions with a variety of characters. Take, for example, the following Excerpt (2) in which Peter calls his male friend, Quagmire, while in the bathtub. Note the timestamp which places this interaction almost immediately following the exchange in Excerpt (1).</p>

<p><monospace>17       ((<italic>realizes that Quagmire has hung up the phone</italic>))</monospace></p>
<p>In this bit of talk, Peter calls Quagmire without a specific agenda, and Quagmire rejects that activity as inappropriate. In addition to the ‘feminine’ prosodic contours mentioned above, this interaction illustrates a particular communicative practice that is contextually depicted as used by women, given that, at this point in the episode, Peter’s identity remains that of ‘‘a chick’’. This telephonic practice is out of the ordinary for Peter, as is shown by Quagmire’s implicit negative assessment (lines 6–7, 9–10, 12–13, 15). While Quagmire does not produce an explicit summative assessment as was seen in Chris’s line 16, gender has already been made relevant for the viewer due to the scene’s sequential placement after others such as Excerpt (1): Peter’s behavior remains portrayed as a result of his newly feminine identity. The comedic effect of this brief clip is achieved as the viewer orients to the play on supposedly gender-specific interactional practices: <italic>women call one another just to ‘chat’ while men do not</italic>. Whether or not this accurately reflects the reality of how actual men and women interact via telephone, again, is not relevant to our purposes. Here we argue only that the show actively takes advantage of a gendered stereotype of interaction for comedic effect, this being possible due to the sequential positioning of this interaction relative to the others already taken in by the viewer of the episode.</p>
<p>The previous examples have illustrated male and female communicative norms through deviations from those norms on the part of a male character; however, these gendered standards can be portrayed through female character identity transformations as well (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750481312472971">Henry, 2007</xref>). In an episode of <italic>Family Guy</italic> titled ‘Lethal Weapons’, Lois steps outside of her normal role as housewife and begins taking martial arts lessons. She subsequently becomes quite aggressive, as seen in the following Excerpt (3) which occurs after another mother begins using the park swing that Lois had planned to use for her own infant, Stewie.</p>

<p><monospace>13 LOIS:  <underline>She</underline> <underline>saw</underline> me walkin’ to the swing.</monospace></p>
<p>In this excerpt, Stewie provides an assessment of Lois’s threatening lines 4–9 in his own lines 11–12. He explicitly categorizes her utterances as male gendered by making reference to external genitalia: <italic>men are this forceful in their speech while women are not</italic>. This is the same sequential progression which we saw in Excerpt (1): gender-deviant behavior followed by an assessment of the behavior as such. Note here, though, that Lois’s response in line 13 addresses and provides an account for her display of aggression toward the other mother, demonstrating her active understanding of the association made between gendered norms of speaking and forcefulness. She thereby indeed challenges what she interprets as a potentially negative assessment of her talk as ‘unnecessarily aggressive’; but she does <italic>not</italic> challenge the categorization of such speech as male-gendered, which was the way in which Stewie formulated his evaluation. In fact, she inherently <italic>accepts</italic> this categorization by responding to the concept that the association was aiming to index (i.e. aggression). Yet again, this assessment of the talk makes gendered interactional norms demonstrably relevant for the <italic>viewer</italic> precisely because they are oriented to by the participants in the onscreen interaction.</p>
<p>Gender roles and identities need not constitute the overt focal point of an episode’s <italic>entire</italic> plotline, as in the previous <italic>Family Guy</italic> examples, for gender to be communicatively defined through the show’s discourse. On the contrary, orientations to discursive gender norms and deviations thereof also appear as jokes in momentary, cut-away and other plot-inconsequential interactions in search of quick laughs. In the <italic>American Dad!</italic> episode titled ‘Jack’s Back’, the father character, Stan, is contacted by his own long-lost father, Jack, who abandoned the family during Stan’s youth. In this scene, Stan and his son, Steve, go to retrieve Jack from prison. Upon seeing Jack in the driver’s seat of the car, Stan presumes he is attempting to steal the car and run away again, so he shoots out the car’s tires to halt the vehicle.</p>

<p><monospace>      ((<italic>crying tone</italic>))</monospace></p>
<p>In lines 9–10, Stan uses the metaphor that the car is making a ‘‘black tinkle’’ which is coming from the ‘‘whosie-what’er’’ to explain that the car’s transmission is leaking fluid due to having been hit by one of the gunshots. He immediately receives confused looks from Jack and Steve, accompanied by a two-second silence, qualifying the utterance as somehow out of the ordinary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1750481312472971">Pomerantz, 1984</xref>). Stan’s subsequent account for his statement is then that his mother taught him about cars due to the absence of his father (line 12).</p>
<p>Stan’s qualification in line 12 is what goes on record to categorize the metaphor and lexicon in lines 9–10 as feminine. Again echoing Lakoff’s ‘men’s’ versus ‘women’s work’ stereotypes, the image created is that, as a woman, his mother did not possess the technical vehicle vocabulary that a man would (be expected to) use in describing a car. Stan’s mother substituted these gaps in her vocabulary with metaphors and invented words, and that is how Stan learned to refer to such topics as his father was not present to ‘correctly’ socialize him in the male gender norm of using technical language for automobiles. Thus we have what might be called a momentary code-switch (or register switch) into ‘woman’s language’. Instead of an overt, verbal sanction of the gender-deviant behavior as seen in the previous examples, here gaze paired with a lack of verbal uptake in line 11 is sufficient to elicit a gendered explanation/account from the producer of the gender-inappropriate turn (line 12). This combination then shows that such an utterance is judged by all three of the interactants as ill-fitted or inappropriate to this speaker precisely because the speaker is male. In other words, the lexical choices in lines 9 and 10 are not dealt with in the interaction as constituting trouble sources for repair due to a lack of understanding of their <italic>meaning</italic> (what exactly Stan was referring to), in which case we would expect a repair proper consisting of a new or elaborated way of referring to the car’s transmission (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1750481312472971">Schegloff et al., 1977</xref>). Here the problematic nature of the turn is oriented to by Stan (the speaker of the trouble source) as due to its mismatch with his (and society’s) gendered norms of speaking. This ill-fittedness/inappropriateness is immediately addressed in the onscreen discourse as gender-based through the account in line 12, and thereby unambiguously conveyed to the at-home viewer as well.</p>
<p>Through the brief excerpts presented in this section, we have attempted to illustrate how these animated programs are able to tap into viewers’ preconceptions about gendered communicative behaviors, show deviation from ‘normative’ practices and exploit them for comedic effect. These preconceptions were shown to exist at various levels of speech: from basic fundamental frequency (high pitch and dramatic pitch contours for women), to lexicon (‘women’s/men’s language’), to overall general speech practices, emotions and communities of practice (telephone interaction, demonstrating aggression). Attributing to one gender discursive characteristics supposedly typical to another – and then explicitly marking them as such in the onscreen interaction (i.e. through initiations of repair, assessments and accounts) – actively ‘does being’ male and female by putting on display for the viewer what is <italic>appropriate</italic> (or ‘the norm’) and what is <italic>inappropriate</italic> (or ‘abnormal’) for each gender with regard to (American) socio-interactional norms.</p>

<title>Orienting to sexuality in interaction</title>
<p>We now transition into interactions which display orientations to <italic>sexualities</italic>, using as cases in point the discursive ‘doing’ of gay and straight male identities.</p>
<p>The <italic>American Dad!</italic> episode titled ‘Lincoln Lover’ opens with staunch conservative Stan bringing his son, Steve, to a meeting of local Republicans: ‘The Langly Conservatives’. (‘Langly Falls’ is the name of the town in which the family lives.) The theme of sexuality is topicalized immediately in the episode as this particular group does not allow gays to attend.

<p>This interaction is undoubtedly attempting a satire of what might be called, for lack of a better term, an <italic>extremely</italic> closed-minded view of sexuality: gays are ‘‘d<underline>a</underline>ngerous’’ (line 4), but ‘‘Luckily: there are ways to identify them:’’ (line 15). The sheer outrageousness of the comments in such scenes (e.g. any woman who wears pants must be a lesbian, lines 24–26) is what has earned <italic>American Dad!</italic> and <italic>Family Guy</italic> their reputations as socially liberal series which enjoy poking fun at non-liberal perspectives, as we described earlier. While this sequence in and of itself is indeed quite deserving of analysis, it is included here as background for other interactions to come.</p>
<p>Later in the same episode, Stan is invited by a different group, the ‘Log Cabin Republicans’ (a Republican group which advocates gay and lesbian rights), to speak at their National Convention. After being taught the ‘‘dangerousness’’ of gays earlier in the episode (Excerpt (5)), Stan’s son is worried that interacting with homosexuals at the Convention will ‘‘turn’’ his father gay, as he demonstrates in the following Excerpt (6):</p>
<p><bold>(6) (<italic>American Dad!</italic>) ‘Lincoln Lover’: 11:25-11:40</bold></p>
<p><monospace>1 STEVE: So they’re not gonna turn you ga:y.</monospace></p>

<p><monospace>11    ((<italic>immediate scene transition</italic>))</monospace></p>
<p>Steve’s B-event statement in line 1 is heard as a request for information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1750481312472971">Labov, 1972</xref>: 124), which Stan provides in line 2. After announcing his intention to depart for his first meeting with the Log Cabin group (lines 4–5), he dramatically raises his pitch and produces a diminutive formulation of the word ‘‘Bye’’, accompanied by a wave of fluttered fingers (line 7). Just as we saw in the previous section on gender (see e.g. Excerpt (4)), this turn is non-vocally problematized by Steve, who grimaces at his father and crosses his arms in an explicit display of disbelief, withholding the provision of an appropriate second-pair part to the farewell. In the immediately prior adjacency pair sequence, Stan claimed that he would ‘‘of course’’ <italic>not</italic> be ‘‘turned’’ gay; but Steve’s combination of gesture and gaze in line 8 embodies a stance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750481312472971">Goodwin, 2007</xref>) which illustrates his interpretation of line 7 to be evidence to the contrary. Steve’s non-verbal behavior is subsequently taken as an initiation of repair, calling into question the formulation of the prior ‘‘↑↑<underline>Bye</underline>:-zies::!↑↑’’; Stan orients to the lack of uptake by providing the repair proper himself – a low-pitched repetition, now accompanied by a fist gesture – in lines 9–10, precisely to support his earlier claim of <italic>not</italic> being ‘‘turned gay’’ by spending time with the Log Cabin Republicans. Through the design of this repair proper, then, Stan displays (to Steve and to the viewers) his understanding of line 7 as exhibiting features of ‘gay speech’ (and gesture) by eliminating those problematized, non-normative elements in his repetition.</p>
<p>It is important to re-highlight that these features do not seem to have any foundation in <italic>actual</italic> gay speech. Specifically with regard to pitch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1750481312472971">Lerman and Damasté (1969)</xref>, for example, did not find any fundamental frequency difference between heterosexual and homosexual men, nor did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1750481312472971">Smyth and Rogers (2002)</xref>. Nonetheless, the <italic>stereotype</italic> does exist that gay speech is produced at a higher pitch – in fact, the existence of the stereotype is precisely what prompted these studies of fundamental frequency; and the sequential positioning of turns in this exchange taps into that preconceived assumption in the mind of the viewer.</p>
<p>A similar example of sexuality ‘manipulation’ occurs in the episode ‘Family Gay’, in which <italic>Family Guy</italic>’s Peter signs up to receive experimental gene injections to bring in some extra money. One of the genes he is injected with is ‘‘the gay gene’’, which causes him to become homosexual for the remainder of the episode. Soon after receiving the injection, he leaves his wife and moves in with his new boyfriend, Scott. The following is an exchange between these two in their apartment:</p>
<p><monospace><bold>(7) (<italic>Family Guy</italic>) ‘Family Gay’: 14:40-14:54</bold></monospace></p>
<p><monospace>1  PETER:  [I am <underline>s:o::</underline> <underline>gay::</underline> for you Scott.</monospace></p>
<p><monospace>2      [((<italic>holding Scott’s hand</italic>))</monospace></p>
<p><monospace>3  SCOTT:  <underline>I</underline>’m so gay for <underline>you</underline> Peter.</monospace></p>
<p><monospace>4      ((<italic>they kiss</italic>))</monospace></p>

<p><monospace>6  SCOTT:  I jus:t (0.5)</monospace></p>
<p><monospace>7      You complete me:: you know that?</monospace></p>
<p><monospace>8      You just make me wanna be a gayer man.</monospace></p>
<p><monospace>9  PETER:  Oh:: come he::re.</monospace></p>
<p><monospace>10     ((<italic>they begin kissing</italic>))</monospace></p>
<p>At the level of the individual word, we see the so-called ‘‘intensive <italic>so</italic>’’, reported by Lakoff to be a feature of women’s speech, used in lines 2 and 3. The intensiveness is further accentuated by segment lengthening, marked intonation and hyperarticulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1750481312472971">Walters, 1981</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750481312472971">Barrett, 1997</xref>). Moreover, on a more general thematic level, this interaction portrays the discursive contributions of homosexuals as omnirelevantly homosexual, constantly making reference to sexual themes: sexual orientation, sexual organs, and so on. In other words: <italic>all gays talk about is gayness</italic>. This is done explicitly in lines 1, 3, 5 and 8. Not even a canonical, pre-established English idiom such as ‘penny for your thoughts’ is exempt from sexualization in gay speech, being substituted with explicit reference to male genitalia in line 5. The comedic effect here is tapping into Peter’s current identity as a gay man (sequentially established by immediately prior scenes) and, of course, into the stereotypes that viewers possess about that identity and its behavior.</p>
<p>Again the viewer sees Peter’s utterances as contrasting from his ‘everyman’ interactional and behavioral norm. And because having been given the gay gene is the novelty in this episode, the subsequent differences in speech are interpreted by the viewer as due to his being gay. The audience is thus offered the transitive connection: <italic>his speech is different because he is now homosexual</italic> and <italic>homosexuals speak differently than heterosexuals</italic>.</p>
<p>The final exchange we examine occurs in the same episode after Peter is sent to “Straight Camp,” where he will supposedly relearn how to be a heterosexual man. Excerpt (8) is from one of his classes at camp.</p>

<p>This exchange offers an overt (see lines 1–2) representation of both heterosexual (by the Teacher) and homosexual (by Peter) speech styles. Looking first at the level of grammar, we see that the Teacher’s prescriptively incorrect ‘‘me and my friends’’ in line 5 is repeated by Peter as the correct ‘‘my friends and I’’ in line 7, paralleling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750481312472971">Barrett’s (1997)</xref> mention of hypercorrect grammar in gay men’s speech. Moving to the overall themes referenced in this exchange, the Teacher’s heterosexual turns mention activities which are presented in the interaction as traditionally linked to hegemonic heterosexual masculinity. That is, straight men are depicted behaviorally as engaging in consumption of heavy amounts of alcohol (line 6), physically dangerous/demanding sports (lines 10–11) and the pursuit of sex with any willing women (line 15). Peter’s ‘translations’ of the Teacher’s utterances, in turn, portray the speech and activities of homosexuals as the Other, directly in contrast with the heterosexual norm: obsession with personal physical appearance (lines 8–9 and 16–17), non-participation in sports (lines 12–13) and homoerotic activities (line 18). Note that the Teacher, in line 19, subsequently sanctions Peter for his nonconformity with regard to talking ‘‘like a straight man’’ (line 2), and thus Peter’s previous turns are discursively depicted as gay speech.</p>
<p>Naturally, by the end of this episode, the effects of ‘‘the gay gene’’ wear off, Peter’s heterosexual identity and behavior return, and the harmony and familiarity of the heterosexual household and family are restored.</p>

<title>Summary and discussion</title>
<sec id="section12-1750481312472971">
<title>Character identity in onscreen interaction</title>
<p>Through the examples presented above, we have argued that these animated TV sitcoms create representations of the social norms of heterosexuality and ‘traditional’ gender roles at the behavioral and interactional levels, in the discourse between characters on the screen – and therefore also in the interaction that viewers have <italic>with</italic> that discourse. This conclusion parallels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1750481312472971">Kim et al.’s (2007)</xref> more macro-level findings regarding overall plotlines in their study of 25 primetime network television shows, namely a massive inclination toward the heterosexual script.</p>
<p>How these animated shows are able to tap into the preconceptions of their viewers is through onscreen <italic>orientations</italic> and <italic>reactions</italic> to characters’ gender-/sexuality-non-normative interaction and behavior. And when reactions treat the behavior as out-of-the ordinary, the violator him/herself often provides a gender- or sexuality-based account for that atypicality. The deviations are thus attended to and referenced in the onscreen discourse, and therefore the connection between gendered/sexual identity and communicative behavior is simultaneously made relevant to viewers. After Peter attends the Women’s Retreat, we, the viewers, are discursively guided – turn-by-turn, frame by frame – to identify him as ‘‘a chick’’, his speech having been transformed ‘in kind’ to a ‘feminine’ variety. When he becomes homosexual after being injected with ‘‘the gay gene’’ and his speech changes, we, the viewers, are overtly invited to make the connection between his new interactive practices, his new identity and what constitutes ‘gay speech’. Of course, through these portrayals of what does <italic>not</italic> adhere to the norm, the viewer is correspondingly also exposed to what <italic>are</italic> the socially acceptable norms of interaction for both men and women.</p>

<sec id="section13-1750481312472971">
<title>Critiquing or reestablishing social norms?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481312472971">Fairclough (1995)</xref> describes the relationship between media and society as a dialectal one in that the former is both <italic>shaped by</italic> as well as <italic>shapes</italic> the latter, to a great extent a cyclical process. Thus far we have concentrated on the first part of this equation; that is, we have shown how society’s male/female genders and hetero-/homosexualities are discursively made salient for viewers by characters in the animated TV family sitcom. But to what end? What are these indexations cyclically communicating back <italic>into</italic> society through their secondary interaction with real human viewers?</p>
<p>While it is true that representation involves interpretation by the viewer, and thus there may be multiple possible interpretations of a given scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750481312472971">Fiske, 1987</xref>), the <italic>explicit</italic> problematization of these behaviors <italic>in</italic> the situated discourse of the onscreen characters – through overt vocal assessment, gaze, lack of uptake, accounts, and so on – strongly encourages the viewer to make sense of them in a particular way. These evaluative communicative practices parallel the dichotomization of gender and sexuality identities that is commonplace in the hegemonic discourses of mainstream society – the idea that: <italic>there are men and there are women, men behave like this and women behave like that</italic>. And, with specific reference to sexuality, the idea that: <italic>straight men behave like this, gay men behave like that</italic>. Of course, much research has worked to demonstrate that male/female identities are, in fact, quite complex and fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750481312472971">Coates, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750481312472971">Holmes and Schnurr, 2006</xref>, among many others), as are sexuality identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750481312472971">Barrett, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1750481312472971">Podesva et al., 2001</xref>, among many others), and that this fluidity manifests itself as one engages in talk with an interlocutor. However, such fluidity that is the reality of authentic gendered and sexual identity and speech is <italic>lost</italic> in the polarized representations of onscreen interaction. That is, what the viewer is exposed to in Stan’s use of non-technical language to refer to car maintenance is <italic>not</italic> an ‘alternative masculinity’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750481312472971">Coates (2001)</xref> has described, or a momentary other method of ‘doing being’ male, as is possible in everyday natural discourse. Rather, the character receives unequivocal criticism <italic>in the onscreen interaction</italic> for sounding momentarily ‘female’ – or <italic>not</italic> appropriately male – essentially accomplishing a micro-lesson in hegemonic masculinity: <italic>men aren’t ‘supposed’ to talk that way</italic>. Lois’s show of aggression toward another mother at the park is not characterized as just that – an emotion; on the contrary, her assertiveness earns her a momentary identification as male, because: <italic>males behave like that, not females</italic>.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that there are, in reality, no singular ‘male’ or ‘female’ ways of speaking, the polarized view of ‘male’ versus ‘female’ speech in these series allows viewers’ ‘association[s] of linguistic features with particular social groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750481312472971">Bell, 2002</xref>: 142) to be tapped into; and the same argument can be made for ‘straight’ versus ‘gay’ social identities. At this point, then, what does the viewer do with these identities once they have been evoked? Does s/he understand the polar indexation as a <italic>critique</italic> of gendered and sexual stereotypes of interaction? Or, does s/he simply ingest the ‘stylized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1750481312472971">Rampton, 1999</xref>) talk as an authentic depiction of ‘reality’, thereby <italic>reestablishing</italic> the stereotypes as social norms? As is generally the case with social satires and parodies, both sorts of viewers surely exist among the shows’ fans. Liberal-minded followers are free to find Peter’s gay speech a purposefully ridiculous performance and appreciate the poking fun at such a closed-minded stereotype of gay identity. Simultaneously, other admirers of the show are able to enjoy such an ‘accurate’ depiction of homosexual behavior. This polysemic nature of television media is a recipe for popularity due to a single show’s ability to appeal to a wide and diverse audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750481312472971">Fiske, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Regardless of the liberal or conservative interpretation of the individual viewer, however, the associations themselves are taken in by all, and thus subtle polarization of male versus female and hetero- versus homosexual communicative norms can constitute momentary support for the very social norms and hegemonic stereotypes that the shows’ overarching liberal plotlines seem to be aiming to critique. Recall the liberal-based satire in Example (5) which depicted as utterly ridiculous and nonsensical those who prescribed to stereotypes about homosexual males. And yet, minutes later in the same episode, the viewer is presented with a discursive categorization of some features of talk-in-interaction (i.e. raised pitch, fluttered hand gesture) as features of ‘gay speech’. Similarly, when Peter becomes ‘‘a chick’’ (Excerpts (1) and (2)), what is assessed in the interaction is the fact that a <italic>male</italic> would call friends without an agenda and be concerned with breaking a nail. However, there is no discursive problematization of these behaviors as <italic>female</italic>. On the contrary, they are the precise communicative features which allow the co-participants in the onscreen talk – and therefore the viewers as well – to determine Peter’s new <italic>feminine</italic> identity. When Stan demonstrates his lack of vehicle vocabulary in Excerpt (4), it is his momentary conforming to supposedly female norms that is challenged, <italic>not</italic> what those male and female norms actually are. These dichotomous ‘doings’ of onscreen normative/non-normative identity through interaction can therefore indeed reinforce ‘biased meanings built into language and, thus, contribute to the re-construction of social inequities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750481312472971">Messner et al., 1993</xref>: 133).</p>
<p>Note that such dichotomization echoes the reconstruction of hegemonic masculinity that has been shown to exist in studies of natural discourse as well (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750481312472971">Coates, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750481312472971">Kiesling, 2002</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1750481312472971">Mittell (2001)</xref> claims in his analysis of <italic>The Simpsons</italic> (again at the level of overarching plotlines), animated shows ‘[do] not work to destroy generic codes but to <italic>highlight</italic> their cultural circulation and common currency among the show’s media-saturated audience’ (p. 25, emphasis in original). In the present study, we have illustrated that this occurs even at the subtle, micro-level of discursive practices.</p>

<title>Conclusions and avenues for future research</title>
<p>The fact that these (and numerous other) series incorporate overt illustrations of and commentary on the communicative practices of various genders and sexualities demonstrates how relevant these issues are for American society. After all, ‘However limited their speaking parts are, and even when they are realized on screen as animals, glove puppets, and graphic shapes, these characters are imagined exemplars of us – people in the real world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750481312472971">Richardson, 2010</xref>: 192). Through the conversation-analytically grounded approach employed here, we have aimed to show that potentially individual, extra-situational and otherwise analyst-imposed interpretations of scripted, onscreen talk are not required for the investigation of norms of social behavior on television. The characters themselves are attending to the existence of these norms in and through their co-constructed interaction with one another, and the work of the analyst is to uncover how that is being accomplished and thereby communicated to the viewers at home.</p>
<p>These programs are cutting-edge in their tackling of issues which are at the forefront of their viewers’ minds – and gender, sexuality and overall identity are no exception. The data and episodes included here only scratch the surface of these complex themes which, as mentioned earlier, are present in some way in almost every episode. In an attempt to keep the discussion as clear as possible, we limited our discussion to two identity dichotomies: male/female (gender) and hetero-/homosexual male (sexuality). Various other related identities also appear in these three series, however, and merit (socio)linguistic and discourse-based analysis: Meg becomes a lesbian in <italic>Family Guy</italic>’s ‘Brian Sings and Swings’; she undergoes gender reassignment surgery and subsequently becomes ‘Ron’ in ‘Stu and Stewie’s Excellent Adventure’; Quagmire’s father does the same and becomes ‘Ida’ in the episode ‘Quagmire’s Dad’. In addition, each of the shows analyzed here contains a character whose sexuality is purposefully and creatively ambiguous: Stewie in <italic>Family Guy</italic> and Roger the Alien in <italic>American Dad!</italic> (see also Mr Smithers in <italic>The Simpsons</italic>). How is language used to accomplish these (and other) various fictional identities which are put on display for viewers?</p>
<p>In short, data related to gender, sexuality and identity more generally are not lacking in this corpus. Given the extraordinary following these programs have with the (American) public, further academic pursuit into what millions of viewers are consuming from their television sets on a daily basis is critical.</p>
<p>Future studies may also look more directly at the consequences of this type of programming on its audience with regard to the beliefs and opinions viewers have about the speech practices and behavior of various genders and sexualities, as well as concerning the linguistic production of the actual viewers themselves (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1750481312472971">Spitulnik, 1997</xref>). Studies of this nature will further illuminate the role that the interactions unfolding <italic>on</italic>screen can and do play in the interactions that unfold <italic>off</italic>screen – and vice-versa.</p>
