<title>Introduction</title>
<p>ADHD is found to be a highly prevalent disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711413074">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>) persisting from childhood into adulthood in 30% to 60% of the cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711413074">Mannuzza et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054711413074">Weiss &amp; Murray, 2003</xref>). The average prevalence of adult ADHD in the general population has been estimated to be 3.4% in a large cross-national study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711413074">Fayyad et al., 2007</xref>). Adding to sustained symptoms, adults with ADHD have an increased risk of lifelong comorbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711413074">Halmoy, Fasmer, Gillberg, &amp; Haavik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711413074">Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, &amp; Walters, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711413074">Rasmussen &amp; Levander, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711413074">Torgersen, Gjervan, &amp; Rasmussen, 2006</xref>). Studies suggest that as much as 90% of adult patients with ADHD have one or more comorbid psychiatric disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711413074">Nutt et al., 2007</xref>). The most common comorbid disorders are anxiety disorders, mood disorders, substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), and developmental disorders such as autism and learning disabilities.</p>
<p>Adult ADHD is also associated with poor functional outcomes in multiple life domains such as psychosocial function and role functioning in education and work life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711413074">Adler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711413074">de Graaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711413074">Safren, Sprich, Cooper-Vince, Knouse, &amp; Lerner, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Most studies have found only minor gender differences in symptoms, comorbidity, and functional outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711413074">Biederman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711413074">Biederman, Faraone, Monuteaux, Bober, &amp; Cadogen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711413074">Rasmussen &amp; Levander, 2009</xref>). However, some studies have reported differences between women and men in symptoms and ADHD subtypes, with women reporting higher levels of current ADHD symptoms compared with men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711413074">Halmoy et al., 2009</xref>) and relatively more men than women being present in all subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711413074">Cumyn, French, &amp; Hechtman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Generally, the participation in work life is assumed to be negatively affected by ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711413074">Biederman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711413074">de Graaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711413074">Halmoy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711413074">Torgersen et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, research has also shown similarities in employment rates between ADHD and a clinical control group not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for ADHD but having other psychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054711413074">Young, Toone, &amp; Tyson, 2003</xref>). This suggests that psychopathology other than ADHD symptoms may contribute to occupational outcome.</p>
<p>In a socioeconomic perspective, work-related impairments represent an increased burden on society. On the individual level, being separated from work life increases the risk of social isolation adding to the burden of ADHD itself. Compared with age- and gender-matched controls, ADHD in adults is associated with occupational underattainments relative to what may be expected according to their intellectual potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711413074">Biederman et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, results from a large-scale prevalence study among workers showed that ADHD was significantly associated with decrements in both quantitative and qualitative work-related role performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711413074">de Graaf et al., 2008</xref>). Compared with other workers, those with ADHD had more days out of work-role, being less productive, and having reduced work performance quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711413074">de Graaf et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, cross-sectional studies have shown lower occupational functioning in adults with ADHD compared with controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711413074">Barkley, Murphy, &amp; Fischer, 2008</xref>). This indicates that the symptoms of ADHD per se might play an important role in occupational functioning. This is supported by a recent study reporting associations between the severity of ADHD symptoms and work impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711413074">Safren et al., 2010</xref>). Being in work seems to include the ability to perform several skills and strategies relevant to most functional domains. Executive function deficits such as problems with self-management of time, self-motivation, and self-discipline are found to contribute to occupational problems in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711413074">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The impact of comorbidity on occupational outcome is somewhat ambiguous. A European study found a relationship between psychiatric comorbidity and low-occupational activity in adults with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711413074">Sobanski et al., 2007</xref>). Also, the severity of childhood ADHD and comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, especially conduct disorder, is reported to correlate with poor outcome of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711413074">Barkley, Fischer, Edelbrock, &amp; Smallish, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711413074">Newcorn et al., 2004</xref>). Contrary to this finding, other results indicate that occupational outcome might be independent of psychiatric status and more related to ADHD itself when the condition is continuing into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711413074">Mannuzza, Klein, Bessler, Malloy, &amp; LaPadula, 1993</xref>). Recent studies suggest that central stimulant treatment is beneficial for adult function in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711413074">Spencer et al., 2008</xref>), thus possibly a predictor of occupational function. Furthermore, a recent Norwegian study found that childhood diagnosis and treatment with central stimulants might have a beneficial effect on adult occupational outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711413074">Halmoy et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is important to further investigate the impact of early central stimulant treatment on adult occupational outcome.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to describe functional and clinical characteristics in a clinically referred sample of adults with ADHD. Furthermore, we wanted to explore what factors might predict occupational outcome. Predictors were identified from previous research literature and correlation analyses. We hypothesized that age of first treatment with central stimulants, ADHD symptom severity as measured by the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale Full Edition (ASRS), and comorbid psychiatric disorders would be significant predictors of occupational outcome in adulthood.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants in the study were identified through the Patient Administrative System at Levanger and Namsos hospitals, Department of Psychiatry, in North-Troendelag in Central Norway. The hospitals have a catchment area for 130,000 inhabitants. Between 1997 and 2009, 586 adult patients had been diagnosed with hyperkinetic disorder as defined by the International Classification of Diseases–10th Revision (ICD-10) research criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711413074">World Health Organization [WHO], 1993</xref>). Inclusion criteria for the present study were (a) a valid ADHD diagnosis according to the (ICD-10) research criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711413074">WHO, 1993</xref>) after an assessment at Levanger or Namsos hospital and (b) a confirmed diagnosis by an experienced psychiatrist (the second author). The participants also had to be able to give their consent to participation in the study. An assessment of the data by an experienced psychiatrist showed that 79 of the participants had been incorrectly registered with the diagnosis and 30 diagnoses were found not to be valid. Furthermore, 6 persons had died. Subsequently, 471 participants were invited to participate in the study: 177 women and 294 men. Among the 471 participants invited to participate in the study by postal mail, 152 responded positively and returned completed questionnaires and informed consent to participate, including permission to collect data from their medical journals. The self-report questionnaire responses from three participants were self-contradictory and substantially incomplete. The review of the medical records revealed that these participants probably had specific learning difficulties to a substantial degree. Thus, the data from these participants were excluded from the data set. The final sample included 149 participants: 78 women and 71 men. The recruitment process is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087054711413074">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Material and Procedures</title>
<p>In this study, we used data collected from the following two sources: (a) the participant’s medical records and (b) self-report questionnaires. Data from the medical records were screened and collected by an experienced psychiatrist. A comorbid disorder was diagnosed only if the information in the medical record clearly confirmed the criteria for a <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711413074">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994</xref>) diagnosis.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1087054711413074">
<title>Medical Records</title>
<p>From 1997 to May 2005, all patients older than 18 years who were to receive treatment with central stimulants in Norway had to be evaluated and approved by one of three National expert committees for hyperkinetic disorders. National guidelines were used to secure a valid diagnosis and adequate treatment. These guidelines included systematic assessment of ADHD according to the International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders: Diagnostic criteria for research, ICD-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711413074">WHO, 1993</xref>). Two modifications were made, allowing the inattentive subtype in the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711413074">APA, 1994</xref>) as sufficient for the diagnosis and for the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders. The guidelines were mandatory until May 2005. This procedure for assessment and treatment of adult ADHD is described in earlier papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711413074">Halmoy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711413074">Rasmussen &amp; Levander, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711413074">Torgersen et al., 2006</xref>). The Department of Psychiatry at Levanger and Namsos Hospitals continued to use the national guidelines for assessment after May 2005, with two modifications. The general Adult ADHD Symptom Checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711413074">Amen, 1995</xref>) was replaced by the ASRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711413074">Kessler, Adler, et al., 2005</xref>), and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview was introduced as a mandatory tool for diagnosing comorbidity. In most cases, the assessment was supplemented with additional information, such as structured diagnostic interviews, neuropsychological tests, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, and electro encephalography. All relevant information about the diagnostic assessment, patient history, and treatment was documented in the medical records.</p>
<sec id="section6-1087054711413074">
<title>Clinical Variables</title>
<p>From the patients’ medical records, we collected information about past ADHD diagnosis and treatment history, including age at first treatment with central stimulants from childhood to adulthood and duration of central stimulant treatment in adult psychiatry. Also past comorbid diagnoses were collected from the patient’s records. Two comorbid disorders are labeled lifetime disorders: lifetime depressive disorder and lifetime anxiety disorder. This resembles the different types of categories within depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>From the medical records, we also collected data from the self-report questionnaire Symptom Checklist–90 (SCL-90; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711413074">Derogatis, Lipman, Rickels, Uhlenhuth, &amp; Covi, 1974</xref>), which was completed as part of the initial assessment of all adult ADHD patients. The SCL-90 is a 90-item self-report designed to screen for psychological problems and distress on nine dimensions yielding sum scores on each dimension. Each of the 90 items is rated on a 5-point scale of distress ranging from none to extreme. In addition, the SCL-90 provides a Global Severity Index (GSI). The SCL-90 has demonstrated satisfactory validity and internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711413074">Holi, Sammallahti, &amp; Aalberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054711413074">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Self-Report Questionnaires</title>
<sec id="section8-1087054711413074">
<title>Current Sociodemographic Characteristics</title>
<p>Information about age, gender, and level of education and occupational status were obtained from the participants using a self-report questionnaire. Occupational status refers to the individual’s source of income. The Norwegian social welfare system comprises social benefits such as unemployment benefit, sickness benefit, vocational rehabilitation, and medical rehabilitation. Due to their temporary nature, these categories are statistically pooled in one group, called temporary social benefit. Disability pension differs from temporary social benefits as it is most often a lifelong benefit obtained only when treatment and rehabilitation most likely will not enable the individual to attain a job again.</p>

<title>Current ADHD–ASRS</title>
<sec id="section10-1087054711413074">
<title>ASRS-version 1</title>
<p>The ASRS is the WHO’s self-report rating scale for adult ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711413074">Kessler, Adler, et al., 2005</xref>). This scale is designed to assess current ADHD symptoms and consists of 18 items based on the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnostic criteria for ADHD. The items are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4: <italic>never/seldom</italic> to <italic>often</italic>), with a possible total range of 0 to 72. Higher scores indicate higher frequencies of symptoms and symptom load. The scale is organized in two sections, each with its own sum score. Items 1 to 9 (Part A) reflects symptoms of inattention and items 10 to 18 (Part B) reflects symptoms of impulsivity or hyperactivity. Internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha for ASRS in the data set was .86 for Part A and .86 for Part B.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 16. We used nonparametric test statistics and <italic>t</italic> tests to describe distributions of sociodemographic and clinical variables in the sample. We conducted bivariate correlation analyses to explore correlations between possible predictor variables. To test the hypothesis of predictors, we used a hierarchical multiple regression model using time being in work for the last 12 months as the outcome variable.</p>

<sec id="section13-1087054711413074">
<title>Sociodemographic Characteristics</title>
<p>Mean age for the total sample was 33.7 years ranging from 18 to 63 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.7). A total of 71 patients (48.3%) reported junior high school as their highest level of education and 13 (8.9%) had attained college or university. A total of 48 patients (33.3%) were receiving disability pension and 55 (38.2%) received some type of temporary social benefit. A total of 32 patients (22.2%) reported ordinary work as their source of income at the time of data collection, whereas 9 (6.2%) were students. In total, 52 patients (44.4%) had not been in work or studies for the last 12 months, 18 (15.4%) had been working or studying for 1 to 4 months, 9 (7.7%) for 5 to 8 months, and 38 (32.5%) for 9 to 12 months. There were no significant gender differences in sociodemographic characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1087054711413074">
<title>Clinical Characteristics</title>
<p>Only 23 patients (16.5%) had been diagnosed with ADHD by the age of 18. Almost all patients included in the analysis (90.2%) had received treatment during their contact with child or adult psychiatry. First treatment with central stimulants by age groups showed that 23 (17.4%) of the patients had started central stimulant treatment by the age of 18 or earlier, 45 (34.1%) had started between the age of 19 and 30, 40 (30.3%) had started between the age of 31 and 40, and 24 (18.2%) had started by the age of 41 or above. Current status for central stimulant treatment showed that 61 out of 94 patients (64.9%) were receiving this treatment when data were collected.</p>
<p>The total ASRS mean score was 46.88 (<italic>SD =</italic> 11.65), with a mean of 23.97 (<italic>SD =</italic> 6.5) for Part A and 22.80 (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.4) for Part B.</p>
<p>For ADHD subtypes, we found significant gender differences as 20 (26.7%) women versus 5 (7.5%) men had the inattentive subtype (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), whereas 53 (70.7%) women versus 62 (92.5%) men had the combined type (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Only 2 patients had the impulsive or hyperactive subtype.</p>
<p>Lifetime depressive disorder was the most prevalent comorbid disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 54; 37.8%). A total of 41 patients (28.1%) had lifetime substance abuse, 34 (23.3%) had lifetime alcohol abuse, and 21 (14.6%) had lifetime anxiety disorders. In total, 11 men (16.2%) versus 2 (2.6%) women had comorbid ASPD, which was a significant gender difference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). We also found gender differences in substance abuse, with 25 males (36.2%) versus 16 women (20.8%) having this disorder (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). A total of 8 females (10.5%) had comorbid borderline personality disorder versus none of the males (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The mean of SCL-90 GSI in the whole sample was 1.51 (<italic>SD</italic> = .76), with significant higher GSI scores for females, 1.77 (<italic>SD</italic> = .84) versus 1.30 (<italic>SD =</italic> .63), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The overall gender ratio of the 149 clinically recruited adults with ADHD in this study was almost even and similar to some other recent European studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711413074">Halmoy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711413074">Sobanski et al., 2007</xref>). This could support recent findings suggesting a more equal distribution of prevalence between men and women today compared with what has previously been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711413074">Staller &amp; Faraone, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A major finding in this study was the high impairment in terms of low educational attainment and poor occupational outcomes. Approximately 48% of the participants had junior high school as their highest degree of education compared with 29.8% in the general Norwegian population in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054711413074">Statistics Norway, 2010</xref>). Thus, more than half of the sample had an educational level not suited for most domains in the work market. Only 8.9% reported having a college or university degree, compared with 20.8% in the general Norwegian population at the time of data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054711413074">Statistics Norway, 2010</xref>). Although we found that participation in work or studies varied within the last 12 months, only 22.2% of the participants had ordinary work as their source of income at the time of data collection compared with 72% in the general Norwegian population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711413074">Statistics Norway, 2011</xref>). These results show that deficits associated with occupational outcome were highly prevalent in the sample. We found lower employment figures than what has been reported in some other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711413074">Able, Johnston, Adler, &amp; Swindle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711413074">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711413074">Sobanski et al., 2007</xref>). However, one should also keep in mind earlier findings, suggesting that unemployment might be related to other symptoms and deficits than what is counted for by ADHD alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054711413074">Young et al., 2003</xref>). Adding to the high proportion being out of work, we found a high prevalence of social security benefit among the patients as approximately 33% reported receiving disability pension and 38% reported receiving temporary social benefits. The high prevalence of social security benefits and low participation in work life implies that many of the patients in the present study still have unsolved functional deficits. We found no significant gender differences in sociodemographic variables.</p>
<p>A clinically important finding was the fact that only 17.4% of the participants had been treated with central stimulants by the age of 18. Results from a recent Norwegian study suggest that early recognition and drug treatment of ADHD might protect against occupational impairment in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711413074">Halmoy et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The sample was characterized by severely impaired adults with ADHD. There were no significant differences between the genders in symptoms. However, there were significant gender differences in both ADHD subtype and comorbidities. More women than men had the inattentive subtype, whereas more men than women had the combined type. Contrary to this, another recent study showed that for all groups of subtypes men were more present than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711413074">Cumyn et al., 2009</xref>). Also unlike the findings in the present study, similarities between women and men in subtype prevalence have been documented earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711413074">Biederman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711413074">Rasmussen &amp; Levander, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711413074">Biederman et al. (2004)</xref>, we found significantly more men than women having comorbid substance abuse and ASPD. The prevalence of ASPD was lower in our sample (9.0%) than what has been reported in some other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711413074">Biederman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711413074">Torgersen et al., 2006</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711413074">Cumyn et al. (2009)</xref> reported prevalence of ASPD in the combined subtype close to the findings of this study.</p>
<p>More women than men had comorbid borderline personality disorder. Approximately 19% of the participants had received a diagnosis of personality disorder, which is lower than reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711413074">Dalsgaard, Mortensen, Frydenberg, &amp; Thomsen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711413074">Fischer, Barkley, Smallish, &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>) but almost in line with another study from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711413074">Rasmussen &amp; Levander, 2009</xref>). We also found significant differences between women and men in symptom load as measured by the SCL-90 GSI with significant higher GSI scores for women.</p>
<p>Correlation analyses showed that age of central stimulant treatment start and ASRS inattentiveness were significantly negatively correlated with degree of occupational participation. The regression analysis showed that early central stimulant treatment was a significant predictor of occupational outcome. This is in line with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711413074">Halmoy et al. (2009)</xref>. We also found that ASRS inattentiveness negatively predicted degree of occupational participation. A recent study has reported a strong relationship between the number of ADHD symptoms and degree of general impairment, including work functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711413074">Mannuzza et al., 2011</xref>), and a comprehensive review of follow-up and cross-sectional studies concluded that no other identified factor than ADHD per se predicted occupational outcome in adults with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711413074">Barkley et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings that symptoms of inattentiveness predicted occupational status add to this research. Contrary to what has been reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711413074">Halmoy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711413074">Sobanski et al., 2007</xref>), we found no effect from comorbidity on occupational outcome, and our findings are in line with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711413074">Barkley et al. (2008)</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section18-1087054711413074">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>As in most clinical samples, our data were not perfectly normally distributed, hence cautions should be taken in generalizing our findings to the ADHD population. The response rate was approximately 32%, and this might raise questions about external validity of the findings. However, the ADHD symptom load and prevalence of comorbidity in this study is comparable to findings in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711413074">Halmoy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711413074">Sobanski et al., 2007</xref>). Another limitation is the use of retrospective collected data from patients’ medical records. This method could result in larger variability in data quantity and quality between patients. This is especially the case for comorbidity data, as the quality of information will be more variable and uncertain. Due to this problem, we have only included a comorbid diagnosis if the patient’s journal showed that the patient clearly fulfilled the criteria for a <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnosis. Our sample was recruited by postal invitations, requiring the patients to both complete questionnaires and returning their responses by postal mail. These efforts could have led to a bias resulting in a healthier sample of adults with ADHD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1087054711413074">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>There are important implications from the findings in this study. First, we found a very high prevalence of functional impairment in our sample, with a large number of patients reporting poor educational achievement. Moreover, compared with the general population very few had ordinary work as their source of income. These findings suggest that impaired function in important domains of life is still an unsolved clinical challenge.</p>
<p>Second, the fact that only a small number of the participants were offered central stimulant treatment by the age of 18 has caused a more severe course for many of the patients in the sample. Early detection and treatment of ADHD seems to have a protective effect on later occupational outcome. However, more studies are needed to further investigate the impact of early detection and early treatment of ADHD on adult occupational outcome.</p>
