<abstract>
<p>This paper presents experimental results of a study conducted to investigate the use of filament-wound fiber-reinforced polymer tubes as a stay-in-place structural formwork for concrete beams. The experimental study was carried out on a total of seven concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer tube beams of 213 mm diameter and 2000 mm long. Five concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer tube beams and two control specimens without tube were tested under four-point bending. One control specimen was reinforced with spiral steel while the other had no transverse reinforcement. The test parameters used in this investigation include the type of internal reinforcement (steel or glass fiber-reinforced polymer bars), the type of transverse reinforcement (spiral-steel or fiber-reinforced polymer tube), fiber-reinforced polymer tube thickness and the concrete compressive strength. The fiber orientations of the tubes were mainly in the hoop direction. The test result indicated that the two control specimens failed in shear; however, using glass fiber-reinforced polymer tubes instead of transverse spiral-steel changed the mode of failure of the five concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer tube beams to flexural failure. The experimental cracking moments of the steel and fiber-reinforced polymer-concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer tube beams were compared to theoretical predictions provided by North American codes, design guidelines and the available equations in the literature. The test results indicate that the fiber-reinforced polymer tube enhances the crack and ultimate moment capacities of the test specimens, whereas it provides a longitudinal reinforcement in the tension side. In addition, improvement to the crack moment equation is suggested to account for the effect of confinement.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412450083" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Corrosion of steel reinforcement causes continual degradation to the infrastructures worldwide and it has prompted the need for challenges to those involved with reinforced concrete structures. In the last decade, considerable efforts have been made to apply fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) composites in the construction industry, and recently, structural applications of FRP composites started to appear in civil infrastructure systems. FRP composite materials have been used as internal and external reinforcement in the field of civil engineering constructions. It has been used as internal reinforcement for beams, slabs and pavements,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412450083">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412450083">2</xref></sup> and also as external reinforcement for rehabilitation and strengthening different structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412450083">3</xref></sup> Recently, the use of FRP tubes as structurally integrated stay-in-place forms for concrete members, such as beams, columns, bridge piers, piles and fender piles has emerged as an innovative solution to the corrosion problem. In such integrated systems, the FRP tubes may act as a permanent form, often as a protective jacket for concrete, and especially as external reinforcement in the primary and secondary directions such as for confinement. Furthermore, the use of concrete filled-FRP tubes (CFFTs) technique is predicated on performance attributes linked to their high strength-to-weight ratios, expand the service life of structures, enhanced corrosion resistance and potentially high durability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412450083">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412450083">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In fact, extensive research programs have been conducted to investigate the behavior of concrete columns confined with FRP sheets and FRP tubes under pure compression load.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412450083">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412450083">11</xref></sup> However, relatively few studies have focused on static flexural strength of CFFT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412450083">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412450083">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412450083">13</xref></sup> To date, only two studies have been reported in the literature on flexural behavior of CFFT beams reinforced with longitudinal FRP or steel bars.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412450083">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412450083">15</xref></sup> The experimental test results of five reinforced CFFT and two reinforced concrete (RC) beams indicated that CFFT beams performed substantially better than beams with a steel spiral. Unlike CFFT with FRP rebar, CFFTs with steel rebar failed in a sequential progressive manner, leading to considerable ductility and strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412450083">15</xref></sup> Also, it was concluded that the most critical parameter affecting the behavior of steel-reinforced CFFT beams was steel reinforcement ratio: when increased, it improved stiffness, strength and ductility. Furthermore, Cole and Fam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412450083">15</xref></sup> reported that increasing the proportion of fibers in the axial direction of the tube or increasing concrete compressive strength tends to increase strength and stiffness, only after yielding of rebar.</p>
<p>The objective of the present study is to examine the flexural behavior of reinforced CFFT beams. New glass FRP (GFRP) tubes were used to act as stay-in-place formwork for beams. The fiber orientations of these tubes were mainly in the hoop direction. The experimental investigation included a total of seven beam specimens, approximately 213 mm in diameter and 2.00 m in length, tested in four-point bending. In the following sections, full details about the experimental program of this study and the considered parameters are provided as well as the analysis of experimental test results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0731684412450083"><title>Research significant</title>
<p>From the available literature on the CFFT technique, it is clear that the amount of the experimental works on specimens reinforced with longitudinal steel or FRP bars are very limited. It is obvious that further experimental research is required on CFFT beams with internal reinforcement. The research reported in this paper evaluates the flexural behavior of CFFT beams using new FRP tubes and considering the effect of concrete strength, thickness of FRP tubes and the type of internal and transverse reinforcements. In addition, the paper examines the validity as well as providing modifications of the available design provisions for predicting the cracking moments of the steel and FRP-reinforced CFFT beams.</p>

<p>All the specimens in this study were constructed from two concrete batches named (N and M). Concrete batches were supplied by ready mix concrete supplier. The maximum size of the coarse aggregates was about 20 mm. Overall, 10 plain concrete cylinders (152 mm diameter and 305 mm height) were prepared from each concrete batch and cured under the same conditions as the test specimens. The 28-day average concrete compressive strength was found equal to 30 ± 0.6 and 45 ± 0.5 MPa for the first and second batch, respectively. Also, the average tensile strength obtained by performing split cylinder tests on five specimens was found equal to 3.0 and 3.8 MPa for N and M, respectively.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0731684412450083"><title>Steel bars</title>
<p>In this study, two different steel bars were used to reinforce the CFFT and control specimens. Mild steel bars of 3.4 mm diameter were used as spiral reinforcement for the control specimens. Deformed steel bars No. 15 M were used as internal reinforcement for the CFFT beams. The mechanical properties of the steel bars were obtained from standard tests that were carried out according to ASTM A615/A615M-09,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412450083">16</xref></sup> on five specimens for each type of the steel bars.

<p>GFRP tubes were used as structural stay-in-place formwork for the CFFT specimens of this study. Two different types of the GFRP tubes, namely, D and E were used with different thicknesses and having the same internal diameter. The tubes were manufactured using continuous filament winding process adopted by FRE Composites (St-Andre-d’Argenteuil, Quebec, Canada). E-glass fiber and Epoxy resin were utilized for manufacturing these tubes. The glass fiber volume fraction as provided by the manufacture was 68% ± 3%. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412450083">Table 3</xref> shows the details of fiber orientations, stacking sequences, thickness and internal diameter for each type of the tubes. The thickness of tube E was almost double of tube type D. Different fiber angles with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tubes were used. The winding angles of the tubes D were optimized for below underground pipe applications, while tubes E were designed for pipe telecommunication applications. The tubes were provided with a total length equal to 6000 mm.

<p>The FRP tubes were cut to the proper length (2.00 m), using saw and then were cleaned and dried carefully. The FRP tubes provided the formwork for beam specimens. Reinforcement cages with different configuration were constructed from GFRP and steel bars. The rebar cage was designed to have an outside diameter of 193 mm, allowing for 10 mm clear cover on all perimeters of the FRP tubes, which has a 213 mm internal diameter. The cages of the RCFFT specimens had six longitudinal bars (#5 glass FRP bars or 15 M steel bars). The longitudinal bars were held in its positions at equal intervals using three hoop steel stirrups (3.4 mm diameter) at the two ends and middle length of the cages. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412450083">Figure 3</xref> shows the typical steel and glass FRP cages. The control specimens were prepared for vertical casting using stiff cardboard tubes. The cardboard tubes were attached with four vertical stiffeners using wood plate of 50 × 30 mm, cross-section distributed at the perimeter of the tube, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412450083">Figure 4</xref>(a).

<p>The specimens were tested in four-point bending over a simply supported clear span of 1920 mm, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412450083">Figure 5</xref>. The deflections were measured using three linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) at the mid-span and at each quarter-span to monitor the deflection profile along the beams. Two high-accuracy LVDTs (±0.001 mm) were installed at the mid-span to measure the crack width. Also, one LVDT was attached at each support, to measure beam end rotations. In addition, two high-accuracy LVDTs (±0.001 mm) were installed at the end of the beams to measure the slip between concrete core and FRP tube. On the other hand, electrical resistance strain gauges were attached to the reinforcing bars, concrete surface and FRP tube surface. In each beam, two electrical strain gauges of type KFG-6-120-C1-11L3M3R and gauge length 6 mm were bonded on the longitudinal reinforcing bars at mid-span to measure tensile strains. In addition, two electrical strain gauges of length 67 mm were bonded on the top surface of the RC beams at mid-span to measure the concrete compressive strains. A total of 12 electrical resistance strain gauges (KFG-6-120-C1-11L3M3R) were affixed to the outside surface of each tube at its mid-span section. Six were in the hoop direction, while the other six were in the longitudinal direction. The strain gages were distributed evenly around the section at 60° angles. In additional, three strain gauges, in a rosette pattern, were fixed to the out surface of the FRP tubes to measure the hoop, diagonal and longitudinal strains at the mid-height of the beam specimens, at the middle of the shear span, at the two different sides of the beams. The GFRP tubes’ surfaces were sanded to remove the protective UV coating before installation of strain gauges.

<p>The load was transferred from the actuator to the tested beam at two points through a steel spreader I-beam, applied on the round surface of the beams through curved loading plates. A roller support was obtained by placing a steel cylinder between two steel flat plates. A pin support was obtained using specially adapted steel I-beam. The upper plate of the I-beam had spherical groove and the plate was supported on the web plate, which had a spherical end to house the plate and allow the rotation. Curved steel plates were connected at the top of the pin and roller supports, to cradle the beams against side movement, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412450083">Figure 5</xref>. During the test, the load was monotonically applied at a stroke controlled rate of 0.8 mm/min using a 500 kN closed-loop MTS actuator. The MTS actuator, strain gauges and LVDTs were connected by three 40 channels Data Acquisition System.</p>

<p>All the five CFFT beams of this study failed in flexure due to the tensile rupture of FRP tubes and reinforcing bars at the tension side. While the two RC beams without and with steel spiral failed in shear and shear-compression, respectively. A summary of the beam test results is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684412450083">Table 4</xref>, in terms of the yield and ultimate loads and the ductility.

<sec id="sec13-0731684412450083"><title>Effect of type of shear reinforcements</title>
<p>The influence of the confinement using steel spiral or FRP tubes of the three beams (CO-S-N, COS-S-N and D-S-N) that were reinforced internally with steel bars is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412450083">Figure 6</xref>. The load–deflection was bilinear for the two beams COS-S-N and D-S-N, and linear for beam CO-S-N. The two beams with transverse reinforcement (COS-S-N and D-S-N) showed elastic–plastic behavior and failed at large deflection. Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412450083">Figure 6</xref> shows the brittle failure of the beam, which had no transverse reinforcement (CO-S-N). The yield load of CFFT beam (D-S-N) occurred at load level higher than that RC beam (COS-S-N) which, in turn, had a higher yield load of the beam (CO-S-N). The yield load for the RC beam (COS-S-N) is 70% that of the CFFT beam (D-S-N) and the corresponding value for the RC beam (CO-S-N) is 66%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412450083">Figure 6</xref> indicates that the beam confined by FRP tube (D-S-N) experienced lower deflection, higher stiffness and superior strength (55% higher) than the beam reinforced with steel spiral. The initial stiffness and the stiffness after yielding of specimen D-S-N was approximately 61% and 49% higher than that of the beam reinforced with a steel spiral, COS-S-N. This is attributed to the contribution of the helical fibers of the FRP tubes to provide shear and flexural resistance to the beam, and to confine a much larger concrete cross-sectional area than steel spiral. The most important difference that can be observed is the ductility of the tested beams. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684412450083">Table 4</xref> presents the ductility of the seven beams as measured by the energy absorption. Energy absorption is one of the important deformational characteristics of concrete structure to determine the ductility of the structure. The energy absorption was determined in this study as the area under the load–displacement curve. The integration of the load–displacement curve was performed numerically from the experimental data of the load versus displacement along the whole load history. D-S-N exhibited great ductility, with sequential failure and residual strength at very large deflection (125 mm). As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684412450083">Table 4</xref>, the ductility index of D-S-N is 82% higher than that of COS-S-N. This result is consistent with the test results as discussed in previous studies by Fam et al.<sup>18</sup> 2007 and Cole and Fam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412450083">15</xref></sup>

Since, FRP reinforcing bars are linear-elastic to failure when loaded in tension and fail in a brittle manner, a ductile steel-like failure does not occur in FRP-reinforced concrete beams. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412450083">Figure 7</xref> shows the elastic–plastic behavior of the steel-reinforced beam D-S-N and their eventual failure at larger deflection as compared with the elastic behavior of FRP-reinforced beams D-G-N. The behavior of FRP reinforced CFFT beam showed no yielding as compared with the steel reinforced CFFT beam. The figure indicates that the beam reinforced with steel bars experienced lower deflection, higher stiffness and higher strength than the FRP-CFFT beam. The ratio of the strength of FRP-RCFFT beams to that of steel-RCFFT beams was approximately 60%. This ratio approximately equals the cube root of axial stiffness ratio between glass and steel bars <inline-formula id="ilm1-0731684412450083"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0731684412450083"><mml:mrow><mml:mroot><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>fl</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>fl</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>sl</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>sl</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mroot></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (the corresponding beam had the same reinforcement ratio). In addition, the post-cracking flexural stiffness for the beam reinforced with steel bars is higher than that of RCFFT beam reinforced with glass FRP bars. The average ratio between the post-cracking flexural stiffness of the steel to FRP-CFFT beams was approximately 3.9. This ratio was approximately the same as the ratio of the modulus of elasticity of steel to that of glass FRP bars as it was 4.1. Consequently, it can be concluded that the post-cracking flexural stiffness of the FRP-RCFFT beams to that of steel-RCFFT beams is the same as the ratio of the axial stiffness of FRP reinforcing bars to the axial stiffness of steel bars. On the other hand, the most important significant behavior is the difference in the ductility between the steel-CFFT beam and FRP-CFFT beam. The ductility index of D-S-N is 5.6 times that of D-G-N. This is attributed to the elastic–plastic behavior of the steel bars as compared with the linear elastic behavior of FRP bars.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412450083">Figure 8</xref> presents the effect of the FRP tube thickness through the test results of specimens D-G-N and E-G-N. The load–deflection plots for the two beams exhibited similar characteristics. The CFFT beam of tube type E showed lower deflection than beam of tube type D, at all load levels. Increasing the FRP tube reinforcement ratio by 120% (using tube E instead of tube D) increased the flexural strength and the energy absorption on average by 20% and 58%. It is clear that the increase in the flexural strength (20%) is not significant as compared by the increase in the FRP tube reinforcement ratio. The increase in the flexural strength is mainly attributed to the contribution of the increase in the thickness of the FRP tubes in the tension side of the beams. However, the increases in the thickness in the shear span and at the compression side are attributed to increase in the shear and compressive strengths of the beams, respectively. This was evident either by crushing or shear failure did not occur for all the CFFT beams compared to steel spiral RC beams. On the other hand, it is found that the average ratio of the experimental flexural strength is equal to the 3.5 root of the axial stiffness ratio (axial modulus of elasticity multiplied by the FRP tube thickness) between the two tubes,<inline-formula id="ilm2-0731684412450083"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-0731684412450083"><mml:mrow><mml:mroot><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>fl</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>FRP</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>fl</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>FRP</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mroot></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. For the two beams, the post-cracking flexural stiffness for the RCFFT beam constructed from tube type E is higher than that of RCFFT beam constructed from tube type D.

The average ratio between the post-cracking flexural stiffness of the RCFFT beams constructed from tubes type E and type D was approximately 1.85.

<sec id="sec16-0731684412450083"><title>Effect of concrete compressive strength</title>
<p>The influence of the concrete compressive strength on the load–deflection responses of the four beams (D-S-N, D-G-N, D-S-M and D-G-M) that contained identical internal reinforcement ratio of steel or FRP bars and constructed from the FRP tubes type D or E is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412450083">Figure 9</xref>. The figure indicated that, for the two CFFT beams constructed from concrete type N (30 MPa), the initial and post-cracking flexural stiffness were similar to that of the two CFFT beams constructed from concrete of type M (45 MPa). It was observed that the two types of concrete considered in this study did not have significant effect on the flexural capacities of CFFT beams reinforced with steel bars (D-S-M versus D-S-N). Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412450083">Figure 9</xref> indicates that the increase in the flexural strength for beam reinforced with GFRP bars is not significant with increasing the concrete strength from 30 MPa (D-G-N) to 45 MPa (D-G-M), Specimen D-G-M having only 4.8% higher strength than that of D-G-N. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684412450083">Table 4</xref> indicates that the increase in the energy absorption is not significant as compared with the increase in the concrete compressive strength 50% (from 30 to 45 MPa) for the tested CFFT beams. The increase in the energy absorption is limited to 3%, for the beams reinforced with steel bars, with increasing the concrete compressive strength. The corresponding value for the beams reinforced with FRP bars is 11%. It can be concluded that the flexural behavior of the four CFFT beams tested in this study was not significantly affected with increasing the concrete compressive strength from 30 to 45 MPa. This is attributed to the two factors. First, the four CFFT beams failed in flexural due to the tensile rupture of the FRP tube and FRP or steel bars at the tension side of the beam. Second, the FRP tubes confined the concrete core of the beams. This was recognized from the final failure mode as the concrete core inside the FRP tube at the compression side did not experience crushes or spalls as compared with failure mode of the control RC beams.

<sec id="sec17-0731684412450083"><title>Failure modes</title>
<p>All CFFT specimens failed by flexural-tension failure, except the two control specimens, CO-S-N and COS-S-N, which failed in shear span. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412450083">Figure 10</xref> shows the different failure modes for the control and CFFT specimens of this study. In specimen COS-S-N with spiral steel, crushing of the concrete occurred at the two points of loading after yielding the flexural reinforcements, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412450083">Figure 10</xref>(b). In addition, rupture of spiral steel was observed after the test at the mid-shear span at the level of mid height of the beam. Flexural failure is the final failure mode for all CFFT beams with different character as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412450083">Figure 10</xref>(c). The flexural failure of the CFFT beam reinforced with steel bars (D-S-N and D-S-M) started by the rupture of the FRP tube in the maximum tension moment zone. The rupture occurred beyond the yield of the tension steel bars and at the end of the plastic stage with a drop in the flexural load. After that, the deflection increased significantly combined with a reduction in the load carrying capacity. However, the complete failure occurred after the first and second cut of the steel bars in the tension side. On the other hand, the flexure failure of FRP-reinforced CFFT beams started by rupture of the longitudinal GFRP rebar followed by rupture of the tube. It was also noted that local buckling of the tube occurred at the top zone of the beam in the mid-span prior to the failure. White patches were observed forming hoop cracks at the surrounding area of the FRP tubes during the plastic stages of the loading, especially at tension side of the beam. After finishing the test, the FRP tubes were removed for all beams to check the crack patterns of the concrete core. It was evident that no crushing occurred for the concrete at the maximum compression moment zone. Also, uniform flexural cracks were observed in the flexural span between the two concentrated loads, where the bending stress is high and shear stress is zero. Also, no significant shear cracks were observed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412450083">Figure 10</xref>(d). This resulted from confining the concrete core by FRP tube, which increased the shear strength of the beam, and changed the shear failure to flexural failure mode.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684412450083">Figure 11</xref>(a) shows the measured mid-span strains in the reinforcements (steel and FRP bars) at the tension side as well as in the concrete and FRP tubes at the compression side versus the applied load for the tested beams. The maximum compression strain at failure was 2633 micro-strain for the RC beam with no transverse reinforcements, CO-S-N. This value is less than the ultimate useable strain (3000 micro-strain), indicating that no flexural-compression failure had occurred at the onset of shear failure. The corresponding value for the spiral-steel beams (COS-S-N) was 3959 micro-strain. This value is higher than the ultimate useable strain, indicating that the shear failure occurred accompanied with flexural compression failure. On the other hand, the maximum measured compression strain for the steel-CFFT beams in the FRP tube at the compression side were 15516 and 10629 micro-strain for D-S-N and D-S-M, respectively, these values present 70% and 50% of the ultimate strains of the FRP tubes. While the corresponding values for the glass FRP-CFFT beams ranged from 5415 to 4064 micro-strain, which are quite below (76% to 81% less) the ultimate strains of the FRP tubes. These results indicate that no compression flexural failure had occurred for the steel and FRP-CFFT beams at the onset of tensile flexural failure.

<p>For the steel-CFFT beams, the maximum measured tensile strains in the steel bars on average ranged from 15000 to 15500 micro-strains. These values approximately are the same value of the ultimate tensile strain of the steel bars. This indicates that the steel-CFFT beam failed at onset of flexural tensile failure, whereas the FRP tube strain at the compression side were quite below the ultimate FRP tube strain. For the FRP-CFFT beams, it can be noted that after cracking, the compression strains of FRP tubes and tension strains of FRP bars vary almost linearly with the increased load. Also, for the steel-CFFT beams, the load–compression strain relationships of the FRP tubes after cracking are bilinear up to failure, where the bend point occurred on the curve after yielding stages. Also, the load–tension strain curves of the steel bars present elastic–plastic responses up to failure. It can be noticed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684412450083">Figure 11</xref>(a) that the increase in the thickness of the FRP tube (from tube D to E) decreased significantly both the compression and tension strains of the FRP tubes and FRP bars, respectively, that measured at the same load level. The similar behavior was observed, as using the steel bars instead of FRP bars decreased significantly the compression and tension strains measured at the same load level.</p>

For the RC beams, strain distribution remains linear up to failure. Also, for the RCFFT beams up to 50% of the ultimate load, the strain distribution remains approximately linear; however, beyond that level, RCFFT beams begin to exhibit non-linear strain distribution. The figure indicates that the highest tensile and compressive strains are observed for the steel-RCFFT beams and D-S-N. It appears from this figure that that the neutral axis is located within a region of 0.25 to 0.35.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684412450083">Figure 12</xref> shows the typical measured mid-span hoop strains in the FRP tube versus the applied load for the tested beams. The hoop strains were measured at four different levels through the depth of the beams. The hoop strains A and D were located at the top and bottom surface of the beam, respectively, while hoop strains B and C were located at the D/4 from the top and bottom surface of the beams, respectively. The figure indicated that lateral compressive strains were developed on the tension side of the beams. This attributed to the tensile strain of the beam in the longitudinal direction, which in turn develops compression strain in the hoop direction due to the Poisson’s ratio effect of the tube. The maximum measured lateral strains at these locations on average ranged from 500 to 1000 micro-strains. However, these values are quite below the FRP hoop strain of the FRP tubes used in this study. This reflects the insignificant confinement effect of the FRP tube in flexure at the middle zone of the beam. On the other hand, the figure indicates that lateral tensile strains were developed on the compression side of the beams (locations A and B). The figure shows that the lateral strain at this location increased excessively as the load increased. The load–strain curves were almost bilinear. The maximum measured strains at ultimate on average ranged from 2000 to 4000 micro-strains. This indicates that the FRP tubes are activated to confine the concrete core more as the load increase.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0731684412450083">Figure 13</xref> shows strain gauges measurements taken on the concrete and FRP tubes surfaces of RC and RCFFT beams. H, I and V represent the horizontal, diagonal and vertical strains measurements at mid-depth of the mid-shear span of the beams. The strain rosette (three strain gauges H, I and V) was recorded at the right and left hand of the mid-shear span of the beams. The figures indicate that the vertical strains develop tensile strain (positive), the maximum measured vertical strains on average ranged from 100 to 400 micro-strains, except the vertical strains of steel-RCFFT beams reached on average to 500 micro-strains. However, these values are quite below as compared with the axial or hoop strain of the FRP tubes. This reflects the insignificant confinement effect of the FRP tube in shear at the mid-span of the beam. On the other hand, it is obvious that the horizontal strains are approximately coinciding with diagonal strains up to failure. The maximum measured horizontal and diagonal strains for RCFFT beams on average ranged from 1500 to 2500 micro-strains. For the control specimens, the horizontal and diagonal strains increased progressively after yielding or cracking for the steel-RC and FRP-RC beams, respectively. This indicates vulnerability of the beam to shear failure as it was evident from the final failure modes for the RC beams (shear failure). The figures also show that for all RCFFT beams the mid-span flexural strains are higher than the measured shear strain rosette in the three directions (H, I and V). This indicates that the tested RCFFT beams of this study were flexure-critical rather shear-critical, as it was evident from the failure modes for all RCFFT beam, flexural failure. It can be noticed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0731684412450083">Figure 13</xref> that the increase in the thickness of the FRP tube (from tube D to E) decreased both the horizontal and the diagonal strains that measured at the same load level. The similar behavior was observed, as using the steel bars instead of FRP bars decreased the horizontal and diagonal strains measured at the same load level.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0731684412450083">Figure 14</xref> shows that the first cracking in the concrete occurs at a relatively low load level compared to the ultimate load. The cracking load ranged between 11.99 and 12.14 kN for the RC beams and ranged between 15.90 and 19.88 kN for the RCFFT beams. These values are approximately 7.50%–11.68% of the ultimate load. It can be noticed from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684412450083">Table 4</xref> that, there is a difference in the flexural cracking load. The beam reinforced transversely with FRP tube cracked at a load higher than that of the beam reinforced with steel spiral or without. The average cracking loads of the beam reinforced with steel spiral or without are 88.5% and 80% of that the beam reinforced with FRP tubes. This difference in the flexural cracking load may be attributed to the positive contribution of the FRP tubes to increase the axial stiffness of the beam as compared with that of the steel spiral reinforced beams. Also, the RCFFT beams reinforced with steel bars cracked at a load higher than that of the RCFFT beams reinforced with FRP bars. The average cracking load of RCFFT beams reinforced with steel bars is 81% that of the RCFFT beams reinforced with FRP bars. The difference in the flexural cracking load may be attributed to the difference in the axial stiffness of the longitudinal reinforcement (steel and FRP bars). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684412450083">Table 4</xref> gives the yield load for the RC and RCFFT beams reinforced with steel bars. The yield load for RC beams without and with steel spiral reinforcement (CO-S-N and COS-S-N) occurred at 75% and 54% of the ultimate load, respectively, and the corresponding value for the RCFFT beams (D-S-N and D-S-M) are 50% and 52%, respectively. The yield load for the beam reinforced with FRP tube type D (D-S-N) yielded at load higher than that of the beam reinforced with steel spiral reinforcement (COS-S-N) which, in turn, had a higher yield load of the beam without transverse reinforcement (CO-S-N). The yield load for the beam reinforced with steel spiral reinforcement (COS-S-N) is 70% that of the beam reinforced with FRP tube type D (D-S-N) and the corresponding value for the beam without transverse reinforcement (CO-S-N) is 66%. On the other hand, the yield load for the RCFFT beam constructed from concrete type M (D-S-M) yielded at load 7.5% higher than that of the RCFFT beam constructed from concrete type N.</p>

<sec id="sec23-0731684412450083"><title>Beam end rotation</title>
<p>The applied load versus end-rotation plot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0731684412450083">Figure 15</xref>) follows the same trend as the load–deflection curves for all RCFFT beams. The stiffer the longitudinal reinforcement in the specimen, the higher the slope of the load versus end-rotation plot. For all tested beams and at the same level of applied load, the beam reinforced with glass FRP bars experienced higher rotation than the beam reinforced with steel bars. This result indicates the effect of the modulus of elasticity of the reinforcing bars on the end-rotation of the beam. Similar to the effect of the modules of elasticity of the reinforcing bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0731684412450083">Figure 15</xref> indicates that the higher the FRP tube thickness (Type E), the smaller the end rotation. On the other hand, the rotations at the ultimate for the FRP-RCFFT beams (ranged from 2.7 o to 3.2 o) were quite below the recorded rotations for the steel-RCFFT beams.

This indicates that the CFFT beams have higher cracking strength than that conventional RC beams. The increase in the cracking moment is attributed to the improvement in the flexural tensile strength of the beams, which was resulted from the confinement of the concrete core inside the FRP tube and the contribution of the FRP tube in the tension side to the flexural capacity. In addition, casting the concrete in FRP tubes eliminates the initial cracks after the initial setting of the beams, and restrained the expansion of concrete during curing, which might have induced a state of chemical prestressing of the concrete. This result is consistent with the test results as reported by Fam.<sup>19</sup> The test results are used to modify the coefficient <italic>k</italic> of equation <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-0731684412450083">4(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula8-0731684412450083">b</xref>) to correlate the experimental with the theoretical results.

<p>On the other hand, the flexural behavior of CFFT beams was investigated by Fam<sup>19</sup> by testing CFFT beams with small and large diameters. The test results indicated that with <italic>k</italic> = 1.00 the ACI equation predicted well the experimental values. The proposed value for <italic>k</italic> by Fam<sup>19</sup> (1.0) is slightly higher than the proposed value (0.94) of the present study. The increase in the <italic>k</italic> value is attributed to the difference in the fiber orientation in the axial direction for the used FRP tubes. Whereas, the FRP tubes that had been used by Fam<sup>19</sup> included fiber in the axial directions much higher than that used in the present study, which in turn increased the cracking moment; this indicate that the value of <italic>k</italic> can be described based on the stiffness of the FRP tube in the hoop and axial directions. More research studies are required in this area to study the effect of fiber orientation of FRP tubes on the cracking moment behavior of CFFT beams.</p>

<p>This paper included experimental investigations on the flexural responses of CFFT beams. The experimental work included the testing of seven CFFT and RC beams with four various experimental test parameters, namely, type of transverse and longitudinal reinforcements, FRP tube thickness and concrete compressive strength. Based on the specific findings of this research, the following conclusions may be drawn:
<list id="list2-0731684412450083" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>All the CFFT beams tested to failure in this study, failed in flexure. However, diagonal tension failure at the shear span and shear compression failure were the final failure modes for the RC control beams without and with spiral steel, respectively.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The experimental test results indicated that the beams confined by FRP tubes experienced lower deflection, higher cracking load level, higher ductility, higher stiffness and superior strength than the beam reinforced with a spiral steel.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The strength, deflection and ductility of the CFFT beams were affected significantly by the axial stiffness of the FRP tubes. It was found that the average ratio of the experimental flexural strength was equal to 3.5 root of the axial stiffness ratio (axial modulus of elasticity multiplied by the FRP tube thickness) between the two tubes,<inline-formula id="ilm35-0731684412450083"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math35-0731684412450083"><mml:mrow><mml:mroot><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>fl</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>FRP</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mi>tube</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>No</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>fl</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>FRP</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mi>tube</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>No</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mroot></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where tube No.1 has smaller thickness.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For normal and medium strength concrete, the test results indicated that the ratio of the strength of FRP-RCFFT beams to that of steel-RCFFT beams was 60%.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>From the load–flexural hoop strain curves at the mid-span of the tested beams, it was confirmed that the FRP tubes were activated to confine the concrete core of the beam.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The test results indicated that the cracking moment of CFFT beams was occurred at a higher load level than that of RC beams. The equations provided by ACI 318-08 code and ACI 440.1R-06 design guidelines for reinforced concrete structures with steel and FRP bars, respectively, and both CAN-CSA S806-02-CSA standard A23.3 and CAN-CSA S6-06 codes underestimated the modulus of rupture of RCFFT beams. Based on the test results, a modification to the code and design guidelines equations was proposed for predicting the modulus of rupture of RCFFT beams.</p></list-item>
