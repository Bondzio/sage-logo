From the papers presented at this conference, we have selected three and added two more for this issue of <italic>Marketing Theory</italic>. As it turned out, the debates—and consequently, the articles in this issue—inadvertently turned toward the role of various crucial events and publications, various manifestary moments (Bode and Østergaard, this volume) and their consequential historical legacy. We wish to follow up on that unexpected turn in this editorial introduction.</p><p>We find it an ironic experience to introduce a series of articles that attempt to give an accounting of CCT’s past in order to argue for desired futures. The sense of irony inheres in the fact that we ourselves were actors in the history of events being described and evaluated. However, we also find that some of the evidentiary gaps, rhetorical agendas and theoretical positions create the contradictory echo typical of irony.</p><p>Much of this noise is attributable to the exclusive use of written documents as an evidentiary base, a problem well recognized in history but not well understood in marketing, since historical method has so little presence in this discipline. So, we decided to do a quick corrective exercise and pose a set of 10 questions to a short list of living sources—people who were instrumental in the birth of CCT, in Europe and America.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470593113479007">1</xref></sup> We got replies from Morris Holbrook, Russ Belk, John Sherry, Craig Thompson, Eric Arnould, Elizabeth Hirschman, Sidney Levy, Dennis Rook, David Mick, Barbara Phillips, Ed McQuarrie, Jeff Murray, Fuat Fırat and Markus Giesler in the North American scene as well as Stefania Borghini, Alan Bradshaw, Bernard Cova, Güliz Ger, Jacob Östberg, Nil Özçağlar-Toulouse, Stefano Pace, Diego Rinallo, Lorna Stevens, Pauline Maclaran and Luca Visconti in Europe. We wrote to, but did not get a response from a total of 18 other colleagues in Europe and North America, although several kindly offered their apologies.</p><p>The list was casual and the request was sent over the Christmas holidays with very little time to respond. Nevertheless, we received quite a bit of information in return—so much, in fact, that we cannot accommodate it all here and have promised to put the verbatim on the CCT web site for all to see. We are also considering a paper of our own, since the gaps we have observed raised theoretical and epistemological concerns. But that is for another day.</p><p>One of the key methodological challenges of a history—and always an important clue to the agenda of a historian—is the choice of dates, both beginning and end, for the narrative. In our little quick and dirty field experiment, the selection of the mid-1980s as the moment of a paradigm shift met quickly with the following comment from Sidney Levy:<disp-quote><p>The reference to the 1980s did amuse me, reminding me of a paper a student wrote for a class I taught about Marketing Behavior that said, ‘Ten years ago when the women’s movement began…’ After all, people began studying, thinking about, and writing about consumer culture in earnest when the ‘Consumer Revolution,’ began in the late 1940s and early 50s.</p></disp-quote>Russ Belk, too, was keen to provide a voluminous list of books (18 works) that could be viewed as “consumer research” published prior to 1980, nearly all from anthropology.</p><p>Here is yet another lesson in interpreting historical sources: we all see things through the lens of our own discipline and personal circumstances. Russ’ list did not include, for instance, Lydia Marie Child or Christine Fredericks or Hazel Kyrk, who were important authors in the history of what used to be called “home economics,” a field that certainly has substantial overlap with what we now call “consumer research,” but is often seen as feminine. And his list of theoretical sources did not include a single literary theorist. (Thompson, Arnould and Giesler in this volume similarly do not mention literary theorists in their “broad spectrum” of sources, then base their own argument on Bakhtin, without mentioning that he was a literary, not a social, theorist, and without explicating “heteroglossia” in the context of the term’s origin, a textual approach to the modern novel.)</p><p>Such omissions were particularly ironic since virtually every account of the origins of CCT pointed to the Symbolic Consumer Behavior conference in 1981, which was organized by Morris Holbrook and Elizabeth Hirschman. Both Hirschman and Holbrook were strongly concerned at the time with issues of aesthetics and symbolism. These concerns were consonant with other responses we received from this casual list, where scholars who were engaged at the time recalled an emphasis on validated interpretive methods, especially textual interpretation and a sudden reorientation of the field toward the realm of communication, by means of the symbolic. An article mentioned several times as having been an important opening shot in the movement was Holbrook’s “Out of Africa,” which was a textual interpretation of the film. Indeed, in the publications and events of the paradigm shift of the 1980s, the concern with goods as communication, as well as the textual properties of advertisements, accompanied by a serious romance with semiotics, is extremely salient in both the published record and the memories of our respondents. Yet, textual work makes little appearance in this issue’s essays. Indeed, the thrust of criticism here is more about some mythical postmodern theory having spent itself. The recharacterization of this turf as an exercise in social theory—excluding the inquiry into communication using interpretive methods—represents a notable divergence from either the written record or our respondents’ memories.</p><p>Another group that has differentiated from “mainstream” consumer behavior, in much the way CCT has, is the Transformative Consumer Research (TCR) group. The TCR cadre, many of whom were in the original band of fellow travelers, has a distinctly activist orientation, as opposed to the theoretical focus of CCT. The question of the role of activism is important because, for many, the spirit in the beginning of the paradigm shift was as much political as it was methodological or disciplinary. Many felt that marketing scholars overlooked the power imbalances and negative social effects that characterized the market—and asserted that mainstream scholars colluded with industry in an inappropriate way by declaring that the purpose of research should be to help marketing sell more things. Though we realize that the position taken by leading CCT scholars is often ostensibly political, many in the critical activist camp have felt marginalized since the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470593113479007">Arnould and Thompson (2005</xref>), a text that every article in this issue points to as foundational.</p><p>In fact, behind the scenes, this article became highly controversial because it was perceived to stake out limits to the inquiry of the group, in the process excluding the agendas and careers of several people who had been part of the “in crowd.” The most disaffected group was the political activists, particularly those with a Marxist bent. We found it interesting, for instance, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2a-1470593113479007">Moisander, Peñaloza and Valtonen (2009)</xref> were cited several times in this issue, without acknowledgment that this piece was responding to Arnould and Thompson’s exclusion of leftist research. Given this perspective, the proposal from Bradshaw et al. in this volume takes on a different importance, though we suspect the choice of communism as the preferred ideology would be controversial, even among the left wing of consumer behavior.</p><p>One can always expect that there will be important people and backstage events that simply will not make an appearance in the written record. Our living sources were at pains to give credit to open-minded journal editors, especially Rich Lutz (“he was very much a key actor and can rightly been seen as the godfather of the interpretive turn,” wrote Craig Thompson) as well as Hal Kassarjian and even Jim Bettman (this last being virtually impossible to discern from publications). Some authors who were extremely important early on have left the field, such as Grant McCracken and Doug Holt and others have died, such as Paul Anderson and Barbara Stern. Behind the scenes, it was a small group gathered for the gender conference at Wisconsin who decided, quite informally and abruptly, to start an “interpretivist” conference (this was before Arnould and Thompson coined “CCT”). Russ Belk and John Sherry chaired the first one, but they were not acting alone.</p><p>In looking around us to take note of who among the original band are now missing, as well as which concerns have dropped out of the discourse, we noted the near-total demise of feminist theory. Though several of the leading feminist voices—Eileen Fischer, Pauline MacLaren, Lorna Stevens, Elizabeth Hirschman and Linda Scott—are still active, the political voice of feminist theory, which made a big splash in the mid-1990s, has grown silent. An absence of that particular voice is especially tragic since several of our respondents, including some of the men, noted how unfriendly marketing had been to women in their careers. One might also point out that women in the developed world today account for more than 80% of consumer decision-making. In the developing world, this number is estimated at 66% and growing. Yet, there is not now an active stream of feminist theory in CCT.</p><p>We were brought back into the excitement of the moment by some of the memoirs we received. It reminded us that unwritten exchanges are important as much for their sound, their passion, as the text they leave behind. Several talked about how exciting the debates you could expect at conferences in those days were, about the electricity in the air. Thus, some of the articles that appear in <italic>Advances in Consumer Research</italic> (ACR), pieces that might now be overlooked in written form, were actually manifestos in the moment because of the circumstances of their delivery, because of questions and comments that were raised from the audience or because of criticisms spoken during corridor conversations afterward.</p><p>It is amusing (but somewhat uncomfortable to say it in writing) that explanations for events and articles are often rooted in personal relationships. So, for instance, Dennis Rook was Sid Levy’s graduate student, Morris Holbrook and Beth Hirschman lived next door to each other and several among our group were, at least at one time, married to each other (Eric Arnould and Linda Price, Linda Scott and Tom O’Guinn—Janeen Costa and Gary Bamossy are still married). There are long-standing private enmities and a few nearly forgotten affairs, as well as one fistfight, in this history. This is not to mention many nights with too much liquor.</p><p>The narratives of the CCT origins in significant (but also somewhat mythologized) events, such as the conference on symbolic consumer behavior, the paradigmatic debates between Hunt and Anderson and the Consumer Odyssey, are probably part of a joint legacy regardless of where today’s CCT(-oriented) scholar is located. Nevertheless, there is not only one history of CCT, since various local and national chains of events lead to particularisms of the history and acceptance of nonpositivist consumer research and, subsequently to different kinds of reception of the CCT brand.</p><p>As already indicated, in particular, the critical theory-inspired researchers saw the publication of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470593113479007">Arnould and Thompson (2005</xref>) overview as a hegemonizing, narrowing and (US style) mainstreaming assault on the wacky oddballs of interpretivist consumer research (to paraphrase Bode and Østergaard, this volume), not least due to its focus on <italic>Journal of Consumer Research</italic> (JCR) publications—notwithstanding that this was the task given to them by the JCR editor. This critique was especially strong in the United Kingdom, since the British interpretivist environments had been quite anchored, for many scholars, in a strong critical marketing tradition carried on today by, among others, Douglas Brownlie, James Fitchett, Avi Shankar and Mark Tadajewski. Also, at that time, the weak representation of British authors among the interpretivist JCR publications led, according to the responses we received, to a lopsided view of interpretivism as being a predominantly American phenomenon. In fact, our respondents claim that this kind of research had already found more institutional resonance in several places in Europe, even to the extent that one of our living sources qualifies it as “almost mainstream.”</p><p>The British legacy within interpretive consumer research has been very much founded by Richard Elliott, who has been an important endorser of interpretive work not only in his publication record but also in his administrative positions in places such as Exeter and Bath. Perhaps most significantly, in terms of bridge building across the Atlantic as well as among the European interpretivist environments, Elliott initiated and co-chaired the first Interpretive Consumer Research Workshop held at Oxford University in 1997—in other words, contemporary with Heretical Consumer Research (HCR) and well before that small group in Wisconsin decided to start their own conference. This biennial small-scale conference will reach its seventh iteration in the spring of 2013. The scholars who gather at the event have taken pride in focusing more on (presumed European style) “theorizing and reflection” and less on (presumed US style) “empirical results and publication-ready research.”</p><p>Simultaneously, on the Irish scene, Stephen Brown and Darach Turley were quite instrumental in putting their promising doctoral students (Lorna Stevens, Pauline Maclaran and others) in contact with American interpretivist and, in this case typically, also feminist scholars, not least through the three “conclaves” organized by Brown at St Clements but also through insisting on cross-Atlantic conference participation. The “conclaves” were thus a European parallel to HCR meetings in connection with North American ACR conference in terms of ignoring or downplaying an eventual cross-Atlantic divide. Brown himself has, of course, spent several periods at schools in the United States, although he (“of course,” as it is stated on his home page) was never invited back.</p><p>Stephen Brown has also visited Odense, Denmark (more than once!)—first in 1992 on the initiative of then-visiting professor and macromarketing legend George Fisk. Here, a small culturally oriented group of scholars in marketing had emerged following the creation of a marketing department at Odense University in 1987. This small department was the first in Denmark to create an (initially small) “unit” working with cultural differences and cross-cultural communication. Unit leader Dominique Bouchet, an associate professor of sociology, insisted on bringing in two new doctoral students (Søren Askegaard and Per Østergaard) in order to build the unit. Simultaneously, a small group of researchers working with semiotics was being built-up at the Copenhagen Business School, where David Mick was invited over as a visiting professor. Even if this group is long dissolved, it still plays a significant role in the history of European CCT research, because in 1989, they organized a symposium on marketing and semiotics, which had Sidney Levy as an invited commentator. Bouchet, Østergaard and Askegaard all participated and the encounter with Sidney Levy resulted in a lasting friendship. The outcome was an invitation to join the ACR conference in Chicago in 1991, where Sid introduced Bouchet and Askegaard to a crowd of culturally oriented scholars: Russ Belk, John Sherry, Fuat Fırat, Alladi Venkatesh and others. This resulted in a steady flow of these founding fathers and mothers of CCT in Odense through the mid-1990s, where some (Alladi Venkatesh, Fuat Fırat, Güliz Ger, Eric Arnould and Linda Price) stayed for half or even a whole year (Fuat Fırat even longer).</p><p>In the early years, the focus was still very much on the cultural dimension of international marketing (Bouchet organized two international conferences under that title in 1991 and 1992) and the series of intensive doctoral seminar weeks from 1992 was held under that name until it got its new name (Consumption Theory: A Canon of Classics) when Søren Askegaard took over the organizing tasks after some 10 years, approximately at the time when it was agreed with Bilkent to coordinate seminar themes and calendars as to form the first step toward the current doctoral seminar series in CCT. Gradually, the cross-Atlantic friendships built on both shared ideas and shared beers and collaborations of Østergaard and Askegaard with, for example, Belk, Fırat, Ger and Arnould turned the orientation of the Odense group (the university was renamed University of Southern Denmark after a merger in 1998) more and more toward consumer research.</p><p>The establishment of the Odense group was also connected to the gradual rise in CCT research in Sweden. Karin Ekström from Gothenburg visited Odense in 1999 and later obtained significant funding enabling her to establish a group of consumer researchers hosting the European ACR conference in 2005 as well the well-visited “Elusive Consumption” symposium. Even more decisive was the Danish connection for the establishment of a CCT doctoral milieu at Lund University, where a visiting professorship of Søren Askegaard was instrumental in adding a marketing and CCT dimension to an already flourishing culturally conscious and critically oriented management research unit led by Mats Alvesson.</p><p>Of all the European countries, the introduction of CCT types of research in France is by far the most well documented due to the publication by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593113479007">Özçağlar-Toulouse and Cova (2010</xref>), where they try to map the historical trajectories of different streams of research in the French context. They identify three major themes, namely appropriation of experience, linking value of goods and service to consumers and the sociosemiotics of consumption. The first stream of research can be said to be rooted in an interest in interpretivism and the study of experiential consumption. However, the importance of the notion of postmodernism in the constitution of the French environment is reflected in the European contributions to the special issues of <italic>International Journal of Research in Marketing</italic> on postmodernism, appearing in 1993 and 1994 respectively, and both edited by A. Fuat Fırat, John F. Sherry Jr and Alladi Venkatesh. Last but not least, the French CCT environment was and is strongly influenced by the French tradition of structural semiotics, introduced in marketing mainly through the work of Jean-Marie Floch, but propagated into the 1990s and 2000s by notably people like Patrick Hetzel and Benoit Heilbrunn.</p><p>In spite of the quite widespread presence of researchers doing CCT-oriented research in the French university and graduate business school system and the attempts by Nil Özçağlar-Toulouse to create a fully fledged CCT environment in Lille, it would be embellishing to characterize the French institutional system as “CCT friendly.” The French marketing scene, although inclusive of CCT researchers, is also characterized by conflicts and strife between, in particular, the stronghold of “normal science” promulgators and the minority of socioculturally oriented researchers. Furthermore, the French “CCT-oriented” environment seems to be divided between those more actively embracing the American linkage and the CCT brand (e.g. as the Lille group) and a group of researchers espousing more skepticism toward the CCT brand and, possibly in particular, the risk of contamination with US institutional logics that employment of the CCT brand engenders. The French sociological tradition seems to have played a role in securing not just an environment for CCT-oriented research, but also, more generally, a critical sociological approach to marketing and management (compare the work of, e.g. Franck Cochoy)</p><p>In Italy, the American linkage also seems to be quite obvious since the now dissolved environment at Bocconi University grew out of the influence of Stefania Borghini and her collaborations with a number of American colleagues. It is fair to add, however, that the writings of Bernard Cova and his involvement in collaborative efforts with representations of various groups in Italy (most notably, possibly, University of Pisa) have been significant in promoting interpretivist research in an environment of business studies, which seems considerably more closed around itself and inherently skeptical if not hostile to CCT and related approaches to marketing and business research.</p><p>Even more obvious is the American CCT tradition’s direct influence on the leading CCT environment in Turkey at Bilkent University, built by Güliz Ger and continued by Özlem Sandikci, both of whom have an American PhD and for Güliz Ger, a long tradition of collaborating, notably with Russ Belk. The Turkish group around Bilkent had been a steady exporter of talented youngsters to pursue a doctoral degree at North American universities to such an extent that some (jokingly) refers to the significant group of Turkish CCT scholars as “the Turkish mafia.” Güliz Ger herself, in her response to our questions, refers to the (underrated) significance of the HCR meetings inaugurated at Arizona State University West in Tempe prior to the 1996 ACR conference in Tucson in terms of bringing (pre-)CCT scholars together, providing a platform for the exchange of ideas and modes of presentation that was distinctly defined as being different from and beyond the more slick “ready for publication” presentation style of even most CCT scholars’ performance at ACR conferences. Not least significant, this openness toward different formats of presentation meant that HCR became a place of encounter of Americans and Europeans alike and thus a highly significant bridge (if far from being an integrating factor) between these worlds of interpretivists. As already mentioned, a similar role albeit in Europe was played by Stephen Brown’s conclaves.</p><p>This was just a handful of trajectories of interpretivist consumer research in a number of national and cross-national contexts, obviously very condensed and more oblivious than exhaustive. In all contexts, the development in research traditions eventually leading to the formation of an institutionalized CCT rested on a confluence of factors that both specific to national institutional conditions and emphatically global due to personal linkages established across borders—including the Atlantic divide.</p><p>Consequently, we have absolutely no wish to perpetuate the “Ryders Cup logic” (thanks, Alan Bradshaw, for this great metaphor) of consumer research. There are simply too many crossroads within the labyrinth, the sum of which constitutes a more or less common history. Some scholars paving the first paths leading CCT originated outside America, even when they operated in US institutions (Nik Dholakia, Fuat Firat and Alladi Venkatesh). A lot, if not all, of the personal histories evoked in the memoires we collected witness the cross-fertilization and mutual encouragement of ideas across ocean(s). Consequently, our personal histories unfold both in a global “researchscape” and in very real geographically and institutionally defined environments.</p><p>The philosophical roots of the CCT movement are very much drawn from a European critical philosophical tradition (see Thompson, Arnould and Giesler, this volume), even if within CCT, these roots are applied and mediated in a consumer research tradition that for many (Europeans) seems to be more American than European. The “great divide” is thus much more blurred than it might seem at a first glance, when CCT homogeneity and heterogeneity are considered. Hence, if the doctoral seminars of Bilkent and Odense for the last decade or more have tried to and succeeded in providing a particular “European” scholarly tradition to young, promising CCT scholars, many of the invited faculties have been American and the influence of the American ethos of productivity and pragmatism in terms of publication has also been substantial, both in the seminars and during the shorter or longer visits of European doctoral students, junior and senior faculty to the United States and Canada. In short, things happen both locally and globally, and while CCT is a global and <italic>globalizing</italic> scholarly group (including increasing contingencies not only from Australia but also from Latin America and—hopefully—increasingly from Asia and Africa), there is a plethora of highly localized <italic>events</italic> and institutional conditions that shapes our mutual history and provides different challenges for the more often than not quite marginalized proponents of CCT research. After all, CCT is a minority within consumer research, mostly considered an at times relatively marginal part of the discipline of marketing—a subdiscipline within a set of managerial disciplines and mostly (at least in Europe) not considered very central parts of managerial disciplines—in themselves in disregard from “real” disciplines within the social sciences (economics, sociology, etc.). Given these conditions, one might be inclined to think that we are doing quite well in a number of ways.</p><p>This is also the message of the first contribution of this volume, which is a kind of direct response to the abovementioned article by Askegaard and Linnet as well as other critical publications notably, by Johanna Moisander, Lisa Penaloza and coauthors. Thompson, Arnould and Giesler build on the Bakhtinian metaphor of heteroglossia to argue that recent critical voices of a certain tendency within CCT to privilege microsocial and phenomenologically oriented accounts of consumer experiences at the expense of more critical and/or more macro-oriented approaches may have had a point at some past moment in the CCT history, but that given the contemporary multiplicity of CCT-oriented debates and publications grounded in all kinds of social theory, this critique somewhat misses the boat and kicks in open doors. It is concluded that, while there are dangers and problems lurking, CCT of today is a “heteroglossic interpretive community.”</p><p>If heteroglossia is a key metaphor for the opening article, the next one by Bode and Østergaard is built-up around the metaphor of “manifesto.” They make reference to two manifestary moments in the history of building CCT, namely the original dissent of the experientially oriented consumer researchers exploring consumption in its symbolic and hedonic aspects in the early to mid 1980s and the institution-based (read: JCR) move toward institutionalizing a brand for the heteroglossia that the “people doing the weird but interesting stuff” was perceived to represent by the field of consumer research in general. They conclude by providing some reflections on the effect of the relationships between power and knowledge (metaphorically represented as “realpolitik” and “research”) and its consequences for CCT-scholars sense of community.</p><p>The third contribution by Coskuner-Balli, who in opposition to (some of) the authors, was definitely not part of the early CCT history and therefore introduces a (welcome) regard from the outside (or, rather, the posterior) uses the metaphor of legitimacy to map the history of CCT. Drawing on Abbott’s theory of professionalism, she argues for the gradual buildup of cultural and social legitimacy of the kind of research that is (supposedly) comprised under the CCT label. In this way, she paves the way for an understanding of the processes involved in particular group of researchers and their work gradually becoming institutionalized and elaborates on the processes of marginalization, institutionalization, isomorphism and legitimation.</p><p>If there is a metaphor that would capture the essence to the fourth contribution in this collection, it might be CCT—Consumer Communism Theory. Much in the vein of Baudrillard’s famous question “what are you doing after the orgy?,” the authors Cova, Maclaran and Bradshaw reflect on, what we (i.e. the interpretivist consumer and market researchers captured under the acronym of CCT) should pursue, after postmodernism has disappeared as a root metaphor for what interpretivists are bringing to the understanding of consumers and consumption. Indeed, as it is also recalled in the article, one of the aims of the original CCT paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470593113479007">Arnould and Thompson (2005</xref>) was to point to the limits of the “postmodernism” denominator for the kind of interpretivist research that was going on. As an alternative, the authors point to communism (inspired by the works of Badiou and Zizek) as a new anchoring point for a CCT engagement with emerging popular movements against neoliberal ideology. This, they argue, is an obvious alliance, since “CCT has always been communist,” as it is concluded by pointing to the radical and critical perspectives of most of the great social thinkers that have inspired CCT research.</p><p>The closing article by Bajde is less a history of CCT (although an Actor–Network Theory (ANT)-based attempt to provide a history of CCT to supplement the other articles in this volume would have been highly welcome) than it is a reflection on the similarities between CCT and ANT in terms of bodies of knowledge and a prolegomenon for the fecundation of the former by the latter. As Bajde underlines such fertilization is already taking place, but the ANT with focus on materiality, process and institution represents an ontological epistemology that might contribute to the solution of some of the issues currently shaping the CCT discussions—relations between agents and context, practices and materiality and so on.</p><p>One could tell any number of stories about “CCT history”: from the narratives presented in this volume, from the data we received, especially coupled with our own memories and the rather extensive written record as well as other archival material. And that is one of the most ironic things about this exercise. Two of the articles here in this issue purport to introduce a new theory—“dirty theory” and ANT—yet the descriptions are uncomfortably like history and historical method. But history is one major discipline that has very nearly been embargoed from CCT. Because you can tell so many histories by tracing any one thread, whether it be one person’s view or one subgroup’s agenda or one major theme; the practice of history is the ultimate antitheoretical exercise. History is always contested and negotiated among different historians, who go back repeatedly to the same event and the same set of evidence to tell a new story, sometimes adding new evidence, but often not. And the output of history is “only a story,” after all. History very seldom “makes a theoretical contribution” (to coin a phrase) in a single article, so it is unlikely ever to flourish in consumer research, particularly when footnotes are forbidden, covering the same topic twice is taboo, and colleagues are loathe to argue with each other on paper. For these reasons, history is yet to be admitted to the CCT club in any significant way and it very possibly never will be.</p><p>The history of CCT, and our present short account of it, is fundamentally ironic in the legacy of Søren Kierkegaard; it is both either or and<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470593113479007">2</xref></sup>—too much and too little, over- and under-estimating, … fill in the qualifiers. One of the pseudonyms of this master thinker of irony always only writes prefaces. The relationship between author and text is so close that he (and his wife) considers it a kind of adultery. But if the pseudonym refrains from writing other things than prefaces, this is considered acceptable and his marriage can be saved.
