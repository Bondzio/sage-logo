<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate food habits and preferences against menu planning for heterogeneous groups in institutions and to determine to what extent these results on food habits and preferences can be applied to practical recommendations in menu planning for heterogeneous groups. This study used data from a sample of students to determine whether food habits and preferences influence students’ own menu planning and that of other eating outlets. A sample of 60 students within the University of Cape Coast campus was considered for this study. Findings from the study revealed that a greater number of students have altered their food habits over the years. This was attributed greatly to health factors, change of environment and education. The recommendations made in this study include encouraging cooking competitions among young people to expose them to traditional meals/dishes, which show culinary prowess, and also holding food fairs and encouraging teaching cooking methods for traditional dishes to children.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="section2-0260106012467245">
<title>Background of study</title>
<p>The food habits of individuals has been a popular topic for researchers over the years as many people prepare meals they like as well as those that they have been brought up with. Most people would not prepare meals they do not like or meals they are not familiar with.</p>
<p>Stoetzel (1990), in his studies on the social and psychological aspect of food habits, found that food habits are very important in the everyday life of most people. He quoted studies of the behavior of Tunisian Jewish immigrants and showed that changes in their food habits occurred rather late in the process of assimilation. They accepted the language and newspapers of their host country long before they started to change their food habits. In some cases, a change in religion preceded a change in food habits. Sai (2002), in his studies on food habits of immigrants, also concluded that immigrants generally look for accustomed foods, which may not be readily available, and only reluctantly choose substitutes. If known foods are available, they would usually buy them irrespective of cost. It was found that northern immigrants (people who have migrated to Tema from the three Northern Regions of Ghana) in Tema, Ghana, would pay an exorbitant price for millet despite maize being available cheaply. If no millet were available they would use maize, but prepare it as they would the millet.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some organizations that have been set up to research the food or eating habits of individuals. One such organization is ARAMARK. In 2003, ARAMARK, which studies consumer eating patterns and preferences to identify ways to better serve consumers, initiated a comprehensive, nationwide study of the eating habits, preferences, and perceptions of American adults. Using nationally recognized research firms and sophisticated lifestyle segmentation analysis techniques, six distinct Nutritional DiningStyle types were uncovered that provide a whole new framework for understanding how and why Americans eat the way they do. Each year since then, over 5000 Americans over the age of 18 have been interviewed as part of ARAMARK’s ongoing Nutritional DiningStyles research program. In addition, ARAMARK interviews over 200,000 American consumers each year at the thousands of food service locations they operate. These insights have allowed them to better understand and serve the needs of the millions of American consumers they serve every day. The findings of their research have been widely published, presented and recognized by medical, academic and media organizations around the world each year. ARAMARK’s emphasis and scientific approach using Nutritional DiningStyles research gives scientists new insights into the evolving eating patterns and preferences of the average American adult. It will be interesting to see how these preferences and habits change over time and whether they can be modified by the eating environment and can be said of other individuals elsewhere.</p>
<p>Again, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0260106012467245">Goldberg and Strycker’s (2002)</xref> study on personality traits and eating habits, which assessed food preferences in a large community sample, it was reported that eating practices were not associated with educational level, intelligence or various indices of psychopathology; they were related to the demographic variables of gender and age: older participants reported eating more fiber in their diets than younger ones, and women reported more avoidance of fats from meats than men.</p>
<p>These studies, however, show how the food habits and preferences of individuals or groups are hard to change and also show the efforts that are being made to incorporate the food habits and preferences of individuals into meals for a healthy diet.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0260106012467245">
<title>Statement of the problem</title>
<p>Food habits that are meaningful to a group are carefully adhered to, and are not quickly altered or easily changed. It follows, therefore, that to change food habits the meanings of the particular folkways and habits must be understood. However, food habits that are recently acquired or do not have deep meaning may be changed more easily than those of long standing. Ghanaians are no different from the norm. They have their individual food habits that they strive to incorporate into their meals.</p>
<p>An interaction with some students from the University of Cape Coast (UCC) showed that they prepare foods that they like and are unlikely to prepare foods they do not like. They also stated that they have their individual food habits that they derived from their culture and also from their families. Some also stated that, owing to education as well as peer influence, their food habits have changed. Therefore, foods that they did not eat previously now form part of their meals, as these foods are considered with prestige and status. This in effect explains the increasing consumption of tea, soft drinks, sugar and fatty foods that has brought about many health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, which were not common in the days when food habits were wholesome. Students admitted to changing their methods of preparing foods as well as the way in which they eat certain foods; this is peculiar to a specific dish (‘fufu’ traditionally served in ‘asanka’ (earthenware bowls) is now served in plastic bowls or glassware and eaten with a spoon instead of fingers) in order to meet their tight schedules.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, from the findings and observations made, that people are mocked when they are seen eating ‘gari and beans’ with fried plantain, ‘kokonte’, ‘fufu’, ‘palm nut soup’, and other traditional foods. It is also not surprising that most students do not frequent chop bars or eating places that prepare traditional meals in favor of restaurants or takeaway stands or joints, which sell continental dishes or modernized traditional dishes full of many spices and other additives that make foods different from a typical local or traditional dish. They are also mostly served in polythene bags or takeaway packs, which are not hygienically or health-wise sound.</p>
<p>In this vein, efforts are being made by institutions both private and public and also by the media to ensure that local foods and ways of preparing them are brought back for young people to cherish and practice.</p>
<p>Efforts being made by institutions can be observed in the organization of food bazaars and food competitions that display local dishes. Also, by airing programs such as ‘Edziban’, ‘Onga Food Tour’ and ‘Asanka Delight’, the media have shown their efforts to promote local foods.</p>
<p>People’s food habits, whether changed or unchanged, as well as their food preferences, influence or affect their menu planning.</p>

<title>Literature review Introduction</title>
<p>To live one must eat. However, we do not eat only to live, but also to express appreciation, for a sense of belonging, as part of family customs, and for self-realization. What we eat affects our ability to stay healthy, do work, be happy, and live well. Knowledge of what to eat and in what quantities is a prerequisite to a healthy and happy life. The average nutritional requirements of groups of people are fixed and depend on such measurable characteristics as age, sex, height, weight, and degree of activity and rate of growth.</p>
<sec id="section9-0260106012467245">
<title>Concept of food habits</title>
<p>These are the practices and associated attitudes that predetermine the way in which individuals or groups of individuals select, consume, and utilize portions of the available and preferred food in response to social and cultural pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0260106012467245">Viljoen and Gericke, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0260106012467245">Rodriguez (2011</xref>) defines food habits as why and how people eat, which foods they eat and with whom they eat, as well as the ways people obtain, store, use, and discard food. Individual, social, cultural, religious, economic, environmental, and political factors all influence people’s eating habits.</p>
<p>These habits are considered more personal than other habits, as food is usually eaten in the confines of the home and with family members. Food habits are often complex, unreasoned and symbolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0260106012467245">Rodriguez, 2011</xref>). Consequently, they are difficult to change. The difficulty of course lies in trying to guide and foster desirable changes and to slow down undesirable ones. However, in Ghana some tribes have reverence for their staple food and have no desire to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0260106012467245">Adow et al., 1991</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0260106012467245">Lowenberg et al. (1974)</xref> indicated that an emigrant gives up habits of dress and speech before he gives up his native food habits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0260106012467245">
<title>Effects of food habits on individuals</title>
<p>People often assume that all people within a country eat similar foods. People tend to understand and judge actions, beliefs and values of others according to the culture of their own group and to think of their group as the norm or as better than other groups. In reality some food habits of individuals will be held onto tenaciously and great effort should be made to incorporate certain foods or types of food preparation into daily diet. Other food behaviors may be changed, modified or dropped to meet individual or family taste or social preferences.</p>
<p>Food habits can be termed as ‘healthy’ and ‘unhealthy’. Healthy food habits refers to eating foods that are nutritionally balanced and meet the nutritional requirements of the individual, whereas unhealthy food habits refers to eating foods that do not contain nutrients in the right proportions and quantities. Most of the healthy food habits, which mainly consist of traditional meals, have been changed to unhealthy food habits, which mainly consist of fatty and sugary foods that bring about nutritional problems such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and gout. This in effect explains the high rate of nutritional problems in Ghana as well as in other countries as resulting from a change in food habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0260106012467245">Gilbert and Khokhar, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0260106012467245">Sakyi (2012)</xref> observed that many Ghanaians have forsaken traditional cholesterol-free foods and are gravitating towards western foods. He stressed that it is wrong to assume that healthy eating is synonymous with being rich and eating out at expensive restaurants and eateries, which serve foods that are often saturated with unnatural monosodium glutamate, the main cause of obesity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0260106012467245">
<title>Food habits of Ghanaians</title>
<p>The components of a meal vary across cultures, but generally include grains, such as rice or noodles; meat or a meat substitute, such as fish, beans or tofu; and accompaniments, such as vegetables. In each culture there are both acceptable and unacceptable foods, though this is not determined by whether or not something is edible. For example, alligators exist in many parts of the world, but they are unacceptable as food by many persons. Likewise, horses, turtles, and dogs are eaten (and even considered a delicacy) in some cultures, though they are unacceptable food sources in other cultures. There are also rules concerning with whom it is appropriate to eat. The situation is the same in Ghana. Ghanaians have different cultures and as such have varied food habits. The foods peculiar to Ghanaians include ‘fufu’, ‘gari and beans’, ‘red red’, ‘kokonte’, ‘omo tuo’, ‘tubaani’, ‘kenkey and fried fish’, and ‘banku and okro’ soup. According to Sakyi (2012) many people on the go, with hectic work schedules in multinational corporations, banks, and factories, get very little time to cook for themselves, let alone eat healthily and stay healthy. Many urban dwellers in Ghana eat the green colouration less which is plentiful in cocoyam leaves, amaranthus, pumpkin and cassava leaves, cabbage, lettuce, lentils and sweet potato leaves. Leafy greens are eaten in northern and upper Ghana, as well as by those from the Volta region. Other regions must borrow a leaf from their northern and Volta neighbors. Okras are said to be a great source of iron, along with green plantains and some species of leafy vegetables. Sakyi (2012) emphasized that Ghanaians cherish fewer rich sources of proteins such as pumpkin seeds (egusi or akatsewa), black-eyed beans, bambara beans or cowpeas or bambara groundnuts (aboboye), and butternut beans, among others. Groundnuts, he added, are a veritable source of nutritional value as they contain fats, carbohydrate, and proteins. Boiled green plantains, cocoyam leaf sauce, and amaranthus leaf sauce are all healthy foods that we must promote in our homes. Also, it is much healthier to depend on a diet of fish rather than on livestock products such as pork and beef. Of course, white meats are thought to be better, such as home-bred chickens, rabbits, ducks, guinea fowls, and pheasants. The Japanese and Chinese live mostly on fish and their culturally determined foods. The people of Ghana should be proud of their delicious, delectable, and inimitable cuisines, which can be marketed as international cuisine to attract tourists. Their foods are part of their rich cultural heritage (Sakyi, 2012).</p>
<p>Various food guides provide suggestions on foods to eat, portion sizes, and daily intake. However, personal preferences, habits, family customs and social setting largely determine what a person consumes.</p>

<sec id="section12-0260106012467245">
<title>Factors influencing food habits of individuals</title>
<p>Food habits, like other forms of human behavior, do not develop in a vacuum. They result from many personal, cultural, social, and psychological influences. For each individual, these factors are interwoven to develop a whole unique individual. Food habits are influenced by more than just the foods that are available. Habits depend on a combination of psychological and biochemical factors. Among these influential factors are geography of the land, agriculture practiced by the people, the economic marketing practices, their views on health or safe food, and their history and traditions.</p>
<p>There are others who also think of food patterns as based on food love, cultural patterns, perceptions, values and beliefs, knowledge of nutritional needs and, in developed countries, aggressive commercial advertising and marketing techniques.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0260106012467245">Rodriguez (2011</xref>), people eat according to learned behaviors regarding etiquette, meal and snack patterns, acceptable foods, food combinations, and portion sizes. <italic>Etiquette </italic>refers to acceptable behaviors. For example, for some groups it is acceptable to lick one’s fingers while eating, whereas for other groups this is rude behavior. Etiquette and eating rituals also vary depending on whether the meal is formal, informal, or special (such as a meal on a birthday or religious holiday).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0260106012467245">Rodriguez (2011</xref>) further added that exposure to foods is a way of acquiring food habits. There are innumerable flavors and food combinations. A liking for some flavors or food combinations is easily acceptable, but others must develop or be learned. Sweetness is a universally acceptable flavor, but a taste for salty, savory, spicy, tart, bitter and hot flavors must be learned. The more a person is exposed to a food—and encouraged to eat it—the greater the chances that the food will be accepted. As the exposure to a food increases, the person becomes more familiar and less fearful of the food, and acceptance may develop. Some persons only eat specific foods and flavor combinations, whereas others enjoy trying different foods and flavors.</p>
<p>Lowenberg et al. (1974) added that people usually eat what their families have eaten in the past, that is food patterns are passed from one generation to the next. For instance, food handling methods, such as eating utensils, food combinations, methods of serving, use of color, disposal of leftovers, garbage disposal and cultural factors, affect meal styles. Based on these reviews, the factors influencing food habits can be classified.</p>
<sec id="section13-0260106012467245">
<title>Availability of food</title>
<p>Physical availability of food in the environment and cultural availability are the two main concepts here. Physical availability depends on the kinds of food attainable in the specific part of the world in which the individual or family lives. The productivity of the land, the climate and the agricultural technology are important factors. Regional climate and land fertility determine what can be produced in areas and thus what foods are available for consumption. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0260106012467245">CRDD-MOE (1998)</xref> research indicated that in Ghana the main crops such as cassava, maize, cocoyam, plantain, and garden eggs grow very well in the Ashanti and Brong Ahafo regions. The Northern Region, being an example of savanna lands, cultivates crops such as millet, maize, rice, guinea corn, groundnuts, and melon seed. It follows that people in these areas will choose foods that are available to them.</p>
<p>Again, family income, community, source of food and market conditions influence food choice and ultimately food habits. People eat foods that are readily available to them and culturally accepted by people who have always lived in that area. Again money can be said to be a primary determinant of food habits. This means that within the range of food available, people can only eat what they can afford.</p>
<p>Additionally, findings of Lowenberg et al. (1974) indicate that whoever buys food for the family largely controls food selection for the entire family system. Furthermore, if the amount of money to be spent on food is limited, more cereals and starchy foods are used than animal foods, fruits or vegetables (Lowenberg et al., 1974). Poverty may impose constraints on the choice of food. In times of famine food may be available, but it may be so expensive that few people will be able to buy it. Cultural availability has a strong influence on food behavior. Beliefs and attitudes about food have considerable input. A group of people who find themselves in another location still keep faith in cultural beliefs about the consumption of food.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0260106012467245">
<title>Religious beliefs</title>
<p>From early times, ceremonial and religious rites have surrounded certain events and seasons. Food gathering, preparation, and service have followed specific customs and commemorated special events of religious and national significance and heritage. These sometimes create changes in eating habits. This is especially true when religious sects do not allow certain foods. Again, strong religious factors associated with food tend to have their origin and reinforcement with food within the family meal circle. For instance, no matter how scarce beef may be in a country a Muslim would refuse to touch pork, nor would he or she eat animals that have been slaughtered by non-Muslim communities. The fetish would only touch certain food items after specific rites have been performed for fear of going against the beliefs of their gods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0260106012467245">
<title>Physiological</title>
<p>According to Ihekeronye and Ngoddey (1985) hunger is a basic condition or drive felt by individuals when they lack food in the body system. Certain aspects of food also increase the drive to eat. These include its sensory appeal, that is how it stimulates the senses initially by its appearance and smell, and later by its taste. If these things dominate eating habits, nutritional values will probably be overlooked and this can bring about nutritional deficiency diseases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0260106012467245">
<title>Social</title>
<p>The study of human group behavior reveals the numerous activities, processes and structures involved in social life. Human behavior can be understood in terms of social phenomena and problems, such as social change, urbanism, rural life, the family, the community, race, relations, delinquency, drugs and crime.</p>
<p>Food habits in any setting are highly socialized; these habits perform significant social functions, some of which may not always be evident. First, within social relationships, food is a symbol of social acceptance, warmth, and friendliness. People tend to accept food more readily from those persons they view as friends or allies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0260106012467245">Bender (1993)</xref> stated that people eating in a group are likely to eat better or at least have a wider variety of foods and a more lavish and nutritious meal than people eating alone.</p>
<p>One problem is that the habits that are most closely associated with family sentiments are the most tenacious throughout life. Again, Barassi and Mottran (1987) found that food and the way it is presented can be used to express status in society. Those who strive to climb the social ladder and advance their economic status avoid foods associated with the poor. An elaborately prepared dish with sauces and garnishes is considered to be superior in status to plain cooked food.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0260106012467245">
<title>Psychological</title>
<p>Food is needed to meet an emotional requirement, that is for sadness or depression. Eating a meal can give comfort to oneself or someone else. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0260106012467245">Fleck (1981)</xref> stated that emotions have a great deal of influence upon what, when and how one eat. An example is when a mother gives milk to her baby, the baby feels happy and content, which leads to a feeling of affection for his mother. However, people who have had unhappy experiences connected with eating when they were young may have a dislike for food connected with the unpleasantness. Parents may also pass on their likes and dislikes for certain foods and their preference for cooking and serving styles. The mother is especially influential in developing the eating habits of her children. Usually, parents attempt to get the children to eat what they believe is good for them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0260106012467245">
<title>Culture</title>
<p>Often the most significant thing about a society’s culture is what it takes for granted in daily life. Culture has other tenants in addition to all the little habits of everyday living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0260106012467245">Williams, 1994</xref>), such as preparing and serving food and caring for children, feeding them, and lulling them to sleep. Through a slow process of conscious and unconscious learning individuals take on their culture’s values, attitudes, habits, and practices through the influence of parents, teachers, and others. Culture usually determines what foods are eaten, as well as meal patterns. Adow et al. (1991) said that sometimes food is associated with evil and cannot be eaten. Each culture and ethnic group passes on its likes and dislikes through the family system.</p>
<p>At a very young age each child knows what is considered appropriate food. Children are taught socially accepted behavior in relation to food. They come to know the limits of food behavior and what is the accepted behavior of their culture and family system. This results from the fact that food habits are among the oldest and most deeply rooted aspects of many cultures and tend to exert deep influence on the behavior of the people. The cultural and subcultural background determines what shall be eaten as well as when and how it shall be eaten.</p>
<p>Again, within every culture certain foods are deeply infused with symbolic meaning. Those symbolic foods are related to major life experiences from birth through death and to religion, politics, and general social organization. Some examples of strict adherence to cultural practices in food habits are given below.</p>
<p>Immigrants bring food traditions with them as familiar foods give them a feeling of security. In other instances, it is culturally accepted in some localities that children should not be given meat or eggs because for generations it has been believed that these items make children steal. Also, a pregnant woman is not supposed to eat snails because, if she does, her baby will salivate too much. In another culture, when a fowl is slaughtered and prepared, the back, gizzard, and liver are given to the man, whereas the children and their mother share the rest.</p>
<p>According to Adow et al. (1991), as people move from their native areas to other areas they take with them the food tradition they have known since childhood (students on the UCC campus hunger after their native food items at the marketplace). However, as two different cultures come together, inter-cultural influence is expected especially in the area of food habits; these students therefore tend to adulterate their choices of food. This is because, when people are in villages or localities, they are often under strict cultural rules and norms but become free when they are outside their cultural setting; these changes may be due to education and nutritional requirements. This might be because they may be living with people of the same ethnic group and also because the habits are difficult to break. However, if these customs are strictly adhered to, they can have adverse effects on the health of the individual.</p>
<p>In addition, Khan’s (1981) model consists of factors that are believed to influence food habits, acceptance, and preference. The model, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0260106012467245">Figure 1</xref>, supports the factors reviewed in this study.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The descriptive survey design was extensively used in this research. This study used data from a sample of students to determine whether food habits and preferences influence their own menu planning and other eating outlets. A sample of 60 students within the UCC campus was considered for this study. The UCC was chosen for this survey because of its heterogeneous nature. The university consists of a wide group of people from different parts or regions of Ghana. It also reflects the general characteristics of gender, age, and family backgrounds, which are all essential prerequisites for this survey. The students were randomly selected from lecture halls.</p>
<p>Primary data were collected through questionnaire administration. The questionnaire included both structured and unstructured forms of questions. Structured questions were used in order to present the respondents with a fixed set of choices, whereas the unstructured questions sought to encourage respondents to share as much information as possible in an unconstrained manner. Descriptive statistics were employed in the presentation and analysis of the empirical results.</p>

<title>Research objectives – what is food habit?</title>
<p>All the respondents showed adequate knowledge of food habits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0260106012467245">Figure 2</xref>). They defined food habits generally as how one eats and the kinds of foods one eats.</p>

</fig>
<p>The results showed that knowledge of food habits was obtained from either the home or the school. A greater number of respondents derived their knowledge of food habits from the school and a few derived the knowledge from the home (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0260106012467245">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>This shows that the school or education is a medium through which information on food habits is derived, and thus exposes students to a variety of foods. As the participants came from different ethnic groups or regions their food habits changed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0260106012467245">Figure 4</xref>, due to their exposure.</p>

</fig>
<p>Food habits of the students may also have changed over the years. The factors that altered their change from the lowest to the highest included superstition, parents, friends, time and income, health factors, and change of environment and education. Health factors and change of environment and education were the main factors that altered food habits.</p>
<p>In addition, students were observed to consume mostly soft drinks during and after meals. These practices or habits are largely attributed to advertisements, which are considered the biggest harm to traditional eating habits.</p>
<p>Most Ghanaians today eat their foods with soft drinks and other beverages rather than the ‘old-fashioned’ habit of eating with a cup of water or eating oranges or mangos after or before meals. Most billboards and other advertisements in the media in Ghana carry information that sets a trendy habit for most young and old Ghanaians to adopt. For example, if they see Jackie Appiah, who is a famous actress in Ghana, eating food with a soft drink, most Ghanaians are likely to adopt this habit as they consider it a new trend. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0260106012467245">Sackey (2012)</xref> interpreted a billboard showing two females eating a meal with a bottle of ‘koka-kolah’ and a heart drawn on the billboard as an indication that adding a bottle of soft drink to a meal will make it interesting. He interpreted the heart as a sign that having a soft drink with a meal is interesting and would help with the heart. He further stated that non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and other heart disease are killing more Ghanaians than even HIV. Research carried out in other developed countries has shown that ‘soft drinks’ consumption contributes to a rise in obesity and non-communicable disease. ‘Kokah kolah’ contains sugar, artificial coloring, and water. The sugar contained in a small bottle is equivalent to that in nine cubes. This statistic can be found in the nutrition information provided on the bottles. Combining this with a meal will most likely cause one to consume more calories than one need and this predisposes one to obesity, diabetes and the other non-communicable diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0260106012467245">Sackey, 2012</xref>). A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0260106012467245">Dubois (2007</xref>) concluded that children who regularly consume soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages between meals may be at a higher risk of becoming overweight. Another study also showed that, over the past decades, an increase in the consumption of soft drinks has paralleled an increase in obesity. A higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with an increase in weight and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0260106012467245">Schulze, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Again, results from the observations also showed that most traditional food habits have been replaced with more ‘trendy habits’. For instance, most have substituted ‘kenkey’, ‘banku’, ‘tubaani’, vegetable and legume sauces and stews (nkontomire, ntroba, beans stew, etc.) and ‘kooko’, porridge made from whole grains with polished rice, with plain gravies and stews, tea, coffee, and milo which they combined with the consumption of soft drinks (instead of the traditional habit of drinking water, orange juice, or mangoes before or after the meal), contribute to diets lacking in dietary fiber. Diets lacking in dietary fiber form the majority of Ghanaians’ food habits. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0260106012467245">Wise (2012)</xref>, dietary fiber, which is also known as roughage or bulk, is essential in the diet of an individual. A high-fiber diet normalizes bowel movements; reduces the risk of developing hemorrhoids and diverticular disease; helps to lower blood cholesterol levels; helps control blood sugar levels; and also aids in weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0260106012467245">Wise, 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section22-0260106012467245">
<title>Research objective – what are the identifiable food habits of individuals and the effects of these food habits on individuals in terms of health?</title>
<p>A majority of students indicated that their practices were beneficial health wise and would recommend such practices to others. A few stated that their food habits were not beneficial to their health but would not like to change them.</p>
<p>This result was reflected in their choice of favorite food. A majority of students stated local foods as their favorite. The local foods included ‘fufu’ with light soup, groundnut and palm nut soup, ‘banku’ and okra stew, ‘banku’ and ground pepper with fried fish, ‘waakye’, fried plantain with beans, ‘omo tuo’ with groundnut soup, ‘ampesi’ and ‘kontomire’ stew. A few stated fatty foods such as fried rice with chicken, potato chips, jollof rice, and curried rice with beef sauce as their favorites.</p>
<p>Sakyi (2012), in his study on ‘Ghanaian eating habits’, observed that many Ghanaians have forsaken traditional cholesterol-free foods and are gravitating towards western foods. He stressed that it is wrong to assume that healthy eating is synonymous with being rich and eating out at expensive restaurants and eateries, where foods are often saturated with unnatural monosodium glutamate, one of the main causes of obesity.</p>
<p>The findings from this study, however, show that a majority of students still consider their local foods, which contain less fat, as their favorite foods with very few choosing fatty foods as their favorite, which, when eaten as a habit, could cause a number of health problems such as obesity and diabetes.</p>
<p>The results are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0260106012467245">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0260106012467245">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0260106012467245">7</xref>.</p>

<title>Health effect of students’ food habits</title>
<p>Research on the food habits formed by UCC students also indicates that four out of every five students eat fewer fruits, eat fewer vegetables, skip meals, consume less water than the daily recommended in take, and consume soft drinks, and even indulge in alcohol consumption. All these affect students’ health in one way or another.</p>
<p>The research revealed that students eat fewer fruits and raw vegetables, which are good sources of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Thus, students are likely to suffer from nutritional problems such as constipation and from nutritional deficiencies such as of vitamin A and B<sub>1</sub>, which cause nightblindness and beriberi, respectively.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0260106012467245">Wise (2012)</xref> stated that consuming a diet rich in fiber is beneficial to the health of the individual. Dietary fiber remains undigested throughout the digestive system. Dietary fiber is also known as roughage or bulk and includes all parts of plant foods that the body cannot digest or absorb. Humans lack the enzyme called ‘cellulose’ that is required for the digestion of the kind of carbohydrate provided by dietary fiber. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0260106012467245">Wise (2012)</xref> further stated that, as fiber cannot be digested and absorbed, it passes relatively intact through the stomach, small intestine, and colon and out of the body. There are two kinds of dietary fiber: namely soluble and insoluble fiber.</p>
<p>Soluble fiber is the type of fiber that dissolves in water to form a gel-like material. It can help lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels. Soluble fiber is found in oats, peas, beans, apples, citrus fruits, carrots, and barley.</p>
<p>Insoluble fiber promotes the movement of material through the digestive system and increases stool bulk, and thus it is beneficial to those suffering from constipation. Wholewheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, and vegetables are all good sources of insoluble fiber.</p>
<p>Dietary fiber normalizes bowel movement; lowers the risk of developing hemorrhoids and diverticular diseases; lowers blood cholesterol levels; helps control blood sugar levels; and aids in weight loss.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0260106012467245">Wise (2012)</xref> also stated that skipping breakfast and eating heavy meals late at night, which many students do, causes high blood cholesterol. In addition, eating fried foods and other fatty foods also results in high blood cholesterol. He also stated that leaving more than 6 hours between meals in a day can cause high blood cholesterol levels and that a lack of exercise is a major cause of high blood cholesterol. He recommended that to reduce cholesterol in the blood, one would have to reduce the consumption of cholesterol in the diet. He cited the following as ways of reducing cholesterol: consuming more vegetables and fruits, reducing the amount of fried food in the diet, consuming fewer oily foods and oily soups, eating breakfast daily, regular exercise and eating at regular intervals.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0260106012467245">Hingle (2012)</xref> stated that consuming vegetables and fruits is an effective way to enhance reproductive health. Low consumption of vegetables and fruits may be the reason for the high increase in infertility in Ghana. Green leafy vegetables are nature’s multivitamins and are filled with many things the body needs to sustain a healthy reproductive system, including high calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium contents. Spinach is an especially potent reproductive food that contains a large number of vital minerals including iron. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0260106012467245">Hingle (2012)</xref> recommends eating a green leafy vegetable daily. Black beans are loaded with hormones, including estrogen.</p>
<p>She also stated that orange peel contain a compound called PMF that stimulates the central nervous system, reduces cholesterol and increases circulation, all of which are important to a healthy reproductive system.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0260106012467245">Gilliam (2012)</xref> stated that water is the body’s most important nutrient. It is involved in every bodily function and constitutes up to 70–75% of the total body weight. Water helps to maintain body temperature, metabolizes body fat, aids in digestion, lubricates and cushions organs, transports nutrients, and flushes toxins from your body.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0260106012467245">Gilliam (2012)</xref> further stated that everyone should drink at least 64 fluid ounces per day, and more for those who are overweight. Blood is approximately 90% water and is responsible for transporting nutrients and energy to muscles and for taking waste from tissues. If a person does not consume enough water, the body will react by taking water from other places, including the blood. This causes some smaller vessels (capillaries) to close, increasing the thickness of blood and making it more susceptible to clotting and harder to pump through the body’s circulatory system. This can have serious implications including hypertension, high cholesterol, and heart disease. Recent studies have also linked a lack of water to headaches, arthritis, and heartburn.</p>
<p>If a person gets up in the morning feeling bloated, or tries on a ring or shoe that fitted on the previous day but not that day, it is likely that the body is highlighting a problem. If a person has a problem with water retention, excess salt may be the cause. The body will tolerate a certain amount of sodium; however, the more salt one consumes, the more fluid is needed to dilute it. </p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0260106012467245">Gilliam (2012)</xref> also stated that being dehydrated promotes an increase in body fat. Water contributes to energy storage along with glycogen. Without water, excess glucose remains in the bloodstream until it reaches the liver; the extra glucose is stored as fat. The body takes water from cells in an effort to compensate for a dehydrated state, including fat cells. Less water in fat cells means less mobilization of fat for energy.</p>
<p>One of the liver’s primary functions is to metabolize stored fat into energy. The kidneys are responsible for filtering toxins, wastes, ingested water and salts out of the bloodstream. If the body becomes dehydrated, the kidneys cannot function properly, and the liver must work overtime to compensate. As a result, it metabolizes less fat. Thus, to decrease the amount of fat in your body, water consumption must be increased.</p>
<p>In Merber’s (2005) 10 principles of eating, he reinforced the need to eat breakfast, stay hydrated, avoid sugar, exercise, and make time to eat. Eating a balanced breakfast supplies one with the fuel to help maintain energy levels and set the body’s metabolism up for the day. To stay hydrated it is important to drink plenty of water, preferably at least 1.5 liters a day and more during hot weather or when exercising. Merber (2005) stated that, by the time a person’s body tells him that he is thirsty, he is already dehydrated. Limiting alcohol and salt intake is important as these dehydrate the body. Sugar is present in food in many different forms, all of which break down into glucose and therefore contribute to fat production and weight gain. Also, exercising and healthy eating need to go hand in hand in order to get results.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0260106012467245">Figure 8</xref>, a large number of students chose health as a factor they consider when choosing meals over food customs or habits and their likes and dislikes.

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate food habits and preferences against menu planning for heterogeneous groups in institutions and to determine to what extent these results on food habits and preferences can be applied to practical recommendation in menu planning for heterogeneous groups.</p>
<p>This study used data from a sample of students to determine whether food habits and preferences influence students’ own menu planning and other eating outlets. A sample of 60 students within the UCC campus was considered for this study.</p>
<p>Findings from the study revealed that a large number of students have altered their food habits over the years. This was attributed greatly to health factors, a change of environment and education. Their food habits, though altered, still included a larger number of local foods, which are healthier than the ‘foreign’ fatty foods that, when consumed regularly, can cause health problems as noted by a few students. Their favorite foods were mostly local or traditional foods and a greater number of their choices matched the foods eaten in their region of birth. Those that did not match their region of birth, however, matched other regions in Ghana with very few stating foods such as potato chips, which are eaten by the diaspora, as their favorite foods. The factors most influential in food habits included health factors, geographical location and cost. The choice of dishes as a food habit of individuals could be used as a tool in menu planning as choice of dishes of students revealed from the study are more often beneficial to health.</p>
<p>On the other hand, findings also revealed that food habits formed by UCC students also indicate that four out of every five students eat fewer fruits and vegetables, skip meals, consume less water than the recommended daily requirement, consume more soft drinks, and consume alcohol. All of these affect students’ health in one way or another.</p>

<sec id="section27-0260106012467245">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The food habits and culture that have been meaningful to the group are carefully adhered to and not quickly altered or easily changed. It follows, therefore, that to change food habits the meanings of the particular folkways and habits must be understood. Food habits that are, however, recently acquired or do not have deep meaning may be changed more easily than those of long standing.</p>
<sec id="section28-0260106012467245">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Local foods such as ‘apapransa’, ‘yakayaka’, ‘akyeke’, ‘kaakro’, ‘tatare’, ‘boodoo’, ‘yooke gari’, ‘asanku’, ‘epitsi’, ‘esaato’, and others can be widely marketed to foreign visitors and served or added to Ghana Airways/Airlines/Air Ghana menus. Cooking competitions among young people should be encouraged to expose them to traditional meals/dishes that show the country’s culinary prowess. Food fairs and teaching of traditional dishes and their nutritional value should be encouraged for both boys and girls at schools.</p>
<p>Cookery schools can be established solely to teach Ghanaian dishes to foreigners and whoever is interested in learning more about Ghanaian culture and to develop an export market. Already, some effort has been made in this direction but more is yet to be done, and this will create new jobs. Many foreign foods are imported. Often these are high in fat, sugar, and salt, which are seldom beneficial to health.</p>
<p>The pioneering work of Nkulenu Industries is a good example of progress in local products. Local foods should be used in meal planning in health centers and schools.</p>
