<abstract>
<p>Three studies tested and confirmed the hypothesis that secure attachment relationships lead to feelings of security and energy, as well as willingness to explore. In Study 1, priming a secure attachment relationship increased felt security and energy. In Studies 2 and 3, felt energy mediated the effect of (primed) secure attachment relationships on willingness to explore. In Study 3, the effect of (primed) secure attachment relationships on felt energy and willingness to explore was independent of general positive affect. Secure attachments energize partners, thus enabling exploration.</p>

<p>The preceding quote is an extract from a once popular song. It reflects two qualities of secure relationships: feelings of security and energy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211436117">Bowlby (1973)</xref> proposed that security results from attachment behavior, such as proximity seeking to a caregiver, which is necessary for survival. The literature has been consistent with Bowlby’s idea that felt security is a consequence of secure relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167211436117">Murray, Holmes, &amp; Griffin, 2000</xref>). However, past research has not examined directly the effect of secure relationships on feelings of energy. Attachment security may increase partners’ subjective sense of energy, thus facilitating willingness to explore. The present article is concerned with the energizing impact of secure relationships and with how feelings of energy in turn facilitate exploration.</p>

<title>Attachment, Affect Regulation, and Exploration</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211436117">Bowlby (1973)</xref> highlighted several biologically rooted behaviors that are crucial to the survival of an individual or his/her offspring. These behaviors are attachment, exploration, parenting, and reproduction. Most of Bowlby’s work focuses on attachment and exploration, which aim to protect and provide environmental knowledge, respectively. Attachment behavior involves seeking proximity to a caregiver (e.g., clinging, following), especially when one feels threatened. In contrast, exploratory behavior involves approaching or showing interest in novel and complex stimuli (e.g., activities, objects, people). Thus, these behavioral systems complement each other.</p>
<p>Normatively, in times of danger, stress, or illness, the attachment system is activated leading to proximity seeking. Once attachment needs are met, other behavioral systems, such as exploration, may be activated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211436117">Bowlby (1973)</xref> argued that both the attachment and exploratory behavioral systems (i.e., display of an appropriate mix of attachment and exploratory behaviors) are crucial to survival. What determines which behavioral system (attachment or exploration) will be activated is in part due to early experiences with caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167211436117">Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, &amp; Wall, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>Positive experiences (e.g., receiving sensitive and responsive care) cultivate a self-view as worthy and a view of others as reliable—what is known as attachment security (or low attachment anxiety and avoidance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167211436117">Brennan, Clark, &amp; Shaver, 1998</xref>). Secure children display an <italic>appropriate</italic> balance of attachment and exploratory behaviors depending on circumstances. Specifically, secure individuals display attachment behaviors when they feel threatened, in order to elicit appropriate responses from caregivers for distress relief. However, when unthreatened, secure individuals are able to use the provision of the caregiver as a base from which to engage in exploratory behavior; this can be considered part of the broaden-and-build cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211436117">Frederickson, 2001</xref>). In addition, security allows the acknowledgment and expression of a variety of emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211436117">J. A. Feeney, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167211436117">Magai, Hunziker, Mesias, &amp; Culver, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167211436117">Mikulincer &amp; Orbach, 1995</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167211436117">Fuendeling, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, negative experiences with caregivers (e.g., insensitive and unresponsive care) cultivate a self-view as unworthy and a view of others as unreliable. This leads to an <italic>inappropriate</italic> use of attachment or exploratory behaviors at the expense of others. Inconsistent care is linked to attachment anxiety and a negative self-view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167211436117">Ainsworth et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167211436117">Bartholomew &amp; Horowitz, 1991</xref>). Attachment anxious children display an overuse of attachment behaviors, which interfere with the implementation of exploratory behaviors, in the “Strange Situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167211436117">Ainsworth et al., 1978</xref>). Furthermore, individuals high in attachment anxiety overly focus on negative emotions and relationship anxieties (i.e., use hyperactivating strategies) and are vigilant for threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167211436117">Birnbaum, Orr, Mikulincer, &amp; Florian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167211436117">Mikulincer &amp; Florian, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167211436117">Mikulincer &amp; Orbach, 1995</xref>). Neglect and rejection are linked to attachment avoidance and a negative view of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167211436117">Ainsworth et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167211436117">Bartholomew &amp; Horowitz, 1991</xref>). During strange situation reunions, attachment avoidant children engage in an overabundance of exploratory behaviors at the expense of attachment behaviors. However, this exploration has been described as superficial on the basis of children showing sustained elevated heart rate, which indicates that they are still upset from the separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167211436117">Sroufe &amp; Waters, 1977</xref>). Furthermore, those high in attachment avoidance suppress their relationship anxieties and emotions at a conscious level (i.e., use deactivating strategies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167211436117">Fuendeling, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167211436117">Mikulincer &amp; Orbach, 1995</xref>), albeit sometimes they fail to do so at the unconscious level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167211436117">Mikulincer, Florian, &amp; Tolmacz, 1990</xref>), the physiological level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167211436117">Mikulincer, 1998</xref>), or under cognitive load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167211436117">Mikulincer, Dolev, &amp; Shaver, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers have tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211436117">Bowlby’s (1973)</xref> ideas regarding the display of attachment and exploratory behaviors using measures of adult romantic attachment, and they found that individuals with a secure attachment orientation show an increased propensity to exploration in the form of thrill-seeking activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167211436117">Carnelley &amp; Ruscher, 2000</xref>), effective and competent environmental transactions (i.e., approach-oriented achievement; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167211436117">Elliot &amp; Reis, 2003</xref>), curiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167211436117">Aspelmeier &amp; Kerns, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167211436117">Mikulincer, 1997</xref>), cognitive openness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167211436117">Mikulincer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211436117">Mikulincer &amp; Arad, 1999</xref>), as well as social, environmental, and intellectual exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167211436117">Green &amp; Campbell, 2000</xref>). These findings suggest that attachment security is predictive of exploratory behavior that extends beyond infancy and childhood into adulthood.</p>

<title>Attachment and Energy</title>
<p>As previously described, attachment dimensions are related to the expression or suppression of emotions. Crucially, however, no research has examined directly the link between attachment models and energy. This link is important, because a sense of energy may constitute the resource needed for environmental exploration. That is, energy may serve what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211436117">Frederickson (2001)</xref> called a “broaden-and-build” function. It may broaden one’s knowledge about one’s environment through information acquired by exploration. This additional knowledge may help to build one’s resources to cope with potential future threats.</p>
<p>Sense of energy has been conceptualized as subjective vitality by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211436117">Ryan and Frederick (1997)</xref>. They define subjective vitality as feelings of aliveness and vivacity. These feelings represent a discrete mood state that is separate from general positive affect. Energy is indicative of the high positive affect spectrum of the Consensual Model of Affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211436117">Watson &amp; Tellegen, 1985</xref>), which reflects highly aroused mood states. In contrast, general positive affect represents the pleasantness dimension of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211436117">Watson and Tellegen’s (1985)</xref> model of affect. Furthermore, although subjective vitality has been associated with a component of felt security, namely, self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211436117">Ryan &amp; Frederick, 1997</xref>), it does not encompass the other constituents of felt security, namely, feelings of care, love, and safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167211436117">Bowlby, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167211436117">Holmes &amp; Rempel, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167211436117">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167211436117">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167211436117">Murray et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, energy should be related to felt security but be distinct from it.</p>
<p>Secure individuals are likely to have relatively high energy. To begin with, acts of self-control (e.g., coping with stress, emotion regulation) reduce energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167211436117">Gailliot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167211436117">Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000</xref>). As such, persons with low attachment avoidance will be more energetic, because they are less likely to impose strict regulatory control on their emotions (J. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211436117">Feeney, 1999</xref>). Moreover, persons with low attachment anxiety will be more energetic, because they are less likely to use emotion-focused coping associated with a hyperactivated attachment system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167211436117">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003</xref>), which inhibits the activation of other behavioral systems. Finally, past research has shown that high subjective vitality (feelings of energy) is associated with decreased trait anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211436117">Ryan &amp; Frederick, 1997</xref>), high attachment anxiety is associated with increased anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167211436117">Carnelley, Pietromonaco, &amp; Jaffe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211436117">Hankin, Kassel, &amp; Abela, 2005</xref>), and high attachment anxiety and avoidance are associated with increased physiological arousal when engaging in a stressful task in the presence of one’s romantic partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167211436117">Carpenter &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1996</xref>) and after a brief separation from one’s romantic partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167211436117">B. C. Feeney &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Consumed by (or suppressing) anxiety and insecurity, individuals with high attachment anxiety and/or avoidance may lack the energy for environmental exploration. This lack of energy may be the reason why past research has found that people with insecure attachments express decreased willingness to explore the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211436117">B. C. Feeney, 2004</xref>), although this research has not tested the direct effect of attachment security on energy. Thus, we propose that the previously reported positive association between secure attachments (i.e., low attachment anxiety/avoidance) and willingness to explore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167211436117">Carnelley &amp; Ruscher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167211436117">Green &amp; Campbell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211436117">Mikulincer &amp; Arad, 1999</xref>) is due to individuals with secure attachments having higher energy, which enables them to explore their environment. We tested these hypotheses in three studies. In all studies, we created an experimental microcosm, in which we asked participants to reflect on relationships and then assessed transitory increases in energy. Studies 1 to 3 gauged the effect of a primed secure relationship on energy, whereas Studies 2 and 3 gauged the full mediational model (i.e., energy mediates the effect of relationship security on exploration), in attempting to demonstrate the “broaden-and-build” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211436117">Frederickson, 2001</xref>) function of energy.</p>

<title>Participants and Design</title>
<p>One hundred and two female participants aged 18 to 55 (93.1% aged 18-35) took part online in exchange for credit (<italic>n</italic> = 12) or were recruited from various websites (<italic>n</italic> = 90), including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.socialpsychology.org">http://www.socialpsychology.org</ext-link>, psychological research on the Internet, and online forums with a psychology or research theme (e.g., Linkedin, Livejournal). These websites directed participants to the study’s webpage. The majority of participants resided in the United States (<italic>n</italic> = 76; 74.5%).</p>
<p>Participants were included in the study, if they wrote for 5 to 10 min about the instructed relationship. They were randomly assigned either to the secure relationship prime condition, the anxious relationship prime condition, or the avoidant relationship prime condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0146167211436117">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were informed that this 20-min study involved a visualization task. They were also instructed to complete the study alone and in a quiet place. After giving their consent, they indicated their gender, age, country of origin, and country of residence.</p>
<p>Participants then engaged in the relationship visualization (priming manipulation) task. They visualized a person with whom they had either a secure, anxious, or avoidant relationship. Next, they specified the nature of their relationship with that person (e.g., parent, friend, romantic partner) and the duration of time that they had known her or him. Subsequently, they were instructed that they would have 8 min to write about this person. Although they were presented with an online clock that counted down the time remaining, participants were permitted to continue writing after the 8-min countdown. After the visualization task, participants completed, in the following order, measures of felt security and energy. Written debriefing concluded the testing session.</p>

<title>Priming Manipulation</title>
<p>Participants in the secure relationship prime condition received the following instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211436117">Bartz &amp; Lydon, 2004</xref>; secure attachment prime):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Please think about a relationship you have had in which you have found that it was relatively easy to get close to the other person and you felt comfortable depending on the other person.

It is crucial that the nominated relationship is (or was) important and meaningful to you.</p>

<p>Then, participants were presented with the following guided questions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Now, take a moment and try to get a visual image in your mind of this person. What does this person look like? What is it like being with this person? You may want to remember a time when you were actually with this person. What would he or she say to you? What would you say in return? What does this person mean to you? How do you feel when you are with this person? How would you feel if this person was here with you now?</p>

<p>Participants in the anxious relationship prime condition received the following instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211436117">Bartz &amp; Lydon, 2004</xref>; anxious–ambivalent attachment prime):</p>

In this relationship, you wanted to get very close to the other person but you worried that this would scare the other person away. It is crucial that the nominated relationship is (or was) important and meaningful to you.</p>

<title>Felt security</title>
<p>The Felt Security Scale served as a manipulation check. Past theory and research has conceptualized this construct as comprising feelings of care, esteem, love, and safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167211436117">Bowlby, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167211436117">Holmes &amp; Rempel, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167211436117">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167211436117">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167211436117">Murray et al., 2000</xref>). However, no existing scale captures the full dimensionality of felt security. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211436117">Gillath, Hart, Noftle, and Stockdale (2009)</xref> have developed a state measure of attachment security, but this measure captures the emotions, behaviors, and cognitions associated with attachment security rather than feelings of security per se.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Past research has shown that primed attachment relationships influence interpersonal expectations, recall for attachment words, and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167211436117">Rowe &amp; Carnelley, 2003</xref>). Our findings extend this past research by demonstrating that primed attachment relationships exert different effects on felt security and energy. In particular, secure, relative to insecure (i.e., anxious and avoidant), attachment relationships increase felt security and energy, whereas anxious and avoidant attachment relationships do not differ in feelings of security or energy.</p>
<p>In all, Study 1 showed that felt security and energy were boosted by a secure (vs. insecure) attachment relationship prime. We followed up with two studies. These studies tested whether a secure attachment relationship prime boosts felt security, energy, and exploration above and beyond neutral control primes (i.e., distant neutral relationship; Study 2) and positive control primes (i.e., positive affect prime; Study 3). More important, these studies tested whether the effect of attachment security on willingness to explore is mediated by energy. Does energy serve a “broaden-and-build” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211436117">Frederickson, 2001</xref>) function by sparking the acquisition of new information about one’s environment through exploration?</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Consistent with Study 1, the secure relationship prime condition led to an elevated sense of security and energy. In addition, secure relationships increased exploration. In addition, the effect of the secure relationship prime on exploration was partially mediated by felt energy, as both the direct and indirect paths were significant. Secure relationships strengthen felt security and energy. Energy then enables individuals to engage in environmental exploration, supporting the notion that energy serves a “broaden-and-build” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211436117">Frederickson, 2001</xref>) function.</p>
<p>Yet it is possible that the manipulation influenced general positive affect in addition to energy. We wanted to be confident that there is something unique about visualizing a secure relationship: It energizes rather than simply enhance the mood. To that purpose, we designed Study 3. Here, we used a different control prime than Study 2, given that our intent was to demonstrate that there is something special about a secure relationship that boosts energy and augments willingness to explore over and above positive affect in general. In particular, participants in the control condition visualized a scene from a comedy movie or television sitcom. We also measured general positive affect. If participants who are primed with a secure relationship (vs. positive affect) report higher security, energy, and willingness to explore, and if there is no effect of the priming manipulation on general positive affect, then we will be able to rule out the possibility that the effect of the relationship prime is due to general positive affect.</p>

<title>Age, gender, and sample effects</title>
<p>Age was not significantly associated with any of the dependent measures, <italic>r</italic>s(87) &lt; −.21, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .06. Therefore, we omitted age from further consideration.</p>
<p>We also examined whether gender and sample type had effects on the dependent variables. We aimed to test whether participants who received compensation for their participation (<italic>n</italic> = 23) differed from those who volunteered (<italic>n</italic> = 66). Therefore, we combined the participants who received any type of compensation into one group. Women reported higher security (<italic>M</italic> = 3.98, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.40) and energy (<italic>M</italic> = 4.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.23) than men (<italic>M</italic> = 3.42, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.25; <italic>M</italic> = 3.42, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.26, respectively), <italic>F</italic>s(1, 83) &gt; 3.99, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05, ηs<sup>2</sup><sub>partial</sub> &gt; .04. In addition, the Priming Manipulation × Sample Type interaction on felt security was significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 83) = 6.54, <italic>p</italic> = .01, η<sup>2</sup><sub>partial</sub> = .07. This effect emerged because volunteer participants in the secure prime condition reported higher felt security (<italic>M</italic> = 4.82, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.07) compared and with volunteer participants in the control-prime condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.95, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.10 compensated participants in the control-prime condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.38 compensated participants in the secure prime condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.03), <italic>ts</italic>(43) &gt; 2.74, <italic>ps</italic> &lt; .05, ds &gt; 0.96, using the Bonferroni correction for all three comparisons (α/3). Similarly, the Priming Manipulation × Sample Type interaction on energy was significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 83) = 7.87, <italic>p</italic> = .01, η<sup>2</sup><sub>partial</sub> = .09. This effect emerged because volunteer participants in the secure prime condition reported higher energy (<italic>M</italic> = 4.36, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.21) compared with volunteer participants in the control-prime condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.47, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.26), <italic>t</italic>(64) = 2.53, <italic>p</italic> = .01, <italic>d</italic> = 0.61, and with compensated participants in the control-prime condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.28), <italic>t</italic>(43) &gt; 2.81, <italic>ps</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>ds</italic> &gt; 1.03, but did not differ from compensated participants in the secure prime condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.24, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.90), <italic>t</italic>(44) = 2.14, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.71 using the Bonferroni correction for all three comparisons (α/3). None of the remaining effects involving gender and sample type were significant, <italic>F</italic>s(1, 83) &lt; 3.61, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .06, ηs<sup>2</sup><sub>partial</sub> &lt; .05. Given that these were the only gender differences to emerge and that the sample included relatively few men and compensated participants relative to women and volunteer participants, we excluded gender and sample type from the main analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0146167211436117">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Confirmatory factor analyses</title>
<p>We tested the extent to which general positive affect and energy are separate constructs using confirmatory factor analysis. We computed two structural models to examine the extent to which general positive affect and energy are unique constructs. Model A included a single factor accounting for all of the covariance between the affect and energy items. This model did not fit the data well, χ<sup>2</sup>(65, <italic>N</italic> = 86) = 277.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and the indices indicated poor fit, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .80, Standardized Mean Residual (SRMR) = .10, Root Mean Square of Approximation (RMSEA) = .20. Model B tested whether the positive affect and energy items load onto separate factors. This model yielded satisfactory fit, χ<sup>2</sup> (64, <italic>N</italic> = 86) = 181.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and the indices indicated acceptable fit, CFI = .89, SRMR = .06, RMSEA = .15. This model fit the data significantly better than Model A, χ<sup>2</sup>Δ(1) = 95.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Furthermore, the path coefficients to the latent general positive affect (βs &gt; .63, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001) and energy (βs &gt; .67, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001) were significant. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211436117">Ryan and Frederick (1997)</xref>, the correlation between the latent general positive affect and energy factors was moderate, <italic>r</italic>(84) = .57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. These findings are supportive of the two-factor solution rather than the one-factor solution, suggesting that general positive affect and energy are separate constructs.</p>

<sec id="section45-0146167211436117">
<title>Structural equation analyses</title>
<p>We tested a series of structural equation models to examine whether the effect of the priming manipulation on exploration was simultaneously due to the effects of the priming manipulation and positive affect on feelings of energy and to the effect of energy on exploration. First, we examined the full model in which the priming manipulation (dummy coded: 1 = <italic>secure relationship prime</italic>, 0 = <italic>positive affect prime</italic>) predicted feelings of energy and exploration, positive affect predicted feelings of energy, and feelings of energy predicted exploration (Statistical Model 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167211436117">Figure 2</xref>). This model yielded excellent fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 89) = 3.22, <italic>p</italic> = .20, CFI = .98, SRMR = .06, RMSEA = .08. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167211436117">Figure 2</xref>, all of the paths were significant (βs &gt; .21, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05) except for the direct path from the priming manipulation to exploration (β = .15, <italic>p</italic> = .12).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we computed a series of nested model comparisons. Given that Statistical Model 1 indicated that the path from the priming manipulation to exploration was not significant, we fixed the path from the priming manipulation to exploration to 0 in Statistical Model 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0146167211436117">Figure 3</xref>). Statistical Models 1 and 2 were not significantly different from one another, χ<sup>2</sup>Δ(1) = 2.38, <italic>p</italic> = .12. However, further fixing the paths from the priming manipulation to feelings of energy, feelings of energy to exploration, and positive affect to feelings of energy to 0 resulted in significantly poorer fit compared with Statistical Model 1, χ<sup>2</sup>Δ(4) = 55.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and Statistical Model 2, χ<sup>2</sup>Δ(3) = 52.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Taken together, these results suggest that Statistical Model 2 is preferable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0146167211436117">Figure 3</xref>). The secure relationship prime predicted high feelings of energy, positive affect predicted high feelings of energy, and high feelings of energy predicted high willingness to explore. Furthermore, the bootstrapping procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167211436117">Cheung &amp; Lau, 2008</xref>), using 1,000 bootstrap samples from the data, indicated that the indirect path from the priming manipulation to exploration (through feelings of energy) was significant (β = .10, <italic>p</italic> = .02, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.22]). Finally, the indirect path from positive affect to exploration (through feelings of energy) was significant (β = .23, <italic>p</italic> = .001, 95% CI = [0.13, 0.34]).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of Study 3 replicated those of Studies 1 and 2. A secure relationship increases felt security and energy and also increased willingness to explore. Furthermore, the effect of a secure relationship on exploration was mediated by felt energy, further bolstering the “broaden-and-build” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211436117">Frederickson, 2001</xref>) function of energy. Crucially, Study 3 extends Study 2, given that we used a different control prime (i.e., positive affect prime). The findings suggest that a <italic>secure</italic> relationship, not simply a positive affect prime, increases exploration through its effect on energy.</p>
<p>Moreover, Study 3 offered support for the discriminant validity of our energy scale in two important ways. First, there were no effects of the priming manipulation on general positive affect, but the secure relationship prime increased felt energy relative to a positive affect prime. This suggests that secure relationships boost a discrete positive emotion, energy, rather than positive affect in general. Second, although both energy and positive affect had significant direct and indirect effects, respectively, on exploration, the confirmatory factor analyses gave credence to the two-factor solution with separate factors representing general positive affect and energy. Taken together, these findings indicate that feelings of energy associated with secure relationships, not general positive affect, enable individuals to explore their environment.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section47-0146167211436117">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>In three studies, we provide the first direct evidence that secure relationships increase felt energy. Consistent with past research, Studies 2 and 3 obtained support for the notion that secure relationships predict willingness to explore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167211436117">Aspelmeier &amp; Kerns, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167211436117">Carnelley &amp; Ruscher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167211436117">Elliot &amp; Reis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211436117">B. C. Feeney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167211436117">Green &amp; Campbell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167211436117">Mikulincer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211436117">Mikulincer &amp; Arad, 1999</xref>). However, Studies 2 and 3 extend past research by showing that the link between secure relationships and exploration is indirect. In particular, secure relationships increased exploration through their effect on felt energy. In Study 2, a secure relationship prime increased exploration relative to a distant neutral relationship prime. In Study 3, energy, not general positive affect, increased willingness to explore. Our findings illustrate the “broaden-and-build” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211436117">Frederickson, 2001</xref>) function of energy.</p>
<p>Several features of our research are noteworthy. First, we obtained similar results using different control primes. A secure relationship prime increased felt security and energy compared with an insecure relationship prime, regardless of whether the latter focused on anxious or avoidant attachment. Furthermore, a secure relationship prime increased willingness to explore compared with two separate control (distant neutral relationship and positive affect) primes. Second, the priming manipulation had no effect on general positive affect, suggesting that the energizing quality of secure relationships is distinct from general positive affect. The energizing effect of secure relationships is the result of feeling safe, allowing one to express an interest in exploring the environment. Finally, we obtained these results from varied samples collected on the Internet, allowing us to be more confident about the generalizability of the findings beyond university student populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167211436117">Gosling, Vazire, Srivastava, &amp; John, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the strengths of our findings, several issues warrant further consideration. The fact that we collected our data on the Internet may still invite criticism. Participants may not be representative of the wider population, may be maladjusted (i.e., suffer from social isolation), or may provide careless data that are unreplicable in the laboratory. However, this is no serious cause for concern. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167211436117">Gosling et al. (2004</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167211436117">Fraley, 2007</xref>) provide evidence that Internet samples are more representative of the population than samples published in top psychology journals, are not unusually maladjusted, and are highly motivated to give accurate responses and to feel free to self-disclose information. Furthermore, studies conducted on the Internet produce similar findings to those obtained from traditional methods. Indeed, the effect of the relationship prime on felt security, for which one component is self-esteem, replicates past laboratory research on the influence of relationship priming on felt security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167211436117">Rushforth, 2009</xref>) and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211436117">Carnelley &amp; Rowe, 2007</xref>). This replication reinforces the notion that our findings are reliable and valid.</p>
<p>Similarly, some of our participants may have encountered difficulties with our priming manipulation because they may never have experienced some of the relevant relationships in actual life. This may be more likely for participants who suffer from social anxiety, as there is a link between social anxiety and anxious and/or avoidant attachment styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167211436117">Darcy, Davila, &amp; Beck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167211436117">Eng, Heimberg, Hart, Schneier, &amp; Liebowitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167211436117">Mickelson, Kessler, &amp; Shaver, 1997</xref>). However, past research has demonstrated that priming a secure relationship increased felt security in a sample of participants scoring high on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167211436117">Mattick and Clarke’s (1998)</xref> Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167211436117">Rushforth, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, future research should examine how priming manipulations like ours may influence felt security, energy, and willingness to explore in larger and more diverse samples, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167211436117">Mickelson and colleagues’ (1997)</xref> national sample. These researchers obtained a link between self-report measures of psychopathology and an insecure attachment style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167211436117">Mickelson et al., 1997</xref>). Replicating our findings in more diverse samples would further demonstrate the external validity of our relationship prime manipulation.</p>
<p>The correlations between felt security, energy, and exploration were high (<italic>r</italic>s &gt; .46, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001), raising the possibility that these three constructs may be redundant. However, we believe that these are three separate constructs. Exploration refers to behaviors, whereas felt security and energy refer to specific emotions. Proponents of the tripartite model of attitudes argue that although emotions and behaviors are components of attitudes, they are distinct components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211436117">Katz &amp; Stotland, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167211436117">Zanna &amp; Rempel, 1988</xref>); an implication is that felt security and energy should be distinct from exploration.</p>
<p>To explore this notion, we tested the extent to which felt security, energy, and exploration were separate from each other using confirmatory factor analysis on a different sample of 661 participants (468 women, 184 men, 9 undeclared). These participants completed the same felt security scales as in Study 1 and the same energy and exploration scales as in Studies 1 to 3. We computed two structural models to examine the extent to which felt security, energy, and exploration are unique constructs. Model A included a single factor accounting for all of the covariance between the felt security, energy, and exploration items. This model did not fit the data well, χ<sup>2</sup>(405, <italic>N</italic> = 661) = 5,993.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and the indices indicated poor fit, CFI = .72, SRMR = .09, RMSEA = .15. Model B tested whether the felt security, energy, and exploration items load onto separate factors. This model yielded satisfactory fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(402, <italic>N</italic> = 661) = 2,622.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and the fit indices indicated acceptable fit, CFI = .89, SRMR = .04, RMSEA = .09. This model fit the data significantly better than Model A, χ<sup>2</sup>Δ(3) = 3,371.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Furthermore, the path coefficients to the latent felt security (βs &gt; .67, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001), energy (βs &gt; .65, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001), and exploration (βs &gt; .50, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001) factors were significant. Although the correlation between the latent felt security and energy factors was high, <italic>r</italic>(659) = .77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, the correlations between the latent energy and exploration factors, <italic>r</italic>(659) = .35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and between the latent felt security and exploration factors, <italic>r</italic>(659) = .24, <italic>p</italic> = .01, were more modest. These findings are consistent with the notion of a three-factor (rather than one factor) solution, suggesting that felt security, energy, and exploration are separate constructs.</p>
<p>Across all our studies, participants completed the security, energy, and exploration measures directly after the priming manipulation. In addition, the majority of participants completed all of the materials within 30 min. It would be interesting for future research to examine the long-term effects of repeated secure relationship priming on security, energy, and exploration. Relevant past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211436117">Carnelley &amp; Rowe, 2007</xref>) has shown that repeated attachment security priming (3 times over 3 days) can last for at least 2 days following exposure to the secure relationship prime. In particular, this repeated attachment security priming increased general positive self-views and relational expectations, but decreased attachment anxiety, regardless of participants’ general attachment styles. There is reason, then, to believe that repeating our priming manipulation over time could have a stronger effect on security, energy, and exploration.</p>
<p>Another cautionary remark pertains to our measure of exploration: It reflected attitudes toward exploration rather than exploratory behavior per se. A task for future research would be to examine whether secure relationships indirectly predict actual exploratory behavior through felt energy. Past research has found that secure relationships predict the amount of information participants request about a novel stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167211436117">Mikulincer, 1997</xref>), the amount of time participants spend engaging with novel stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167211436117">Aspelmeier &amp; Kerns, 2003</xref>), and the degree of feedback participants request (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167211436117">Selcuk &amp; Hazan, 2010</xref>). However, none of these studies have examined whether persons with secure relationships actually engage in exploratory behavior because they experience high energy.</p>
<p>Finally, it would be useful for future research to examine whether secure relationships provide people with the resources to cope with adversity. People with secure relationships respond more effectively to stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167211436117">B. C. Feeney &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167211436117">Simpson, Rholes, &amp; Nelligan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167211436117">Wildschut, Sedikides, Routledge, Arndt, &amp; Cordaro, 2010</xref>) and like out-groups better, even after their cultural worldview is threatened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167211436117">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2001</xref>). The current findings suggest that priming secure relationships may increase feelings of energy when faced with a hardship. These increased feelings of energy could provide people with the appropriate resources to deal with hardship. Does increased energy associated with secure relationships provide these individuals with the resources to cope effectively with hardships (e.g., a setback or negative feedback)?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These research findings are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211436117">Bowlby’s (1973)</xref> hypothesis that people are willing to explore their environment when they know that their attachment figures are available or supportive and that they are worthy of their partners’ care. The findings provide the first direct support for the notion that secure relationships are associated with an increase in energy, which provides individuals with the resources for exploration. Secure relationships enable exploration through their energizing potential.</p>

<p>Given the significant correlation between age and energy, we computed a structural equation model to examine the effect of the manipulation on energy, controlling for the effect of age and the interaction between condition and age on energy. Although the effect of age on energy was significant (β = .23, <italic>p</italic> = .02) and the effect of condition on energy became nonsignificant (β = .05, <italic>p</italic> = .60), the model fit was poor, χ<sup>2</sup>(3, <italic>N</italic> = 102) = 233.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .01, SRMR = .31, RMSEA = .87.</p>

<p>In Study 2, there were some incompatibilities in the relationship primes across the priming conditions. In particular, participants in the secure prime were asked to think about a <italic>current</italic> relationship, whereas participants in the distant neutral relationship prime condition were asked to think about a <italic>past</italic> relationship. To rectify this inconsistency, we asked 10 additional participants in Study 2 (5 women and 5 men) to think about a <italic>past</italic> relationship in the secure relationship prime condition. As expected, participants who thought about a <italic>past</italic> secure relationship did not differ on the dependent measures from those who thought about a <italic>current</italic> secure relationship, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .23, but they indicated higher levels of felt security and energy as well as willingness to explore than participants in the neutral relationship prime condition, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05. Therefore, we combined all participants who thought about a secure relationship into one condition, the secure relationship prime condition.</p>

<p>Given the differences between men and women on felt security, we computed a multigroup analysis to test whether the path coefficients differed significantly between men and women.
