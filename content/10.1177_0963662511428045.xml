<abstract>
<p>The goal of this article is to map out public perceptions of animal experimentation in 28 European countries. Postulating cross-cultural differences, this study mixes country-level variables (from the Eurostat database) and individual-level variables (from Eurobarometer Science and Technology 2010). It is shown that experimentation on animals such as mice is generally accepted in European countries, but perceptions are divided on dogs and monkeys. Between 2005 and 2010, we observe globally a change of approval on dogs and monkeys, with a significant decrease in nine countries. Multilevel analysis results show differences at country level (related to a post-industrialism model) and at individual level (related to gender, age, education, proximity and perceptions of science and the environment). These results may have consequences for public perceptions of science and we call for more cross-cultural research on press coverage of animal research and on the level of public engagement of scientists doing animal research.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In November 2010, the European Commission released its “6th Statistical Report on Animal Use.” In Europe (EU15), the number of experimental animals used remained stable between 2005 and 2008 after an increase between 1999 and 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511428045">European Commission, 2010</xref>). The total number of animals used indicates the importance of animal experimentation in scientific practices such as medicine, pharmacology, biology and toxicology to name but a few. Nowadays, animals are also sources of organs, cells and genes in technoscience. However, the issue of public perceptions of animal experimentation has been neglected by the Public Understanding of Science (PUS) community, with the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662511428045">Pifer (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511428045">Hagelin, Carlsson and Hau (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511428045">Crettaz von Roten (2009)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662511428045">1</xref></sup> This lack of research is surprising because PUS studies move from general attitudes towards science on to attitudes towards more specific scientific domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511428045">Evans and Durant, 1995</xref>) and attitudes towards animal research may interact with attitudes towards those scientific fields.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662511428045">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The few studies available in the literature identify two types of predictors of approval of animal research. First, approval is related to intrinsic factors of the experiment itself: the type of research (more accepted for medical research), particular species (more accepted for mice), animal suffering (more accepted without suffering) and the possibility of alternatives (more accepted without possible alternatives) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511428045">Hagelin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511428045">Serpell, 2004</xref>). Moreover, approval may also be linked to national intrinsic factors: the importance of animal research in a country or the type of regulation governing animal experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511428045">MORI, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511428045">2009</xref>). Second, approval is related to extrinsic factors, i.e. to the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents: in particular gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511428045">Herzog, Betchart and Pittman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511428045">Eldridge and Gluck, 1996</xref>), education (Pifer, Shimizu and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662511428045">Pifer, 1994</xref>), urban versus rural background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511428045">Hills, 1993</xref>), personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511428045">Galvin and Herzog, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511428045">Mathews and Herzog, 1997</xref>), pet ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662511428045">Paul, 1995</xref>), interests and attitudes towards the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511428045">Pifer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511428045">Jerolmack, 2003</xref>), attitudes towards nature and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511428045">Crettaz von Roten, 2008</xref>) and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662511428045">Wuensch and Poteat, 1998</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511428045">Coleman (2008)</xref> reported a trend of more negative attitudes towards animal research in Europe and North America, where surveys have been done.</p>
<p>The viewpoints about animal experimentation also concern science directly as they question whether animal experimentation is scientific or not, if experimenting on nonhuman primates is vital to science, whether experimenting on dogs has led to medical breakthroughs, and whether scientists should pursue new forms of animal testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511428045">Broida et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662511428045">Peek, Bell and Dunham, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511428045">Cothran, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662511428045">Traïni’s (2011)</xref> historical sociology essay on animal protection illustrates how this issue is related to the evolution of science (i.e. the emergence of the experimental method in medicine and the evolution of the role of natural scientists) and how animal protection became a way to show distinctive national virtues (in the 19th century, animal protection and rejection of vivisection were a line of demarcation between England and France). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511428045">MORI (1999)</xref> showed a lack of trust in the regulatory system in the United Kingdom and that the most trusted sources of relevant information were not scientists but animal welfare groups and veterinarians. In a Swiss survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511428045">Crettaz von Roten (2008)</xref> showed the influence of attitudes towards science on attitudes towards animal experimentation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511428045">Pifer et al. (1994)</xref> combined scientific knowledge and attitude towards science to explain differences in attitudes towards animal research in fifteen countries.</p>
<p>PUS literature has identified cultural climates for science by analysing public perceptions towards science in different national contexts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511428045">Bauer, Durant and Evans (1994)</xref> introduced the post-industrialisation model, which interprets the changing pattern of relationships between interest, knowledge and attitudes towards science by transitioning from an industrial to a post-industrial society. On the whole, industrialised countries have greater expectations of science, a higher belief in progress, and view science as being more omnipotent than do post-industrialised countries; industrialised societies idealise science and technology as the preferred path to economic and social progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511428045">Durant et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511428045">Allum, Boy and Bauer, 2002</xref>). On the other hand, in post-industrial countries, science, which has already reached the public sphere, is no longer idealised but more critically evaluated by the public, in particular in voicing environmental concern related to some scientific developments (for example genetically modified plants or nuclear energy).</p>
<p>On the basis of the above discussion, we postulate cross-cultural differences in attitudes towards animal experimentation in Europe. Our aim is to examine similarities and differences in the attitudes towards the use of animals in scientific research in 28 European countries. This paper follows three major lines of inquiry. First, what are the current attitudes towards animal research in Europe? Second, have attitudes towards animal research varied during the last five years cross-culturally? Third, can we explain the individual-level as well as the country-level differences in attitudes towards animal research?</p>
<p>Apart from a few national studies of the public’s attitudes towards animal research, there is a lack of cross-national research. The few existing studies are restricted to the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511428045">Crettaz von Roten, 2009</xref>) or to the macro level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511428045">Pifer et al., 1994</xref>), but do not take the multilevel nature of the issue into account. Limitation to the macro level carries the risk of the ecological fallacy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662511428045">3</xref></sup> that “it [cross-national comparison] reifies national boundaries, overlooks heterogeneity and change, and perhaps reinforces parochial stereotypes of national identities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511428045">Jasanoff, 2005</xref>: 11). Restriction to the individual level does not take into consideration potentially important determinants such as the importance of animal experimentation in or the level of industrialisation of a country.</p>
<p>For this research, we will use data at both levels retrieved from the Eurostat database (country level) and from the Science and Technology Eurobarometer (EB) surveys (individual level) and build a multilevel analysis for the differences found among individuals and countries. The potential predictors will be drawn from the literature on the cultural climate for science and on public perceptions of animal research. At the country level, we assume a negative effect of the measure of post-industrialism (post-industrialisation hypothesis) but no relation with the number of animals used because the literature indicates that respondents are generally not well informed about animal research in their country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511428045">MORI, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511428045">Macnaghten, 2004</xref>). At the individual level, attitudes towards animal research are expected to depend on gender, age, education, level of medical and environmental information, engagement towards science and attitudes towards science: all other things being equal, being male, being older, having tertiary education, being informed, engaged and positive about science should increase respondents’ acceptance of animal research, whereas being informed about the environment should decrease acceptance.</p>

<title>Measures of the dependent variables</title>
<p>The issue of animal research has not given rise to specific surveys in Europe. Therefore, we performed a secondary analysis of the Science and Technology EB surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511428045">TNS Opinion &amp; Social, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662511428045">2010</xref>). The national samples come from a multistage random design of the adult population, with approximately 1000 face-to-face interviews conducted. Thirty-two countries participated in the 2005 and 2010 surveys, namely the European Union Member States, two candidate countries, plus Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. For this research, we used the 27 member states and Switzerland, therefore 28 European countries.</p>
<p>The EB surveys used two five-point Likert-type items ranging from “totally disagree” to “totally agree”: “Scientists should be allowed to experiment on animals like dogs and monkeys, if this can help resolve human health problems” (EB 2005 and EB 2010), and “Scientists should be allowed to do research on animals like mice, if it produces new information about human health problems” (EB 2010). For the EB 2010, each item was recoded so that higher values indicated a more favourable attitude and then summed to build a scale ranging from 0 “very negative attitude” to 8 “very positive attitude.” “Don’t know” answers were considered as missing values. For this scale, Cronbach’s alpha, which merely represents an estimate of inter-item reliability, indicates a good quality scale (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.74).</p>

<title>Measures of the independent country variables</title>
<p>At the country level, we considered the number of animals used for experimentation in 2008 retrieved from the report of the Commission of the European Communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511428045">European Commission, 2010</xref>) and, as an indicator of post-industrialism, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in purchasing power parities (PPP) in 2010 (in tens of thousands of Euros) retrieved from Eurostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511428045">Durant et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511428045">Bauer, 2009</xref>).

</sec>
<sec id="section6-0963662511428045">
<title>Measures of the independent individual variables</title>
<p>For the sociodemographic background, we used gender (coded 1 for men and 0 for women), age (in years, transformed to age divided by 10 for simplicity of interpretation of the coefficient) and tertiary education (a dichotomic variable indicating a tertiary level as the highest level achieved, coded 1 for people having achieved a tertiary education and 0 for others).</p>
<p>For the level of scientific and environmental information, we used three variables: the level of information (coded from 0 “poorly informed” to 2 “very well informed”) on new medical discoveries and on environmental problems, as well as the level of engagement measured by the frequency of attending a public debate about science and technology (coded from 0 “never” to 3 “regularly”).</p>
<p>The attitudes towards science were measured by three five-point Likert-type scales (coded from 0 “totally disagree” to 4 “totally agree”): “The benefits of science are greater than any harmful effects it may have,” “Even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research which adds to knowledge should be supported by Government,” “Science can sort out any problem” and a dichotomic variable measuring trust towards “Scientists working in an industrial laboratory.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662511428045">4</xref></sup> Finally, a scale of technological optimism was built on the number of technologies, out of the eight proposed to respondents, that will have a positive effect on our way of life in the next 20 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662511428045">5</xref></sup> For the national results on the independent variables, see the EB report at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_340_en.pdf">ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_340_en.pdf</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>For the three lines of inquiry, we began with descriptive statistics: percentages, means and correlations. To test the change of attitude towards animal research in Europe, we performed a series of non-parametric analyses of variance on the item that was measured in 2005 and 2010 (Kruskal-Wallis for independent samples). For this analysis, “Don’t know” answers were recoded as missing values. We used the Bonferroni rule to test whether there was a change between 2005 and 2010: if a <italic>p</italic>-value was smaller than 0.05/28 = 0.002, there was a significant change between 2005 and 2010 for that country.</p>
<p>In order to analyse differences in attitudes towards animal research found among individuals and countries, we constructed two-level regressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511428045">Hox, 2010</xref>). The models try to explain individuals’ attitudes using both individual characteristics (level 1) and country-level characteristics (level 2). The first model contains only a random intercept to explain the scale of attitudes towards animal research of individual <italic>i</italic> living in country <italic>j</italic> (<italic>Y<sub>ij</sub></italic>); it considers that the intercept, <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>0j</italic></sub>, depends on the characteristics, <italic>Z</italic><sub>1</sub><italic><sub>j</sub></italic> and <italic>Z</italic><sub>2</sub><italic><sub>j</sub></italic>, of country <italic>j</italic>.</p>

<p>The predictors at the country level are the number of animals used and GDP, and at the individual level gender, age, tertiary education, proximity towards science and the environment, and attitudes towards science. The second model introduces a cross-level effect (GDP and “Science can sort out any problem”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662511428045">6</xref></sup>) and random slopes for individual predictors with strong fixed effects in the first model: gender, age and two attitudes towards science (support for research and the benefits of science).</p>

<p>At the national level, experimentation on mice is generally accepted, but attitudes on experimentation on dogs and monkeys are divided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662511428045">Figure 1</xref>). However, the level of approval on mice varies between 81 percent of respondents in Estonia, 78 percent in Denmark or Lithuania and 52 percent in Austria and 49 percent in Luxembourg. Acceptance on dogs and monkeys varies between 65 percent in Spain, 62 percent in Bulgaria and 32 percent in Slovenia and 29 percent in Luxembourg.

<p>We observe a significant positive relationship between acceptance on mice or on dogs and monkeys (i.e. the more we accept on one species, the more we accept on the others, <italic>r</italic> = 0.71). Moreover, there is a clear effect of species: the use of dogs and monkeys results in lower support than the use of small rodents everywhere. For some countries, the effect of species is small, that is the gap between the two levels of approval is small, e.g. Spain, Portugal and Bulgaria (11 percent), but for other countries the gap is very important, e.g. France (36 percent), Latvia (33 percent), and Estonia (30 percent).</p>
<p>Is there a change of public attitudes towards animal experimentation in Europe? The results of a series of non-parametric analyses of variance indicate a significant effect of years in nine countries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963662511428045">Table 1</xref>), which means that acceptance of animal experimentation has significantly dropped between 2005 and 2010 in Germany, Finland, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovenia and Bulgaria. To sum up, according to our results on European countries, animal experimentation is either less accepted or records no change.</p>

<p>To understand the individual-level as well as the country-level differences in attitudes towards animal research we have carried out a two-level regression. As a preliminary analysis, we have estimated the correlations between country-level predictors and individual attitudes towards animal research. Acceptance is not related to the number of animals used in 2008,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963662511428045">7</xref></sup> but there is a significant negative correlation between acceptance and GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662511428045">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>r</italic> = −0.63): as the level of industrialisation increases, the level of acceptance of animal research decreases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0963662511428045">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>The results of the two-level regression analyses are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511428045">Table 2</xref>. The so-called null-model (not shown here) indicates that 95 percent of the total variance in public perception of animal research is due to within-country variance and only 5 percent to between-country variance. The first column displays the results of the model with a random intercept. Let us first examine the country-level effects. As suggested by the preliminary analysis, the number of animals used is not significant; we therefore dropped this insignificant country-level variable for model 2. However, GDP is a significant predictor: all other things being equal, individuals’ acceptance of animal research decreases by almost 0.25 percent with every increase in GDP per capita of 10,000 Euros.</p>

<p>Men, older people and tertiary educated people are more likely to accept animal experimentation than women, younger people and less educated people. The acceptance of animal experimentation is also positively linked with information on new medical discoveries, with attendance at debates on science, and with positive attitudes towards science and technology (specifically, potential benefits of science and technology, an omnipotent vision of science, support for research, trust in scientists, technological optimism) and negatively linked with information on environmental problems.</p>
<p>The second column displays the results of the model with an interaction between country- and individual-level variables (between GDP and the item on the omnipotence of science) and with random slopes on gender, age, support for research and benefits of science. This analysis has improved significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001) the quality of the model. At the country level, the fixed effect of GDP is still significant. The cross-level effect between GDP and the omnipotence of science reaches significance with a negative estimate (−0.03), meaning that taking an omnipotent vision of science moves towards more acceptance of animal research in countries with low levels of GDP than in countries with high levels of GDP.</p>
<p>The Appendix gives the random slopes for every country, and the comparison of the fixed and random effects for these predictors gives some interesting information. The random slopes for gender vary between −0.35 in Hungary and Spain, −0.33 in Italy, and 0.42 in the UK and Sweden, 0.47 in Finland and 0.52 in Switzerland. As the estimate of the fixed effect of gender is 0.60, this means that in Hungary, Spain and Italy the effect of gender is very low, whereas in the UK, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland the effect of gender is much stronger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0963662511428045">9</xref></sup> In the case of support for research, the random slopes vary between −0.25 in Finland, −0.23 in Slovenia, −0.19 in the UK, and 0.13 in Italy and 0.24 in Cyprus. As the estimate of the fixed effect is 0.34, this means that in Finland, Slovenia and the UK the effect of support for research is very weak, whereas in Cyprus and Italy the effect is much stronger. Finally, the item on the weighting of the benefits and harmful effects of science has a much lower effect in Malta, Denmark, Belgium and Sweden, whereas it has a stronger positive effect in Romania and Austria.</p>
<p>For the last predictor, the random slope estimates change completely the interpretation. For age, the minimum random slopes are −0.16 in Luxembourg and −0.15 in Austria and the maximum are 0.17 in Cyprus and 0.18 in Latvia. As the estimate of the fixed effect of age is 0.11, this means that in Luxembourg and Austria, age has a small negative effect (the younger are more positive towards animal research), whereas in Cyprus and Latvia there is a stronger positive effect (the older you are, the more positive you are towards animal research).</p>

<title>4. Discussion</title>
<p>At the national level, experimentation on mice is generally accepted (27 countries out of 28 have acceptance above 50%, and even 10 countries above 70%), but attitudes on experimentation on dogs and monkeys are divided (10 countries have acceptance above 50% and 10 countries below 40%). On the last species, we observe a drop in approval between 2005 and 2010 in nine European countries, mostly Eastern European countries, and stability in the remaining countries. These results may be related to the increase in the number of actions of animal research opponents nowadays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511428045">Demateo, 2008</xref>). Spain, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Latvia record the highest levels of approval of animal research on both species, whereas Luxembourg, Austria and Switzerland show among the lowest levels of approval. This pattern is consistent with the few existing studies, such as a study of attitudes towards animal welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511428045">TNS Opinion &amp; Social, 2007</xref>), where Spain, Lithuania and Latvia indicated the lowest importance on the animal welfare score.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0963662511428045">10</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511428045">Pardo et al.’s (2009)</xref> study on public perceptions of “pharming” showed considerable difference in the attitudes towards animal rights to life in twelve European countries; moreover, Spain presented the highest acceptance rate for the statement that animals have a right to life but not in the same way as humans and Austria the highest acceptance that animals have a right to life in a similar way to humans.</p>
<p>Animal experimentation sets in a way the question of the human–animal boundary, i.e. where to “draw the line” on the species that deserve moral consideration. In all countries, experimentation on mice is more accepted than on dogs and monkeys. The higher support for research on mice is coherent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511428045">Driscoll’s (1992)</xref> study which stated that approval is higher for rodents or non-mammalian vertebrates than for attractive mammals (primates or pets).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0963662511428045">11</xref></sup> The lower support for research on dogs and monkeys is in line with public pressure on monkey research in some European countries, and the fact that new legislations jeopardise this type of research in countries like Switzerland and Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511428045">Suran and Wolinsky, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Our multilevel analysis demonstrates that public attitudes towards animal research vary between and within countries. The between-country differences are explained by GDP per capita: populations in industrialised countries have higher levels of approval of animal research than populations in post-industrial countries. Animal research is performed mostly in a scientific context and in this sense the influence of GDP supports the post-industrialisation hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511428045">Bauer et al., 1994</xref>), but since animals are part of the environment, views on animal experimentation might also be influenced by views on the environment. GDP has been shown to positively correlate to concern for the environment: “populations in richer countries have higher levels of environmental concern” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511428045">Franzen and Meyer, 2010</xref>: 229). This relationship might also be playing a role in our results.</p>
<p>Moreover, the significance of the cross-level effect – the interaction between GDP and one’s attitude towards science – indicates that the effect of the omnipotent vision of science on approval of animal research depends on the level of industrialisation of the country in which the person lives (the effect is stronger among countries with low levels of GDP).</p>
<p>The multilevel model results show also that attitudes towards animal research are related to public perceptions of science (the acceptance of animal experimentation is linked with greater appreciation of the contributions of science and technology) and the environment (the acceptance is linked with less interest in or information on environmental problems). These results are consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511428045">Pifer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511428045">Jerolmack, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511428045">Crettaz von Roten, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally the multilevel model provides random slope estimates that could be used to group countries on the explanatory pattern of attitudes towards animal research. Because attitudes towards animal research are not a performance indicator but a cultural indicator, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511428045">Bauer, Allum and Miller’s (2007)</xref> terms, such attitudes are rooted in transnational cultural environments. Research on similarities among countries might contribute to documenting the cultural dimension of attitudes towards animal research.</p>
<p>This study was performed on a secondary analysis of existing data, that didn’t include a wide collection of items to measure fully attitudes towards animal research. However, this important issue should be studied with a specific survey that would involve a well-established series of items on attitudes towards animal research (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511428045">Driscoll, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511428045">Eldridge and Gluck, 1996</xref>). Such a specific survey could also include other possible predictors such as items on attitudes towards animals and nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511428045">Serpell, 2004</xref>) or measures of the level of knowledge on animal experimentation or measures of values. Furthermore, it might be helpful to research the influence of press coverage given on animal experimentation and public engagement by animal scientists on public perceptions. A survey of nearly 1000 biomedical scientists, conducted by <italic>Nature</italic>, suggests that communication on animal research with the general public could be encouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511428045">Cressey, 2011</xref>). Do cross-national differences at the level of public engagement of scientists doing animal research explain differences in public perceptions of animal research? This question should be investigated in further research.</p>
<p>We began this paper with a question about the lack of research on attitudes towards animal experimentation by the PUS community. Our multilevel analyses confirm the working hypothesis of a link between attitudes towards animal research and attitudes towards science. We find that this link is influenced by the level of industrialisation, in addition to the simple effect of the level of industrialisation on attitudes towards animal research. We hope to encourage further research in the light of our empirical analysis.</p>
