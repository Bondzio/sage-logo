<abstract>
<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To assess if patients can safely self-assess their need for ear, nose, and throat (ENT) review following initial emergency department attendance for nasal trauma.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design</italic>. This prospective study was divided into 2 parts. The initial part evaluated an information sheet for patients to lead them through a self-assessment to establish if they require ENT review following nasal injury. The second part of the study investigated outcomes following the introduction of the self-assessment.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. This work was conducted at a District General Hospital in Scotland.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. Forty-nine consecutive patients underwent self-assessment plus blinded otolaryngology assessment, after which self-assessment was introduced as routine. This was evaluated comparing outcomes of 49 new consecutive nasal injuries against the original group using subjective patient scores of nasal cosmesis and nasal airway following injury and any subsequent treatment.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. There was no significant difference in outcome between the 2 study periods. After the introduction of self-assessment, there was a large reduction in the nonattendance rate for nasal injuries and in the attendances of patients with nasal injuries not requiring manipulation.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion</italic>. In our institution, patients can be relied on to safely self-assess their nasal injuries to decide if they need ENT review when provided with appropriate information. This reduces the outpatient burden on the ENT department with no deterioration in subjective patient outcomes.</p>

<p>The nasal bones are the most commonly fractured bone of the facial skeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811435892">1</xref></sup> (the third most common bone fractured overall),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811435892">2</xref></sup> and these injuries are frequently part of otolaryngology practice. Such fractures are most commonly due to road traffic accidents, sporting injuries, assaults, and falls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811435892">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Displaced fractures require reduction within 2 weeks of injury to achieve an optimum outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811435892">4</xref></sup> Assessment also requires exclusion of potential complications (eg, septal hematoma, cerebrospinal fluid leak) due to their adverse consequences. A delay in diagnosis or treatment beyond the therapeutic window can lead to persistent functional deficit, deformity, or the need for more extensive reconstructive surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811435892">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our institution, patients have previously been seen in a weekly nasal fracture clinic run by a junior ear, nose, and throat (ENT) trainee. Patients were assessed 5 to 10 days after their injury and had arrangements for treatment made as required. This clinic had a high nonattendance rate, and many patients were found to have minor injuries that required no intervention. It was postulated that enabling patients themselves to arrange assessment after any initial swelling had resolved could minimize such problems. This study was designed to test if patients were able to self-assess and self-refer their nasal injury on the basis of information in an advice sheet without a detrimental effect on long-term outcomes.</p>

<title>First Study Period</title>
<p>All patients attending a weekly fractured nose clinic at an otolaryngology department over a 4-month period were invited to participate in the study. Referrals were accepted from the local emergency department or general practice. Patients were assessed in the clinic 5 to 10 days following the date of nasal injury as per usual practice.</p>
<p>After obtaining written consent for enrollment in the study, patients were given an information sheet on nasal fractures and their assessment, detailing how, when, and why treatment could be given (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811435892"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). After demographic information was obtained, subjects assessed their own injury using the provided pro forma (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811435892"><bold>Table 1a</bold></xref>). Patient’s self-assessments were sealed in an envelope prior to medical review. Subjects were subsequently assessed by an otolaryngologist (lead author) who was blinded to the patient-rated outcomes.</p>

<p>In addition to the injury self-assessment, patients were asked if they considered a nasal manipulation was required and if they would have telephoned for a clinic appointment 1 week after injury if the patient information sheet had been provided at the time of acute presentation (ie, if they felt there was a cause for concern).</p>
<p>After all treatment was completed, all subjects were recontacted by telephone 12 to 18 months after initial injury. Both those who had attended and those who had not were included on an intention-to-treat basis. Patients were asked to subjectively rate current bony deformity and nasal airway compared with preinjury by asking if the airway and cosmesis were the same, better, or worse than their preinjury state (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599811435892"><bold>Table 1b</bold></xref>). Subjects were also asked if any adverse events had occurred following their injury.</p>

<title>Second Study Period</title>
<p>A change to referral practice was made prior to commencement of the second study period. Upon seeking initial assessment within the emergency department, patients were given an instructional booklet based on the first study information sheet (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811435892"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). This replaced the previous practice of automatically booking all patients into an otolaryngology clinic. Subjects were asked to self-assess their nose 5 to 7 days postinjury using the instructional booklet. In the presence of new bony deformity or nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, or other concerns, subjects were advised to telephone for an appointment to be assessed. Patients who were unable to read or understand the information sheet were managed according to the previous protocol.</p>
<p>During the second study period, conducted over 7 months, the management pathway of each patient was recorded. Subjects were contacted by telephone for final follow-up in the same manner as those in the first study period 12 to 18 months after initial injury.</p>
<p>The cosmetic and functional outcomes of patients were compared with patient preinjury status using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (VasserStats, Poughkeepsie, New York). The protocols used were approved as complying with the audit policy of St John’s Hospital, Livingston, addressing ethical concerns.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the first study period, 61 consecutive patients were referred to the fractured nose clinic, of which 49 (80%) attended for assessment; all agreed to participate in the study. The demographic details are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599811435892"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>. The remaining 12 patients (20%) failed to attend their clinic. Twenty-three of the enrolled subjects (47%) were assessed to be suitable and underwent nasal manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) by an otolaryngologist (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0194599811435892"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). The self-assessment of nasal injuries by patients with regard to their need for MUA had a sensitivity of 35% and specificity of 54% against the gold standard of an ENT doctor assessment. Four patients (8%) who were considered suitable for MUA stated that they would not have telephoned for an appointment after reading the information sheet. Further investigation of these cases showed mitigating factors for this decision; these will be considered in the Discussion section. Nineteen subjects were lost to follow-up, and the reasons for this are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0194599811435892"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>. The remaining 42 of the original 61 patients who had been given appointments responded to telephone follow-up, and outcome data were collected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0194599811435892"><bold>Tables 5</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0194599811435892"><bold>6</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>During the second study period, 49 consecutive patients were given self-assessment information sheets by the emergency department. The demographic details of this group are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599811435892"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>; they are comparable with subjects in the first study group. Within the second study population, 7 patients (14%) self-referred for otolaryngology assessment by telephoning for an appointment, and 2 patients (29%) underwent subsequent MUA of a nasal fracture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0194599811435892"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). Thirty-six patients (74%) were successfully contacted for final follow-up; those patients with whom contact was not possible are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0194599811435892"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>.</p>
<p>Posttreatment outcome measures of nasal cosmesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0194599811435892"><bold>Table 5</bold></xref>) and nasal airway patency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0194599811435892"><bold>Table 6</bold></xref>) show similar results between the 2 study groups. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the 2 study referral pathways in either nasal cosmesis outcome (<italic>P</italic> = .88) or nasal patency outcome (<italic>P</italic> = .87). In particular, it can be seen that there is no deterioration in the proportions of those having a less than perfect outcome for the 2 measures when moving to the patient self-assessment pathway. Data for the outcomes of those who underwent MUA in the 2 groups are included and appear satisfactory, but statistical analysis was not performed because this was not part of the aims of the study (in addition, the numbers in the second group are to low too give any meaningful results).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nasal injuries are extremely common in otolaryngology practice. Only a minority of injuries require any further management, and thus, new strategies to minimize the number of unnecessary referrals and nonattendances at clinic are welcome. Prior to instituting a management algorithm change, this study demonstrated a high referral rate for nasal injuries associated with a significant subsequent nonattendance rate (20%). Following otolaryngology assessment, 23 (47%) subjects underwent manipulation of their nasal pyramid. Final follow-up revealed high levels of subject satisfaction with both nasal cosmesis and nasal patency.</p>
<p>Of those eligible for surgical correction, 4 subjects after self-assessment stated that they would not have telephoned for an appointment for consideration of surgical intervention. Of these, 1 subject had a history of previous nasal fracture, and the new injury added to the preexisting deformity. A second case was under review by the maxillofacial surgeons for a facial fracture and did not appreciate the need for additional assessment by the otolaryngology service. The third case was of a young male who sustained an injury during a football match with resulting deformity. It is possible his younger age or desire to continue to play football may have contributed to his responses. The final case gave paradoxical responses, stating he felt he needed a manipulation but would not have phoned for an appointment.</p>
<p>Following a change in referral pathway, which allowed subjects to self-assess their injury and self-refer to clinic as required, the number of referrals dropped to just 14% of the nasal injuries treated acutely by the emergency department. Of these, all patients attended their requested otolaryngology assessment. The number of attending subjects undergoing nasal manipulation was also reduced (9% of total injuries, 29% of self-assessors attending). Long-term subject satisfaction was no different from those going through a more traditional management pathway in the first study group for nasal cosmesis (<italic>P</italic> = .88) and patency (<italic>P</italic> = .87). There were no adverse outcomes for either patient group, and the only patient expressing ongoing concern about his nose at telephone follow-up had been an attender in the second group who had gone on to have septal surgery at a later date. While he was dissatisfied with the eventual outcome, the process itself was not at fault.</p>
<p>There was a difference in the number of cases considered eligible for MUA between the 2 study cohorts. This may have been compounded by the low number of patients who attended for assessment in the second study group; the low number could be for a variety of factors relating to the injury (mechanism, alcohol intake, or time of year). There were more assaults in the initial group (59% vs 47%), and alcohol was more often involved when acquiring the injury in this group (30% vs 12%). These factors may be relevant in the severity of the trauma sustained.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that patients within the referral population were able to safely and effectively self-assess their own nasal trauma. This had a beneficial impact on clinic appointments and no adverse effect on the patients’ long-term outcome. This is the first study to demonstrate that patients with nasal trauma may be managed in this way.</p>
<p>Limitations of the study include the use of an information sheet that relies on patients being able to understand the information and retain it until the appropriate time for self-assessment. This could be a problem given the circumstances under which many nasal injuries occur (ie, late at night, with alcohol involvement, and with alleged assault) or among a population with high illiteracy rates or ethnic diversity that precludes reading and understanding written information. The outcomes of the initial study would suggest that this was not a factor within the population studied.</p>
<p>Long-term follow-up data were available from 69% of the first study group and 74% of the second study group. Given the long time between the injury and follow-up (12-18 months to ensure that complete healing had occurred) and the young and transient nature of the study population, this loss to follow-up is within anticipated parameters. There was no significant difference in dropout rates between the 2 study groups.</p>
<p>The use of subjective outcome measures inevitably has potential for bias. However, attempts at objective measures would have been impractical as preinjury data could not be collected (be it cosmetic or functional data), and even if this were not an issue, the logistics and resources required to obtain clinical photography and functional measures would have placed an undue burden on the unit so as to make it impossible to run this study. Ultimately, it is patients’ subjective perception of their outcomes that is the important factor, and this is what we aimed to record with the telephone survey.</p>
<p>While the study demonstrated no change in outcome following the use of self-assessment, it should be borne in mind that there is an increased emphasis on the emergency department team initially assessing the patient to exclude occult injuries and that they spend sufficient time going through the information sheet with the patient to ensure that the patient understands all that is involved. Should the initial assessment raise any concerns regarding the patient’s ability to perform self-assessment, there should still be an avenue for direct referral to the otolaryngology department.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that the aim of this approach is to improve the patients’ journey following their nasal injury, addressing their concerns while minimizing unnecessary medical attendances. The results obtained from this work in our institution suggest this novel approach achieves this and maintains good outcomes. Implementation in other units should be subjected to all the usual clinical governance safeguards and appropriate evaluation to maintain standards.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Patient self-assessment of nasal injury accurately selects a group containing those who require surgical intervention. This has no adverse effect on long-term subjective patient cosmesis and airway outcomes. Such a management algorithm reduces the number of unnecessary clinic appointments and nonattendance rates, saving patient visits and reducing the burden on the outpatient resources.</p>
