<p>Alcohol use is becoming a critical problem in the area of health promotion and preventive programmes for adolescents. Likewise, in Korea, adolescent alcohol use has become an increasingly severe social problem. As many as one-fourth of Korean high school students engage in problematic alcohol use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911409733">1</xref></sup> The onset of alcohol use among Korean adolescents has been becoming increasingly earlier, at a mean age of 13.4 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911409733">2</xref></sup> Annual reports of college freshman deaths caused by too much alcohol during ‘hazing’ – a ritual involving alcohol abuse and violent activities as a way of initiating freshmen into a group by college seniors – are growing in number. Korea has been undergoing dramatic social and economic changes over the last 40 years which seem to have led to corresponding changes in values with the introduction of Western individualism and competitiveness. Close family ties, which have been emphasized under Confucian philosophy in the past, have rapidly loosened, and a generation gap in values between youth and the aged has been increasing. This rapid culture-contextual change has caused Korean adolescents to be more vulnerable to alcohol use.</p>
<p>Many studies have examined predictors of the use of substances such as alcohol and tobacco by adolescents (hereafter referred to as ‘substance use’), the majority of which have shown that the parent–adolescent relationship is an important protective factor against substance use during adolescence. Findings from previous studies support the social control theory and the attachment theory, both of which emphasize the importance of the parental attachment relationship as a protective factor against adolescent substance use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911409733">3</xref></sup> Both theories suggested that adolescents who had little or no rewarding interactions with parents were more likely to use substances, and that lower levels of relationship quality leads to higher levels of negative interaction and less parental monitoring.</p>
<p>Peer substance use is one of the strongest influences to be related to adolescent substance use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911409733">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911409733"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911409733">12</xref></sup> These findings support theoretical models (peer socialization model, peer selection model, and bidirectional influences model). These models suggested that peer substance use is a risk factor against substance use during adolescence. Additionally, Jaccard, Blanton, and Dodge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911409733">13</xref></sup> showed that peer influences were found to be stronger when adolescents were dissatisfied with their maternal relationships and that adolescents identified more closely with their peers than with their parents when parental bonds were strained, which suggests a moderating effect of parental factors on the link between peer substance and adolescent substance use.</p>
<p>Others have reported a gradual increase in adolescent substance use over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911409733">14</xref></sup> To investigate the trajectory of change in adolescent substance use, we used latent growth curve models (LGMs). LGMs exhibit patterns of such a trajectory by measuring variables repeatedly with longitudinal data. Furthermore, LGMs are unique in that they incorporate information on the means as well as the variances and covariances of measured variables. Thus these models focus on both the group and individual level of analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911409733">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the basis of literature review, we aimed first to examine trajectories of change in adolescent substance use during high school in Korea using LGMs, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0017896911409733">Figure 1</xref>. If the individual differences were significant in the trajectories of change in adolescent substance use, the predictors of adolescent substance use – parent–adolescent relationship quality, parental monitoring, and deviant peers – could be introduced, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0017896911409733">Figure 2</xref>. Finally, we examined whether parental factors moderated the association between peer substance use and adolescent substance use.</p>

<p>This study used the Korea Youth Panel Survey (KYPS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911409733">16</xref></sup> a nationally-representative sample of 3,125 high school students. The participants were in the 10th grade when first recruited and were assessed annually from 2005 to 2007. Retention rates were 90.5 % and 86.0 %in 2006 and 2007, respectively. There were no significant differences between participants who stayed in survey and those who dropped with respect to demographic characteristics (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; .19 for family income, parents’ education, age, and sex). In this study, demographic variables were found not to be related significantly to adolescent substance use. We addressed missing data with full information maximum likelihood (FIML).</p>

<title>Parent–adolescent relationship quality</title>
<p>We utilized the parent–adolescent relationship quality measure developed by KYPS and validated in Korean studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911409733">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911409733">18</xref></sup> This measure included six items such as: ‘I try to spend lots of time with my parents’, ‘My parents always like and love me’ and ‘My parents and I understand each other well’. Responses were based on five-point Likert scales (1= I very much disagree to 5 = I very much agree). Higher scores indicated higher relationship quality, and we used the mean scores of the six items.

<title>Parental monitoring</title>
<p>We used the parental monitoring measure from the KYPS. This measure included four items such as: ‘When I go out, my parents know where I am in most cases’, and ‘when I go out my parents know whom I am with in most cases’. Responses were made on five-point Likert scales (higher scores represented <italic>stronger parental monitoring</italic>). We analyzed the mean scores for the four items.

<title>Peer substance use (alcohol and tobacco)</title>
<p>Two items from the KYPS were taken: ‘the number of close friends who have drunk alcohol for the past one year’ and ‘the number of close friends who have smoked for the past one year’. Responses were coded on five-point Likert scales (0 = no friends, 1 = 1–2 friends, 2 = 3–5 friends, 3 = 6–10 friends, and 4 = 11 or more friends). We used the mean scores of the two questions, and mean and standard deviations are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911409733">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Adolescent substance use (alcohol and tobacco)</title>
<p>Two questions from the KYPS were administered in 2005, 2006, and 2007 to assess the frequency of alcohol use during the previous one year and the frequency of smoking during the last year. In Korea, the use of drugs such as marijuana is illegal and carries severe penalties. Hence, in this study, substance use measured alcohol and tobacco use only. Responses were coded on five-point Likert scales (0 = never, 1 = 1–2 times, 2 = 3–5 times, 3 = 6–10 times, and 4 = 11 or more times).

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis was conducted in three steps using AMOS 7.0. In the first step, an LGM was used to test the expectation that adolescents would report gradual linear growth in substance use over time. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0017896911409733">Figure 1</xref>, because the intercept or starting point is a constant for any given individual, the factor loadings of the intercept on the repeated measures are fixed to 1. The slope factor has sample estimates of the mean and variance that represent the mean rate of the change in adolescent substance use and individual variability about that change, respectively. Factor loadings of the slope on the repeated measures were 0, 1, and 2, which describe linear growth across three time points based on a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911409733">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the second step, the expanded LGM displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0017896911409733">Figure 2</xref> was estimated to test the effects of parent–adolescent relationship quality, parental monitoring, and peer substance use on adolescent substance use. The effects were examined by regressing the adolescent substance use intercept and slope factors on parent–adolescent relationship quality, parental monitoring, and peer substance use. In the third step, we tested whether parental factors (parent–adolescent relationship quality and parental monitoring) moderated the relation between peer substance use and the trajectory of change in adolescent substance use. To further examine the moderating-effect hypothesis, we conducted a series of multiple-group LGM in which we compared adolescents who had low parent-related scores with those who had high parent-related scores.</p>

<title>LGMs of adolescent substance use</title>
<p>The main aim of this research was concerned with the characteristics of growth in substance use among Korean adolescents. A three-wave LGM of adolescent substance use and the statistical fit of the LGM are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0017896911409733">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0017896911409733">Table 2</xref>, respectively. Estimation of the model indicated that the hypothesized linear trajectory provided a very good fit to the observed data (χ<sup>2</sup> with 1 <italic>df</italic> = .056, <italic>p</italic> = .813, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 1.000, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 1.002, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = .000). The mean initial starting point for substance use was estimated to be .445 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the mean rate of change was estimated to be .165 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Variance estimates for the intercept (.472, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the slope (.115, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001) also showed individual differences. Finally, the estimated correlation between the intercept factor and the slope factor was −.047 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); thus, higher levels of initial substance use were slightly but significantly associated with slower growth in substance use over time.</p>

<title>Predictors and growth in substance use</title>
<p>Predictors of growth in adolescent substance use were evaluated for the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0017896911409733">Figure 3</xref>. The correlation matrix for this model is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0017896911409733">Table 3</xref>. Fit indexes indicated very good fit of the model to the observed data (χ<sup>2</sup> with 4 <italic>df</italic> = 5.605, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, CFI = 1.000, TLI = .998, RMSEA = .001). Consistent with prior research, our results showed that lower parent–adolescent relationship quality (β = −.077, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and peer substance use (β = .686, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were associated with higher initial levels of adolescent substance use. Whereas parental monitoring was not associated with initial adolescent substance use, it was negatively related to linear growth in substance use (β = −.087, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), indicating that lower levels of parental monitoring (Time 1) prospectively predicted accelerated rates of growth in substance use over time. Parent–adolescent relationship quality was unrelated to the adolescent substance use slope, indicating that it did not predict the average growth that occurred for all adolescents. Time 1 peer substance use was negatively related to linear growth in adolescent substance use over time (β= −.104, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), indicating that lower levels of peer substance use (Time 1) prospectively predicted accelerated rates of growth in substance use over time, which reflected findings of LGM analysis that covariance of intercept and slope was significantly negative.</p>

<p>We examined whether parent–adolescent relationship quality moderated the association between peer substance use and adolescent substance use. The multiple-group analysis proceeded as follows: as a first step, the sample was divided into high/low groups based on a mean split of scores on the Time 1 measure of parent–adolescent relationship quality. Then the model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0017896911409733">Figure 3</xref> was estimated simultaneously for the low and high groups. All parameter estimates showed different values in the two samples. Then a model was estimated in which the path from parent–adolescent relationship quality to the substance use intercept factor was forced to be equal across the two groups. The difference in the chi-square values between the two models was significant (χ<sup>2</sup> with 1 <italic>df</italic> =11.544, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), indicating that the fit of the second, constrained, model was significantly worse than that of the first, unconstrained model. Further examination revealed that the estimated effect of peer substance use on the initial level of adolescent substance use was significant and positive for adolescents with the low (<italic>b</italic> = .536, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the high parent–adolescent relationship quality (<italic>b</italic> = .457, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). This suggested that peer substance use influenced more strongly the initial level of adolescent substance use in the low group than high parent–adolescent relationship quality group.</p>
<p>As a second step a model was estimated in which the path from parent–adolescent relationship quality to the substance use slope factor was forced to be equal across the two groups. The difference in the chi-square values between the two models was significant (χ<sup>2</sup> with 1 <italic>df</italic> = 6.653, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), indicating that the fit of the second, constrained, model was significantly worse than that of the first, unconstrained, model. Data showed that the estimated effect of peer substance use on subsequent growth in adolescent substance use was significant and negative for adolescents in the low group (<italic>b</italic> = −.062, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but was not significant for adolescents with high parent–adolescent relationship quality (<italic>b</italic> = −.016, <italic>p &gt;</italic> .05). As expected, an effect of peer substance use on adolescent substance use was evident only in the low parent–adolescent relationship quality group, which indicated that parent–adolescent relationship quality served as a moderator</p>
<p>Second, we performed the same procedure to examine whether parental monitoring moderated the effects of peer substance use on both the intercept and the slope of adolescent substance use (the slope factor). The differences in the chi-square values between the unconstrained and constrained models were not significant in intercept (χ<sup>2</sup> with 1 <italic>df</italic> =.078, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) and slope (χ<sup>2</sup> with 1 <italic>df</italic> =.022, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), respectively, indicating that no moderating effect of parental monitoring was found in the association between peer substance use and both starting point and subsequent linear growth in adolescent substance use.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the effects of parent–adolescent relationship quality, parental monitoring, and peer substance use on adolescent substance use in Korea. In particular, an LGM of adolescent substance use in Korea was developed, and predictors of growth were examined. Additionally, this study investigated the moderating role of parental variables in the association between peer substance use and adolescent substance use. The study contributed to the literature by using LGMs, assessing such LGMs for substance use among Korean adolescents, exploring the predictors of such growth, and incorporating the parental effect and the peer effect into a single model.</p>
<p>Consistent with the results of extant work in the West,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911409733">14</xref></sup> substance use among Korean adolescents increased over time. The trajectories of change in adolescent substance use were similar to those observed in the West, providing more evidence of cultural similarity. These increasing trajectories of adolescent substance use have been reported in studies of American youth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911409733">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911409733">19</xref></sup> and Korean youth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911409733">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911409733"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911409733">22</xref></sup>. However, these trajectories of change exhibited significant individual differences in Korea. The pattern of trajectory of change was a linear growth over time, but its initial starting point and slope differed significantly among individuals. In light of these differences, it was necessary to examine which adolescents displayed low initial starting points and slow rates of change in substance use over time and which displayed high initial starting points and steeper slopes. Parent–adolescent relationship quality had a significantly negative effect on the starting point of adolescent substance use but did not significantly influence its slope. On the contrary, parental monitoring did not correlate with the starting point of adolescent substance use but showed a slight negative effect on its slope. Previous studies that examined only causal relationships among variables and drew conclusions about the effect on parental variables of adolescent substance use were unable to assess the starting point and change rate of growth over time in substance uses associated with these parental factors (parent–adolescent relationship and parental monitoring) with different mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911409733">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911409733">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911409733"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911409733">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study revealed the important role of peer substance use in predicting adolescent substance use. This result also supports cultural similarity. The effects of peer substance use on adolescent substance use was consistent with what has been reported in prior research on Western adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911409733">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911409733"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911409733"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911409733">12</xref></sup> In particular, peer substance use influenced the initial level of adolescent substance use significantly more strongly than either of the two parenting variables (parent–adolescent relationship quality: β = −.077, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; parental monitoring: β = −.007, <italic>ns</italic>; peer substance use: β = .686, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). These findings were consistent with those of Lee’s study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911409733">17</xref></sup>, which reported the importance of peer groups in the development of adolescent externalizing problems. Some researchers have hypothesized that the influence of parents generally weakens over time, such that, in adolescence, the influence of peers becomes stronger than in childhood, while the influence of parents becomes weaker.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896911409733">30</xref></sup> During this transition, healthy peer relationships provide positive social support for adolescents, while unhealthy peer relationships yield a strong predictor of deviant behaviours. The results, exhibiting such a great difference in the size of the effects of parental factors and those of peer factors, might reflect strong substance use culture among Korean adolescents.</p>
<p>Our finding that peer substance use negatively affected the rate of change in adolescent substance use should be interpreted carefully. Although peer substance use was related negatively to the slope of adolescent substance use, this finding does not suggest that a higher level of peer substance use is associated with a smaller increase in the rate of substance use among adolescents. This result is likely caused by a ceiling effect, due to which adolescents with higher initial levels of substance use had limited room for increased levels within the upper limit of the five-point scale. This is likely because the covariance between intercept and slope was negative, and the effect of peer substance use on the intercept of adolescent substance use was strong.</p>
<p>We investigated whether parental variables moderated the associations between peer substance use and adolescent substance use. It was found that only parent–adolescent relationship quality had a moderating effect. An effect of peer substance use on adolescent substance use was evident only in the low level of parent–adolescent relationship quality group, not in the high level of parent–adolescent relationship quality group. As mentioned in Branstetter et al’s study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911409733">3</xref></sup> it seems that parent–adolescent relationships would work to reduce the selection of delinquent or alcohol-using peers much in the same manner as they influence the use of alcohol. Specifically, if the relationships with parents were threatened by interactions with an alcohol-using peer, an adolescent with a more secure style may be more likely to make the necessary changes to ensure the trust and stability of their relationship with their parents. Thus the current study found that peer influences work with parental influences to affect adolescent substance use.</p>
<p>Despite the aforementioned outcomes of this study, it had some limitations. First, it had some measurement issues. The responses of peer substance and adolescent substance use are skewed; therefore the findings of this study are limited. Second, effect size of parent–adolescent relationship quality on adolescent substance use was small, so significance might be caused by large sample size. Third, moderating effects of the parent–adolescent relationship quality was analyzed by dividing the sample into high and low groups on the basis of the scores of the parent–adolescent relationship quality scale. Because cut-off value is highly dependent upon the observed sample even if the sample is representative of Korean adolescents, the findings can’t be generalized in diverse cultures.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As many studies only examined parenting effects on adolescent substance use, this study examined how peer influences work with parental influences to affect substance use among Korean adolescents. As expected, peers are the most powerful proximal influence on an adolescent’s substance use. Special attention needs to be paid to peer affiliations in substance use prevention programmes.</p>
