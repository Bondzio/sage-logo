<p>Purpose: We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of ankle–brachial index (ABI), photoplethysmography (PPG), and continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound (CWD) in the detection of anatomically stenotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Methods: Ninety-seven patients (194 legs) patients who had coincidentally undergone computed tomography angiography (CTA), ABI, PPG, and CWD for the evaluation of PAD were retrospectively reviewed. Sensitivity and specificity were measured. Results: Among 194 legs, 163 (84%) legs had stenotic PAD on CTA. Overall sensitivity of ABI, PPG, and CWD was 69.3%, 81.6%, and 90.8% and specificity was 96.8%, 77.4%, and 64.5%, respectively. Ankle–brachial index showed a statistically significantly decreased sensitivity (14.8%) for below trifurcation level stenosis compared with CWD (92%) and PPG (67%). The sensitivity of ABI was also significantly decreased in single level and moderate stenosis (45.1% and 42.1%, respectively). In contrast, the sensitivity of CWD and PPG was not significantly decreased. Conclusion: The ABI showed significantly decreased sensitivity especially in stenosis below the trifurcation level. Both PPG and CWD were complementary to ABI in these groups of patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can be defined as a range of noncoronary arterial syndromes that are caused by the altered structure and function of the arteries that supply the brain, visceral organs, and the limbs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>
</sup> Overall prevalence of PAD based on objective testing has been reported to be 3% to 10%, increasing to 15% to 20% in persons over 70 years in several epidemiologic studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>

</sup> The majority of patients with PAD are asymptomatic and the ratio of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003319712464814">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319712464814">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003319712464814">6</xref>
</sup>  PAD is in the region of 1:2 to 1:4. Patients with symptomatic PAD have a significantly high risk of death from cardiovascular disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003319712464814">7</xref>
</sup> They have approximately a 28% 5-year mortality rate which is higher than the 5-year mortality rates of breast cancer and Hodgkin disease in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319712464814">8</xref>
</sup> However, even in patients with PAD without typical symptoms such as intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia, the risk of subsequent cardiovascular morbidity, myocardial infarction, and internal carotid artery stenosis is substantially higher than that in the average population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003319712464814">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319712464814">8</xref>

</sup> Therefore, early detection and management of patients with asymptomatic PAD may be indicated. To date, ankle–brachial index (ABI) is the most widely used initial evaluation method for screening PAD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>
</sup> It is relatively simple, noninvasive, inexpensive, and is more than 90% sensitive and specific compared to angiography, the gold standard test.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003319712464814">12</xref>
</sup> Although ABI provides several benefits, it has limitations. Ten percent of the general population has congenital absence of the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery meaning that ABI would not be accurate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319712464814">13</xref>
</sup> And ABI may not be accurate in noncompressible pedal arteries, as in diabetic and elderly patients.<sup>

</sup> Furthermore, several authors have recently questioned the sensitivity of ABI and reported its sensitivity at 60% to 70%, compared with angiography.<sup>

</sup> Several noninvasive vascular diagnostic tools have been tried to overcome the shortcomings of ABI, which includes toe–brachial index,<sup>

</sup> Changes in blood volume, blood vessel wall movement, and the orientation of red blood cells can affect the amount of light received by the photodetector.<sup>

</sup> Continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound is used to obtain velocity waveforms and to measure systolic blood pressure at sequential segments of the extremities. This technique allows estimation of disease location and severity, follow-up of disease progression, and quantification of the effects of interventional therapies.<sup>

</sup> Although CWD and PPG were originally introduced decades ago, there has been no report that directly compares the diagnostic value of ABI, CWD, and PPG.</p>
<p>The goals of this study are (1) to assess the sensitivity and specificity of ABI, PPG, and CWD in the detection of anatomically stenotic PAD, (2) to determine whether combining these tests would improve the sensitivity and specificity, and (3) to determine a complementary role of PPG and CWD in the detection of stenotic PAD.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0003319712464814">
<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>This study was approved by our local institutional review board. A total of 225 patients who had coincidentally undergone computed tomography angiography (CTA), PPG, ABI, and CWD in a 2-year period (2007-2008) for the evaluation of PAD were retrospectively reviewed. Among the 225 patients, 127 patients were excluded according to the exclusion criteria. Finally 97 patients (194 legs) were included in present study. Exclusion criteria were (1) patients who had undergone prior interventional procedures before tests, (2) patients who had undergone interventional procedures between tests, and (3) patients in whom the interval between tests was more than 14 days. Basic characteristics such as height, weight, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular accident were collected from electronic medical records. Follow-up data of each individual patient were not included in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0003319712464814">
<title>Diagnostic Test</title>
<p>Computed tomography angiography was performed with a 64-channel MDCT (Brillance 64, Philips, the Netherlands and SOMATOM definition, Siemens AG., Germany) scanner using contrast dye. Precontrast phase, arterial phase, and venous phase images were taken. Results were interpreted by a vascular interventional and divided into 3 segments (iliac artery, femoral artery/popliteal artery, and below trifurcation level). Severity was categorized into mild stenosis (50%-69% diameter reduction), moderate stenosis (70%-89% of diameter reduction), and severe stenosis (more than 90% diameter reduction). In this study, moderate or severe stenosis was considered as significant anatomically stenotic PAD on CTA. The ABI, PPG, and CWD were measured according to the protocol at the same time. Patients were preconditioned at room temperature (24°C) for 20 minutes before evaluations. A single technician performed all the tests sequentially without disruption. The ABI was measured with a computer based diagnostic kit that includes 8 MHz continuous-wave Doppler (Vasoguard P84, VIASYS Healthcare) and sphygmomanometer with a blood pressure cuff to measure blood pressure. The ABI was derived for each leg by dividing the ankle pressure by the higher of the upper extremity pressures. Ankle pressures were determined as a higher pressure between pressures measured at posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery. An abnormal ABI was defined as less than 0.9. The CWD was subsequently measured with same equipment. Wave forms were obtained at both sides of femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis arteries. The probe was placed at the midportion of the femoral and popliteal artery. The posterior tibial pulse was detected at the posterior aspect of the medial malleolus. The dorsalis pedis pulse was detected at the dorsum of the foot.</p>
<p>The CWD wave form was interpreted by a single physician using the following criteria: (1) loss of triphasic pattern, (2) decreased amplitude of more than 50% compared with the contralateral side, or (3) loss of reverse flow component. The presence of any of these findings was considered as positive. As the normal Doppler arterial wave has a triphasic pattern composed of initial steep peak (representing systolic flow), dipping down second portion (representing reverse flow in early diastole) and last small peak (representing late diastole forward flow), loss of any component which lead to biphasic or monophasic pattern was considered as “loss of triphasic pattern.”</p>
<p>The PPG was measured subsequently. The clips which have light emitting and receiving part were attached at toes to obtain waves. At least 60 heartbeats were obtained for the averaging period. The PPG wave form was interpreted by the same physician with the criteria listed as follows: (1) loss of dicrotic notch, (2) decreased amplitude of more than 50% compared with contralateral side, or (3) rounding of peaks compared with contralateral side. The presence of any of these findings was considered as positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003319712464814">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0003319712464814">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Inc, Redmond, Washington) software. Results were systemically collected by a single researcher (D.H.R.). We considered CTA as the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) values were calculated with the Wilson score method without continuity correction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003319712464814">24</xref>
</sup> Ninety-five percent CI was used to compare between tests (if 95% CI of sensitivity of test A was higher than test B without overlapping, test A was considered to have statistically higher sensitivity than test B). The sensitivity of subgroups was calculated by grouping patients with the underlying disease and using CTA findings (number of involved segment, location of involved segment, and severity of stenosis). Pearson chi-square test was performed to compare the prevalence of PAD in subgroups. <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered as statistically significant. In every statistical analysis, each leg was considered independent of each other as each test (ABI, PPG, CWD, and CTA) was separately (ie, left and right) performed and interpreted.</p>

<title>Subgroup Analysis of Sensitivity and Specificity</title>
<p>We subsequently performed subgroup analysis. Patients were grouped by underlying disease (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and smoking history) and CTA findings (number of involved segment, location of involved segment, and severity of stenosis). As the sensitivity of diagnostic tests (ABI, CWD, and PPG) could be affected by prevalence of disease, we performed Pearson chi-square test to the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the number of patients with PAD in the subgroup. <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered as statistically significant. There was no statistical difference in the number of patients with PAD by smoking history and hypertension subgroup (<italic>P</italic> value .676 and .052, respectively). However, the number of patients with PAD in the group with diabetes mellitus was statistically significantly (<italic>P</italic> value .046) higher (79 of 88 patients, 89.8%) than the nondiabetic groups (84 of 106, 79.2%), though it was not strong. Subgroup analysis of sensitivity by underlying disease showed no statistically significant differences between groups (95% CI of sensitivity was compared). As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003319712464814">Table 3</xref>, underlying disease did not affect the sensitivity of diagnostic test.</p>

<p>Subgroup analysis by stenosis severity, number of segments involved, and anatomical location by CTA findings was performed. The ABI showed statistically significantly lower sensitivity in both the moderate and severe group when compared with PPG and CWD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003319712464814">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, in single-segment stenosis, the sensitivity of ABI was statistically significantly lower than that of PPG and CWD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003319712464814">Figure 1B</xref>). By stenosis level, sensitivity of ABI was only 14.8% (95% CI: 5.9%-32.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003319712464814">Figure 1C</xref>), which means ABI could misdiagnose about 85% of CTA-proven below trifurcation level stenosis. As ABI was not sensitive in specific groups of patients, we combined the result of PPG and CWD with ABI to evaluate their combined value. When we re-define PAD positive as “either positive PPG or ABI value of less than 0.9,” the sensitivity increased from 69.3% to 87.1% (95% CI: 81.1%-91.4%). When we combine CWD instead of PPG, the sensitivity increased up to 92% (95% CI: 86.8%-95.3%). In the below trifurcation level stenosis, the sensitivity increases more dramatically. Combination of PPG with ABI could increased sensitivity up to 77.8% (95% CI: 59.2%-89.4%) and combination of CWD with ABI could increase sensitivity up to 92.5% (95% CI: 76.6%-97.9%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003319712464814">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that the overall sensitivity of ABI for detecting PAD was lower than CWD and PPG. In stenosis with below trifurcation level, single level, and moderate degree, the sensitivity of ABI was statistically significantly lower than that of PPG and CWD. However, the specificity of PPG and CWD was lower than that of ABI. Both PPG and CWD were complementary to ABI so that combining these tests improved sensitivity in diagnosing anatomically stenotic PAD.</p>
<p>Traditionally, clinical symptoms are considered to be important in diagnosing PAD. However, the presence of intermittent claudication largely depends on the activity level of patients. In chronic debilitating condition such as diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure, PAD may manifest as a critical limb ischemia even in patients without claudication.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>
</sup> As PAD is closely associated with ischemic cardiovascular disease, early detection and early intervention (such as risk reduction medication and exercise programs) for PAD have become more important.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>
</sup> And with rapid progression in the technology of interventional endovascular procedures, timely intervention in selected patients could decrease amputation, procedural morbidity, and mortality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003319712464814">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Computed tomography angiography is usually indicated in patients with symptomatic PAD to check the anatomic location of disease before any interventional procedure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>
</sup> It is considered as accurate as digital subtraction angiography, a gold standard diagnostic method in PAD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003319712464814">26</xref>
</sup> However, as CTA needs a bolus injection (usually &gt;100 mL) of iodine-contained contrast agent, and potential serious complication such as nephrotoxicity and anaphylaxis limits its usage as a primary diagnostic method, especially in patients with decreased renal function. Magnetic resonance angiography can be an alternative option in this particular situation however it may not be available in usual clinical settings. Ankle–brachial index is a standard noninvasive diagnostic method for detecting PAD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>
</sup> It is a relatively simple, noninvasive, inexpensive test and has been reported to have good sensitivity and specificity when compared with CTA or angiography.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003319712464814">27</xref>
</sup> However, the limitations of ABI have been highlighted by many authors. Reich reported that 10% of the general population has congenital absence of the dorsalis pedis artery or posterior tibial artery and ABI may not be accurate in noncompressible pedal arteries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319712464814">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003319712464814"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003319712464814">15</xref>
</sup> Schroder et al recently reported that a high ankle pressure ABI had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 99%, while low ankle pressure ABI had a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 93%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319712464814">16</xref>
</sup> Lijmer et al reported a 79% sensitivity and 96% specificity of ABI for detecting 50% or more stenosis that was confirmed by angiography.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319712464814">17</xref>
</sup> Nam et al also reported a 61% sensitivity and 87% specificity of ABI by the same angiographic criteria above.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003319712464814">18</xref>
</sup> These reports showed a lower sensitivity than previous reports which suggested a 95% of sensitivity and specificity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003319712464814">12</xref>
</sup> Such inconsistent findings for sensitivity is likely based on a lack of clear definition of PAD in terms of anatomical location. Khan et al reported that several studies in which ABI has been shown to be &gt;90% sensitive and &gt;95% specific to diagnose 50% stenosis of lower arteries are inaccurate, because of their lack of the definition of PAD in terms of the diameter stenosis of the arteries concerned.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003319712464814">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our report differs from the ones cited above by directly comparing CTA findings with noninvasive studies (ABI, PPG, and CWD) in terms of anatomic location. Our definition of PAD on CTA was more than 70% of diminution at least one segment (from iliac artery to below trifurcate level). With direct comparison, we demonstrated that the sensitivity of ABI decreases in stenosis below trifurcate level, single level stenosis, and moderate stenosis groups. Therefore, early diagnosis of PAD would not be feasible with ABI in these specific groups. Many efforts have been tried to overcome limitations of ABI. Ramsey et al criticized ABI in that it fails to reflect the severity of peripheral ischemia when underlying vessels are calcified or when there is extensive pedal or digital arterial disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003319712464814">19</xref>
</sup> Instead of ABI, authors proposed the toe–brachial index for detecting PAD. In this article, the toe–brachial index was well correlated with ankle pressure and the sensitivity for detecting PAD was 85% to 90%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003319712464814">19</xref>
</sup> However, the toe–brachial index is not as popular in practice as ABI. It is more difficult to measure and its accuracy has also been questioned.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003319712464814">29</xref>
</sup> Allen et al have proposed PPG as an alternative test for ABI in a primary care setting.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003319712464814">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003319712464814">30</xref>
</sup> The authors advocated PPG as it has 91% sensitivity and 93% specificity compared with ABI, while it takes less time and does not need a trained specialist. Gale et al proposed segmental pressure measurements in addition to ABI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003319712464814">21</xref>
</sup> However, compared with ABI, the addition of segmental pressure to waveform data failed to improve the accuracy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003319712464814">21</xref>
</sup> Despite these efforts, none of these authors have demonstrated which test could improve the sensitivity of ABI in terms of anatomical location.</p>
<p>As early detection and early intervention of PAD is becoming more important in community health care, the need for a more sensitive test is becoming more important. In this study, we have analyzed the limitations of ABI in terms of location, severity, and number of involved segments and demonstrated that the sensitivity of ABI could increase with combining CWD and PPG.</p>
<p>This study has limitations as follows: (1) as this study is based on a retrospective review, confounding factors could not be controlled effectively. For example, we could not clearly check current smoking status but only record smoking history. (2) Vessel wall calcification that might have had an effect on ABI had not been assessed. However, only 1 leg had an ABI of more than 1.3, which indicates noncompressible calcified vessel. (3) The prevalence of PAD, especially severe PAD, was substantially high in the study population (80 legs were less than 0.6 for ABI) and males were predominant (female to male ratio was 1:9). This may have been a result of the retrospective nature of this study. This study retrospectively reviewed cases that had needed CTA for evaluation of vascular status in high-risk patients. A demographic study has shown a male predominance pattern of PAD in South Korea.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003319712464814">31</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, Criqui et al also reported that although the prevalence of PAD is similar between sexes, male patients tend to be more severely affected compared with women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319712464814">9</xref>
</sup> Therefore, we feel a male predominance in this study would not invalidate our conclusions. (4) Though we have demonstrated the limitations of ABI in below trifurcation level disease, the clinical significance of early detection and interventional treatment for the stenosis below trifurcation required further evaluation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712464814">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712464814">2</xref>
</sup> However, as several studies have demonstrated improvement in claudication symptom and foot ulcer by endovascular intervention at below trifurcation level, we expect that intervention therapy or exercise programs would be helpful in selected groups of patient.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003319712464814">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003319712464814">33</xref>
</sup> (5) The possibility of qualitative interpretation of pulse waves, especially in PPG interpretation may affect the result of our study. More objective measures such as computerized interpretation of waveforms could increase the diagnostic value of PPG<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003319712464814">34</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003319712464814">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, ABI showed statistically significantly decreased sensitivity in detection of anatomically stenotic PAD especially in stenosis below trifurcation level. Both PPG and CWD were complementary to ABI in these groups of patients. Early detection of stenotic PAD can be facilitated by combination of ABI with PPG or CWD. This may enable timely intervention in patients with PAD without typical claudication symptoms.</p>
