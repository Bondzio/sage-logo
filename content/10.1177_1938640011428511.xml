<abstract>
<p>Because of its high recurrence rate, complete excision with total synovectomy is crucial for diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis (DPVNS). Regardless of location, surgical approach requires meticulous soft tissue management and full joint exposure to assure complete tumor excision. In the ankle, PVNS can be present in the medial and lateral gutters, as well as extend along the syndesmotic ligament, flexor and peroneal tendon sheaths, and adjacent joints (ie, subtalar and midtarsal joints). The authors describe an open, anterior–posterior technique for excision of DPVNS lesions from the ankle joint with erosive lesions of the tibia and talus, as well as from the flexor hallucis longus and peroneal tendon sheaths. Whereas previously described dual-incision techniques have focused on posteromedial and posterolateral approaches to the ankle, the authors’ posterior exposure, in particular, uses a midline skin incision and a longitudinal split of the Achilles tendon. This provides an excellent exposure and minimizes potential wound healing complications.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare disease with an annual incidence of 1.8 patients per million people per year in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640011428511">1</xref></sup> Although more common in the knee, its occurrence in the ankle ranges from 2.5% to 25% of all cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640011428511">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640011428511">3</xref></sup> and may present with swelling, pain, and/or tenderness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640011428511">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640011428511">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>First described in 1852, PVNS was originally thought to be a neoplasm based on its behavior. PVNS lesions were found to be locally aggressive, capable of eroding articular structures, including bone and soft tissues, and exhibited a high recurrence rate following attempted resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640011428511">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640011428511">7</xref></sup> Since that time, PVNS has been pathologically thought of as a proliferative condition of the synovium, tendon sheaths, and bursa,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640011428511">8</xref></sup> characterized histologically by lipid-laden macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, hemosiderin deposition, and fibroblastic proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640011428511">9</xref></sup> Monoarticular involvement is the most common disease manifestation.</p>
<p>The 2 extremes of presentation described in the literature include diffuse (DPVNS) and localized (LPVNS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640011428511">7</xref></sup> DPVNS characteristically involves the majority of the joint synovium. It is more common and historically has a high recurrence rate following surgical resection, reported up to 46% in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640011428511">10</xref></sup> LPVNS presents as a pedunculated, lobular lesion affecting one synovial region. This disease form has an excellent prognosis and a low recurrence rate after surgical resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640011428511">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A retrospective study of 11 cases of PVNS affecting the foot and ankle reported a painful mass as the initial symptom in 9 cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640011428511">11</xref></sup> The average lag between symptom onset and diagnosis for PVNS of the ankle is 27 to 38 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640011428511">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640011428511">12</xref></sup> Timely diagnosis is essential in preventing further morbidity, including mechanical instability, joint degeneration, and osseous destruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640011428511">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of its high recurrence rate, complete excision with total synovectomy is crucial for DPVNS. Surgical approach requires meticulous soft tissue management, full joint exposure to assure complete tumor excision from the medial and lateral gutters. Furthermore, PVNS can extend along the syndesmotic ligament, flexor and peroneal tendon sheaths, and adjacent joints (ie, subtalar and midtarsal joints) necessitating excision at these locations as well. Adjuvant therapies described in the literature include use of intraarticular radioactive isotopes, radiation therapy, and cryosurgical techniques.</p>
<p>The extent of extra-articular disease generally favors open treatment over arthroscopic excision but not without associated complications. Clearly, there is a delicate balance between damaging healthy tissues in attempting complete surgical excision versus performing a less aggressive resection to protect normal tissue, perhaps at the expense of a higher disease recurrence rate. If disease recurs, revision surgery is made even more challenging with the presence of scar tissue and complication rates are correspondingly higher.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640011428511">14</xref></sup> Thus, appropriate surgical approach and meticulous soft tissue management are essential.</p>
<p>We describe an open, anterior–posterior technique for excision of DPVNS lesions from the ankle joint with erosive lesions of the tibia and talus, as well as from the flexor hallucis longus and peroneal tendon sheaths in a healthy 36-year-old woman. She presented with continued pain and dysfunction after several attempted arthroscopic procedures for excision of recurrent PVNS lesions about her left ankle. A recent magnetic resonance image demonstrated extensive disease recurrence involving the tibiotalar joint and medial and lateral gutters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640011428511">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>The operative procedure was completed under regional and general anesthesia with the use of a tourniquet, beginning with the patient in the supine position. A standard anterior approach to the ankle was used, establishing the plane between the extensor hallucis longus and tibialis anterior tendons. Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial peroneal nerve in the distal aspect of the wound and the anterior neurovascular bundle. Deeper dissection allowed for exposure of the anterior ankle joint capsule. PVNS lesions were located distally over the talonavicular joint, the largest of which was roughly 2 cm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640011428511">Figure 2</xref>). The entire anterior capsule over the distal tibia and talus with associated PVNS lesions was excised en bloc. PVNS lesions within the medial and lateral gutters were debrided and excised using curets and rongeurs. Additional lesions were mechanically debrided from the distal tibia and talus. After thorough irrigation, the deep tissues, extensor hallucis longus tendon sheath, and subcutaneous tissues were closed with absorbable suture. Staples were used on the skin and sterile dressing applied.</p>

</fig>
<p>Operative drapes were removed and the patient was placed prone with appropriate bolsters. The leg was reprepped and draped. A 5-cm posterior incision was made directly over the Achilles. The Achilles tendon was split. The retrocalcaneal bursa was debrided. Medially, the flexor hallucis longus muscle belly and tendon were exposed and debrided of PVNS lesions.</p>
<p>The posterior ankle joint capsule was excised, exposing the posterior ankle and subtalar joints with a nearby PVNS lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640011428511">Figure 3</xref>). Additional PVNS lesions within the medial and lateral gutters were identified and removed. Finally, PVNS lesions were seen laterally around the peroneal tendons, which were thoroughly debrided. The posterior wound was irrigated and the Achilles tendon reapproximated with a braided ultra high molecular weight polyethylene suture. Subcutaneous tissues were closed with absorbable suture and staples placed for skin closure. A sterile dressing was applied and the patient was placed in a bulky splint in 5° of plantarflexion.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The patient was kept non–weight bearing in a short leg cast for four weeks to optimize wound healing given the dual-incision approach and history of multiple prior arthroscopic surgeries to the ankle. At 4 weeks, the patient was transitioned into a weight-bearing walker boot and started physical therapy. Both wounds healed without complication.</p>
<p>One year following surgery, the patient is pain free and demonstrates 10° of ankle dorsiflexion, 45° of plantarflexion, 10° of hindfoot eversion, and 15° of inversion. She exhibits full strength throughout all lower extremity musculature and exercises regularly in a normal shoe without limitation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A limited number of case reports and series describe surgical and adjuvant treatment of foot and ankle PVNS lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640011428511">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640011428511">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640011428511">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640011428511">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640011428511">16</xref></sup> Saxena and Perez<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640011428511">16</xref></sup> reported on 10 athletes with PVNS lesions of the ankle who had symptoms clinically indistinguishable from common lateral ankle pathology, including tenosynovitis, osteochondral defects, os trigonum injury, and tendon tears. A variety of treatments were used, including synovectomy, tenosynovectomy, bone grafting of bone defects, and irrigation with hydrogen peroxide solution.</p>
<p>Brien et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640011428511">11</xref></sup> retrospectively reviewed 11 patients with PVNS lesions of the foot and ankle treated with surgical excision, followed by radiation therapy in some cases. Of the 9 patients with lesions originating in the ankle, 6 had subtalar extension and 1 extended to the plantar foot. Six of these patients presented after initial surgical excision elsewhere, and were subsequently treated with synovectomy with 4 also undergoing radiation therapy. Surgical approaches to the ankle included both single incision and double incision techniques (ie, medial and lateral). Brien et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640011428511">11</xref></sup> reported no recurrence at an average of 9 years for primary lesions and 3.5 years for recurrent lesions.</p>
<p>Heller et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640011428511">15</xref></sup> describe the surgical excision of PVNS lesions of the ankle in 2 patients, one with LPVNS invasion into the anterior talofibular ligament and sinus tarsi requiring a tibiofibular ligament turndown transfer for ankle stabilization. The other patient had DPVNS with talar bone extension and destruction, along with involvement of the anterolateral tibial plafond, anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament, calcaneofibular ligament, and peroneal tendon sheath. The latter case required bony and soft tissue excision, bone grafting, and a Chrisman–Snook lateral ligament reconstruction.</p>
<p>For extensive PVNS lesions affecting the ankle, previously described dual-incision techniques have focused on posteromedial and posterolateral approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640011428511">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640011428511">14</xref></sup> Our posterior exposure uses a midline posterior skin incision and a longitudinal midline split of the Achilles tendon. This provides an excellent exposure to both the posterior aspects of the ankle and subtalar joints. This approach also minimizes potential wound healing complications associated with nonmidline approaches via dissection between angiosomes, which optimizes skin flap vascularity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640011428511">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640011428511">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>One year after undergoing this dual-incision, ankle approach for debridement of multiple DPVNS lesions, our patient exhibits full, pain-free foot and ankle function without wound complication or clinical evidence of disease recurrence. This comprehensive, yet soft tissue–respecting approach, may prove beneficial for patients with extensive disease affecting the anterior and posterior ankle, to avoid subsequent surgery for disease recurrence due to inadequate debridement.</p>
