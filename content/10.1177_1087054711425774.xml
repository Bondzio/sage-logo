<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is an expanding, though still limited, literature available regarding the impact of past oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in adult patients with ADHD. In childhood ADHD, ODD is consistently the most frequently encountered comorbid condition. This observation has been confirmed in ADHD populations worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711425774">Adewuya &amp; Famuyiwa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711425774">Alqahtani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711425774">Barkley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711425774">Byun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711425774">Gau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711425774">Ghanizadeh, Mohammadi, &amp; Moini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711425774">Jensen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711425774">Leskauskas, Kuzmickas, Baranauskiene, &amp; Daskeviciene, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711425774">Michanie, Kunst, Margulies, &amp; Yakhkind, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711425774">Pastura, Mattos, &amp; Araujo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054711425774">Serra-Pinheiro, Mattos, &amp; Angélica Regalla, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054711425774">Sitholey; Agarwal, &amp; Sharma, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1087054711425774">Souza, Pinheiro, Denardin, Mattos, &amp; Rohde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1087054711425774">Zavadenko &amp; Suvorinova, 2007</xref>). Generally, the incidence of ODD has been between 30% and 60% of the ADHD population.</p>
<p>One of the first descriptions of ODD is found in August <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711425774">Homburger’s (1926)</xref> seminal text <italic>Vorlesungen über Psychopathologie des Kindesalters</italic> (Lectures on the Psychopathology of Childhood). In 1980, the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (3rd ed.; <italic>DSM-III</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711425774">American Psychiatric Association, 1980</xref>) introduced the diagnosis of ODD.</p>
<p>A number of publications have examined the significance of ODD in children with ADHD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711425774">August, Braswell, and Thuras (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711425774">Hurtig et al. (2007b)</xref> reported that ODD was more frequent in patients in whom ADHD was persistent. Both symptom level and functional impairment are greater in patients with ADHD plus ODD as opposed to ADHD alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711425774">Connor &amp; Doerfler, 2008</xref>). In follow-up studies of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711425774">Biederman et al., 2008</xref>) and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711425774">Barkley, Fischer, Edelbrock, &amp; Smallish, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711425774">Kuhne, Schachar, &amp; Tannock, 1997</xref>), ODD combined with ADHD led to greater adolescent functional impairment. ADHD patients with ODD show more emotional symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711425774">Harada, Yamazaki, &amp; Saitoh, 2002</xref>), increased substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711425774">August et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711425774">Harpold et al., 2007</xref>), and adolescent conduct disorder (CD; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054711425774">Rowe, Maughan, Pickles, Costello, &amp; Angold, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1087054711425774">Whittinger, Langley, Fowler, Thomas, &amp; Thapar, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2007, we published the first study assessing the incidence and treatment of an adult population with combined ADHD and ODD. Our findings indicated that 45% of our ADHD population had significant ODD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054711425774">Reimherr et al., 2007</xref>). Through an assessment of children with ADHD that followed into adulthood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711425774">Barkley, Murphy, and Fischer (2008)</xref> found that 50% of their participants with persistent ADHD had ODD during childhood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711425774">Gadow et al. (2007)</xref> also found that ODD can be identified in adults. In a more detailed analysis of our study population, we also showed that impairment in social adjustment and personality disorder was concentrated in ADHD patients with ODD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054711425774">Reimherr, Marchant, Williams, et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, one can conclude that ADHD combined with ODD represents an important treatment population with a high risk of adverse adult outcomes. Viewed in this light, treatment studies on ADHD combined with ODD, which report on the ODD symptoms, are particularly important even though they have received insufficient attention to date.</p>
<p>Two recent reviews on the treatment of pediatric ODD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711425774">Connor, Steeber, &amp; McBurnett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711425774">Hazell, 2010</xref>) conclude that many children and adolescents show positive responses with typical medications used for ADHD, but for a substantial group these medications alone are not adequate. These results coincide with clinical experience that while stimulants work, at times they do not seem sufficient.</p>
<p>In the preliminary report noted earlier, we demonstrated that we could identify adults with current significant oppositional symptoms. We used a patient self-report scale based on the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (4th ed.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711425774">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) criteria as a screening device and also to assess outcome. Based on these initial findings, a more comprehensive study was designed to confirm our initial report and to address the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1087054711425774" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In a second population of adults with ADHD, could we again show that a substantial portion had current ODD symptoms that were associated with a higher degree of functional impairment?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Did these symptoms improve with stimulant treatment?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Which particular ODD symptoms were most frequently present and which showed the largest changes?</p></list-item></list>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The University of Utah Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1087054711425774">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial comparing methylphenidate transdermal system (MTS) with a placebo patch. The double-blind phase was preceded by a 2 to 3 week screening period in which we carefully assessed childhood symptoms, personality, and psychosocial functioning followed by a baseline visit to reassess the severity of ADHD symptoms. There was no required minimum rating on the ADHD symptom scales. However, we did require that potential patients have at least a moderately impaired rating on the Clinical Global Impressions–Severity Scale (CGI-S). Patients who continued to meet inclusion criteria at baseline were randomized into the first of two 4-week treatment periods. In each arm, patients were started on a 10 mg MTS patch and instructed to increase to 15 mg after 3 days. During the second week, an attempt was made to reach a dose between 20 and 30 mg per day. The dose was then held constant for the last 2 weeks of the study. Participants were seen weekly and assessed using the Wender–Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (WRAADDS), Clinical Global Impressions–Improvement Scale (CGI-I), and CGI-S. At the final visit of each arm, the self-report version of the WRAADDS (SR-WRAADDS) and the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) were administered. A more complete description of the study has been published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054711425774">Marchant, Reimherr, Robison, Olsen, &amp; Kondo, 2011</xref>). At the end of the second crossover period, the participants who participated in both double-blind arms were eligible to enter a 6-month open-label phase (not reported here).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Adults meeting <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711425774">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) criteria for ADHD and/or the Utah Criteria for ADHD, and experiencing at least moderate impairment (a score of 4 or greater on the CGI-S for ADHD at both Screening and Baseline visits) were enrolled. A description of the Utah Criteria can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1087054711425774">Wender (1995)</xref>. The Utah Criteria are based on a qualitative assessment of symptoms as opposed to the more behavioral DSM-IV system. Patients are required to have at least moderate motor hyperactivity and attentional difficulties as well as significant problems in two of the following symptom areas: disorganization, impulsivity, temper problems, affective lability, or emotional overreactivity. The Utah Criteria and the WRAADDS supply suggestions for assessing the severity of each symptom area. The diagnosis of ADHD was made by each admitting psychiatrist using multiple ratings. The Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS), the Barkley Childhood Symptoms Scale (CSS), the Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale (DBRS) and the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale: Short Form (PRS) furnished information regarding childhood symptoms. The Utah Criteria were collected using the WRAADDS. <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria were then confirmed with the Conners’ Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for <italic>DSM-IV</italic>. Finally, overall impairment was also reassessed with the CGI-S and the Weissman Social Assessment Scale. Of the 65 participants who furnished double-blind data, 57 met <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria and 63 met the Utah criteria. In the instances when it was unclear if participants displayed symptoms by age 7, they were admitted into the study if other diagnostic criteria were met. Participants were between 18 and 65 years of age. Female participants were eligible to enter this study if they were of nonchildbearing potential or agreed to use an approved form of contraception. Participants with major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia as well as those with seizure disorder were excluded. Participants with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism were also excluded. Finally, those with significant medical conditions likely to become unstable during the trial or likely to be destabilized by treatment with methylphenidate (e.g., cardiovascular disease) were excluded.</p>

<title>Assessment Measures</title>
<p>Adult-ODD symptoms were assessed using both an investigator- and a self-rated scale. The SR-WRAADDS-ODD Scale uses a 0 (<italic>none</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very much</italic>) format to assess ODD symptoms. Following <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria, participants were categorized as having adult ODD when four or more symptoms were clearly present. In our first publication, item averages of two or more were used to define patients as having adult ODD. Both methods produce essentially the same population. There were nine investigator-rated items attached to the WRAADDS (Inv-ODD), creating an investigator-rated scale. Each item was scored using a three-point scale, 0 to 2. The summary scores of each scale were treated as continuous variables.</p>
<p>Childhood ODD and CD symptoms were retrospectively assessed using two scales. Summary scores of each were treated as ordinal and continuous variables. The CSS is a patient-rated scale developed by Barkley with responses varying from 0 (<italic>never or rarely</italic>) to 3 (<italic>very often</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711425774">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 1998</xref>) to assess retrospectively ADHD, ODD, and CD symptoms. On this scale, scores of 2 or 3 indicate that the symptom was once present. The Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale–Retrospective Adult Form (DBRS-RAF) was completed by the parent of their now adult child, describing the child’s behavior between ages of 6 to 12. This form is almost identical to the CSS except for the rater. If at least four of the eight ODD symptoms were once present on either scale, the patient was considered to have had childhood ODD. Similarly, if at least 3 of the 15 CD symptoms were present on either scale, the patient was considered to have had CD. The percentage of patients meeting criteria for childhood ODD or CD in this manner is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711425774">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Five measures were used to assess the efficacy of MTS. The WRAADDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054711425774">Reimherr, Marchant, Robison, et al., 2010</xref>) is a clinician-rated scale typically completed with the assistance of a spouse or significant other. It assesses the seven domains of the Utah Criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1087054711425774">Wender, 1995</xref>) and is normally divided into three factors: attentional difficulties + disorganization, hyperactivity + restlessness/impulsivity, and temper + affective lability + emotional overreactivity. The scale contains sub-items and a 0 to 4 point global rating for each domain. These three factors were treated as continuous variables for analysis. Patients were considered to have emotional dysregulation if they had an average score greater than 2 on the emotional factor (temper + affective lability + emotional over-reactivity). This scale was administered at each study visit. The CAARS used in this trial was the investigator-rated version. The scale consists primarily of the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> ADHD symptoms with some modifications for adults. It was administered at baseline and the end of each treatment arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711425774">Conners, Erhardt, &amp; Sparrow, 1999</xref>). The total CAARS score was treated as a continuous variable. CGI-I is a Likert-type scale completed by the clinician regarding the overall improvement of the patient’s ADHD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711425774">Guy, 1976</xref>). CGI-S was completed by the clinician regarding the overall severity of the patient’s ADHD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711425774">Guy, 1976</xref>). Both CGI Scales are ordinal in nature and were completed at each visit. The SR-WRAADDS uses a Likert-type format to address the seven domains of the WRAADDS as well as ODD, academic impairment, and social adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054711425774">Reimherr et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Personality disorder was assessed using three instruments. The Structured Clinical Interview for <italic>DSM-IV</italic> Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711425774">Ekselius, Lindström, von Knorring, Bodlund, &amp; Kullgren, 1994</xref>) is an interview-based assessment for personality disorder using a two-step system. The patient completes a screening questionnaire, and then a follow-up interview is conducted checking on areas that the patient has rated over a threshold level. We only report on the number of items endorsed by the participant in the first step. The Wisconsin Personality Inventory–IV (WISPI-IV) is a self-administered scale consisting of 214 items with demonstrated validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1087054711425774">Smith, Klein, &amp; Benjamin, 2003</xref>). We report the average <italic>z</italic> scores. The Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire–Version 4 (PDQ-4+) is a self-administered scale consisting of 99 true/false items developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054711425774">Hyler, Skodol, Oldham, Kellman, and Doidge (1992)</xref>. We report the number of items endorsed by the participant.</p>
<p>Four other clinical scales that produced continuous variable scores were used to assess these participants. The patient-rated WURS and the parent-rated PRS were used to help verify childhood symptoms of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1087054711425774">Wender, 1995</xref>). The PRS is a 10-item scale containing items on emotions, temper, and oppositional symptoms, and variation of the scale now called the Conners 3 ADHD Index has been used primarily to separate children with suspected ADHD from the normal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1087054711425774">Wender, Reimherr, &amp; Wood, 1981</xref>). The WURS also assesses emotions and oppositional symptoms in addition to <italic>DSM-IV</italic> ADHD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054711425774">Stein et al., 1995</xref>). The Weissman Social Adjustment Scale was used to assess social adjustment. It is a structured interview, which evaluates functioning in six areas: economic functioning, work, social and leisure activity, extended family, and marital and parental relationships. It has been found effective in assessing the social, interpersonal adjustment of psychiatric patients and correlates with clinical improvement with treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054711425774">Reimherr, Strong, Marchant, Hedges, &amp; Wender, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054711425774">Serretti, Lattuada, &amp; Smeraldi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1087054711425774">Weissman, Prusoff, Thompson, Harding, &amp; Myers, 1978</xref>). The Sheehan Disability Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711425774">Leon, Olfson, Portera, Farber, &amp; Sheehan, 1997</xref>) assesses work, social, and family functioning. It is a Likert-type scale asking how much the symptoms have disrupted the areas ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 10 (<italic>extremely</italic>). Scores of 4 to 6 indicate moderate disruption and marked disruption starts at 7.</p>

<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>Participants were categorized into three groups for comparison at baseline:</p>
<list id="list2-1087054711425774" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Adult ODD—These participants reported moderate or more severe impairment on at least four ODD items of the SR-WRAADDS. Most of them also met criteria for childhood ODD.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Child ODD—These participants met criteria for childhood ODD using the patient-rated CSS and/or parent-rated DBRS, but not the criteria for adult ODD.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Non-ODD—These were participants who failed to meet ODD criteria either as children or as adults.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Baseline differences between the three ODD groups were analyzed using ANOVA for continuous variables, and the Kruskal–Wallis test for categorical variables. Because of the exploratory nature of this study, no attempt was made to statistically control the increased risk of Type I error caused by the large number of variables assessed.</p>
<list id="list3-1087054711425774" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Relationships between scales (both ADHD and ODD) were assessed using Pearson correlations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Response of specific ODD items to treatment was analyzed using Wilcoxon’s matched-pairs signed-ranks test (last observation carried forward).</p></list-item>

</sec></sec>
<sec id="section7-1087054711425774" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 92 participants signed consent for the study. Six participants did not furnish enough information to be categorized regarding either adult or childhood ODD status and were removed from this analysis. Using the scores from the SR-WRAADDS-ODD, 36 met criteria for adult ODD. Overall, 23 participants met childhood criteria for child ODD (but not for adult ODD), and 27 participants did not meet criteria for either adult or childhood ODD and were classified as non-ODD. Of the 92 participants, 65 completed at least one double-blind arm and 52 were in both arms.</p>
<p>There were differences in the retrospective childhood ratings of the core <italic>DSM-IV</italic> ADHD items for both the patient-rated CSS (<italic>p</italic> = .02) and the parent-rated DBRS (<italic>p</italic> = .004). In both cases, the relationship was primarily mediated by the hyperactivity + impulsivity items, not the inattention items. The three groups also differed in the WURS (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The non-ODD participants were the least impaired. Adult-ODD participants were retrospectively diagnosed with higher levels of CD on the patient scale.</p>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711425774">Table 1</xref>, the three groups differed in ADHD symptoms with adult-ODD participants having the highest scores and non-ODD participants having the fewest symptoms on the total WRAADDS, <italic>F</italic>(2, 80) = 8.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and total CAARS, <italic>F</italic>(2, 69) = 4.0, <italic>p</italic> = .024. On the WRAADDS, this was primarily attributable to the symptoms of emotional dysregulation, <italic>F</italic>(2, 82) = 12.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The between-group difference was even more pronounced on the SR-WRAADDS. On every subscale except disorganization, the participants with adult ODD were significantly more impaired.</p>
<p>The percentage of participants considered to have clinically significant impairment in social adjustment on the Weissman Social Adjustment Scale or Sheehan Disability Scale is presented at the bottom of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711425774">Table 1</xref>. The adult-ODD participants experienced significantly more impairment in marital relationships (<italic>p</italic> = .005), and oddly the greatest difference was between the adult-ODD and the child-ODD groups.</p>
<p>The three groups differed on all three measures of personality disorder (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711425774">Table 1</xref>). Adult-ODD participants had higher WISPI-IV <italic>z</italic> scores, <italic>F</italic>(2, 66) = 4.2, <italic>p</italic> = .02. They also endorsed more symptoms on the SCID-II, <italic>F</italic>(2, 79) = 7.4, <italic>p</italic> = .001, Screening Questionnaire, and the PDQ-4+, <italic>F</italic>(2, 77) = 4.5, <italic>p</italic> = .02. On these measures, the significant difference was between the adult-ODD group and both the other groups.</p>
<p>Although the admission criteria excluded all potential participants who were currently experiencing substance abuse problems, the three groups differed in their history of substance abuse problems. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711425774">Table 1</xref>, 80% of the participants with adult ODD had a history of alcohol abuse as defined by periods when they had more than five drinks per day on a regular basis (χ<sup>2</sup> = 10.0, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> = .01). In contrast, only 43% and 48% of the child-ODD and non-ODD participants had a history of alcohol abuse, respectively. A similar pattern was seen regarding substance abuse. Adult-ODD participants were most likely to have a history of drug abuse whereas the non-ODD participants were least likely to have had this history (χ<sup>2</sup> = 12.2, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> = .005).</p>

<title>Agreement Between Adult and Childhood ODD Measures</title>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054711425774">Table 2</xref>, there was significant agreement regarding childhood ODD between the patient-rated CSS and the parent-rated DBRS (<italic>r</italic> = .63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). They produced the same diagnostic conclusion 71% of the time. There was also a strong relationship between the two adult-ODD scales (<italic>r</italic> = .59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), which came to the same diagnostic conclusion 66% of the time. Generally, the correlations between the scales within each life period were much higher than the correlations between childhood and adulthood assessments.</p>

<title>Response to ADHD Treatment With MTS</title>
<p>As we have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054711425774">Marchant et al., 2011</xref>), MTS was more effective than placebo in treating the symptoms of ADHD on the total WRAADDS, <italic>F</italic>(1, 46) = 14.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). There were no significant treatment (MTS vs. placebo) by group (adult ODD, child ODD, and non-ODD) interactions, <italic>F</italic>(2, 46) = 0.64, <italic>p</italic> = .53. The same pattern occurred in the CAARS and the ODD symptoms whether they were rated by the clinician or the patient.</p>
<p>Categorical measures of improvement displayed a significant treatment effect for both ADHD and ODD measures. Using a 50% improvement in SR-WRAADDS-ODD Scale, 66% (33) of the participants improved in the MTS arm compared to 33% (16) of the participants in the placebo arm (McNemar exact test = .002). Using a 50% improvement in Inv-ODD Scale, 53% (30) of the participants improved in the MTS arm compared to 19% (10) of the participants in the placebo arm (McNemar exact test = .003). Again, there was no interaction effect between the improvement and treatment groups.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054711425774">Table 3</xref> presents the outcome analysis with participants separated based on the presence of adult and childhood ODD as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711425774">Table 1</xref>. In the adult-ODD group, MTS was significantly superior to placebo on every outcome measure. In the other two groups (child ODD and non-ODD), MTS was numerically better than placebo on all measures; however, these differences were statistically significant on only some of the dependent variables due to smaller sizes and, in most cases, less drug–placebo differences.</p>

<title>Relationships Between ODD and WRAADDS Scores</title>
<p>At baseline, the clinician-rated Inv-ODD showed significant correlations with the ADHD symptoms of hyperactivity + impulsivity (<italic>r</italic> = .50, <italic>df</italic> = 81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and emotional dysregulation (<italic>r</italic> = .58, <italic>df</italic> = 81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but not attention + disorganization (<italic>r</italic> = .14, <italic>df</italic> = 81, <italic>p</italic> = .19). During the double-blind phase, improvement in ODD symptoms paralleled improvement in ADHD symptoms: change scores (placebo minus MTS) for ODD symptoms (Inv-ODD) correlated with change on the total WRAADDS (<italic>r</italic> = .75, <italic>df</italic> = 81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the CAARS (<italic>r</italic> = .62, <italic>df</italic> = 81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). These ODD change scores correlated with all three WRAADDS factors significantly: attention + disorganization (<italic>r</italic> = .59, <italic>df</italic> = 81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), hyperactivity + impulsivity (<italic>r</italic> = .70, <italic>df</italic> = 81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and emotional dysregulation (<italic>r</italic> = .81, <italic>df</italic> = 81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Analysis of Specific Adult ODD Items</title>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087054711425774">Table 4</xref>, participants and investigators agreed on which two ODD items were the most common—“feeling bothered, easily annoyed” and “stubborn, strong-willed.” There was a significant treatment effect for seven items on the self-report SR-WRAADDS-ODD and a significant treatment effect for six items on the investigator-rated Inv-ODD. All nine items showed significant improvement by the physician and/or the patient. Based on the amount of change that occurred between the two treatment arms, the symptoms that showed the most change were as follows: “get into disagreements, arguments”; “feeling angry, resentful”; “feeling bothered, easily annoyed”; and “stubborn, strong-willed, trouble seeing things from someone else’s point of view.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Of the ADHD participants who were evaluated for ODD, 42% met criteria for adult ODD which was similar to the 45% found in our previous osmotic release oral system methylphenidate (OROS MPH) trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054711425774">Reimherr et al., 2007</xref>). In comparison, the MTA found that 58% of their children had ODD and/or CD. In the MTA, 15% of the participants had CD and almost all the patients with CD also had ODD. The percentage of our adults with ODD was similar to the report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711425774">Barkley et al. (2008)</xref> and similar to the numbers cited in the “Introduction” section. In addition, 27% of our patients had a history of childhood ODD, but no longer had a moderate or worse level of severity on at least four symptoms of ODD.</p>
<p>This is the first adult trial in which patients have been evaluated for the presence of ODD in adulthood while simultaneously assessing the presence of ODD in childhood. By this measure, 69% of our patients had either childhood or adulthood ODD. This observation coincides with several references noted in the introduction from which it can be concluded that ODD was associated with a higher level of persistence of ADHD into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711425774">August et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711425774">Hurtig et al., 2007b</xref>). Consequently, we conclude that a large percentage of patients in this adult study had childhood ODD and many continued to have similar symptoms as adults. We suspect that this would be true for most studies of ADHD in adults.</p>
<p>In this adults trial, ODD was associated with a higher level of symptoms on ratings of childhood ADHD (WURS, CSS, PRS, and the DBRS), especially on the hyperactivity/impulsivity items. The WURS and the PRS also contain emotional items. Adult-ODD participants had a higher current ADHD symptom load (WRAADDS, SR-WRAADDS, and CAARS). ODD status was significantly associated with the symptoms of emotional dysregulation. ODD was associated with increased academic impairment, another common problem experienced by children with ADHD. While this sample demonstrated substantial psycho/social impairment, the three groups differed significantly only in marriage relationships. On measures of personality disorder, adult-ODD participants were the most impaired group. We have previously reported that the levels of these scores found in the adult-ODD patients were associated with the presence of personality disorder. Although cluster B personality disorders are commonly associated with ADHD, we have found that cluster C diagnoses are at least as common in adult ADHD. Finally, there was an increased incidence of substance abuse in these patients. The combination of ADHD with ODD has been associated with impairment in other areas in numerous childhood studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711425774">Connor &amp; Doerfler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711425774">Gadow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711425774">Hurtig et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711425774">Kuhne et al., 1997</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711425774">Harpold et al. (2007)</xref> found that ADHD combined with ODD in childhood predicted increased risk for subsequent psychiatric disorders. Consequently, our data supports childhood reports that ADHD combined with ODD represents a more seriously impacted population and extends this finding into adulthood.</p>
<p>In a prior publication, we reported that ODD symptoms were more highly correlated to the ADHD symptoms of hyperactivity + impulsivity and emotional dysregulation than inattention. (Although the symptoms defining emotional dysregulation have not been a part of the <italic>DSM</italic> criteria, they are part of the Utah Criteria and several studies are supportive of their inclusion in adult ADHD.) Similarly, the MTA trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054711425774">Newcorn et al., 2001</xref>) found that participants with comorbid ODD/CD were more likely to be rated as impulsive than inattentive. This trial replicated these earlier observations in the baseline assessment. However, the limited relationship between ODD and attention + disorganization at baseline may be a ceiling effect. Participants in all three groups had average scores near 7 for attention + disorganization (out of a maximum score of 8) at baseline.</p>
<p>Improvement in ADHD symptoms was seen for the entire sample on all outcome measures. The three groups did not respond differently to treatment at a statistically significant level. Conversely, the most consistently positive treatment effects were seen in adult-ODD patients. As in childhood trials conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711425774">Ercan, Varan, and Deniz (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054711425774">Sinzig, Dopfner, Lehmkuhl, and German Methylphenidate Study Group (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711425774">Ter-Stepanian, Grizenko, Zappitelli, and Joober (2010)</xref>, these data indicated that not only did participants with adult ODD show improvement in their ADHD symptoms, their ODD symptoms also responded to methylphenidate. In contrast with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711425774">Goez, Back-Bennet, and Zelnik (2007)</xref>, our adults with ODD did not include a significant number of participants who became worse during treatment with methylphenidate. This treatment response for ODD symptoms (the difference between placebo and MTS) was highly correlated with changes in all ADHD symptoms including attention + disorganization. This improvement in ODD symptoms was much stronger than in our previous smaller trial with OROS MPH.</p>
<p>This reanalysis also documents that most of the individual items within each ODD Scale responded positively. The changes produced in this area (which deals with interpersonal functioning) are intriguing and suggest a mechanism by which methylphenidate might improve social adjustment and also measures of personality disorder.</p>
<sec id="section13-1087054711425774">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are two limitations in this study. The first is that the measures of childhood impairment were retrospective. The authors have little doubt that retrospective reports are less valid than current reports or data collected during childhood. However, the extent of agreement between the participants and their parents indicates that the reports were of value. It should be noted that the researchers did not control for the large number of tests and the associated increased risk of Type I error. This decision is supported by the fact that there was substantial agreement between the various scales. Type I error should have resulted in some tests documenting a significant relationship while others did not. The fact that almost all scales associated ODD participants with greater impairment indicates that there was little Type I error. To control for it might have resulted in increased Type II error.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1087054711425774">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A total of 42% of the participants in this clinical trial of MTS were experiencing ODD symptoms at a significant level supporting the belief that ODD does persist from childhood into adulthood. An additional 27% described childhood ODD which had resolved. Retrospective measures of childhood ODD were positively associated with adult measures. Baseline ODD status was associated with increased impairment in emotional dysregulation, personality disorder, and a history of substance abuse. Not only did ADHD symptoms improve for adults experiencing ODD symptoms, the ODD symptoms themselves improved as a result of ADHD treatment with MTS. Alleviation of ODD symptoms appears to be a reasonable treatment goal in these patients especially because both substance abuse and personality disorder are concentrated in these combined patients. While ADHD, ODD, CD, and emotional dysregulation can occur separately, these data give further support to the concept that ODD frequently occurs as an ADHD spectrum condition. Consequently, ODD plus ADHD should be viewed as a distinct subtype of ADHD.</p>
