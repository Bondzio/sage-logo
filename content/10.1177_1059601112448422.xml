<abstract>
<p>In this study, the authors examine factors that explain international scholars’ success in publishing in North American management journals through collaboration. Drawing on the international entry mode literature, the authors propose that international collaboration teams are more successful when they increase complementary resources and reduce transaction costs. A sample of 364 articles from 10 North American management journals shows that teams published in higher impact management journals when they had U.S. or Canadian collaborators, higher proportions of assistant professors, and less gender diversity. Combining additional findings from 23 semistructured interviews, the authors provide a research model to explain the resources and costs embedded in international collaboration teams as well as mechanisms that help transform costs into resources.</p>

<p>Editors of North American (NA; refer to United States and Canada) management journals have expressed a strong interest in globalizing their journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601112448422">Kirkman &amp; Law, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112448422">March, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1059601112448422">Tsoukas, 2008</xref>) by publishing more and more work by international scholars (scholars who live and work outside NA). Their interests coincide with the enthusiasm of international scholars who join the NA management research community, as evidenced by the 514% increase in international membership in the Academy of Management (AOM) since 1990 when it first started to record member nationality. In recent years, NA journals have published the work of many international scholars: in 2010 <italic>Group &amp; Organization Management</italic> noted that more than 50% of their papers were written by international authors who also garnered noticeable presences in other leading journals such as <italic>Administrative Science Quarterly</italic> (23%) and <italic>Strategic Management Journal</italic> (28%). What might have contributed to these international scholars’ success in publishing in NA journals?</p>
<p>Previous research on academic publication has provided valuable insights on this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112448422">Judge, Cable, Colbert, &amp; Rynes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601112448422">McFadyen &amp; Cannella, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1059601112448422">Newman &amp; Cooper, 1993</xref>). These include descriptive accounts of international collaboration processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112448422">Easterby-Smith &amp; Malina, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112448422">Mezias, Chen, &amp; Murphy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1059601112448422">Teagarden et al., 1995</xref>), and prescriptive advice on publication success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112448422">Eden &amp; Rynes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601112448422">Kirkman &amp; Law, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1059601112448422">Peterson, 2001</xref>). However, too few theories and systematic studies identify factors that contribute to successful international collaborations, collaborations that involve scholars outside NA. In this article, we report the results of two empirical studies, one quantitative using archival data and one qualitative using personal interviews, to identify factors that either enable or constrain international collaboration research teams in their efforts to publish in NA journals.</p>
<p>International scholars forming collaboration teams with the aim of publishing in NA journals is similar to foreign companies creating joint ventures to enter other markets. International entry mode research suggests that the most effective way to create joint ventures is by increasing complementary resources and reducing transaction costs (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059601112448422">Brouthers &amp; Hennart, 2007</xref>). Originating from the resource-based view, complementarity means that one party’s resources complement another party’s resources and provide synergy through “economies of scope, economies of scale, or increased market power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112448422">Harrison, Hitt, Hoskisson, &amp; Ireland, 2001</xref>, p. 681). For example, foreign companies may create alliances with companies in target countries to fill the need for local knowledge about the target market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601112448422">Hitt, Dacin, Levitas, Arregle, &amp; Borza, 2000</xref>). The processes of searching and acquiring information, bargaining, and enforcing contracts incur transaction costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1059601112448422">Williamson, 1985</xref>). For example, international companies may avoid pursuing alliances when they find it too difficult to communicate with and monitor the potential partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112448422">Brouthers, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on insights from the international entry mode literature, we propose that international scholars would benefit from collaboration teams that have high complementary resources and low transaction costs. In our study, we identified and empirically tested specific resources and costs embedded in international collaboration teams, using archival data of 364 articles written by 982 authors from 44 countries in 10 NA management journals from 2003 to 2010. We then interviewed 23 international scholars to provide insights into unsolved puzzles and to develop a theoretical framework on academic collaboration success. Our study offers three contributions to research on academic collaboration.</p>
<p>First, we specifically address the factors that enable or constrain collaboration involving international scholars, an area lacking systematic empirical research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112448422">Boyacigiller and Alder (1991)</xref> warned that academic management research has fallen behind global business and that current research has insufficiently reflected internationalization trends. Traditional teamwork literature did not particularly consider the issue of country locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601112448422">Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, &amp; Gilson, 2008</xref>), while work on virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112448422">Algesheimer, Dholakia, &amp; Gurau, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1059601112448422">Martins, Gilson, &amp; Maynard, 2004</xref>) and distributed work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059601112448422">Hinds &amp; Kiesler, 2002</xref>) shed some light but does not address factors specific to the academics. Our study is among the first to provide theory-based and empirically supported factors contributing to success in international academic collaboration.</p>
<p>Second, by applying resource-based view and transaction-cost theory from the international entry mode literature, we broaden our understanding of international collaboration from a strategic perspective. Scholars increasingly recognize the value of applying strategic perspectives to understand academic collaboration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112448422">Landry &amp; Amara, 1998</xref>; Lavie &amp; Drori, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1059601112448422">Peterson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1059601112448422">van Rijnsoever, Hessels, &amp; Vandeberg, 2008</xref>). We move this analysis one step further by integrating insights from both the resource-based view and transaction-cost theory. Specifically, we simultaneously look at both enablers and hindrances of collaboration, generating a more balanced view of factors embedded in a collaboration team.</p>
<p>Third, we adopt both quantitative and qualitative methods to enrich our understanding of international collaboration teams. Previous research on academic collaboration is either quantitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601112448422">McFadyen &amp; Cannella, 2004</xref>) or qualitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112448422">Easterby-Smith &amp; Malina, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1059601112448422">Teagarden et al., 1995</xref>) that only partially explains the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1059601112448422">Weick, 2007</xref>). By using both methods, we are able to test the effects of theoretically derived resources and costs, and also to develop a theoretical framework that enriches and extends the quantitative findings. In sum, this hybrid research design enhances our ability to identify interesting theoretical issues for future research, in addition to providing valid practical suggestions to international scholars.</p>

<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<p>Collaboration is an important mechanism for advancing scientific knowledge creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601112448422">Katz &amp; Martin, 1997</xref>), and its benefit for academic productivity is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1059601112448422">Lee &amp; Bozeman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601112448422">McFadyen &amp; Cannella, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1059601112448422">Wuchty, Jones, &amp; Uzzi, 2007</xref>). Collaboration stimulates intellectual creation by encouraging scholars to share their ideas; it integrates skills and resources necessary for fruitful analyses; and it allows solitary scholars to find enjoyable companionship in their often lonely scientific journeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112448422">Bozeman &amp; Corley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112448422">Gersick, Bartunek, &amp; Dutton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601112448422">Katz &amp; Martin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1059601112448422">Lee &amp; Bozeman, 2005</xref>). In the past 30 years, a new collaboration trend have emerged: scholars outside NA actively search for collaborators in their efforts to publish in NA journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1059601112448422">Peterson, 2001</xref>). Despite this trend, little research has identified factors contributing to the publication success of these collaboration teams. Addressing this issue is important both theoretically and practically as international scholars are increasingly eager to publish in NA management journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112448422">Baruch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1059601112448422">Tsui, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The current academic productivity literature has tended to focus on individual attributes in predicting scientists’ scholarly outputs or impact. Publication records are associated with social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112448422">Bozeman &amp; Corley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601112448422">McFadyen &amp; Cannella, 2004</xref>), aptitude and ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112448422">Bayer &amp; Folger, 1966</xref>), personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112448422">Helmreich, Spence, Beane, Lucker, &amp; Matthews, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112448422">Miner, 1980</xref>), demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1059601112448422">Rodgers &amp; Maranto, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1059601112448422">Zuckerman &amp; Cole, 1975</xref>), and reputational standings of affiliated institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112448422">Crane, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112448422">Helmreich et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1059601112448422">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Podsakoff, &amp; Bachrach, 2008</xref>). However, studies have failed to address factors relevant to collaboration teams, particularly international teams.</p>
<p>Studies devoted to international academic collaboration are mainly descriptive or normative. For example, some scholars identify typical stages of international research collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112448422">Easterby-Smith &amp; Malina, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1059601112448422">Teagarden et al., 1995</xref>) or describe contextual influences on collaboration processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601112448422">Mezias et al., 1999</xref>) based on case studies. Scholars also normatively provide advice based on their experiences or perspectives rather than systematic empirical evidence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112448422">Eden &amp; Rynes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1059601112448422">Peterson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1059601112448422">Tsui, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1059601112448422">2007</xref>). Although these suggestions are valuable, we need theory-driven, hypothesis-testing studies on international collaboration teams to understand the factors contributing to the success of international authors in NA management journals.</p>
<sec id="section2-1059601112448422">
<title>Insights From International Entry Mode Theories</title>
<p>In his review of international collaboration in organizational behavior research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1059601112448422">Peterson (2001)</xref> proposed a strategic approach in choosing international collaborators. To some extent, international scholars choosing collaborators is similar to companies choosing joint venture partners. According to the international entry model literature, companies can choose partners from the target country, another foreign country, or their home country. International scholars may use similar strategies in forming their collaboration teams. They can collaborate with scholars from NA, another foreign country, or their home country. This similarity suggests that the major theories used to explain international entry mode successes―the resource-based view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112448422">Barney, 1991</xref>) and transaction-cost theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1059601112448422">Williamson, 1985</xref>)―can inform international academic collaboration. Although macro theories cannot perfectly map onto micro phenomena, some micro scholars have demonstrated that these perspectives provide a novel and useful lens. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112448422">Landry and Amara (1998)</xref> adopted transaction cost theory to explain scientists’ choices of institutional structures in research collaboration. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1059601112448422">van Rijnsoever, Hessels, and Vandeberg (2008)</xref> and Lavie and Drori (2011) regarded the resource-based view as “a powerful explanatory mechanism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1059601112448422">van Rijnsoever et al., 2008</xref>, p. 1256) to study academic collaboration.</p>
<p>The resource-based view suggests that the success of joint ventures lies in the creation or acquisition of complementary resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable, nontradable, and nonsubstitutable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112448422">Barney, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112448422">Das &amp; Teng, 2000</xref>). Such success relies on synergizing resources via vertical integration or achieving economy of scale via horizontal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112448422">Hennart, 1988</xref>). Similarly, international research collaboration also can achieve resource synergy or economy of scale. For example, collaboration can create synergy by division of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112448422">Laudel, 2001</xref>); that is, some scholars focus on theorization, research design, and grant acquisition, while others collect and analyze the data, and report the findings. Eventually the whole team interprets and discusses the results together. Collaboration can also create synergy by sharing resources that individual authors lack. For example, international scholars who have access to data or research grants may need collaborators who are good theorists or data analysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1059601112448422">Lee &amp; Bozeman, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, collaboration can create economy of scale. As the saying goes, “many hands make light work.” More “hands” allow scholars to work more efficiently, tackle more complex research questions, collect more data, and increase the accuracy of data analysis and interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112448422">Beaver, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Selecting an entry mode must consider not only increasing complementary resources, but also reducing transaction costs that may prohibit successful market entry. The transaction cost theory thus provides additional guidance for entry mode selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112448422">Geyskens, Steenkamp, &amp; Kumar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1059601112448422">Williamson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1059601112448422">Zhao, Luo, &amp; Suh, 2004</xref>). Specifically, transaction costs include costs of establishing a contract, such as searching for information and investing in assets that cannot be used in other transactions, as well as costs of coordinating, monitoring, and enforcing the contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1059601112448422">Williamson, 1985</xref>). To a certain extent, international research collaboration can be considered a social contract for exchanging research resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112448422">Drenth &amp; Wilpert, 1980</xref>). It similarly involves the costs of searching for research collaborators, communicating and traveling long distances, overcoming cultural barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112448422">Landry &amp; Amara, 1998</xref>), and ensuring that collaborators deliver outputs in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Next, we discuss the relative advantage of three possible collaboration modes as proxies for complementary resources and transaction costs. We then develop hypotheses on specific complementary resources and transaction costs that may influence the team’s publication success in NA journals.</p>

<sec id="section3-1059601112448422">
<title>Collaboration Modes</title>
<p>When trying to publish in NA journals, international scholars may collaborate with NA authors (NA-international collaboration), authors in the same country (Non-NA-domestic collaboration), or authors in another country outside NA (Non-NA-international collaboration). Each collaboration mode involves different combinations of resources and costs. International scholars who try to publish in NA journals are challenged by <italic>liability of foreignness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1059601112448422">Zaheer, 1995</xref>), a competitive disadvantage because of unfamiliarity with the NA market. Although using <italic>NA</italic> to categorize a management research paradigm may be a broad stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112448422">Baruch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1059601112448422">Tsoukas, 2008</xref>), NA journals nonetheless share writing styles, paradigms, and conventions that are distinguishable from European or Asian journals. International scholars may diverge from NA scholars in their English usage; even international scholars who are native English speakers may use different styles and terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1059601112448422">Tsoukas, 2008</xref>). Although copy editors can help in proofreading, they lack deep knowledge about the NA management research paradigm or the expertise for positioning papers, critiquing arguments, and establishing constructs and theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1059601112448422">Tsai &amp; Wu, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the publication process involves delicate communication processes with editors and reviewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059601112448422">Baruch, 2008</xref>), and scholars need years of experience to grasp appropriate ways of dealing with reviewer comments. Therefore, international scholars may be disadvantaged because of their unfamiliarity with NA journals. Even as they become familiar with the “market,” which usually takes years, they may still lack legitimacy. Editors of NA journals are still mostly NA scholars and may unintentionally favor NA authors due to the similarity-attraction effect when a paper is at the edge between a major revision and a rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112448422">Baruch, 2001</xref>). Therefore, local NA collaborators provide superior complementary resources by reducing the liability of foreignness.</p>
<p>Besides resource synergies, international scholars also must consider minimizing coordination costs. Collaborators can come from different countries, forming geographically dispersed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112448422">Bosch-Sijtsema, Fruchter, Vartiainen, &amp; Ruohomaki, 2011</xref>) or culturally diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1059601112448422">O’Leary &amp; Mortensen, 2010</xref>) teams. As geographical distance increases and team members spread throughout time zones, communication frequency decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1059601112448422">Van den Bulte &amp; Moenaert, 1998</xref>) and scheduling and coordination becomes more difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601112448422">Boh, Ren, Kiesler, &amp; Bussjaeger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1059601112448422">Massey, Montoya-Weiss, &amp; Hung, 2003</xref>). Scholars working in different locations, similar to distributed work teams, find it difficult to find “each other at the same time, in different times” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112448422">Armstrong &amp; Cole, 2002</xref>, p. 171), and they lack mutual knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112448422">Hinds &amp; Bailey, 2003</xref>). Scholars find that geographical dispersion causes more relational conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112448422">Hinds &amp; Mortensen, 2005</xref>), inhibits communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1059601112448422">Van den Bulte &amp; Moenaert, 1998</xref>), and reduces team innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112448422">Gibson &amp; Gibbs, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>These discussions lead us to conclude that collaborating with scholars from different countries increases coordination costs. In this sense, non-NA domestic collaboration teams are likely to incur lower costs than the other two types of collaboration teams. Compared with non-NA-domestic teams, although NA-international teams have higher coordination costs, they enjoy the important benefit of having NA scholars on board to reduce the liability of foreignness. We thus propose that NA-international teams may have higher publication success than non-NA-domestic teams. Like non-NA-domestic teams, non-NA-international teams lack the complementary resources provided by NA scholars, yet they have higher coordination costs by having team members in other countries. Thus we expect non-NA-international teams also to have lower publication success than NA-international teams. Therefore, we propose:</p>
<list id="list1-1059601112448422" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Collaboration modes will influence publication success as measured by the focal journal’s impact factor. Specifically, NA-international collaboration teams will have higher publication success than will non-NA-domestic teams and non-NA-international teams.</p></list-item>
</list>

<title>Complementary Resources</title>
<p>Collaboration modes are proxies of a combination of resources and costs embedded in a collaboration team. They do not inform the relative effects of specific complementary resources and costs. Next we focus on three specific resources: dominant paradigm knowledge, assistant professors, and contextual knowledge. <italic>Dominant paradigm knowledge</italic> refers to knowledge about publishing within the NA management research paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1059601112448422">Tsui &amp; Ou, 2008</xref>), including major theories, current topics, methods, and publication processes. <italic>Assistant professors</italic> are scholars who have completed doctoral training, obtained tenure-track faculty positions, but have not yet obtained tenure. Assistant professors in the NA university system are equivalent to the position of lecturers in U.K. or Australian university systems. <italic>Contextual knowledge</italic> refers to an understanding of the context where the research phenomenon takes place or where the research sample is obtained. While dominant paradigm knowledge and contextual knowledge may be resources unique to international scholars, the presence of assistant professors on the team is important for academic collaboration in general.</p>
<sec id="section5-1059601112448422">
<title>Dominant paradigm knowledge</title>
<p>Dominant paradigm knowledge can be obtained by working in a NA university, or by training in a NA doctoral program. Particularly, doctoral students learn formal and explicit knowledge about the literature and methods, and obtain tacit knowledge about theorizing and writing by interacting with professors in doctoral seminars, participating in colloquia with distinguished speakers, writing research papers under the guidance of experienced professors, and attending annual conferences where scholars share and exchange practical advice about conducting research. Supporting the importance of graduate school location, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1059601112448422">Podsakoff and colleagues (2008)</xref> used a record of 25,000 authors from about 2,000 universities publishing in 30 management journals and found that graduate school reputation accounts for 33% of the variance in total citations, whereas U.S. universities account for 88% of the top-100 most-cited universities in the field of management. We thus expect that having dominant paradigm knowledge will contribute to publication success in NA journals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059601112448422">
<title>Proportion of assistant professors</title>
<p>We regard academic rank as a proxy of research capability motivation, which has been found to relate positively with academic publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112448422">Bayer &amp; Folger, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112448422">Helmreich et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601112448422">Miner, 1980</xref>). Faculty ranks system rewards productive scholars. Scholars have to establish a record of successfully published articles to get promotion, and every promotion means status and salary upgrades. Assistant professors, who are at the bottom of the academic faculty ranks, are expected to have the strongest motivation to publish, relative to those who have passed the tenure hurdles. Therefore, assistant professors are valuable resources for publication. In support of this argument, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112448422">Klehe and Anderson (2007)</xref> found that motivation was correlated, more strongly than ability, with performance under typical performance situations, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1059601112448422">Tien and Blackburn (1996)</xref> found that full professors vary more in productivity. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112448422">Duffy and colleagues (2011)</xref> studied 673 psychologists and found that pretenured psychologists accumulated publication records more rapidly than tenured colleagues. We thus expect that enlisting assistant professors as collaborators will relate to publication success.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059601112448422">
<title>Contextual knowledge</title>
<p>Many scholars have pointed out that management knowledge is not context-free, and that knowing the research context is important for developing and testing theories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1059601112448422">Tsui, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1059601112448422">Whetten, 2009</xref>). NA editors welcome international authors for two important reasons. First, they hope that international authors will test the generalizability of theories developed in NA using non-NA samples. Second, they value the development of novel theories and methods in new contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1059601112448422">Peterson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1059601112448422">Whetten, 2009</xref>). These potential contributions require deep knowledge about the physical, historical, political, social, economic, and cultural contexts where the research phenomenon occurs or the data are collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1059601112448422">Tsui, Nifadkar, &amp; Ou, 2007</xref>). Local scholars are likely to comprehend tacit contextual knowledge. Therefore, when one or more authors live or work where the sample data are collected, the research is more likely to be rich in contextual explanations, and the paper is more likely to be published.</p>
<p>Summarizing the arguments underlying these three complementary resources, we propose:</p>
<list id="list2-1059601112448422" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Complementary resources, including dominant paradigm knowledge, proportion of assistant professors, and contextual knowledge, will relate positively to publication success.</p></list-item>

<title>Transaction Costs</title>
<p>Transaction cost theory guides our search for factors that hinder international collaboration success. Research on scientists tends to focus on factors contributing to publication success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112448422">Bozeman &amp; Corley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112448422">Judge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1059601112448422">Podsakoff et al., 2008</xref>). Studies on team composition can provide valuable insights regarding factors constraining team functioning and affecting the potential success of international collaboration teams. Among these factors, diversity is regarded as a double-edged sword (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1059601112448422">Williams &amp; O’Reilly, 1998</xref>). Some scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1059601112448422">Wittenbaum &amp; Stasser, 1996</xref>) argue that diverse teams have more access to information, enabling them to be more creative and make better decisions. On the other hand, some scholars draw on similarity attraction paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112448422">Byrne, 1971</xref>) and social categorization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1059601112448422">Tajfel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1059601112448422">Turner, 1987</xref>) and argue that diversity increases conflict and tension, hinders collaboration, and lowers team performance. Empirical findings on diversity are inconsistent. For observable diversity in gender and ethnicity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601112448422">Chatman and Flynn (2001)</xref> found that they were negatively related with collaboration success, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1059601112448422">Tyran and Gibson (2008)</xref> found that they had no effect on group efficacy. These conflicting findings have prompted two meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112448422">Horwitz &amp; Horwitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1059601112448422">Webber &amp; Donahue, 2001</xref>), and both found that observable diversity had no significant main effect on team cohesion and performance. Horwitz and Horwitz concluded that “bio-demographic diversity may actually not affect team performance in any meaningful way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112448422">2007</xref>, p. 1006).</p>
<p>However, many scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112448422">Bear &amp; Woolley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112448422">Joshi &amp; Roh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1059601112448422">van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1059601112448422">Williams &amp; O’Reilly, 1998</xref>) notice that the effect of diversity is more complex than previous studies have suggested, and scholars must adopt a contingency perspective on diversity. In other words, scholars should examine diversity of specific attributes in specific contexts to make accurate predictions. Previously, scholars argued that diversity in some attributes (e.g., function, education) carries informational benefits, whereas diversity in other attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity) triggers social categorization and hinders team functioning. However, overall empirical data failed to sustain this argument (for a review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1059601112448422">van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007</xref>) although some studies found differential effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112448422">Harrison, Price, &amp; Bell, 1998</xref>). Instead, diversity of a certain attribute can have both positive and negative effects, depending on the context. For example, gender is traditionally regarded as a salient attribute to probe social categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1059601112448422">Tsui, Egan, &amp; O’Reilly, 1992</xref>); it also implies various life experiences and perspectives that can enrich information processing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1059601112448422">Woolley and colleagues (2010)</xref> found that the proportion of women was positively related with collective intelligence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1059601112448422">Pearsall and colleagues (2008)</xref> found gender diversity to be disruptive in gender-conscious tasks but beneficial for creativity in gender-neutral tasks.</p>
<p>In fact, abundant research has identified diversity contingencies including task characteristics (e.g., interdependence and complexity), team characteristics (e.g., tenure, time), and organizational characteristics (e.g., organizational culture, human resource practices, and strategy; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1059601112448422">van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112448422">Joshi and Roh’s (2009)</xref> meta-analysis found that gender diversity had a stronger negative effect in a male-dominant setting and in a high-technology industry. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1059601112448422">Pelled, Eisenhardt, and Xin (1999)</xref> found that the positive relationship between race diversity and emotional conflict became stronger when task complexity increased. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112448422">Earley and Moskakrowski (2000)</xref> found that high cultural diversity could become beneficial when team members formed a hybrid culture.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the complexity of diversity, we focus on diversities of two attributes: gender and national culture. We suggest that these two diversity attributes are more likely to be costs than resources in the context of international academic collaboration teams because of two unique characteristics of these teams: (a) task complexity and interdependence and (b) geographical distance. Academic research teams engage in highly complex and interdependent tasks. Theorizing and forming research ideas demands cognitively complex knowledge integration and creation. Designing and implementing data collection procedures involves countless details, each essential to maintain research rigor and ensure success. Data analyses and interpretation require mastery of the newest sophisticated methods and disciplined imagination. Team members must collaborate closely and communicate smoothly to assure that research manuscripts are integral. However, in circumstances of such task complexity and interdependence, diversity increases social categorization and destructive conflict. Supporting this argument, diversity is found to associate with more conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1059601112448422">Pelled et al., 1999</xref>) and less effective communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1059601112448422">Stahl, Maznevski, Voigt, &amp; Jonsen, 2010</xref>) especially when task complexity is high; and conflicts, in turn, damage team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112448422">De Dreu &amp; Weingart, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, working in dispersed geographical areas, as would be the case with international collaboration, reduces communication frequency and effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1059601112448422">Van den Bulte &amp; Moenaert, 1998</xref>), limiting scholars’ capability to reap the informational benefit of diversity.</p>
<p>These characteristics of international collaboration increase the negative relational costs and reduce the positive informational benefits of diversity. In addition, occupational demography in academia further enhances the negative effect of gender diversity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112448422">Joshi and Roh (2009)</xref> noted that social categorization processes are more likely to be enacted when a single demographic group dominates an occupational context. Although female and male scholars are regarded as equally productive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112448422">Duffy et al., 2011</xref>), publication records still indicate gender imbalance. Publication records for international collaboration teams in 10 NA management journals during 2003-2010 showed that only 30% of the authors were women. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601112448422">Metz and Harzing (2009)</xref> concluded that women continue to be underrepresented on editorial boards after tracing 57 management journals over a 15-year period. Such gender imbalance can hinder the performance of mixed gender teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112448422">Bear &amp; Woolley, 2011</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112448422">Joshi and Roh’s (2009)</xref> meta-analysis has evidence on this effect. The negative effect of gender imbalance in an occupation group becomes a vicious cycle so that mixed gender teams in academic collaboration, international or otherwise, will tend to negatively affect collaboration success.</p>
<p>Besides the two characteristics of international collaboration teams that limit informational benefit of diversity in general, diversity of national culture has its unique challenge. National culture characterizes distinctive ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving that are shared among members of a national group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112448422">Earley &amp; Gibson, 2002</xref>). Different expectations of communication practices can easily cause misunderstanding, distrust, and stereotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112448422">Adler &amp; Boyacigiller, 1995</xref>). Using a sample 56 project teams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112448422">Gibson and Gibbs (2006)</xref> found that national diversity was negatively related with innovation. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1059601112448422">Stahl and colleagues (2010)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis on cultural diversity in teams based on 108 studies on 10, 632 multicultural teams. They found that cultural diversity, particularly when using nations as proxies, was associated with higher conflicts (ρ = 0.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), lower social integration (ρ = −0.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), and less effective communication (ρ = −0.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Although cultural diversity related to creativity (ρ = 0.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), the overall effect on performance was insignificant (ρ = −0.02, <italic>ns</italic>.). These results suggest that geographically dispersed teams cannot realize the informational benefit because of reduced communication and increased conflicts. Based on our discussion on gender and cultural diversity, we propose:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>We conducted two studies to examine the complementary resources and transaction costs embedded in international collaboration teams. In Study 1, we used a sample of 364 published articles to empirically test the hypotheses. The findings provided strong support to the hypotheses on complementary resources but only partial support to the hypotheses on transaction costs. In Study 2, we interviewed 23 international scholars to further understand how international scholars transform costs into resources. Incorporating findings from Study 1 and Study 2, we developed a theoretical framework to guide future research and to provide guidance for international scholars seeking collaborators.</p>

<title>Study 1</title>
<sec id="section11-1059601112448422">
<title>Sample and Data Collection</title>
<p>The sample consisted of articles published by international collaboration teams in 10 NA management journals, and the unit of analysis was a published article. Journals were selected from the ISI Web of Science Journal Citation Reports, 2010 Edition, in the category of management. We used three criteria for selecting journals. First, they must be NA journals that publish articles dealing with broad management issues rather than specialty topics, which omitted journals such as <italic>MIS Quarterly</italic> and <italic>Journal of Operation Management</italic>. Second, this group of journals must have sufficient variance in yearly ISI impact factors so that we could test the impact of collaboration team characteristics. This criterion caused us to select journals traditionally regarded as top-tier (e.g., <italic>Academy of Management Journal</italic> and <italic>Strategic Management Journal</italic>), high impact journals that have grown rapidly in recent years (e.g., <italic>Journal of Management</italic> and <italic>Group &amp; Organization Management</italic>), and journals of relatively lower ranking (e.g., <italic>Personnel Review</italic> and <italic>Journal of Management Inquiries</italic>). Third, among journals within a similar range of impact factors, priority went to those that provided sufficient author biographical information for coding. Considering all three criteria, we omitted <italic>Journal of Applied Psychology</italic> and <italic>Personnel Psychology</italic> but chose <italic>Administrative Science Quarterly</italic> and <italic>Journal of International Business Studies</italic>, which had relatively similar impact factors as the omitted two. The 10 management journals include <italic>Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Strategic Management Journal, Organization Science, Journal of Management, Journal of International Business Studies, Human Resource Management, Group &amp; Organization Management, Journal of Management Inquiries</italic>, and <italic>Personnel Review</italic>. Their 5-year impact factors published in 2010 range from 1.17 (<italic>Personnel Review</italic>) to 10.79 (<italic>Academy of Management Journal</italic>). Seven of the 10 journals in this list were included in the top-tier management journal list compiled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1059601112448422">Podsakoff and colleagues (2005)</xref>.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112448422">Judge and colleagues (2007)</xref>, we coded the first and middle issues of each journal from 2003 to 2010. We started from 2003 because our analysis of the Academy of Management membership indicated a significant and continuous growth of international members since that year. We then searched for articles that included more than one author, with at least one affiliated with a university outside the United States and Canada. Among 1,062 articles, international collaboration teams authored 364 articles with 982 authors from 44 countries. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601112448422">Table 1</xref>, articles by international collaboration teams accounted for 34% of articles published in those journals. Some journals had a much higher percentage than others (e.g., <italic>Group &amp; Organization Management</italic>, 52%; <italic>Administrative Science Quarterly</italic>, 23%). Among 364 articles, 42% are NA-international collaborations, 39% non-NA-domestic collaborations, and 19% non-NA-international collaborations.</p>

<p>We collected information about each collaboration team from various sources. We first obtained basic article information from ISI Web of Science, including publication year, page count, and number of references. Then we downloaded the articles, and two authors independently coded the content as theory or review and identified the countries involved. The interrater agreement was 98.5%. Two authors then met and discussed all discrepancies until they reached total agreement. We used biographies provided in the article, authors’ web pages, or email contacts to gather information such as university affiliation, gender, academic rank, and university awarding the highest degree.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section13-1059601112448422">
<title>Dependent variable: Publication success</title>
<p>To indicate collaboration success, we used the impact factor (IF) of the journal in the year that the article was published. Scholars and university administrators have commonly used IF as an indicator of journal quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1059601112448422">Walsh, 2011</xref>), and it provides a straight-forward and quantifiable way to measure publication success. For example, a collaboration team that published in <italic>Group and Organization Management</italic> in 2010 (IF = 2.415) was more successful than another team that published in <italic>Personnel Review</italic> (IF = 0.446). We did not use article citation counts for two reasons. First, we focused on whether international collaboration teams can publish in high-quality journals, not the impact of their specific articles. Yearly journal IF is based on the journal’s total citation counts in the previous 2 years, and thus is a good indicator of the journal quality. Second, journal IF has been found to be the most important predictor of article citation counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112448422">Judge et al., 2007</xref>). However, article citation counts, as an indicator of academic influence, are affected by status of authors’ affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112448422">Baruch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1059601112448422">Mingers &amp; Xu, 2010</xref>). Given that 95% of the top-100 most-cited universities in the field of management are located in NA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1059601112448422">Podsakoff et al., 2008</xref>), article citation counts may underestimate the academic value of an article by international collaboration teams.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1059601112448422">
<title>Independent variable for H1</title>
<p><italic>Collaboration mode</italic> was categorized into three groups: NA-international (at least one author was affiliated with a NA university), non-NA-international (authors from at least two different countries and no NA authors), and non-NA domestic collaborations (authors all from a single country outside NA). We created two dummy variables for these three categories, the NA–international dummy and the non-NA–international dummy. The group of non-NA–domestic articles was the reference group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1059601112448422">
<title>Independent variables for H2</title>
<p>We used two indicators to measure <italic>dominant paradigm knowledge</italic> carriers in the team: the percentage of authors who were affiliated with NA universities as listed in the article, and the percentage of authors who got their highest degree from NA universities. Because these two indicators were highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), we used the average of the two indicators to measure dominant knowledge carriers. Cronbach’s alpha of this measure was .77, above the acceptance level of .70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1059601112448422">Nunnally, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>We used <italic>proportion of assistant professors</italic> as an indicator of research motivation. We coded academic ranks based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112448422">Baruch and Hall’s (2004)</xref> coding scheme. Specifically, the <italic>assistant professor</italic> category included lecturer, assistant professor, assistant or associate lecturer, and instructor; the <italic>associate or full professor</italic> category included associate and full professors, readers, senior lecturers, principal lecturers; the <italic>student</italic> category included students and research assistants; and the <italic>business professional</italic> category included individuals affiliated with noneducational institutions. Because of the small percentages of authors in the student (6.98%) and business professional (2.36%) categories, we combined them into one category: <italic>others</italic>. The proportion of assistant professors was the percentage of the assistant professors in a collaboration team.</p>
<p><italic>Contextual knowledge</italic> was measured by whether at least one author was located in at least one country or region where the sample data were collected (1 = <italic>yes</italic>, 0 = <italic>no</italic>). When the study involved multiple countries and multiple authors, we coded it as 1 = <italic>yes</italic> when at least one author was based in the country or region where the sample was obtained. If an article was a theory or review paper (either a qualitative review or a quantitative review using meta-analysis), the variable was coded as missing.</p>

These eight cultural profiles are West Europe, East-Central and Baltic Europe, Latin America, English-speaking East Europe, South and South East Asia, Muslim Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Confucian Asia. Similar to gender diversity, we used Blau’s Index to calculate cultural diversity for each collaboration team.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059601112448422">Table 3</xref> summarizes the hierarchical regression analysis results. The dependent variable is the yearly journal impact factor, an indicator of publication success. We first entered the control variables in Model 1 (i.e., year, page count, number of references, number of authors, theory/review, and proportion of associate and full professors). Model 2 shows the results for Hypothesis 1. Both NA-international collaboration teams (β = 0.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and non-NA-international collaboration teams (β = 0.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) enjoyed more publications in high-impact journals, relative to non-NA-domestic teams (the omitted category). These two modes accounted for 8% additional variance in publication success. When using non-standardized beta coefficients, NA-international collaboration teams published in journals with impact factors 1.03 higher than non-NA-domestic teams and 0.53 higher than non-NA-international teams. Hypothesis 1 was supported in that the NA-international collaboration teams published in journals with higher impact factors than the other two collaboration modes.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 2 suggested a positive relationship between complementary resources and publication success. Specifically, Model 3a tested the impacts of dominant paradigm knowledge and proportion of assistant professors. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059601112448422">Table 3</xref>, both variables are positively associated with publication success after introducing control variables (β = 0.31 and 0.14 respectively, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Compared with Model 1, Model 3a increased adjusted R-square by 12%, suggesting that complementary resources significantly increased publication success. In Model 3b, we added the third collaboration resource variable, contextual knowledge, using a smaller subsample of 293 teams. We excluded 71 collaboration teams from the sample because their papers were either theory or reviews where sample location information was irrelevant. Contrary to our hypothesis, contextual knowledge had a negative impact on publication success (β = −0.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In addition, this model improved the model fit by 5% from Model 3a. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 received partial support by two of the three complementary resources.</p>
<p>The results for Hypothesis 3 are shown in Model 4. Teams with higher gender diversity published in journals with lower yearly impact factor (β = −0.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), supporting Hypothesis 3. However, cultural diversity had a positive regression coefficient with publication success (β = 0.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), failing to support Hypothesis 3.</p>
<p>Some interesting results emerge from the control variables. Publication year had a positive regression coefficient (β = 0.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), indicating that the journals’ yearly impact factors increased over the years. The results also show that papers published in journals with higher-impact factors have smaller page counts (β = −0.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and more references (β = 0.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Number of authors, theory or review article, and the proportion of associate or full professors showed no systematic relationship with publication success.</p>
<sec id="section20-1059601112448422">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, the results provide strong support for Hypothesis 1 and partial support for Hypotheses 2 and 3. By comparing the three collaboration modes (NA-international, non-NA-international, non-NA-domestic collaborations), we find that the NA-international collaboration teams published in journals with higher impact factors. Our examination on specific resources reveals the beneficial presence of members with dominant paradigm knowledge, that is, scholars who are affiliated with NA universities or receive their doctoral training in NA. Furthermore, we find that having more assistant professors was associated with higher publication success. Besides using the proportion of associate or full professors as a control variable, we conducted a post hoc analysis by adding a dummy variable concerning whether at least one full professor served on the team. The significant effect of assistant professors remained robust.</p>
<p>Interestingly, having authors located in the sample context was a liability rather than an asset. This finding contradicts our expectations that international scholars bring rich knowledge about the sample context and thus improve the quality of the study. Perhaps those teams needed dominant paradigm knowledge carriers to interpret and utilize contextual knowledge, or perhaps contextual knowledge was attenuated when the sample involved too many countries. We conducted two post hoc analyses to examine those possibilities. We first used proportion of NA authors as a moderator between contextual knowledge and publication success and found a marginal positive moderation effect (β = 0.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). This moderation suggests that contextual knowledge may be a liability if the team lacks dominant knowledge carriers to carefully interpret and translate findings about foreign samples. Next, we added number of sample countries as an independent variable and also included a moderation term between it and contextual knowledge. However, neither the new independent variable (β = −0.03, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10) nor the moderation effect (β = 0.03, <italic>p &gt;</italic> .10) were significant, indicating the number of countries in the sample had no effect. This finding on the negative effect of having an author located in the sample context is an interesting puzzle for future research.</p>
<p>We theorized that diversity is more of a cost than a resource to research collaboration teams, but our examination indicates that diversity’s impact is rather complicated. Gender diversity’s negative impact is as expected, but the finding on the positive effect of cultural diversity is intriguing. Is it because cultural diversity is mainly a result of NA scholars joining the team, causing the measure to be confounded with dominant paradigm knowledge? We indeed noticed a high correlation between cultural diversity and dominant paradigm knowledge (<italic>r</italic> = 0.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); however, the positive effect of cultural diversity was significant even after controlling for dominant paradigm knowledge, suggesting that cultural diversity may have additional interpretation capacity beyond dominant paradigm knowledge carried by NA scholars. We suspect that the collaboration team may have resolved the transaction costs of cultural diversity and turned it into resources for publication success. For example, in their study on virtual teams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1059601112448422">Peters and Karren (2009)</xref> found that trust moderates the relationship between functional diversity and team performance, and it is likely that unexplored moderators change the relationship between diversity and publication success. Still, current literature on academic collaborations provides insufficient insight for identifying factors that transform transaction costs into complementary resources. Therefore, we conducted Study 2 using interviews to inductively explore these missing factors.</p>

<title>Sample and Data Collection</title>
<p>We conducted 23 semi-structured interviews to understand factors that might help transform transaction costs into complementary resources. Interviews and qualitative methods are appropriate for studying underexplored phenomena and developing theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112448422">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601112448422">Lee, Mitchell, &amp; Sablynski, 1999</xref>). To learn how scholars transform costs such as cultural diversity into resources, we interviewed only scholars who had collaborated with others outside their home countries. Because our aim is to understand the factors contributing to international scholars’ success in the NA publication market, we interviewed only non-NA scholars. We invited international scholars from different countries, ages, ranks, and genders to compare patterns from different cases. We followed the principle of theoretical sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112448422">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>) to select participants and used the principle of theoretical saturation to stop data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1059601112448422">Yin, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The final sample included 23 scholars from eight countries in four continents outside NA: Asia (4), Europe (17), Oceania (1), and South America (1). These scholars were 30 to 55 years old, five were female, and 70% had successfully published in NA journals with collaborators outside their home country. Fourteen (60%) were assistant professors, and the rest were associate or full professors. We interviewed more assistant professors because university pressures that raise the bar for tenure and emphasize publishing in internationally recognized journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1059601112448422">Leung, 2007</xref>) strongly motivate assistant professors to seek collaborators and to publish in NA journals.</p>
<p>The semi-structured interviews lasted 30-70 minutes each. We asked interviewees about their experiences in recent international collaboration projects and experiences with their most important collaborators. In particular, we asked about the challenges they faced, how they resolved these challenges, and the factors that contributed to their collaboration success or failure. We asked them to elaborate the points with examples. In addition, we explored whether diversity was a challenge. We tape-recorded all interviews and then transcribed them for coding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1059601112448422">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We applied grounded theory techniques to analyze the interview data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112448422">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1059601112448422">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1059601112448422">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). With the assistance of NVivo 9, two authors independently analyzed the interview notes line-by-line and developed first-order concepts by using the original words whenever possible or creating a simple descriptive phrase. These initial codes were added to an emerging dictionary with definitions and examples documented. Next, we adopted axial coding, wherein we identified relationships among first-order concepts and grouped them into second-order themes. Finally, we grouped similar themes into dimensions that constituted the basis of an emergent framework. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601112448422">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the coding process and data structure for factors helping scholars to resolve diversity issues.</p>

<p>The interview analysis was carefully executed to ensure internal validity, external validity, and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1059601112448422">Yin, 2003</xref>). First, using the triangulation principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1059601112448422">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>), two authors served as coders and the third served as a subject expert to assess whether the conclusions were plausible. Second, using the constant comparison technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112448422">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>), we compared patterns found for scholars who successfully published with collaborators with those who failed, and we checked whether themes identified in one case could be replicated elsewhere. These procedures allowed us to generate logically coherent, parsimonious, and reliable findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112448422">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>).</p>

<p>Interviewees consistently referred to cultural diversity as a challenge for international collaboration. Six mentioned language barriers, eight identified mindset differences, and seven addressed communication difficulties. Regarding language barriers, a male Dutch full professor said that he could not communicate effectively with his colleague because they had to use English, a second language for both. He concluded, “If you don’t speak the language, cooperation becomes very difficult.” Regarding different mindsets, a male German assistant professor reported being unable to “find a common denominator” in collaborating with a Chinese colleague because of their different views. Regarding communication difficulties, a male German associate professor said that “[it] is much easier to process a project when you see each other often and you can quickly bring it back into the awareness, into the working memory”. Such comments confirmed our previous theorization that cultural diversity would be a transaction cost.</p>
<p>Despite all these challenges, scholars found international collaboration necessary for publication success. One male German assistant professor commented: “you just don’t find the person within your university or even within your country, and so you have to look worldwide.” In fact, successful teams managed to transform this liability into an asset. Hence, they realized the benefits from cultural diversity, as Study 1 attested. Our subsequent analysis focused on identifying factors that helped overcome the collaboration challenges.</p>
<sec id="section25-1059601112448422">
<title>Personal enablers</title>
<p>Personal enablers are characteristics of individual international scholars that contribute to effective collaboration. Based on 50 comments, we identified two personal enablers: (1) strong professional aspiration (39 comments) that motivated scholars to proactively seek international collaborations, and (2) interpersonal competency (11 comments) that allowed them to successfully avoid or solve conflicts during the collaboration process.</p>
<p>First, these scholars expressed strong professional aspirations. They considered international collaboration as a vehicle for gaining research freedom (3 comments), acquiring research skills (10 comments), increasing publication quantity (13 comments), obtaining research grants (5 comments), getting promoted, or renewing their employment contracts (8 comments). Such strong aspirations motivate international scholars to actively seek collaborators from other countries, to proactively confront challenges, and to find solutions to conflicts in the collaboration process.</p>
<p>Some international scholars received their training outside the NA system, but they wanted to go beyond this personal constraint. For example, a male Spanish assistant professor said: “I want to get freedom to do what I want, such as going to other universities, moving around the world, being competitive in the market.” Many expressed strong learning motives to collaborate internationally. A male full professor in China said that he wanted to eventually become the principal contributor or driver of a research project, but he did not mind taking the role of assistant in his collaborators’ projects to learn from their writing, research methods, and publication skills. Other scholars expressed similar motivations such as learning research design, scale development, data collection, and sampling procedures, or learning how to write and publish. Some scholars were motivated by increasing publication quantity. For example, a female Singaporean associate professor said that rather than seeking to learn from collaborations she specifically looked for increasing research publications. Some scholars were driven by grant opportunities. A female Australian assistant professor started her first international collaboration because “this person is very keen on getting certain grants from the government.”</p>
<p>Partly because of their personal interests and partly because of university incentives or pressures, our interviewees aspired to publish in high-ranking international journals through collaborations with scholars from other countries. European scholars mentioned that universities that were transforming from teaching to research especially value international publications when awarding academic promotions or renewing employment contracts. Some universities provide monetary rewards for international publications or look at international collaborations as additional proof of competency in research grant applications. A male Italian assistant professor detailed the Italian university system: “Italian scholars, after dramatic changes in the academic career system, can get a promotion or renew their employment contract in the future if they have publications in international journals with impact factors. In order to achieve this goal, we need to collaborate and to be in a network.”</p>
<p>Second, successful international scholars demonstrated high interpersonal competency. Specifically, they had agreeable personalities (4 comments), exhibited high cultural intelligence (4 comments), and were task-focused (3 comments). For example, a male Italian associate professor said: “I am pretty easygoing. Basically most of my coauthors are my friends.” These scholars usually had international experiences, such as acquiring doctoral degrees or being visiting scholars in other countries and actively attending international academic conferences. Such experiences increased their cultural intelligence. A male German associate professor said he had to “understand why someone from Portugal or from Italy would always do everything last minute, which could drive somebody from the North rather crazy because we like to have it on the desk on time.” International scholars avoided taking conflicts personally or becoming judgmental; instead, under conflict they managed to reorient the focus to the research project and to reiterate the common goals. For example, a female Chinese assistant professor said: “It’s again you [who] have to be able to compromise first. I mentioned to him again that we both wanted to get this interesting idea published.”</p>

<sec id="section26-1059601112448422">
<title>Team facilitators</title>
<p>Some characteristics of the research team facilitate avoidance of relational conflicts. Based on 94 comments, we found collaboration teams that (1) possess deep similarities (40 comments) and (2) manage the communication process well (54 comments) are likely to overcome collaboration challenges. First, members in successful international collaboration teams possess similar publication goals (11 comments), research interests (18 comments), and working styles (11 comments), indicating deep-level similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112448422">Harrison et al., 1998</xref>). Participants reported that their collaboration team members shared the same research goals and publication motivations. Realizing that they could not finish their projects alone, they cherished their collaborative relationships. One male Greek assistant professor concluded, “it’s important that both parties have the same goals in the collaboration.” He felt that his “collaboration success was because the collaborators were motivated to the same level.” Besides having similar publication goals, team members shared similar research interests. For example, a male German associate professor said: “We have the same research interests; his research projects are in line with my own. Therefore, his project motivates me to learn his methods and every other new aspect involved.” Other scholars mentioned the importance of having similar working styles. A female Singaporean associate professor shared her experience that collaborators “need to share similar working style,” and they “set up the terms and conditions upfront and make sure team members are happy with the collaboration.”</p>
<p>Second, successful international collaboration teams paid special attention to communication processes including frequent (6 comments) and open (7 comments) communication, appealing to common goals (13 comments), utilizing multiple communication media (5 comments), developing long-term friendship and trust (23 comments). A male Argentine associate professor regarded frequent communication as a key success factor: “all members try to have frequent interactions and communications.” A Dutch full professor said that the team openly shared every detail, from research issues to university administration information. When differing ideas escalated to relational conflicts, they managed to return to their original common goals and restart their conversations. A female Australian assistant professor said that it was important to be patient, and more important to have “the willingness to negotiate, the willingness to accommodate each other.” Recognizing the difficulty of communication caused by long distance, scholars utilized multiple communication media such as Skype, phone, and email to obtain more contextual information and minimize miscommunication. A male Dutch full professor, a frequent Skype-user said that it could “clarify issues that cannot be resolved via emails.”</p>
<p>Scholars emphasized the importance of trust and friendship (23 comments) in the process of communication. A female Australian assistant professor mentioned that members on their team knew one another for at least a year before they started the project: “I’ve been working with American colleagues for years and we are good friends who regularly get together. … When it’s more than a superficial connection, it is evidently easier to work together.” A male German assistant professor said: “especially when you work with people from other countries and you know you don’t meet them on a regular basis, you need to establish trust or find some means to deal with problems that could be arising due to low trust.” Such high-quality communication is likely to increase psychological safety among team members, which in turn facilitates team learning activities and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112448422">Kostopoulos &amp; Bozionelos, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results from Study 2 complement Study 1 in that they specify the missing factors that changed the relationship between transaction costs and publication success. Specifically, Study 2 identifies individual-level factors including professional aspiration and interpersonal competency, and it also provides team-level factors including deep-level similarity and communication management. These factors plausibly explain how successful international collaboration teams manage to enjoy the benefits of diversity and avoid its negative effects. Combining the insights gained from the quantitative Study 1 and qualitative Study 2, we develop a preliminary model on factors contributing to successful international research collaboration. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601112448422">Figure 2</xref>, the factors in white boxes are findings from Study 1, and the factors in grey boxes are findings from Study 2.</p>

</fig>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601112448422">Figure 2</xref>, successful international collaboration teams manage two elements simultaneously. First, they ensure that the team has members who have complementary resources such as dominant paradigm knowledge, who are strongly motivated, and who have advanced skills for conducting high-quality research. Second, successful teams use both individual and team efforts to mitigate transaction costs embedded in the team composition. We identify two examples of transaction costs: gender and cultural diversity.</p>
<p>Successful international scholars manage to transform diversity into resources through individual and team efforts. Although individuals naturally prefer working with people who are similar to them, professional aspiration motivates international scholars to collaborate with people who are different and to proactively solve the associated challenges. Interpersonal competency enables them to be good problem solvers. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112448422">Groves and Feyerherm (2011)</xref> who found that diverse teams functioned better with leaders of high cultural intelligence, characterized with knowledge, motivation, and ability to deal with people from different backgrounds. Among team members, deep-level similarity such as shared goals, similar working styles, and research interests provides additional assurance that the team focuses on accomplishing common goals. Being aware of potential detrimental effects of long-distance communication and cross-cultural differences, successful teams pay special attention to their communication processes so that team members share information openly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601112448422">Lin, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The world has never been so interconnected as it is today. Impact of events in one country, be it the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, debt crisis in Greece, or leadership transition in China, is now quickly felt by others around the world. Accordingly, the demand for multidisciplinary and multinational knowledge is increasing rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112448422">March, 2005</xref>). In response, many editors of NA management journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059601112448422">Baruch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1059601112448422">Leung, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112448422">March, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1059601112448422">Tsoukas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1059601112448422">Tsui, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1059601112448422">Tung &amp; van Witteloostuijn, 2008</xref>) either welcome or actively seek the participation of international scholars. So far such effort has been mainly informed by descriptive accounts and prescriptive advice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112448422">Boyacigiller &amp; Adler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1059601112448422">Peterson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1059601112448422">Tsoukas, 2008</xref>). Our study is among the first to empirically examine factors facilitating and constraining international scholars’ success in publishing in NA journals through collaboration. We apply concepts from the international entry mode literature to investigate this issue, and ground our search for success factors on the solid theoretical foundations of resource-based view and transaction cost theory. We also integrate the academic publication literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112448422">Judge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1059601112448422">Newman &amp; Cooper, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1059601112448422">Podsakoff et al., 2008</xref>), and the newest advances in team literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601112448422">Mathieu et al., 2008</xref>), particularly on virtual teams and diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112448422">Bear &amp; Woolley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112448422">Gibson &amp; Gibbs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112448422">Horwitz &amp; Horwitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112448422">Joshi &amp; Roh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1059601112448422">van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers, 2007</xref>). Based on archival data of 364 papers from 982 authors and personal interviews with 23 international scholars, we found general support for the complementary resources and transaction cost hypotheses, and we also identified individual and team level factors that transform costs into resources. We discuss our theoretical contribution, practical implications, limitations, and future research directions below.</p>
<sec id="section29-1059601112448422">
<title>Theoretical contributions and practical implication</title>
<p>By focusing on team composition, we find convincing evidence for the importance of several resources and costs. First, international scholars are more likely to publish in journals with higher impact factors when they collaborate with NA scholars (H1), or with scholars who are trained in NA or are currently working in NA (H2). This finding confirms that international scholars benefit from joining NA management associations or from seeking NA collaborators. Saying that, we do not preclude that there can be a spillover effect that international scholars will pick up and learn the necessary knowledge and skills to eventually be able to independently publish in NA journals. Second, we find benefits from having assistant professors on the team. Although our study focuses on international scholars, this finding is consistent with findings based on NA psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112448422">Duffy et al., 2011</xref>), and thus it seems applicable to NA scholars as well. Third, consistent with the transaction cost argument, gender diversity reduced publication success, which may be explained by gender imbalance in the field. Recent research found that female still perform larger share of housework and child care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112448422">Lachance-Grzela &amp; Bouchard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1059601112448422">Nakhaie, 2009</xref>). In the academic field, they have higher teaching loads and more committee work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1059601112448422">West &amp; Curtis, 2006</xref>). However, women are less exposed to promotion opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059601112448422">Burke &amp; Mattis, 2007</xref>), are under-represented in journal editorial boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601112448422">Metz &amp; Harzing, 2009</xref>), tenured faculty rank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1059601112448422">West &amp; Curtis, 2006</xref>), and earn less salary than male peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1059601112448422">Umbach, 2007</xref>). All these issues manifest the negative consequences of women working in a male-dominated academic field. Universities may need to provide more career support to female scholars in efforts to reduce gender imbalances in workload and reward patterns.</p>
<p>Two findings defy our predictions and challenge general assumptions in the field. First, we proposed contextual knowledge as a resource but found a weak negative effect. Like others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601112448422">March, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1059601112448422">Tsui, 2004</xref>), we assumed that international scholars can contribute to the field by developing knowledge in novel contexts. However, our findings suggest that international scholars alone may be unable to effectively convert their understandings about novel contexts into knowledge. Instead, international collaboration seems a better way to achieve synergy between scholars operating in the dominant paradigm and other scholars who carry insights about the new contexts. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112448422">Fligstein and Zhang (2011)</xref> studied China’s unique form of capitalism. In this case, the second author was a Chinese national who provided the contextual knowledge that the first author, from the United States, rendered useful for publication.</p>
<p>The second surprise is that cultural diversity is positively related with publication success, although research on team diversity suggests that task complexity, interdependence, and geographical dispersion can reduce the informational benefit of diversity. This finding prompted us to qualitatively investigate potential moderators between diversity and publication success. Our analysis of the personal interviews reveals the role of strong professional aspiration and interpersonal competency in dealing with cultural challenges. Consistent with this finding, previous research has found that conscientiousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112448422">Barrick &amp; Mount, 1991</xref>) and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112448422">Klehe &amp; Anderson, 2007</xref>) are positively associated with job performance. Cultural intelligence (CQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112448422">Ang, Van Dyne, &amp; Koh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601112448422">Earley &amp; Ang, 2003</xref>) was identified as a key component of interpersonal competency, suggesting that CQ is not only important to managers and employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112448422">Groves &amp; Feyerherm, 2011</xref>) but also to scholars in achieving successful international collaboration.</p>
<p>In addition, we find that successful collaboration teams share deep-level similarity and effectively manage communication. Scholars have increasingly recognized that deep-level diversity strongly affects group cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601112448422">Elfenbein &amp; O’Reilly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112448422">Harrison et al., 1998</xref>), and our qualitative data confirm that deep-level similarity enables scholars to avoid relational conflicts and reap the informational benefits of cultural diversity. The virtual team literature suggests that geographical dispersion reduces trust and increases conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112448422">Armstrong &amp; Cole, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1059601112448422">Polzer, Crisp, Jarvenpaa, &amp; Kim, 2006</xref>). We find that scholars can offset such barriers by developing long-term friendship and trust.</p>
<p>In summary, our study contributes to the academic collaboration research by explaining resources and costs embedded in international collaboration teams and individual and team factors that transform costs into benefits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112448422">Bosch-Sijtsema and colleagues (2011)</xref> proposed a framework to analyze knowledge work in distributed teams. They suggested that team structure and work processes influence knowledge and team performance. We extend their framework by revealing the importance of both team structure and team process and by providing additional insight into how team processes can enhance or mitigate the effects of team structure. Our study also contributes to virtual team research by studying a special profession of virtual teams, - academic scholars, and we identify factors specific to them, such as dominant knowledge carriers and proportion of assistant professors.</p>
<p>Our study has important practical implications for management scholars. First, international scholars seeking to publish in NA management journals can draw evidence-based suggestions regarding benefits of strategically seeking collaborators, especially NA scholars. Copy editors are insufficient for providing this benefit, because they lack knowledge about management topics or publication processes. Second, we suggest that journal editors should act more proactively to help international scholars publish in NA journals. Among the ten journals we studied, the proportion of papers involving international collaboration widely varied, from 16% (<italic>Journal of Management Inquiries</italic>) to 52% (<italic>Group &amp; Organization Management</italic>). To encourage faster globalization of the journal, editors might consider being less influenced by authors’ university affiliations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112448422">Baruch, 2001</xref>). Third, scholars who mentor doctoral students can initiate more international collaborations during doctoral training, so that students develop necessary skills to collaborate globally. Cross-cultural collaboration will facilitate the examination of the cultural boundaries of established theories and the development of universal theories valid and relevant in many cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112448422">Alon, Child, Li &amp; McIntyre, 2011</xref>). Finally, scholars who engage in distance education are advised to focus on more than content delivery but rather to create opportunities for students to develop friendships and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112448422">Jarvenpaa &amp; Leidner, 1999</xref>). While distance education enables students to overcome educational barriers of time and location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1059601112448422">Simonson, Smaldino, Albright, &amp; Zvacek, 2009</xref>), adopting technology to foster student interaction and collaboration is essential to increase student satisfaction and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112448422">Beldarrain, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations and future research directions</title>
<p>Although our study has strong theoretical foundation and adopts both quantitative and qualitative methods, it has several limitations that inform future research directions. First, we examine only two possible costs in team composition: gender diversity and cultural diversity. However, their effects seem rather complex, and it is possible for collaboration teams to transform costs into benefits. Future research can study other potential costs, interaction among different costs, and moderators that facilitate the transformation. For example, as management knowledge rapidly cumulates, we do not know whether age diversity still bears informational benefits or becomes a liability of obsolescent knowledge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601112448422">Chi and colleagues (2009)</xref> found tenure diversity to have a curvilinear relationship with team innovation, moderated by team-oriented human resource practices. Scholars can study these diversity attributes in the academic collaboration context. They can also examine the interaction between gender and cultural diversity. Although our post hoc analysis finds no interaction effects between gender and cultural diversity (β = −0.09, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10), more nuanced studies may be necessary to tease out the joint effect of gender and culture. For example, male professors in certain cultures may have problem working with women from cultures with different role expectations of women and where women may have different behavioral patterns. Further, the fault line literature suggests a detrimental effect when multiple demographic attributes align (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1059601112448422">Polzer et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to demographic factors, future research should examine personal attributes that are particular relevant for success in international arena. Our study has identified the contributing value of cultural intelligence. Related to CQ is the idea of bi-cultural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601112448422">Mok &amp; Morris, 2010</xref>). Those who identify with two or more cultures may be more comfortable and competent in cross-cultural collaboration, including in academic projects.</p>
<p>Besides individual and team factors as moderators that transform costs into benefits, task characteristics and contextual factors can be further explored. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1059601112448422">Rousseau and Aube (2010)</xref> found that task routineness moderated the relationship between self-managing team behaviors and team effectiveness. It is likely that workload divisions can influence task interdependence and in turn influence diversity effects. For example, two scholars contributing to the theory section will have higher task interdependence than will two scholars who are working separately on theory and method.</p>
<p>Second, our study is one of the first to examine international collaboration teams and makes a major move from descriptive case studies to large sample archival data. However, this type of data limits our investigation to a sole focus on team composition and prohibits examining team processes. The input-process-outcome team effectiveness framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601112448422">Mathieu et al., 2008</xref>) suggested team processes such as transition, action, and interpersonal processes can affect team performance, and scholars have rather fruitfully studied team processes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112448422">Cropanzano and colleagues (2011)</xref> found that unit-level perception of justice increased team performance by improving communication, coordination, and mutual team support. Scholars can examine mediation processes in academic collaboration teams, particularly on how scholars resolve conflicts, which may be more common in geographically dispersed teams. Furthermore, the archival dataset also limits our investigation about editor impacts. Perhaps developmentally oriented journal editors are more likely to publish papers by international authors. For example, when authors submit papers with language problems, reviewers may be inclined to reject the papers because the content is obscured by the writing errors. Developmental editors can reduce such frustration by requiring the authors to rectify language problems before sending the papers out for reviews.</p>
<p>Third, our study uses only journal quality as a measure of publication success, yet there may be other measures that better indicate the quality of knowledge international collaboration produces. Presumably, international scholars can contribute to the development of management knowledge about their personal working contexts, and through such research contribute to global management knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1059601112448422">Tsui, 2007</xref>). Future research can examine publication content offered by international collaboration teams. Do they bring management knowledge about novel contexts that would have been unknown without their contributions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1059601112448422">Li, Yao, Sue-Chan, &amp; Xi, 2011</xref>)? Comparing the content of articles by international collaboration research teams with articles by NA, foreign-international, or foreign-domestic authors could reveal the potential benefits of international collaboration in producing new knowledge about novel contexts. Scholars can also examine other outcomes of international collaboration such as author satisfaction and learning.</p>
<p>The archival dataset may have additional limitations. Scholars may wonder whether we have restriction of range if teams without NA scholars avoid submitting to higher-ranking journals. We endeavor to reduce such restriction by including journals with a broad range of impact factors. Furthermore, we lack information about collaborators’ previous interaction histories or length of relationships. The negative effects of surface-level diversity (e.g., gender or cultural diversity) may lessen after team members work together for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601112448422">Harrison et al., 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Understanding how international scholars can publish their efforts successfully is important not only for their career success but also for the universities supporting their activities with financial resources. In this study, we analyze published papers and conduct interviews with the objective of providing preliminary understandings of successful international academic collaborations. The challenges of international collaboration are enormous, and both individual scholars and institutions must work together to realize its potential. We hope that our insights provide guidance to escalate the globalization of NA journals and suggest avenues for future research into enhancing international research collaborations.</p>
