<abstract>
<p>A burner was developed to accommodate multiple opposing premixed flames, where the turbulence stimulated by impingement was found to extend the stability limits of methane/air mixtures. The opposing jets established closed loop flow currents in a number of sectors, which is twice that of the jets thus providing more eddies within a stronger turbulent flame structure. The stagnation zone for four opposing jets was testified to be larger than that for two jets such that it was able to sustain higher reactive jet velocities up to 14.2 m/s at larger flow shearing rates. Increasing the number of opposing jets and decreasing their separation distance provided higher rates of heat/mass transfer into the ports. As the flow deceleration zone was enlarged, the correspondingly higher burning capacities were correlated to the port diameter, the separation distance, the number of jets, Reynolds number, and the strain rate. Strain rates of growing magnitudes up to 13,080 s<sup>−1</sup> were sustained at jet velocities as high as 21.8 m/s. At such velocities and upon increasing the ratio of the jet diameter to the separation distance, the turbulent kinetic energy was found to exhibit one local peak, as the strain rate due to impingement became enriched by the jet radial shearing effects. A lean blowout equivalence ratio of 0.59 was pronounced as a basis for acquiring low NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions. The burner serves as a potential prototype for increasing the power-to-weight ratio of the combustion chambers like those utilized in furnaces, boilers, gas turbines, as well as jet-propelled vehicles with effectively minimized emissions of pollutants.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0957650912457629" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The turbulence and combustion characteristics of opposing jets have extensively been investigated. While the earlier use of jet flames impinging normally onto a solid plate was optimized for the heating purposes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912457629">1</xref></sup> employing two opposing flames revealed more aerodynamic features and higher strain rates such that the distributed reaction zones could sustain turbulent combustion with extensive limits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912457629">2</xref></sup> The intense turbulence development by the normal velocity gradients due to stagnation/aerodynamic blockage was characterized for those flames stabilized in between the two opposing jets (with their corresponding outward flow issuing in a plane normal to the jets). The flow stagnation as well as the heat capturing along the adiabatic plane separating the two opposing jets thus account for the extension in the premixed flame stability limits. In this regard, Yoshida<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912457629">3</xref></sup> obtained a stable flame at a stretch rate 20 times the one which extinguishes the laminar flame due to the turbulence development via the severe velocity gradients that exist along the axis of the opposing jets.</p>
<p>The extension in the flame stability range was, however, stated to reach the saturation limit of the turbulent dissipation at which any further increase in the mixture flow rate would quench reactions. Warnatz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912457629">4</xref></sup> stated that turbulence convects the reactants toward the flame such that excessive convection rates lead to steeper gradients at the flame thus causing larger diffusion losses. By increasing the rates of turbulence generation, the finite rates of chemical kinetics will thus be unable to proceed as fast as the reactants are delivered and the products, including their enthalpy, are removed. In consequence, the flame temperature decreases which further reduces the reaction rates such that a quenching strain rate of 2700 s<sup>−1</sup> was reported for propane/air mixtures.</p>
<p>There was more recent work by Yoshida et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912457629">5</xref></sup> who stimulated turbulent non-premixed combustion in the distributed reaction zone regime by enforcing multiple opposing fuel jets radially inward to be mixed with an air jet issuing vertically upward. Their burner had the feature of low NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions due to the enhanced mixing rates with the consequently reduced local peak temperatures. Their flow configuration, however, did not include mutually impinging flames from the earlier jet development stage (which will be the case for opposing premixed flames). Instead, their non-premixed flame was stabilized by perfectly stirred reactants which are flowing vertically upward before they issue radially outward (upon having impingement onto the burner confining wall) such that the common flame develops beyond the main stagnation zone.</p>
<p>By considering the fundamental aspects revealed from such previous studies, it is stated that additional studies could be done on premixed opposing flames. The interaction of more than two opposing jets has not been fully addressed, where it is proposed that multiple opposing jets will have a larger stagnation zone since larger flow rates are involved (with a resultant flow that emerges normal to the stagnation line of each pair of jets). For instance, when four opposing jets are employed, the impingement of any two opposing jets results in two planar streams which emerge from the stagnation source and confront the other two opposing jets. In consequence, more heat is recycled among the opposing reactive jets where each emerging stream transmits its enthalpy nearby the other two opposing jets. As this additional heat gets trapped within the common reaction kernel, the ability to sustain higher rates of reaction is provided. In addition, the interaction between the emerging jets and the parent jets increases both the strain and the stagnation strength (with more interference expected upon increasing the opposing jets). Such local heat retrieving effect decreases the diffusion losses stated by Warnatz et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912457629">4</xref></sup> since increasing the jet interference retains more enthalpy and enlarges the zone of high temperatures. As the common exhaust stream, in turn, issues vertically in two opposite directions from the common horizontal plane comprising the opposing jets, one side may be confined such that the hot gases are recirculated into the combustion zone (thus increasing the combustion flow residence time there).</p>
<p>Furthermore, adding other opposing pairs of jets involves the interaction with the radial velocity gradients in addition to the axial ones (where most of the works focused on such axial gradients upon keeping a flat flame front at the mid-way between two opposing ports for the purpose of highlighting the referential flame model). It is thus highlighted that multiple opposing jets are an effective mechanism to merge their respective powerful shearing zones in the vicinity of their ports. Johansson and Andersson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912457629">6</xref></sup> stated that the mean rate of the normal strain is important in such stagnating flows due to the highly adverse pressure gradient, whereby a considerable streamline curvature exists. They found that the consequent increase in the maximum turbulent energy from the jet inlet to the stagnation region is about 500%.</p>
<p>The favorable stagnation/jet shearing effects will establish the conditions of flow deceleration zone enlargement, flame attachment to the burner ports, capturing the reactive jet energies, and increase in the residence time. Moreover, retaining one of the two streams exhausted in the vertical plane will maximize the stagnation effects such that the residence times become sufficient for settling the main reaction zone close to the ports. It may thus be possible to extend the turbulent burning limit beyond that dictated by the quenching strain rate (according to Warnatz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912457629">4</xref></sup>) via maximizing the chemical kinetics if sufficiently longer residence times are provided to sustain the extension in the strain rates currently proposed. The operation near the mixture fuel lean limit may be also pronounced as a potential for reduced NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions. This is sustained by the enhancement in the turbulent heat/mass transfer rates to intensify the recirculation of both heat and active species.</p>
<p>It follows that there is a space for developing opposing jet burners to acquire more kinetically favorable conditions. This study is devoted to highlight the features of the multiple opposing flames and to optimize the turbulence role in augmenting the behavior of the counter-flow flames (representing a reactive flow basic configuration, potentially developed to modulate the combustion performance). In this sense, the port diameter and the spacing between the opposing ports together with the number of ports could be optimized in order to control the stagnation zone character and location for maximizing the flow disturbance and the production rates of the turbulence small scales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912457629">2</xref></sup> Such coupling of the aerodynamic features modulates the stability limits of the premixed flames at reduced emission levels.</p>

<p>The sketch for the opposing premixed flames is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912457629">Figure 1(a)</xref>, wherein 12 premixed fuel/air jets flow radially inward with a common central stagnation region. The flow through each port is controlled by a separate valve such that the full closing of some valves varies the number of the opposing jets, [<italic>n</italic>]. Identical delivery pipe lengths and fittings are employed to split the flow symmetrically from the mixture main supply inlet chamber (which is concentrically allocated beneath the burner by getting imbedded into the solid base in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912457629">Figure 1(a)</xref>) such that the jets issue across the individual ports. Typically, the mixture starts flowing outward through 12 equally sized elbow-connectors and is delivered vertically upward through 12 pipes before it turns inward by another set of 12 elbows into the final admission pipes in the form of 12 jets equally distributed along the burner circumference. Accordingly, the burner flow rate is regulated by a single common valve upstream of the main stream inlet chamber, while the individual valves are either closed or fully opened to involve additional pairs of opposing jets. The multiple flames’ zone represents the source for both turbulence and stagnation effects, whereby the flow streams are severely deflected thus giving the chance for vortices to develop. The burner construction details are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912457629">Figure 1(b)</xref> (representing the case of four jets). A chamber of 16.0 cm interior diameter (with a solid base allocated 20.0 cm beneath the opposing jets’ plane) confines the resultant flames. The combustible mixture is latterly supplied through opposing tubes with all diameters, <italic>D</italic> experimentally varying between 5.0 and 10.0 mm. The opposing ports are separated by a distance; <italic>L</italic> that is changing in the range from 1.5 to 12.0 cm. Such ranges tested for the port diameter and the separation distance optimize the extension in the flame stability limits (as dictated by the jet spatial rates of momentum dissipation around the stagnation point). The longitudinal strain rate, <italic>a</italic><sub>s</sub>, for each two opposing jets is first considered according to Naha and Aggarwal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912457629">7</xref></sup> as follows

Since each pair of the opposing jets contributes a strain effect to the overall one pronounced at the common stagnation center (in the multiple jets’ configuration), the fluid element total distortion becomes (<italic>n</italic>/2)[4|<italic>V</italic>|/<italic>L</italic>], which is simply reduced to [2<italic>n</italic>|<italic>V</italic>|/<italic>L</italic>]. In this case, for four opposing jets the longitudinal strain rate along any pair of the opposing jets (due to their axial velocity gradient) is enriched by an equal radial shearing strain rate via interfering with the other two opposing jets.

<p>Two laminar flow-meters with a digital display are utilized to measure the fuel and air total flow rates into the premixing chamber. From the premixing chamber, the mixture is fed into the main supply chamber from which 12 connecting fittings distribute the mixture total flow rate among the 12 opposing ports. Particularly for the case of reducing the solid base displacement from the opposing jets’ plane, the mixture flow across each port is not supposed to be fully developed as substantiated by a length-to-diameter ratio of 15,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912457629">8</xref></sup> while the jet exit Reynolds number has a maximum value of nearly 12,250. The variation in the mixture equivalence ratio, the jet momentum, and the strain rate is employed by regulating the flow rate, the port diameter, the separation distance, and the number of ports. A platinum-13% rhodium/platinum thermocouple with 0.25 mm wire diameter is utilized for measuring the time-averaged flame temperatures, which are corrected for the thermal radiation from the thermocouple bead. For such purpose, the thermal balance of the thermocouple junction is written as follows

<p>A traverse mechanism is utilized for the thermocouple positioning along the measurement plane. A Nikon digital camera with 2560 × 1920 pixels and a shutter speed of 1/4000 s is used to indicate the flame qualitative features. A preliminary test was performed to check the equality of the individual flow rates by alternatively opening one valve (while keeping the other 11 valves closed) to admit the gaseous mixture only through the port in question and record the corresponding burner flow rate. It was found that the differences between the values of the flow rates recorded for the 12 valves fell within the random errors indicated above so as to verify a high degree of confidence for the equality of flow rates.</p>

<p>A numerical simulation was commissioned to reveal the fluid dynamics/turbulence aspects of the investigated flame configuration with the dimensions typically encountered in the experiments. An ANSYS CFX code was utilized to address the velocity field and the turbulence properties for both cold and reacting flow conditions. A CFX mesh was generated for the geometrically built-in model, while a mesh-adaptation procedure was employed to resolve the reactive flow structures at the higher gradient regions. The governing equations comprising the set of elliptical differential equations were solved for mass, momentum, species concentrations, and energy as previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650912457629">14</xref></sup> while a two equation <italic>k–ε</italic> model was used for the turbulence closure.</p>

A unity Lewis number was assumed for all species, such that both turbulent Schmidt and Prandtl numbers were set equal to 0.7.

<sec id="sec5-0957650912457629"><title>Comparison between two and four opposing jets via flow computations and visualization</title>
<p>While two opposing jets stimulate more turbulence and higher strain rates than a conventional single Bunsen flame, the superiority of the multiple opposing flames (starting with four) is substantiated by their enlarged stagnation zones as numerically predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The streamlines near the stagnation zone for four opposing jets are exposed to severe deflection, whereby the flow is split across a number of sectors (A–H) that is twice the number of jets. Since each jet flows centrally inward, there is an equal source flow (issuing radially outward in the same plane and spherically in 3D) such that the stagnation zones develop opposite to the parent jets in the common region where the source flow and the sink flow both have the same momentum. As the source flow streams evolve from such common region, they are deflected by the parent jets before they turn back to their origin along closed loops, while each parent jet is decelerated upon impingement (such that its streams are deflected on both sides to have a planar symmetrical pattern). The resultant global flow subsequently issues from the common impingement zone both upward and downward (as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(b)</xref> across a vertical plane comprising two opposing jets). The downward streams are reflected from the burner base and interfere with all jet flames (to simultaneously heat and dilute the fresh mixtures) before they merge with the upward flow. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(b)</xref> thus testifies to the repeatable flow impingement between the jet admission and the exhaust gas discharge.
<fig id="fig2-0957650912457629" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Conceptual fluid dynamic features of opposing jets: (a) computed streamlines for four opposing jets; (b) representative flow division/recirculation; (c) representative streamlines for four opposing jets; and (d) representative streamlines for two opposing jets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912457629-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Herein, the flame final temperature along each jet is unaffected but the region of high temperatures in front of each port moves closer to the port from one side and extends toward the impingement center from the other side by combining with the opposing jet high temperatures. The consequent local temperature rise which overrides the associated reactant dilution thus sustains an increased burning capacity. This resembles the techniques of maximizing the heat recirculation in the reverse flow configurations (such as those incorporating swirl or sudden expansion) to assist the flame stability, with the additional feature of modulating the heat intensity by currently adjusting the number of jets, their separation distance, and diameters.</p>
<p>The combination of the centrally emerging source flow and the deflected parent jets indicates such closed loop streams redrawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(c)</xref> (to clarify the main stream reflection via the representative sectors) showing an opposing flow character along each parent jet axis. These reverse flow patterns establish a basis for eight developing eddies with increased velocity gradients that are believed to sustain great turbulence strengths for four opposing jets (as discussed later). Since two symmetrically deflected streams issue from the point of impact between the source and the sink flow along each parent jet axis (such as the point P1), these deflected streams develop additional stagnation points (such as the point P2) by confronting the deflected streams from the neighboring jets. Such subsequent jet confrontation on the periphery of the common circle, in turn, enforces the flow radially both inward and outward. The outward flow represents the 45° parent jet reflection line, while the inward flow centrally penetrates and merges with the other main streams to develop closed loop currents (shown as four clockwise and four counter-clockwise groups inside equal 45° sectors for the whole interaction between the four parent jets). More opposing jets will result in more symmetrical sectors and hence more close interference between the shearing streams.</p>
<p>Since there is less flow deflection associated with only two opposing jets, the corresponding streamlines are sketched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(d)</xref>, whereby the comparison shows that each vortical flow sector for two opposing jets are doubled with four opposing jets. Subsequently, for equal stagnation zone sizes the total path elapsed by the flow is elongated by about 50% (as each sector in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(d)</xref> is split in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(c)</xref> into two sectors such that their representative triangles totally have two sides in excess of four original sides). Inasmuch as the stagnation zone for four opposing jets is actually larger (by the higher source flow rate involved) and since the parent jet outer deflection path in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(d)</xref> roughly seems doubled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(c)</xref>, the reactant flow path is expected to increase by more than 50%. Not only are there supplementary reaction times by such path elongation to sustain higher burning capacities, but also the reactants get closer to the high temperatures of the neighboring mutually supported flames (with more heat recirculation to enhance the chemical kinetics).</p>
<p>The comparative sizes of the vortical flow sectors predicted for both two and four opposing jets were experimentally indicated by spraying heated oil droplets into the plane of either two or four opposing jets as a tracing technique for the flow currents predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(c)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">d</xref>). For four opposing jets, a droplet sequence of movement is noticed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650912457629">Figure 3</xref> (from images A to F), super-imposed by the main streamline detected for the droplet motion to confirm the 45° reflection paths predicted above. As the experiment was repeated for two opposing jets, the flow deflection path was noticed within a nearly 90° sector in agreement with the one pronounced from computations.

<sec id="sec6-0957650912457629"><title>Flame structure verification for four opposing jets (computations and experiments)</title>
<p>The features highlighted above are supported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912457629">Figure 4(a)</xref> (wherein the flame thermal structure satisfies the ignition temperatures close to the ports). Identical conical flame structures are manifested by thick temperature envelopes with the temperature range 1700 °C–1900 °C. The overlap between the temperature contours and the flow main vortices reflects the intensified turbulent reaction regions close to the common center of impingement, whereby the spread out of such high temperature levels pronounces flames that are attached to the ports. There is an excellent agreement between the computations and the experiments regarding the flame location, whereas a satisfactory agreement exists for the flame structure (except for the temperature levels and the reaction zone thickness). In this case, lower peak temperatures and thicker reaction zones with more homogeneous temperatures were experimentally obtained (as typically attributed to the severe turbulence effects which were not all pronounced by the computations). The thermal interaction of the parent jet fresh mixture with the reacting streams issuing from the stagnation zone is inferred from the horizontal plane representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912457629">Figure 4(b)</xref>). The common stagnation zone reflects each parent jet (as represented by a large flow arrow) into two streams (as indicated by small arrows). Each reflected stream is stretched around a parent jet in a vortical flow pattern thus pronouncing the regions (A–H). As these regions significantly enhance the heat retrieval and the flame stabilization, they attribute for the flame allocation close to the port. Such effect becomes highly pronounced as more opposing jets (shown later) are involved with a smaller separation distance, since the resulting pressure of impingement (dominating across a larger spherical zone) will approach the ports further. This is supported by the computations of Johansson and Andersson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912457629">6</xref></sup> who found that (for two opposing jets of 2 cm diameter and 20 cm separation distance) a separation bubble of 8 cm diameter develops in the stagnation region with a peak pressure of nearly 70 Pa. The subsequent influence of the stagnation pressure on the flow development near the ports in their work is currently reproduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912457629">Figure 5(a)</xref> when the separation distance is decreased to 9 cm (with <italic>X</italic>  = 45 mm from the port to the impact point where the pressure reaches a peak of 154 Pa). Such high pressure created at the stagnation hump develops concentric pressure zones for disturbing the potential cores of the opposing jets which become decelerated to such an extent that depends on the opposing jets’ momentum and spacing parameters.

<p>In response to such pressure field which propagates outward, the streamlines for two opposing jets are deflected around the stagnation zone into two aligned streams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912457629">Figure 5(b)</xref>) as confronted by the high pressure developing there, while the stagnation zone for four jets gets a duplicated structure of primary vortices. The stagnation zone is enlarged from size (1) through size (2) to size (3), as denoted by the corresponding numbers in the sketch, by increasing the velocities of the opposing jets as well as by decreasing their separation distance. The original and the duplicated structures are coupled in the 3D vortical pattern for four jets since the vertical plane structure resembles the original one for two jets while the doubled vortices appear in the horizontal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650912457629">Figure 6(a)</xref>). It is shown that as four jets are set in an opposing configuration there are four original vortices in the <italic>Y–Z</italic> plane (as a result of the mutual impact between jets no. 1 and 3) and other four original vortices in the <italic>X–Z</italic> plane (that correspond to the interaction between jets no. 2 and 4). Moreover, the duplication of the number of jets in the horizontal plane <italic>X–Y</italic> pronounces eight vortices. The additional number of the vertical plane structures with four jets extends the flow path elongation calculated above. The combustion zone may thus be represented by an upper and a lower Bunsen flames (with the upper one getting more longitudinal stretch due to buoyancy). The vertical planes’ vortices in the upper half (which comprises the upper Bunsen flame envelope) together with the horizontal plane vortices in the left side are highlighted by a thicker line style to clarify the 3D nature. The lower exhaust stream subsequently impinges onto the burner bottom wall, while the upper stream directly flows upward. The computed stream function values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650912457629">Figure 6(b)</xref>) confirm the exhaust gas reflection from the bottom wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(b)</xref>) where the interference with the parent jets supports the extension in the flame stability that is currently proposed. It is shown that downstream from each impingement position the streams follow divergent paths as a well-known character for the flow development from the stagnation points. As the next impingement station is approached, the main velocity component subsequently developing in the perpendicular flow direction is again dispersed in a divergent flow path fashion.
<fig id="fig6-0957650912457629" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>The complicated nature of the 3D flow: (a) 3D vortical structure for four opposing jets and (b) flow reversal across the vertical plane.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912457629-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Those streamlines diverting 90° for two jets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912457629">Figure 5(b)</xref> are expected to decelerate the other two jets in the four opposing jets’ configuration while the subsequent enlargement in the stagnation bump extends the stability limits by accommodating higher reactive jet velocities. Since the corresponding stagnation pressures are thus higher,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650912457629">17</xref></sup> the flame stabilization zone is enlarged further. With more opposing jets, the overall bump expands furthermore due to the additional stagnation source flow imposed on that shown by Munson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650912457629">18</xref></sup> Consequently, there is a greater chance to stabilize flames at higher burning rates since the stagnation zones will move outward closer to the ports and deflect the reactive jets within smaller horizontal sectors. Regarding another aspect, increasing the number of the merged TKE peaks maximizes their common peak and increases the resultant flow strain. Such effects significantly attribute for the enhanced flame speeds by the multiple opposing jets (relative to the conventional two opposing jets) as the higher turbulent transfer rates of the heat and the active species extend their kinetic limits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650912457629">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the light of the temperature/velocity overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912457629">Figure 4(a)</xref>), some probable paths horizontally experienced by the reacting streams of one parent jet are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912457629">Figure 7(a)</xref>. They include the streams which are directly deflected 45° inside the first sector, in case (a), and those which are partially or entirely mixed within four successive primary vortices across half a circle, in cases (b) to (f). There are other probable paths pertaining to the streams which complete more loops within eight vortices across a full circle, but case (f) is considered the most probable one to represent the average time scale, whereby the streams travel to the opposite parent jet side. Such representative path indicates the time elongation as denoted by the corresponding number of flow stations (1–10). Cases (d) to (f) substantiate that some reactive mass portions are transported between the neighboring jets for experiencing the heat capturing. In all cases, the heating takes place at all jet sides for raising the reaction temperatures to the levels that are liable for the flame speed enhancement as well as the burner fuel lean operation. Depending on the jets’ spacing, their diameter and velocity, the opposing jets may be combusted in a well-distributed reaction zone with the temperature profiles flattened into reduced peaks to maintain low thermal NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> formation rates.
<fig id="fig7-0957650912457629" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Chemical kinetics and reaction times: (a) flow path elongation for four opposing jets and (b) computed relative reaction rates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912457629-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A further insight is gained by plotting the local reaction rates (relative to those of two opposing jets) as the isotherms overlap the fuel concentrations. For a unity Lewis number, any temperature increase for the fresh mixture by duplicating the opposing jets involves fuel concentration dilution by an equal percent. Inspecting the subsequent Arrhenius reaction rate magnitudes pronounces various degrees of relative increase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912457629">Figure 7(b)</xref> for 4 opposing flames. In this sense, each additional pair of jets contributes an additional overriding temperature increase as the reactants were proven in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912457629">Figure 7(a)</xref> to stay most of the time in the burner central region (where the maximum temperatures prevail). The increased reaction rates, the path elongation, and the stagnation zone enlargement all contribute to higher fuel consumption rates (as shown later).</p>

<sec id="sec7-0957650912457629"><title>Flame visualization, recorded stability limits, and strain rates for four opposing jets</title>
<p>By starting the experimental runs with a stoichiometric mixture issuing through four opposing ports of 10.0 mm diameter, attached flames were noticed to persist at an average jet velocity of 1.1 m/s for separation distances, <italic>L</italic> as large as 12.0 cm. The flames were thus buoyancy-dominated with weak mutual interference. Upon decreasing the separation distance down to 8.0 cm, more interference developed between the opposing jets by having their exhaust streams merged with each other. By increasing the stretch rate further, it was possible to combust the reactive jets at an average velocity as high as 14.2 m/s with 4.0 cm separation distance whereby the calculated strain rate was 2840 s<sup>−1</sup>. The corresponding quadruple flow rate thus indicates a large burning capacity increment which highlights the features of the multiple jets’ configurations.</p>
<p>With such high velocity and small jet diameters, the steeper velocity gradients prevailing across each jet strengthen the turbulence intensities due to impingement thus sustaining higher reaction rates. In consequence, at large separation distances longitudinally stretched flames exist; whereas at low separation distances and higher strain rates the flamelets develop into a thick turbulent flame brush. This is typically revealed from the qualitative results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912457629">Figure 8</xref>). As noticed in image (a), the four jets impinge with a cross-fashion appearance and establish a turbulent region for the four flames to be stabilized at an average jet velocity of 2.89 m/s with a separation distance of 8 cm. The potential cores of each two opposing jets nearly merge with each other at the common stagnation center such that high rates of momentum dissipation are encountered there. As supported by Konnov et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957650912457629">20</xref></sup> the high temperature and the large OH concentration regions in this case expand and hence activate reactions along the extended flow paths.

<sec id="sec8-0957650912457629"><title>Highlighting the dimensional effects on the stability limits for four opposing jets</title>
<p>As the separation distance was reduced to 4.0 cm, the turbulence intensities increased such that a mixture average jet velocity of 14.2 m/s could be recorded (with a more homogeneous violet flame brush spreading all over the stagnation region and slightly wrapping around the nozzle tips in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912457629">Figure 8(b)</xref>). Such flame wrapping confirms the stagnation zone enlargement which enforces the hot gases back toward their ports thus providing an effective mechanism of heat recirculation. The corresponding flame vertical expansion can be noticed from the side-viewed image (c). It is thus said that the current burner couples the turbulence generation with the extended flame stability limits where the flame stability is enhanced by turbulence, while the increased combustion intensities promote further turbulence generation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957650912457629">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>There was a slight decrease in the stable flame maximum flow velocity to 13.3 m/s upon decreasing the separation distance to 1.5 cm. This was attributed to the turbulence suppression by having the integral length scale decreased as the ports got very close to each other such that the largest eddy size became limited. This could override the favorable increase in the heat recirculation by the increase in the flame wrapping around the nozzle tips. On the other hand, by decreasing the port diameter, <italic>D</italic> to 5.0 mm; those combusting flow rates persisting at the 4.0 cm separation distance were reduced to a maximum of 9.8 m/s. This occurred because the smaller diameter jets had their potential cores completely disturbed by the radial velocity gradients closer to the ports (before reaching the common impact point) such that the reduced impingement normal velocity gradients did not produce sufficiently powerful turbulence. The maximum mixture velocity became also limited by approaching the quenching diameter for methane/air flames. It follows that there is a governing relationship between the port diameter and the separation distance for stable flames as the turbulence role is optimized at the larger ratios of the port diameter to the separation distance.</p>

<p>A maximum turbulence limit was, however, declared by Warnatz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912457629">4</xref></sup> when excessive turbulence renders the finite chemical kinetics unable to generate products as fast as the reactants are delivered and the products, including their enthalpy, are removed.

However, as combustion approaches the regime of a distributed reaction zone whereby (<italic>Le</italic>) tends to unity, such effects may no longer exist.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the Lewis number effects, there should be a potential for breaking such turbulent strain limit by extending the kinetic limit through the residence time maximization (which currently exists via the path elongation, the flow reversal, and the stagnation zone enlargement). It is also aided by the flame stretch discussed by Bradley.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0957650912457629">33</xref></sup> According to the turbulent flame speeds reported by Turns,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650912457629">19</xref></sup> the currently enhanced burning capacity may be proved to lie in the flamelets-in-eddy regime.

<sec id="sec10-0957650912457629"><title>The burner lean operation</title>
<p>Since any stagnation plane was said to be adiabatic due to the symmetry, the lean mixture combustion was currently achievable by capturing the enthalpy along each opposing jets’ pair and by the flame wrapping around the nozzles (which were noticed to be glowing). At a currently sustained lean equivalence ratio limit of 0.61 (slightly above the normal value of 0.55 for the methane/air mixtures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957650912457629">34</xref></sup>), the flame envelopes were similar to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912457629">Figure 4(a)</xref>, but with lower temperatures. A maximum temperature of 1580 K was restricted to a central small region.

<sec id="sec11-0957650912457629"><title>The TKE production (k–ε turbulence model results)</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650912457629">Figure 9(a)</xref>, maximum TKEs of 0.88 m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup> were computationally detected close to the ports (for promoting the flame stability).

A corresponding peak turbulence eddy dissipation rate of 40.2 m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>3</sup> was found close in location to the maximum TKE. Such turbulence intensities dramatically influence the flame properties via the strain rates upon getting strongly enforced. This was revealed by Mastorakos et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957650912457629">22</xref></sup> who found that both the axial and the radial velocity fluctuations increase due to the strain associated with the stagnation.

<p>More details of the opposing jets’ development and their turbulent combustion characteristics are computationally clarified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650912457629">Figure 9(b)</xref> for a stoichiometric mixture average velocity of 14.2 m/s, port diameter and separation distance of 1.0 and 5.0 cm, respectively. The combined displacement of the average temperature and the OH profiles closer to the two opposing ports in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650912457629">Figure 9(b)</xref> indicates enhanced flame stability limits. Two local TKE peaks appear for each jet along its axis (in correspondence to two velocity gradients). Since the higher peak lies closer to the port, it is responsible for the flame attachment whereby the fuel mole fraction, <italic>Y</italic><sub>CH4</sub> diminishes quickly.</p>
<p>According to Mathiew and Scott,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957650912457629">37</xref></sup> the turbulence production regions usually exist near the maximum mean shear where turbulence develops as symptomatic of the mean flow instabilities encountered. The two peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650912457629">Figure 9(b)</xref> hence indicate the radial jet shearing at the port in conjunction with the impingement instability. Depending on how fast the jet potential core shrinks in width before reaching the common center and how fast the turbulence energy diffuses via the vortical paths in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(c)</xref>, there is either a single or a double peak. In the latter case, the velocity rise across the flame sheet multiplies the first peak value nearby the ports while the impinging normal stress allocates the second peak closer to the common center (where the turbulence production rates have a quadratic variation with the strain rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912457629">1</xref></sup>). This case occurs if the turbulence radial dissipation reduces the TKE downstream from its first peak faster than the stagnation turbulent energy upstream diffusion from the central region to the ports; such that two separated peaks exist. If, on the other hand, the TKE enrichment by diffusion overrides its dissipation (when either the jet velocity or the ratio of the port diameter to the separation distance increases), a common peak exists. The normal and the radial velocity gradients are thus coupled as the radial one determines how deep the jet core is circumferentially penetrated to affect the residual axial velocity gradient (which finally determines the maximum TKE of stagnation).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650912457629">Figure 9(c)</xref> compares the non-reactive jet velocity profiles as it changes from 10.5 to 21.0 m/s where the axial velocity gradient increases to a peak of 2100.4 s<sup>−1</sup>. At 21.0 m/s, there is only one turbulence peak; since the stagnation zone enlargement shifts the axial velocity gradient toward the port where it is merged with the radial one thus pronouncing a single peak of 2100.4 s<sup>−1</sup> there. As combustion proceeds at such large strain rates, the fresh mixture parcels are violently broken down to maximize their interfacial area for reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650912457629">19</xref></sup> Stable flames at a jet velocity slightly over 21.0 m/s were currently possible by involving 12 opposing jets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650912457629">Figure 10(a)</xref> image). It is noted that the envelopes of the individual flames are merged around the common stagnation zone with more intensified reaction rates. The subsequently higher velocity gradients allowed the TKE production rates to increase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650912457629">17</xref></sup> As hot gases expand across the flame sheet, they impinge with higher velocities and create higher stagnation pressures than those for non-reacting jets. Inasmuch as a combusting gas source emerges outward from the common impact point,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0957650912457629">38</xref></sup> the developing pressure decelerates each parent jet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650912457629">Figure 10(a)</xref>) as much as it accelerates its outward issuing streams correspondingly diverted 15° per vortical sector. The successive impact against the other opposing jets hence provides a momentum sink for enhanced flame stabilization. The flame stability limits, in turn, expand to the extent of how long the active species remain around the flame kernel for acquiring effective flame growth.

<p>In order to verify such enhanced flame stability of the multiple jets in comparison to two jets, the relative reaction rates were plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0957650912457629">Figure 11</xref> versus the relative time scales elapsed by the average flow (like that encountered by four jets along path (f) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912457629">Figure 7(a)</xref>). The area ratio thus indicates the relative mass burning capacity per jet (to represent the relative extinction velocity through an original port). In spite of the path elongation by involving more than two jets, there is a net time scale reduction dominated by the increased velocity. Since any relative reaction rate increase overrides its corresponding time reduction, the resultant integrated areas for 4, 8, and 12 jets are 3.27, 4.38, and 4.76 times that for 2 jets, respectively. The jet relative burning capacity increase is thus the outcome of the increased reaction rate and the decreased residence time (which, in turn, is the ratio of the elongated path to the increased velocity). In this regard, switching from two to four opposing jets roughly involves flow path elongation to 1.5 times, while the extinction velocity increases to 3.94 times (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0957650912457629">Table 3</xref>). Consequently, if the relative average reaction rate is nearly 8.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0957650912457629">Figure 11</xref>); the fuel consumption rate relatively increases to 8.6 × 1.5/3.94 (to be 3.27 times). This outcome partially attributes for the stability limit increase to 3.94 times (as experimentally obtained).
<fig id="fig11-0957650912457629" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Computed relative burning capacities.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912457629-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The stability limits of 8 and 12 jets (which were experimentally obtained as 5.16 and 6.05 times the 2 jet limit) could be partially attributed similarly by relative integrated areas of 4.38 and 4.76 times, respectively. For 8 jets the path length extends to a relative magnitude of 2.0 (as each sector for 2 jets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(d)</xref> is split into 4 triangular segments thus adding 6 extra sides to 6 original ones) while a similar analysis for 12 jets yields an approximate path elongation to 2.25 times. Since the relative reaction rates are 11.3 and 12.8, respectively, the corresponding outcomes are 4.38 and 4.76 (calculated as 11.3 × 2.0/5.16 and 12.8 × 2.25/6.05) to partially attribute for the relative extinction velocity increments to 5.16 and 6.05 times. The full attribution may be satisfied by considering the stagnation zone enlargement and the time portion elapsed by the reactants within the vertical plane vortical structure which gets duplicated as the number of jets varies. The increased reaction rate spikes with more jets indicate increased turbulent fluctuations as dictated by the more convoluted paths experienced by the flow.</p>
<p>It is apparent that those closed loop currents in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912457629">Figure 2(c)</xref> are the most appropriate centers for augmenting the flow disturbance by severe velocity gradients. Their corresponding large scale periodic flow thus accounts for the annular zones of high TKE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650912457629">Figure 9(a)</xref>) before getting fully developed into smaller scales to sustain higher burning loads.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0957650912457629"><title>Correlating the enhanced burning capacities</title>
<p>In the light of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0957650912457629">Table 3</xref>, the mixture average extinction velocity relative to that for two jets correlates to the product of 0.76 (<italic>n</italic>)<sup>0.39</sup>. Herein, (<italic>n</italic>) stands for the even number of the horizontally opposing jets. The relationship indicates that increasing the pairs of jets introduces more adiabatic planes to intensify the hot gas recirculation into the flames for sustaining higher reaction rates with the aid of the increased turbulence. The change in the extinctive velocity with the jet diameter and the separation distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650912457629">Figure 10(b)</xref>) further extends the correlation to 0.76 <italic>L</italic><sup>−2.297</sup> <italic>D</italic><sup>0.533</sup> [<italic>n</italic>]<sup>0.39</sup> (for <italic>L</italic> ≥ 4.0 cm below which the extinctive velocity decreases).</p>

The formula indicates that a single jet (<italic>n</italic>  = 1) may have laminar flame conditions such that <italic>S</italic><sub>T</sub>/<italic>S</italic><sub>L</sub>  = 1. Based on <italic>S</italic><sub>L</sub> of 0.42 m/s for the stochiometric methane/air mixtures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650912457629">19</xref></sup> the average extinction velocity (for <italic>L</italic>  = 4.0 cm, <italic>D</italic>  = 1.0 cm, and <italic>Y</italic>  = 20.0 cm) is 14.2 m/s and 21.8 m/s for <italic>n</italic>  = 4 and <italic>n</italic>  = 12, respectively. Under such conditions, the strain rates are 2840 and 13,080 s<sup>−1</sup>, while Reynolds number is 9432 and 14,480, respectively. The maximum strain rate gets such very high value of 13,080 s<sup>−1</sup> due to involving the multiplication of the number of jets in the expression for the strain rate (as currently proposed to pronounce the combined strengthening of the normal and the shear stresses in multiple opposing flow arrangements).

<p>A strong connection between this study results and the recent works on mild combustion is highlighted. In this regard, Cavaliere and De Joannon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0957650912457629">39</xref></sup> stated that mild combustion takes place when the reactant flow inlet temperature is higher than the mixture auto-ignition temperature, while due to dilution the maximum allowable temperature increase during combustion is lower than such auto-ignition temperature. Accordingly, in the mild combustion regime the process cannot be sustained without preheating the reactants. Such preheating effect is currently achieved by the flame zone wrapping around the end parts of the mixture admission pipes (which protrude into the burner chamber) and by the heat conducted across the burner solid base to the mixture main supply chamber allocated beneath. The preheating is also fulfilled to some extent by the radiative heat transfer from the burner chamber wall to the mixture vertical delivery pipes aligned in parallel. There are consequent low maximum combustion temperatures that are associated with a flattened temperature field and concentration profiles which, in turn, result in NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> pollution reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0957650912457629">40</xref></sup> Some other features were also highlighted in terms of the noiseless combustion, the energy saving, the fuel type flexibility, and the homogeneous radiative heat transfer (in the boilers and the material treatment industry, for instance) with no confining wall thermal stresses. The mild combustion mode is also very interesting in gas turbine applications, wherein the controlling step of the ignition delay depends on the temperature level in such a way that a longer residence time reduces the ‘no ignition’ zone limits. By opposing a lean fuel/air mixture and a hot flow, the extinction velocity increases with the temperature of the hot flow. The combustion kernel thus shifts toward the stagnation point by increasing the flow velocity, whereas the lower equivalence ratio for stable flames decreases with the hot flow temperature rise. When the combustion kernel overcomes the stagnation point, a deflagration structure no longer exists and the reaction zone is controlled by the diffusion of reactants, where these characteristics were revealed for the consequently turbulent counter-flow flames.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0957650912457629">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>While a detailed study of the NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emission reduction as well as the aerodynamic interference with a supplementary jet normal to the opposing jets’ plane is discussed in another separate work, the current opposing flames can be extended into more innovative applications. A future work may be commissioned to investigate opposing triple flames (which originally have enhanced stability limits and reduced emissions). The flame acoustical excitation is beneficial for further active control, while more passive control may occur with opposing triangular and square ports (via the expected gain in the turbulence energy at the sharp corners). An additional work should highlight the reaction zone diffusion loss effects by burning mixtures of different Lewis number values.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0957650912457629" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The multiple opposing premixed flames involved higher turbulence production rates and an aerodynamically-controlled combustion character with maximized flow blockage and emerging jet enthalpy capturing. The stagnation bump was verified to expand as the opposing jets increased from two to four. The maximum TKE and the eddy dissipation values were found within the impingement zone to support flame stabilization close to the ports. The correspondingly higher strain rates of 2840 s<sup>−1</sup> sustained a burning velocity of 14.2 m/s as supported by vortical flow structures and higher rates of heat/mass transfer within the common impact region. The flame stability limits were extended further to an equivalent flame speed of 21.8 m/s with a strain rate of 13,080 s<sup>−1</sup> for 12 jets so as to break the conventional limit for 2 jets. A lean blowout equivalence ratio of 0.59 was thus sustained.</p>
