<p>A medical device provided with at least a partial surface coating of a thermoplastic copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkylvinylether that is free of crosslinking monomers and curing agents. The fluoropolymer coating is preferably an amorphous thermoplastic, is highly inert and biocompatible, and has elastomeric characteristics that provide desirable mechanical properties such as good flexibility and durability. These characteristics allow the coating to be considered ‘functionally transparent’, because it withstands mechanical deformations required for the assembly, deployment, expansion, and placement of medical devices, without any adverse effect on the mechanical and biological functionality of the coated device. Furthermore, its inertness, derived from the perfluorocarbon structure, contributes to its functionally transparent nature. The coating can be provided with various liquid or solid additives, can be loaded with large quantities of additives including a wide range of therapeutic agents, and has excellent drug elution characteristics when elutable additives are used.</p>

This is advantageous because free radical initiators such as peroxides tend to degrade diene elastomers. In addition, safe handling and mixing of peroxides can be difficult for rubber compounders. The grafted diene elastomer produced has improved adhesion to substrates, for example, reinforcing cords and fabrics used as reinforcement in rubber articles such as tires.</p>

<p>Esters of cyclohexane polycarboxylic acids are used as plasticizers for polyvinyl chloride to enable products with comparable mechanical properties to be obtained using less polyvinyl chloride. Use of these esters also produces formulations with increased stability to ultraviolet light, improved low temperature properties, lower viscosity and improved processability, as well as reduced smoke on burning. The esters of cyclohexane polycarboxylic acids may be used alone or in admixture with other plasticizers when the esters of cyclohexane polycarboxylic acids may act as viscosity depressants. Fast fusing plasticizers may also be included. The formulations are particularly useful in the production of a range of goods from semirigid to highly flexible materials and are particularly useful in the production of medical materials such as blood bags and tubing.</p>

<p>A process for the manufacture of a plastic part comprises providing a polymer, heating the polymer, introducing a gas or supercritical fluid into the polymer, mixing the polymer and the gas to produce a first melt, extruding the first melt, pelletizing the extruded first melt to form pellets, transforming the pellets into a second melt, and molding the second melt to form the plastic part. In pelletizing the first melt, individual cells of gas are included in the resulting pellets. Before the cells can nucleate, the polymer is solidified to keep the gas contained therein. After the polymer is pelletized, the pellets are considered to be unfoamed. In molding the second melt to form the plastic part, nucleation of the cells is initiated through favorable process conditions and/or additional cell nucleating agents, thereby resulting in the second melt being foamed. </p>

<p>The present invention improves the low temperature endurance of a thermoplastic elastomer composition comprising a polyamide resin and a modified rubber. A thermoplastic elastomer composition which comprises a polyamide resin and a modified rubber having an acid anhydride group or an epoxy group, characterized in that the modified rubber having an acid anhydride group or an epoxy group is modified with a secondary amine. The secondary amine is preferably a compound having a structural formula R1-NH-R2 (In the formula, R1 is a C1-30 straight chain alkyl group, and R2 is a C1-30 hydrocarbon group or a C1-30 hydrocarbon group having a hydroxyl group, a sulphonyl group, a carbonyl group, or an ether linkage.).</p>
