<abstract>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of on-duty death among U.S. firefighters among whom volunteers comprise 71% of the fire service. We sought to understand CVD risk among volunteer firefighters and to develop a CVD intervention based on their input. To accomplish these aims, we conducted a series of focus groups with volunteer firefighters and firefighters who serve with volunteers in Maryland. We conducted two additional focus groups with fire service leaders. Ninety-eight people participated in 15 focus groups. Participants discussed health and wellness, stress and the demanding nature of the volunteer fire service, and the challenges associated with healthy eating. They talked about food in the firehouse and the lack of quick, healthy, satisfying, and affordable food. Several suggestions for interventions to improve the food environment and firefighters’ ability to choose and prepare healthy meals and snacks emerged. An intervention reflecting the participants’ recommendations resulted. The way volunteer firefighters understand health and wellness and the specific factors that influence their food intake are valuable insights for addressing CVD risks in this population. To our knowledge, this is the first study that systematically brings firefighters into the process of developing an intervention to reduce CVD risk among this high-risk population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Firefighters are the first responders to fires, medical emergencies, traffic-related crashes, and other catastrophic events. Currently, there are 1.1 million firefighters in the United States; 71% of them are volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912461150">Karter, 2010</xref>). Firefighting is widely recognized as a demanding and perilous occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912461150">Carey, Al-Zaiti, Dean, Sessanna, &amp; Finnel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912461150">Fahy, LeBlanc, &amp; Molis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912461150">Kunadharaju, Smith, &amp; DeJoy, 2011</xref>) that results in approximately 100 on-duty deaths each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912461150">Karter, 2010</xref>). Despite the physical demands of firefighting, there is a high prevalence of sedentary lifestyles, obesity, hyperlipidemias, and hypertension among both paid and volunteer firefighters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912461150">Kales, Soteriades, Christophi, &amp; Christiani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912461150">Poston et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912461150">Scanlon &amp; Ablah 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912461150">Soteriades, Smith, Tsismenakis, Baur, &amp; Kales, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912461150">Soteriades, Targino, et al., 2011</xref>). Because of these risks, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of all on-duty firefighter deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912461150">Soteriades, Smith, et al., 2011</xref>). Approximately 90% of CVD-related deaths result specifically from coronary heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912461150">Kales et al., 2007</xref>). Poor nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912461150">Wirt &amp; Collins, 2009</xref>) and physical inactivity are important modifiable risk factors for CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912461150">Tremblay, Colley, Saunders, Healy &amp; Owen, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1524839912461150">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Despite the burden of CVD risks in this high-risk population, our review of the literature identified few interventions. One initiative, the PHLAME (Promoting Healthy Lifestyles: Alternative Models’ Effects) study, aimed to increase physical activity and improve dietary intake among paid firefighters through an education-oriented intervention and demonstrated improvements in fruit and vegetable consumption and general well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912461150">Elliot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912461150">Elliot et al., 2007</xref>). To reach members of the volunteer fire service, the National Volunteer Fire Council implemented the Heart-Healthy Firefighter Program in 2003 to raise awareness regarding heart attack prevention. The program has provided more than 16,000 health screenings to firefighters and offers tools and resources to mitigate risk factors for heart disease (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthy-firefighter.org/">http://www.healthy-firefighter.org/</ext-link>). Firefighters are eager for more information and look to their departments for help with addressing their CVD risk as evidenced by a survey of New York volunteer firefighters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912461150">Scanlon &amp; Ablah, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Effective, evidence-based interventions to address CVD risk among volunteer firefighters are needed. Volunteer stations tend to have fewer resources than paid stations and thus are likely to have fewer health promotion resources to offer their members. In addition, the existing literature on firefighter CVD risks includes a limited number of studies with volunteer firefighters. To address this gap in intervention research, we developed and implemented an intervention with volunteer firefighters to address cardiovascular risks. As the initial step in developing the intervention, we drew on the community-based participatory research literature that supports obtaining community input for intervention research. We conducted focus groups with firefighters to understand their perspectives on health and wellness and cardiovascular risk factors related to food and physical activity. In addition, we wanted to learn from them what general interventions and strategies could improve health and mitigate cardiovascular risk factors among volunteer firefighters.</p>
<p>We did not approach the focus groups with a preconceived idea of what interventions would work or with a theoretical framework to guide data collection. Instead, we used the focus group format to create an opportunity to hear from the firefighters about their thoughts on health and wellness and their ideas for what kind of support would help them adopt a healthier lifestyle. With the benefit of such insight, we could then look to the literature to develop a theoretically sound intervention that truly began in the community of volunteer firefighters who would be the ultimate users and beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Here we report findings from the first phase of this research in which we conducted focus groups with volunteer firefighters and firefighters who serve with volunteers to understand their perspectives on health and wellness and to solicit suggestions for how to reduce CVD risks related to food and activity. The second aim of this article is to describe how the focus group data informed the intervention design and offer this approach as a strategy for using community-based participatory research principles to inform intervention development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1524839912461150" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We conducted a series of focus groups to address our study aims. Using focus groups to inform program development is a recognized application of qualitative research methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912461150">Krueger &amp; Casey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1524839912461150">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>We selected Maryland as the site for this research for convenience. The state is accessible to the study team, and the design required us to be in the field for all three phases of the study. Fire stations were eligible for inclusion if they were staffed primarily by volunteer firefighters or, in one case, provided access to a priority population and were located in any of Maryland’s 23 counties. Fire stations in Baltimore City were ineligible since their firefighters are paid. Because we aimed to understand how to develop a health promotion intervention among volunteer firefighters, we primarily sought participants from the volunteer firefighting community. However, paid firefighters, when part of combination stations that have volunteer and paid firefighters, were welcome to participate since they are a part of the volunteer fire culture.</p>
<p>We sought a sample that also included participants from different segments of the state’s volunteer fire service. We identified eligible stations using both convenience sampling (21 stations identified by our partner) and purposeful sampling (16 additional stations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912461150">Richards &amp; Morse, 2007</xref>) to assure inclusion of all regions within the state, and underrepresented populations within the fire service (women and African Americans). We invited each of the 37 selected fire stations to participate in a focus group about health and wellness. Two additional focus groups were arranged with fire service leaders, one at the national level and a second within Maryland, to learn about any systemic barriers and facilitators, general policies, and cultural factors related to CVD and health and wellness. Participants in these leadership groups were identified using purposeful sampling techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912461150">Richards &amp; Morse, 2007</xref>). The national group included individuals from a health and safety committee for volunteer firefighters, whereas the state group included individuals generally recognized as fire service leaders within Maryland. We sought to achieve data saturation though this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912461150">Richards &amp; Morse, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839912461150">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>One or two coauthors, who have extensive focus group research experience, facilitated each of the focus groups using a focus group guide developed by the study team through an iterative process. Our team included people with expertise in nutrition, behavioral health, occupational health, qualitative methods, and the fire service. Categories of questions included the following: beliefs about health, wellness, and fitness; current policies and programs in place related to firefighter health, wellness, and fitness; factors that hinder and facilitate intervention success; and suggestions for promoting health and wellness among firefighters. The focus group guide served as a general roadmap for facilitators but was not administered verbatim. A third coauthor assisted with data collection, which included a brief, self-administered, anonymous, demographic questionnaire. With participants’ permission, sessions were digitally recorded and transcribed by a professional transcription service. Participants were offered $20 for their contributions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839912461150">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>A research assistant compared each transcript against the corresponding recording and corrected the transcripts when differences between the recording and transcript were found. The validated transcripts were then uploaded into NVivo 8 for coding and analysis. After reviewing the transcripts repeatedly, we developed a coding dictionary based on the general topics discussed during the focus groups and the transcript content. Two coauthors double coded a subset of the transcripts to compare their use of the codes and to clarify code definitions. One of the coders was involved with developing the interview guide; the second coder was not involved with that process. Based on this initial coding, we revised the coding dictionary and used the revision to code the remaining transcripts.</p>
<p>We used the coded data to examine, across the groups, the content of the dialogue on recurring topics. This phase of the analysis assessed the frequency of feedback on particular topics and the importance of those topics to participants. We assessed importance based on the amount of time participants talked about an issue, the presence of an issue across groups, and whether participants emphasized particular points when discussing the issues they raised. We also stratified the data by all volunteer compared with combination paid/volunteer stations to determine if distinct patterns were present.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839912461150">
<title>Focus Group Validation</title>
<p>Our team reviewed and discussed the results of the data analysis and developed a summary report to present back to the leadership at participating fire stations. The summary report included findings from the focus groups and the resulting recommendations for interventions, as well as a few suggested interventions from the study team.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839912461150">
<title>Application to Intervention Planning</title>
<p>We used both the coded focus group transcripts and the feedback from the fire stations during the validation process to inform our intervention planning. Specifically, we reviewed coded dialogue that pertained to participants’ comments about interventions and incentives to improve health and wellness and organized those data within the different topics explored during the focus groups. Feedback from fire service leadership directly guided the components of the intervention; those basic components were refined by relevant theory and evidence to produce the intervention we ultimately fielded.</p>
<p>The institutional review board at The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health reviewed and approved this research.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Twelve of the 37 stations we contacted that expressed interest and were able to schedule a focus group within our timeline (August through December 2009) were included. The leaders who agreed took responsibility for notifying members about the focus groups. Most focus groups were scheduled to occur immediately before or after the monthly membership meetings to optimize participation and convenience for interested participants. We conducted 15 focus groups, 2 with fire service leadership and 13 with firefighters, for a total of 98 participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912461150">Table 1</xref>). The largest group included 12 participants, whereas the smallest group included 3. The focus groups ranged in length from 19 to 85 minutes; on average the focus groups lasted 40 minutes. Most participants (88%) described their fire service careers as either all volunteer (77%) or as divided between volunteer and paid positions (11%). Two focus groups occurred within the same fire department because two priority populations—African Americans and women—were well represented in the department’s membership and had organized themselves into groups that met separately from their departments. The 11 remaining groups comprised the firefighters who were available to participate at the designated time the focus groups were scheduled; these groups were not stratified based on demographics or other characteristics. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839912461150">Table 2</xref> summarizes participants’ characteristics.</p>

<title>Beliefs about Health and Wellness</title>
<p>Regardless of whether they perceived themselves to be healthy or not, participants generally had opinions about the role of food and activity in healthy living. Participants were often quick to tell us they were not eating well or exercising enough, and described the fire service lifestyle as one challenge to making improvements in diet and exercise. The most salient issue expressed across groups with regard to the fire service lifestyle was stress. Some described stress in the context of needing to respond at a moment’s notice to an emergency, but the more common sentiment was that the demanding nature of modern life makes healthy living difficult to prioritize. These beliefs were described in focus groups at both volunteer and combination stations, although there was a recognition that for volunteer firefighters, demands include managing their fire service commitment in addition to their “day jobs,” which may or may not be connected to the fire service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1524839912461150">
<title>On Food</title>
<p>There is wide variation in the extent to which cooking and eating occurs at firehouses where our participants work. We heard about firehouses where regular, shared meals cooked at the firehouse are commonplace (typically the combination stations). Firefighters also described firehouses where crews eat at home, bring takeout to the firehouse, go to fast-food restaurants, or rely on snacks from the commissary and vending machines (more typical of all volunteer departments). Regardless of where participants fell on this spectrum, they described their food options as limited, and often unhealthy. The challenging food environment included the larger community (fast-food restaurants provide easy access and in some places the only local hot-food option) and the firehouse, where commissaries and vending machines include many unhealthy choices and resources for healthy cooking are scarce. Participants also mentioned snacking opportunities as a challenge: Donuts or other kinds of “buns” and pizza are often available, free, and hard to resist. In the words of one participant, “healthy types of food are not as available as unhealthy food.”</p>
<p>Although several groups favorably described occasional healthy eating classes offered at the stations that provide useful information about diet and nutrition, they also described these classes as limited because they do not address the challenges of the food environment. Such classes did little to counter the seemingly endless supply of unhealthy options in the immediate and surrounding environments.</p>
<p>Many of our participants described the combination of their stressful lifestyles and the unhealthy food options in the environment as a particular challenge, and one that should be considered in efforts to intervene to promote healthy eating. Volunteers, in particular, struggle to manage their day jobs, personal lives, and fire service responsibilities. In the words of one participant, “Ninety percent of us, we burn the candle at both ends. And we eat late. We don’t eat the right stuff because we eat at quick places just because it’s short, simple, and quick.”</p>
<p>Our focus groups revealed that firefighters are price sensitive. Decisions about what to prepare and what to eat were often described to us as driven by what is on sale because of the need to feed many hungry people on a limited budget. One participant described being able to prepare a low-cost meal as a “badge of honor” within the fire service. Healthy foods were generally perceived as more expensive, more complicated, and less filling than the sale steaks and spaghetti dinners described to us. We heard overwhelmingly from participants that the firefighter lifestyle influences their food choices that need to be fast, filling, cheap, and tasty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524839912461150">
<title>On Fitness</title>
<p>There is wide variation among firehouses with regard to access to fitness equipment and the quality of that equipment. Some focus groups described state-of-the-art fitness machines in their departments whereas others described equipment that was dated and/or broken, or not available on site. Access to exercise equipment was how most of our discussions about exercise began, and it dominated the fitness portion of many groups. Some focus groups included talk about organized sports or competitions as an exercise strategy, but there were few examples of organized sports or drills cited. More than with discussions about healthy eating, participants emphasized the role of personal motivation in increasing physical activity and offered fewer suggestions for how to effectively intervene to promote physical activity among volunteer firefighters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1524839912461150">
<title>Intervening to Promote Healthy Eating</title>
<p>As a result of the emphasis among participants on healthy eating interventions, the intervention we developed and fielded focused on food. Participants communicated they were aware of their health status and emphasized the importance of developing an intervention that provides some combination of tools, skills, and resources to improve their health. Specific suggestions reflected the holistic nature of the discussions about interventions and considered strategies at the individual, worksite, and community levels. For example, participants suggested labeling healthy food options in the commissaries and vending machines. The model of the self-service hotel dining room where juice machines, fresh fruit, and cereal are available 24/7 was discussed in one group. Most often, participants talked about the importance of educating firefighters so they can make informed food choices. Offering sessions on how to shop for and prepare a healthy meal quickly, which would be both satisfying and affordable, would be of interest to the volunteers, according to our participants. A full list of the food intervention suggestions offered by participants is included as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524839912461150">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>Our participants also suggested strategies for improving uptake of an intervention. Many participants emphasized the importance of leadership to fire service culture and explained that leaders’ support for any health and wellness program would be critical to obtaining buy-in from frontline firefighters. The influence of authority does have limits, however. Participants cautioned against mandating a health and wellness initiative (expressing concern that people will resist) and emphasized the importance of individuals’ willingness to commit to healthy living as an essential element of any intervention’s success.</p>
<p>Participants also described competition as a strategy that could be used to increase participation in an intervention and suggested that prizes could serve to incentivize participation.</p>

<title>Validation Process</title>
<p>Feedback from participating fire stations both confirmed our initial decision to focus on food and eliminated certain intervention approaches included in the summary document. Nine of the 12 leaders indicated their stations’ interest in participating in the pilot intervention.</p>

<sec id="section15-1524839912461150">
<title>Resulting Intervention</title>
<p>We developed and fielded a pilot intervention that incorporated an ecological orientation consistent with how participants described food and health, and interventions to promote healthy eating (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524839912461150">Table 3</xref>). We use the word <italic>ecological</italic> here to describe a holistic view of the issue. Participants explained food not only as an individual matter but also as something that is influenced by their home and family, the fire station and their fire colleagues, as well as the larger community in which they live and work. Anthropometric measures (height, weight, waist circumference, body mass index, body fat percentage), biological measures (glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure), counseling sessions at baseline and Month 6, and monthly educational sessions on various nutrition concepts focused on the role of the individual in healthy eating. At the fire station level, the intervention changed the environment by providing electric grills to facilitate healthy cooking, scales to promote weight awareness, written food resources to promote healthy eating, and healthy snack alternatives to the processed foods available in the commissaries and vending machines. In addition, the intervention included peer health advocates at a subsample of the intervention firehouses. Local restaurants offered healthy items at a discount for the firefighters to address the community-level challenges to healthy eating participants described.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CVD is the leading cause of on-duty death among firefighters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912461150">Soteriades, Smith, et al., 2011</xref>), and the epidemiologic data point to a long list of risk factors that explain this observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912461150">Kales et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912461150">Soteriades, Smith, et al., 2011</xref>). However, the literature on interventions to address CVD among fire service personnel and on the potential role of firefighters in informing interventions designed for them is much less developed. Our findings offer important insights about how volunteer firefighters in Maryland understand health and wellness generally, and the factors that influence their food intake. Our findings also inform intervention planning. To our knowledge, this is the first study that systematically brings firefighters into the process of developing an intervention to reduce CVD risk and the first to understand firefighters’ beliefs and attitudes regarding health and wellness.</p>
<sec id="section17-1524839912461150">
<title>Cardiovascular Disease, Healthy Eating, and Volunteer Firefighters</title>
<p>The firefighters in our focus groups connected physical activity to health and wellness but talked more frequently and more extensively about food as both a risk factor and an opportunity for intervention. They explained food and what they eat in a way that is consistent with an ecological view of the individual within larger social organizations. Decisions about what to eat reflected their knowledge about food and their preferences, as well as the availability of food within their firehouses and larger communities. Their individual and community influences were also described in the context of the volunteer firefighting lifestyle, which leaves little time for meal planning and preparation. With modest food budgets, firefighters perceived their options for healthy eating as limited or nonexistent.</p>
<p>Importantly, our participants understand food and healthy eating as more than three meals a day as evidenced by their discussion of both meals and snacks when discussing food and health. The prominent role of snacks and sweetened drinks that are accessible through commissaries and vending machines is a significant source of sugar, salt, and fat. Other sources of snacks include food that is brought into the firehouse for meetings or what is available at hospitals and other response-related sites. Snacks are a quick and easy way for firefighters to access food while on duty, but the snacking described during our focus groups tends to be a high-calorie, low-nutrition food source.</p>
<p>Many of the challenges to healthy eating cited by participants in our sample are directly related to the demanding nature of the volunteer firefighter culture described over the course of our focus groups. This is work that volunteers make time for in addition to their paid jobs and family responsibilities, and often comes at a cost to their ability to plan and eat healthy meals at regular intervals throughout the day. The regular exposure to unhealthy foods, and the lack of access to healthy options, is another challenging aspect of the volunteer culture. These findings suggest that although the volunteer culture may not pose unique challenges to healthy eating, the concentration of so many challenges and the extent to which these challenges become part of the firefighter routine require a different approach to health promotion interventions.</p>
<p>Consistent with the challenges participants described, discussions about interventions to promote healthy eating were complex. Although firefighters most often suggested individually focused interventions aimed at providing the knowledge and skills to navigate past the many obvious, quick, and inexpensive food options in their communities and firehouses, they also talked about minimizing community risks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1524839912461150">
<title>Informing Intervention Development</title>
<p>We sought to develop an intervention to address CVD risks among volunteer firefighters. From the beginning, we established that this goal would be accomplished through a practice–academic partnership that is reflected in the composition of our study team and the participatory nature of our formative research. By structuring our data collection in a way that allowed participants to identify food as an important focus for CVD risk reduction, explain how and why they eat what they do, and direct the conversation about solutions, this study gave practitioners a voice in intervention planning. Given the dearth of literature on effective interventions for promoting healthy eating among firefighters and on the specific needs of volunteers, we view this approach as a promising model for future intervention initiatives with this population.</p>
<p>Importantly, although our approach to gathering the data was driven by the participants’ perspectives on health and well-being and how to promote healthier living among volunteer firefighters, the intervention we ultimately developed married the feedback from firefighters with relevant theory and the scientific evidence available to inform the types of healthy eating interventions the firefighters described. This combination of participatory data collection that yields intervention ideas that reflect the community priorities and can be shaped into theoretically sound interventions and returned to the community is an approach that holds great promise for the field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1524839912461150">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our findings are based on the voluntary participation of individuals from a self-selected sample. In addition, we note that among the participating stations, our firefighters also self-selected to participate. We have no information on nonparticipants. Therefore, our participants may reflect those who are most invested in health and wellness and may not include the hard-to-reach individuals, and/or our participants may be different from the larger population in other, unknown ways. Despite these limitations, the findings do inform the literature about ways to mitigate firefighter CVD risk.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We sought to understand health and wellness from the perspectives of volunteer firefighters and those who serve with volunteers to inform an intervention to address CVD risk and promote health and wellness. Five recommendations from this work are clear.</p>
<list id="list1-1524839912461150" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Interventions seeking to promote healthy eating must consider individuals’ capacity to make good choices, as well as their ability to access healthy food options within the firehouse and the surrounding community.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interventions targeting healthy eating must address snacks as well as traditional meals.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intervention designs should take into account the differences in eating habits, food access, and resources among fire stations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Firefighters experience high levels of stress that affect their ability to engage in health-promoting behaviors. The effects of stress may be heightened among volunteer firefighters. Future interventions should address stress.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Participatory research is a valuable strategy for informing intervention design. When findings are married with relevant theory and evidence, the result is a community-designed intervention that is based in the evidence.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>By including the practice community on the study team, we created a research process that resulted in a participant-driven intervention. Firefighters experience particular risk factors. Their understanding of those risks and how to address them in the context of their lifestyle and the demands of the fire service are important to understand when developing strategies to counter those risks. Increasing the involvement of firefighters in the development of interventions can bring greater insight about their lifestyle and culture to help in the design and implementation of research and practice efforts to address health risks. Our study is one example of how research can be used to accomplish such an end, and we suggest that it may be instructive for future efforts.</p>
