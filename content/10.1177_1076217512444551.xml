<abstract>
<p>One would be hard-pressed to deny the impact that hip hop is having on gifted students. More specifically, because hip hop is a creative and exciting male-dominated culture, gifted males gravitate to hip hop culture. From the perspective of two Black men from two different generations, this article was inspired by discussions about the role of hip hop in our own personal and professional lives as well as the lives of our gifted sons. The authors share their insights to help educators understand the tremendous impact of hip hop on gifted males. Attention is given to the origins of hip hop and unpacking negative images associated with hip hop as they relate to gifted males. The authors conclude with recommendations and resources for parents and educators interested in using hip hop to academically engage gifted males.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, hip hop culture and its relationship to key issues in gifted education have received increased attention at the National Association for Gifted Children convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512444551">Callahan, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217512444551">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217512444551">Callahan, Grantham, &amp; Harris, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1076217512444551">Grantham, Callahan, Harris, &amp; Hébert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1076217512444551">Henfield &amp; Washington, 2009</xref>). Educators and researchers are taking note because gifted males are engaged in hip hop. In our work on culturally diverse gifted students, we have had several conversations with teachers, counselors, and parents about hip hop, and we have discussed the influence of hip hop on the lives of gifted males. In those conversations, we talk about how some gifted males, regardless of background, are attracted to the contemporary styles and aesthetics of hip hop. We discussed the many positive and prosocial aspects of hip hop music and culture. The lack of critique and the apparent acceptance on behalf of gifted males regarding the misogyny, drugs, and violence that appears a great deal in the lyrics in mainstream hip hop music and culture were also a part of our conversations. From these discussions, I believe it safe to say that hip hop, rife with contradictions and ironies, and its impact on gifted males are gaining more and more attention among educators, researchers, and parents of gifted males.</p>
<p>This article represents an overview of the role of hip hop in the lives of gifted males based on conversations, observations, and investigations that we have engaged with educators, parents, and gifted hip hop males themselves. We are two different Black men from two different generations, and we discussed the role of hip hop culture in our lives and in the lives of our gifted sons. One of us is an old-school dad, and the other is a new-school dad. We have unique experiences with hip hop. Tarek grew up during the 1970s and 1980s in a time when hip hop first emerged, and its rhythm, sounds, ideas, and images had not fully matured or received the amount of attention that it enjoys in mainstream America and the world today. Sean, however, was born in the mid-1970s and grew up with hip hop in the 1980s and 1990s in a time when hip hop seemed to pervade nearly every crevice of pop culture and news media. Our relationship with hip hop over the last three decades provides the foundation for the current discussion of the role of hip hop and its influence in shaping gifted males.</p>
<p>We both realize that many gifted males, particularly Black males, are engaged in hip hop culture, whereas some gifted students may feel more of a connection with other popular youth cultures. As teachers, we know that many of you understand hip hop through the media’s negative or commercialized view. For many parents and educators, there is a concern about the influence of hip hop on your gifted males and the possibility that they may reject participation in gifted programs, or may downplay high academic achievement, and understandably so. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1076217512444551">Seidel (2009)</xref> aptly described this sentiment:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Educators often view hip hop as a negative influence in students’ lives. As far as many teachers are concerned, hip hop music promotes violence, misogyny, homophobia,</p>
<p>hypercapitalist consumption, and—to add insult to injury—bad grammar! Hip hop culture is seen as a force that competes for students’ attention, which frustrates many teachers who invest time and energy attempting to engage students, only to be drowned out by cultural products that often critique the very values schools are trying to instill. (para. 3)</p>

<p>We share these concerns as we both have gifted sons. However, we also value the fact that hip hop is a part of our culture that we must conscientiously try to better understand to best appreciate the experiences of our gifted sons and your gifted males. Just because we are both Black and male does not mean that we have the same understanding of or experience with hip hop. Many of you have gifted males who represent a wide spectrum of racial, class, religious, regional, and other demographic background characteristics. One would be naïve to assume that those young men do not engage or are affected by hip hop in some way. Those among us who recognize hip hop’s influence share a common belief that bridges need to be built to overcome the gaps in teachers’ knowledge about hip hop. With this in mind, we share an overview of hip hop in hopes that these insights will enhance your understanding of and appreciation for hip hop in the lives of your gifted males.</p>

<title>Hip Hop Today</title>
<p>What hip hop is today depends on whom you ask. Gifted males will describe it in different ways. Some call it a culture, to some it is just music, to others it is a lifestyle. Still others refer to it as a spirit. They would all be correct. Hip hop is important to different gifted males for different reasons. It provides an outlet for self-expression, be it physically, creatively, intellectually, or spiritually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217512444551">Duncan-Andrade &amp; Morrell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1076217512444551">Keyes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1076217512444551">Morrell &amp; Duncan-Andrade, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1076217512444551">Osumare, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1076217512444551">2008</xref>). It is a billion-dollar industry that provides jobs for a number of people. Gifted males, in general, are attracted to hip hop because of the creativity, youthfulness, and sense of freedom associated with hip hop culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512444551">Cooks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1076217512444551">Jocson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1076217512444551">Weinstein, 2006</xref>). Hip hop provides a multitude of opportunities for gifted males to connect to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1076217512444551">Stovall, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Gifted males can engage hip hop in the same ways as students who have not been labeled gifted. Engagement can range from practicing one or more of “the four elements”—breaking/b-boying, emceeing/rapping, dj-ing, or graffiti. B-boying or b-girling is known by the mainstream as break dancing. The “B” stands for “break”—referring to the part of the song where the music was broken down to rhythm section or percussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1076217512444551">Toop, 1991</xref>). Hip hop pioneer, Afrika Bambaataa, described it as the part of the record that made people “go off” and free themselves in the dance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1076217512444551">1</xref></sup> In a more general sense, however, a b-boy/b-girl refers to a dedicated practitioner of hip hop. Rapping/emceeing is what most people usually connect to hip hop. This is the culture’s verbal expression. Dj-ing (disc jockeying) is culture’s sonic expression. It refers to the art of creating music by playing samples or snippets from two or more records. These samples strung together by alternating between, looping, and/or layering records to extend and embellish beats, melodies, harmonies, and other sounds to create an original composition. Graffiti is considered the culture’s visual expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1076217512444551">Toop, 1991</xref>). Subway and freight trains, highway overpasses, and the sides of buildings are the usual places folks would see some of the larger pieces of graffiti. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1076217512444551">Kan (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217512444551">Gastman, Rowland, and Sattler (2006)</xref> noted that for graf artists, the more people able to see the piece the better. A lot of people today who do not know much about hip hop often confuse this type of graffiti with gang activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1076217512444551">Kan, 2001</xref>). In most cases, there is not any connection between the two. In fact, many gifted male graf artists find this outlet to be just as meaningful as displaying their work in a magnet school’s art contest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1076217512444551">Kan, 2001</xref>). Similar to the artistry of graf artist, gifted males’ participation in hip hop may also include spoken word and poetry slams. Other examples include orchestrating hip hop events, enrolling in courses on hip hop, or simply listening to hip hop music and going to hip hop shows and battles. Battles are freestyle rap or b-boy competitions that can be formal competitions like the “Rap Olympics,” an annual emcee battle, and “Battle of the Year,” an international b-boy battle, where the winner is determined by a panel of judges, or informal competitions where the winner is determined by other participants and onlookers.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for gifted males? For starters, hip hop is a culture and industry that is dominated by males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1076217512444551">Kitwana, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1076217512444551">2005</xref>). There has been a growing body of research that focuses on how youth, primarily males, engage and practice art forms associated with this culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217512444551">Bowen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512444551">Cooks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217512444551">Cristen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217512444551">Duncan-Andrade &amp; Morrell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1076217512444551">Jocson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1076217512444551">Kan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1076217512444551">Schloss, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1076217512444551">Weinstein, 2006</xref>). More specifically, the kinesthetic and artistic giftedness among gifted males is well documented and easily located within the traditional art forms of hip hop. However, the intellectual and socioemotional development of gifted males in regard to their engagement of hip hop culture goes virtually unnoticed by many educators of the gifted. Therefore, there is much to be learned about the role and impact of hip hop on the lives of gifted males.</p>

<title>Origins of Hip Hop</title>
<sec id="section3-1076217512444551">
<title>African roots, American branches</title>
<p>To understand and appreciate the role of hip hop in the lives of gifted males, it is important to explore its evolution. There exists a general consensus among hip hop scholars that it started in the South Bronx in the late 1970s. However, many of the concepts that comprise the elements can be traced back to ancient cultures. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1076217512444551">Keyes (2002)</xref> reminds us that emceeing/rapping can be traced to the griotic tradition in West Africa. <italic>Griot</italic> is a French term that refers to a male and female trained in the oral traditions. Through songs, poems, and stories, they memorize and recall their local history. Griots are known for their wit, musicianship, and ability to extemporize or “freestyle” on current events. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1076217512444551">Osumare (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1076217512444551">2008</xref>) noted that breaking has roots in ritual dances from African tradition but is also influenced by Asian and Brazilian martial arts as well as Latin traditional dance. Hip hop is a cultural phenomenon for students of many races, ethnicities, and cultures in the United States and abroad.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1076217512444551">
<title>Spirituality in hip hop</title>
<p>Some of you may consider hip hop to have emerged out of a cult-like or gang-like phenomenon. This is understandable because there are nefarious aspects and individuals that have been associated with hip hop culture. However, many gifted males do not see hip hop as a cult or gang activity in the sense of the term that is used to describe religious heretics and brainwashed members with leaders the likes of Jim Jones, Charles Manson, and Marshall Applewhite. At the same time, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1076217512444551">Perkinson (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1076217512444551">Pinn (2003)</xref> noted that there is definitely an aspect of spirituality that goes underdiscussed in many conversations about hip hop. For instance, the emcee, master of ceremonies, is responsible for performing the oratory rituals that prepare the audience to make themselves available to the spirit of hip hop. Many smart males with strong analytical skills and leadership ability seem to knowingly or unknowingly participate in the system of ritual practices that structure traditional hip hop art forms. In the documentary, <italic>Freestyle: The Art of Rhyme</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217512444551">Fitzgerald, 2000</xref>), emcees and musicians elucidate this point. Much like the traditions employed by Black Baptist preachers, emcees use practices like call and response, chants and the adept use of words, voice, and rhythm through “freestyling” to keep the audience connected to the energy that brought them together in the first place. Gifted males who b-boy, dj, and emcee often talk about how some of their best, most creative moves or words took place in moments when they felt most connected to a divine intelligence, and they were able to “let go” and trust themselves in that experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217512444551">Fitzgerald, 2000</xref>). In sum, the origins of hip hop include a multitude of influences, and gifted males practice hip hop for a lot of the same reasons you go to church.</p>

<title>“Overstanding”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1076217512444551">2</xref></sup>: Higher order thinking in hip hop</title>
<p>Thinking deeply about a concept or idea or event has long been noted a qualitative indicator of gifted ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1076217512444551">Torrance, 1969</xref>). Many of you may have experienced gifted males who think deeply about their connections to hip hop and its role in their lives. Higher order thinking can be located in the ways that an individual engages hip hop. “Conscious” hip hop, a genre within hip hop music, includes examinations and descriptions of current events, socioeconomic conditions, cultural norms, and politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1076217512444551">3</xref></sup> During the presidential election of 2008 Will.i.am, from the hip hop group Black Eyed Peas wrote and produced several Obama-inspired anthems including “Yes We Can,” “We Are the Ones,” and “It’s a New Day.” These songs represent a type of social critique and activism involved in hip hop music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1076217512444551">4</xref></sup> The book <italic>The League of Pissed-Off Voters Presents: How to Get Stupid White Men Out of Office: The Anti-Politics, Unboring Guide to Power</italic> edited by Adrienne Maree Brown and William Upski Wimsatt “tells 20 little-known success stories . . . of young people who have swung or won elections—from city council to U.S. Senate—16 states, South Korea, and on the Internet” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217512444551">Brown et al., 2004</xref>, back cover). Hip hop artists also draw from their own experiences and the experiences of others, and they incorporate aspects of different cultures to construct their arguments as well as their personal style. For example, Wu-Tang Clan, a hip hop group out of Staten Island who rose to fame in the 1990s, draws heavily from Asian philosophy and martial arts to create an aesthetic that is still distinguishable from other hip hop artists. And while hip hoppers critique social injustices and the world around them, they are as equally critical of the development and current state of hip hop itself. Corporate media control, misogyny, lack of originality, and skill of rappers in mainstream hip hop are frequent topics in conversations among hip hoppers. Documentaries like <italic>Planet B-Boy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1076217512444551">Lee &amp; Fowler, 2007</xref>) and <italic>Freestyle: The Art of Rhyme</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217512444551">Fitzgerald, 2000</xref>) are full of good examples of higher order thinking skills demonstrated with and in hip hop culture. For many gifted males, hip hop provides an outlet for them to use and grow their abilities in ways that current gifted education teaching strategies have yet to consider.</p>

<title>Unpacking Hip Hop’s Bad Rap</title>
<sec id="section7-1076217512444551">
<title>Hip hop in the eye of the beholder</title>
<p>Like beauty, foolishness is in the eye of the beholder. Lower order thinking can also be located in the ways that gifted males engage hip hop. Jazz and social critic, Stanley Crouch, has been on the most vocal opponents of hip hop, lambasting the culture for its poor depiction of Black people, using pejoratives like “modern-day minstrelsy” and buffoonery to describe representations of hip hop in the media. On the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://TheRoot.com">TheRoot.com</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217512444551">Crouch (2010)</xref> blogged, “when it comes to dehumanizing Black people, hip hop wins, hands down.” Many teachers of gifted males might consider hip hop and the ways in which youngsters engage hip hop to be a form of “intellectual emptiness.” True enough, some representations of hip hop that we see in the media leave us wondering, “What were they thinking?” When confronted with negative images, we need to deepen our interrogation and inquire, “What are the educational, social, political, historical, and cultural conditions that make certain types of thinking possible among gifted males who have embraced hip hop?” This is not to excuse bad behavior seen in some hip hop; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1076217512444551">Keyes (2002)</xref> urges us to remember that 30 years ago, hip hop in its entirety was considered foolishness by Whites and middle-class Blacks. To repeat, our view of hip hop is no way an attempt to support the complaints against it. Many of the criticisms are more than valid and very important. Our view is without naivety or boosterism; instead, it includes a headlong foray toward the crux of the issues and attitudes associated with hip hop that disturb us the most. Inquiring about the conditions that make these complaints about hip hop possible is a step in the right direction. Often times, the profanity we see and hear in rap songs and videos is an interpretation or response to profane situations that have been created for oppressed people as well as the situations that oppressed people create for themselves. Many gifted males have the capacity to understand and empathize with the social struggles and triumphs for whom hip hop culture represents, rejecting some schools’ attempts to place a bad rap on hip hop when they frame it as foolishness.</p>
<p>What appears as foolishness to teachers and administrators may make complete sense to gifted males who engage hip hop. For example, education has been touted as the “great equalizer” for many decades. Conversely, underachievement among gifted males and their dropout rate, particularly among gifted Black and Hispanic males, continue to be major themes in conversations about gifted males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512444551">Coleman, Gou, &amp; Dabbs, 2007</xref>). Parents, educators, and legislators find themselves befuddled as to why gifted males are reluctant to take advantage of gifted and advanced programs and view their engagement in hip hop as foolishness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217512444551">Duncan-Andrade &amp; Morrell, 2008</xref>). For many gifted males engaged in hip hop, however, placing their faith in an educational system that continuously shortchanges them and unfailingly persists to find new, more sophisticated ways to restrict their social mobility is viewed as foolish. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1076217512444551">McCormick (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1076217512444551">Mahiri (1998)</xref> noted how many teachers and administrators have associated drug dealing and violence with hip hop culture; however, many gifted males are smart enough to understand that all these things existed long before hip hop was even thought about. Gifted males who engage hip hop have unpacked that foolishness and social injustices are woven into the fabric of American history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217512444551">Fitzgerald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1076217512444551">Hurt, 2006</xref>). True enough, there are aspects of hip hop culture that magnify and glorify these ills, but gifted male hip hoppers know that they did not invent them. They accept that hip hop is as much a <italic>reflection</italic> of reality as it is a creation of reality.</p>

<sec id="section8-1076217512444551">
<title>Hip hop wear: What’s underneath</title>
<p>Many people want to know why males in hip hop like to wear their pants below their waist. What is the significance of having saggy pants and then pulling up your pants when you walk or showing your underwear? Well, this fad started in the early 1990s. Some say this style comes from jail/prison culture, having your belt and shoe-strings confiscated during intake. Without your belt, your pants would hang below your waist. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1076217512444551">Neal (2002)</xref> noted how this practice became part of the thug/gangsta motif in hip hop. It started as an act of social defiance and turned into a fashion statement as the oversized clothes fad caught on. We called it “bustin’ slack.” Now, it just seems more like a platitude, unlike during the Golden Age of hip hop (1985-1995) when you had to be different from the artists that were already out there. Then, there was an amazing amount of diversity in hip hop that was less about how artists wore their pants. Hip hop captured people’s interest because it was stylistic in message, sound, and fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1076217512444551">Keyes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1076217512444551">Kitwana, 2002</xref>). If you were not into gangsta rap, like N.W.A. or Too $hort, you could listen to politically conscious rap, like Public Enemy. If you were not into east coast hip hop, like Nas and Wu-Tang, then you could listen to groups from the South, like OutKast, Goodie Mob, and 8-Ball and M.J.G. and U.G.K. Or, you could be into all of it, like many gifted males are. Nowadays, many artists have to replicate what’s hot, what’s on the radio, to see any commercial success. Consequently, a great deal of the music we hear and images we see on television looks and sounds the same. There is a formula that has been comprised by corporations, telling people what is hip and new, and saggy pants is included in this formula for male hip hoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1076217512444551">Kitwana, 2002</xref>). Another possibility for this style may have come from the “hand me down” pattern practiced in so many families. In particular, when you consider how the incarceration rate of Blacks and Latinos skyrocketed during the 1990s, the idea that little brother would wear his big brother’s (cousin’s, uncle’s, etc.) clothes makes a lot of sense.</p>

<title>The fear of hip hop</title>
<p>Generally speaking, most gifted males of this generation do not fear hip hop. Conversely, many educators may fear the people that can be most readily identified with hip hop through the images and the messages produced and circulated by mainstream media. Teachers often fear what will become of gifted males who respond in a certain way to the social and political conditions that represent hip hop or that make hip hop possible. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1076217512444551">Bakari Kitwana (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1076217512444551">2005</xref>) wrote two books: <italic>The Hip Hop Generation: Young Blacks and the Crisis in African American Culture</italic> and <italic>Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wankstas, Wiggas, Wannabes and the New Reality of Race in America</italic>. In these books, he explains the conditions that draw young people to hip hop. He talks about the visibility of Black youth in popular culture, the expansion to a global economy, the media representation of young Blacks prior to the 1990s, an overall shift in the quality of life for young Blacks in the 1980s and 1990s that influenced the norms, values, networks, and social trust of Black youth in America, and the racial implications of public policy in relation to criminal justice.</p>
<p>In the book about <italic>Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wankstas, Wiggas, Wannabes and the New Reality of Race in America</italic>, some of these conditions include (a) the growth of the global economy, which lowered job prospects producing in young Whites a sense of alienation from mainstream culture in the 1980s and 1990s; (b) significant ruptures in the popular music scene with the death of Kurt Cobain, grunge music icon, and the wane of punk and grunge; (c) a shift in the American economy at the turn of the millennium characterized by the ineffectiveness of education coupled with rise in college tuition and health insurance; (d) exposure to Black culture through sitcoms like <italic>The Cosby Show, The Martin Lawrence Show, A Different World, Living Single</italic>, and programs like <italic>Yo! MTV Raps!</italic> These conditions have only intensified over the last 15 to 20 years, making hip hop culture more accessible and viable as a form of resistance and creativity to engage by gifted Black males as well as gifted males from a wide range of backgrounds. And with this intensification comes more flagrant, diverse, and extreme responses from young people in hip hop.</p>

There are few known role models of successful openly gay or lesbian hip hop artists who have achieved even marginal success in mainstream hip hop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1076217512444551">Hurt, 2006</xref>). This is particularly problematic for openly gay gifted males who do not perform masculinity as prescribed by the hip hop status quo. While misogyny and homophobia are not issues unique to hip hop, the idea that teachers can help gifted males become critical consumers of media by becoming critical consumers themselves cannot be overstated. Among their peers, gifted male hip hoppers can be the most culturally eloquent and socially accepted advocates for topics such as the mistreatment of women and girls, and antigay and lesbian attitudes. These conversations can be difficult for teachers to have with their students, but many gifted males who are most connected with the generational concerns of the day want to use their hip hop perspective to problem solve and discuss these issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1076217512444551">Byron Hurt’s (2006)</xref> <italic>Hip Hop: Beyond Beats and Rhymes</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1076217512444551">Sut Jhally’s and Jeremy Earp’s (1999)</xref> <italic>Tough Guise: Violence, Media, and the Crisis in Masculinity</italic> with Jackson Katz are two very interesting and informative documentaries that shed light on issues in hip hop culture, in particular, and media, in general.

<title>Constructively Engaging Gifted Males in Hip Hop</title>
<p>More than likely, teachers see that their gifted males are already engaged in hip hop. Many of the latest fashion trends, for instance, are inspired by hip hop. In your classrooms, you see the influence of commercials that use hip hop at every turn to sell products. You see your gifted males using language they picked up from hip hop. With that said, media literacy is a way to engage gifted males in thinking about hip hop more deeply. For example, ask your gifted males, “Do you know what you’re looking at/listening to? Why do you think they chose those hip hop words/images in that song, video, or advertisement? What other hip hop or other images/words could they have used?” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medialit.org/">http://www.medialit.org/</ext-link>). The point is to get them to begin to think about and understand that words/images do things. They do things to and for people. Introduce them to the power of manipulating words/images and how hip hop is used in this manner. Try introducing gifted children to different types of hip hop music as well as expressions of hip hop culture. Have gifted males to understand that there is more to hip hop music than just videos and rap records.</p>
<p>Many teachers of the gifted are unknowingly learning about hip hop through the rapport they build with their gifted males. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217512444551">Chung (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1076217512444551">Mahiri (1998)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1076217512444551">Seidel (2009)</xref> noted that learning about hip hop introduces teachers to another code of communication. More than just keeping up with the latest catchphrases and slang, it is important for teachers and parents to understand what gifted males are trying to communicate through their engagement with hip hop. Hip hop is a powerful tool for differentiation. Hip hop provides engaging content and alternative access points and processes, and it adds to the myriad of products that gifted students can develop and use to demonstrate learning.</p>
<sec id="section12-1076217512444551">
<title>Hip hop connections with subject areas</title>
<p>There are very few learning contexts where hip hop cannot be nurtured and developed to some degree. Although language arts is probably the most noticeable academic subject where a hip hop connection with hip hop is valued and nurtured, history and social studies are also fruitful arenas for developing and nurturing hip hop (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1076217512444551">Table 1</xref>). Cultural critics, scholars, and hip hop headz (longtime devotees and listeners of hip hop music) have situated hip hop as a response to “Reaganomics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1076217512444551">Kitwana, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1076217512444551">Neal, 2002</xref>). Take for instance, “The Message” by Grand Master Flash and The Furious Five was released in 1983, during the Reagan’s first term in office. This song has been noted as hip hop’s first expression of a social and political consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1076217512444551">Keyes, 2002</xref>). The group’s response to and critique of the conditions in many socially and economically disadvantaged, inner city neighborhoods created by “Trickle Down” economics can be best surmised by the hook of the record: “Don’t push me, ’cause I’m close to the edge/I’m trying not to lose my head . . . It’s like a jungle/Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under . . . ” Similarly, Talib Kweli (Greene) raps on “Cold Rain,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1076217512444551">5</xref></sup> a record that appears on the CD, <italic>Gutter Rainbows</italic>, released in 2011 that “I’m a product of Reaganomics . . . ” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1076217512444551">Willis &amp; Greene, 2011</xref>). Like Talib, many gifted males are also products of Reagan-era administration. The economic policies implemented during that time created a set of social, cultural, and political conditions that are as much a part of American history as the Revolutionary War, Reconstruction, or any other historical event taught in schools. Hip hop can also be used to teach topics in world history. Because hip hop builds on and incorporates traditions that originated in ancient Africa and draws on traditions from other ancient cultures (e.g., Wu-Tang Clan’s use of Asian and Islamic philosophy), it can be used to introduce lessons and facilitate learning experiences of gifted males. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217512444551">Duncan-Andrade and Morrell (2005)</xref> noted the academic rigor of texts of hip hop and popular film in the Language Arts classroom, using Scarface’s “On My Block” and Eminem’s “The Way I Am” as texts to analyze for tone, diction, metaphor, image, plot and character development, themes, and motifs. From these three humanities-based contexts, links to math and sciences can be made through what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076217512444551">Ron Eglash (2002)</xref> referred to as ethno-mathematics in his book, <italic>African Fractals: Modern Computing and Indigenous Design</italic>. For example, Regina Turner Washington, math teacher at Franklin Military Academy, uses cornrows, a popular hairstyle in hip hop culture, to introduce fractal geometry concepts to students (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://csdt.rpi.edu/african/African_Fractals/turnerstandards.html">http://csdt.rpi.edu/african/African_Fractals/turnerstandards.html</ext-link>).

<title>Hip hop as a form of social action and social justice</title>
<p>Teachers can differentiate learning experiences for gifted males so that they can understand that hip hop began, in part, as a response to Reaganomics that affected Americans directly and indirectly as well as positively and negatively. History tells us that a certain group of people (young, socioeconomically disadvantaged, Blacks and Latinos in S. Bronx) responded to social conditions in ways that lead to the creation of hip hop. If we were to examine the cultural trends of, say, middle-class White and Black Americans during this period, we would find different responses. The point is that the history of hip hop represents an important part of the American history. Understanding the conditions that made hip hop possible is critical to understanding the gifted males who embrace hip hop.</p>
<p>Of the four elements of hip hop, rap and graffiti are the most common vehicles for addressing social injustices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217512444551">Bowen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512444551">Cooks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1076217512444551">Jocson, 2006</xref>). Over the course of time, however, activism has been added to the list of elements that comprise hip hop. Gifted males should be encouraged to learn about hip hop activists who speak out on issues that range from national and geo-politics, racism, worker’s rights, women’s rights, human rights, immigration, prison industrial complex, drug laws, and the like. Gifted males involved with hip hop activism can provide themselves opportunities for civic participation. For instance, hip hop culture, artists, and icons played a huge part in the Rock the Vote campaigns during the last three presidential elections.</p>
<p>One of the ways teachers can help gifted males deal with youthful fears and phobias associated with masculinity issues can be through the infusion of women’s and gender studies of hip hop into gifted curriculum. There are just as many students who would excel and benefit from being exposed to the ideas and concepts in these disciplines as there are students who excel in math and science. Introducing gifted males to social, cultural, political, and historical issues faced by women, gays, and lesbians through hip hop provides educators and practitioners with a rich context in which to identify and develop talent among students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1076217512444551">T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting’s (2007)</xref> <italic>Pimps Up, Ho’s Down: Hip Hop’s Hold on Young Black Women</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1076217512444551">Joan Scott Morgan’s (1999)</xref> <italic>When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost</italic>, and <italic>Home Girls Make Some Noise! Hip Hop Feminism Anthology</italic> edited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076217512444551">Durham et al. (2007)</xref> address these issues. These books are written from a feminist perspective by authors from the hip hop generation and explore the complexities of the relationship between hip hop and young women. One of the overarching themes that these works can unveil for gifted males is how to deal with the contradiction that exists in young women’s engagement and love for a hip hop culture in which misogynistic and hypermasculine representations and behavior patterns have become normal, entertaining, and lucrative. Sharpley-Whiting’s and Morgan’s books are written for the popular audience and would be appropriate for most teachers and gifted high school students. The edited work is more moves between poetry, prose, interviews, and essays about being female in hip hop culture. The anthology, at times, uses concepts and terminology that require more background in feminist and cultural studies; however, gifted males are very likely to be engaged in these high level discussions and analyses.</p>

<title>Creating your own hip hop enterprise at school</title>
<p>There is not a single entity or group of people who can take complete credit for shaping hip hop. Hip hop is shaped by anyone who chooses to participate in it. From the countless musical artists, to the corporate executives, to gifted White males in the “burbs,” to Brazilians in the flavelas (slums), to the young Black males with their pants off their waists, to the teachers and parents at home, hip hop is shaped by our imagination, hearts, and minds. Historically, the hip hop industry has been controlled mostly by White male executives who have very little interest in hip hop outside of its value as a commodity. With the advent of the Internet, and the availability of personal computers and music production software, there has been a surge in independent, “DIY (Do-It-Yourself)” hip hop music. Indie (independently produced) hip hop skips the bureaucracy associated with acquiring production and distribution deals and other frustrations that accompany dealings with major record labels (see <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://indiehiphop.net">indiehiphop.net</ext-link></italic>). Teachers can facilitate independent projects where gifted males become producers of hip hop products and services, as well as contributors to the contemporary thinking about the direction of hip hop (see <italic>beatsrhymesandlife.org</italic>).</p>

<title>Use Their Interest to Encourage Reading</title>
<p>Mason Crest and Checkmark Publishers have biographies that feature hip hop and R&amp;B artists. Reading competitions are also a good way to capitalize on students’ interests in hip hop. For example, Atlanta-based radio personality, Greg Street, has created and sponsors a program called “We Need 2 Read” that awards US$10,000 to the school that reads the most books. Take advantage of teachable moments.</p>
<p>The Center for Media Literacy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medialit.org/overview-1">http://www.medialit.org/overview-1</ext-link>) has compiled book that contain 25 lesson plans designed to help students build media literacy skills. These lesson plans can be used to help students apply critical thinking skills to hip hop culture and media. There are five essential questions that support this approach: Who created the message? What techniques are used to attract my attention? What lifestyles, values, and points of view are presented in or omitted from the message? Why was this message sent? How might different people understand the message differently from me?</p>
<p>For educators who want to use hip hop with a population of students who do not like hip hop, it is important to remember that you do not have to like hip hop to have an opinion about it. What is important for students is that they learn to think about, critique, and articulate their thoughts about cultures that are different from their own.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The attention on males is not new to gifted education. There is a large body of knowledge that addresses concerns with underachievement, socioemotional and intellectual development, and recruitment and retention among this population of youth. For teachers, to learn about hip hop’s impact on gifted males lends oneself to <italic>upstander</italic> effect. The <italic>upstander</italic> effect, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1076217512444551">Grantham (2011)</xref>, entails a proactive stance from educators, students, and parents in addressing the social injustices that contribute to the underrepresentation of Black males in gifted programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512444551">Coleman et al. (2007)</xref> noted that qualitative research on the field of gifted education has primarily focused on the internal, psychosocial processes and external, social and cultural factors that affect the development and achievement of underserved, gifted students. More often than not, gifted males are at the center of these studies. For researchers, parents, and educators, a better understanding of how hip hop culture affects the inner life and contextual circumstances of gifted males provides insight regarding their development. For example, understanding the role of hip hop in the identity development of gifted males is integral to capitalizing on their leadership potential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512444551">Bonner, Jennings, Marbley, and Brown (2008)</xref> noted that for Black males in particular “embracing their race, culture, ethnicity, and gifted status is critical in fostering positive self-concept and identity” (p. 95). They contend that having knowledge of oneself is important to the development of youth leadership. Recognizing and cultivating leadership in youth translates into strong leaders that function well in adult contexts.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, hip hop is a culture that is very much dominated by males. And over the last 20 years, a robust collection of work focusing on hip hop has been produced by scholars and writers from a variety of disciplines; it only makes sense that a conversation emerges regarding hip hop’s impact on gifted males. It was our intent to discuss the complexity of the relationship among the two in a way that displayed hip hop’s educative potency for students, parents, and teachers. We hope that our discussion has enhanced your appreciation and understanding of hip hop culture and its role in the lives of gifted males.</p>

<p><italic>Overstanding</italic> is a term used in hip hop that is derived from the Nations of the Gods and Earth, also known as “Five Percenters,” an offshoot of the Nation of Islam that was spread most notably through hip hop in the 1980s.
