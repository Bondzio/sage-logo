<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Cognitive load</italic> (CL) refers to the amount of mental demand imposed on a person by a particular task and is associated with the limited capacity of the person’s working memory and the ability to process novel information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720811431258">Chandler &amp; Sweller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018720811431258">Sweller, 1988</xref>). It is derived from the semantic or representational complexity of the task. However, the same task can affect different users in different ways and can induce levels of perceived cognitive load that vary from one user to another. This variation is attributable to many reasons, including level of domain expertise, age, and mental or physical impediments.</p>
<p>In complex and time-critical situations, users of an interaction system, especially those working collaboratively, can experience high cognitive demands, which can interfere with their ability to complete a task at an optimum performance level. These cognitive demands are caused either by the complexity of the task being carried out or by the complex design of an interaction system, as in multimodal or multimedia interfaces, which may contain inappropriate amounts of content delivered to users simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720811431258">Mayer, 2001</xref>). For example, high-intensity control room work environments, such as for air traffic control, require operators to manage many such interfaces, switching from one application to another, often on multiple screens and in time-critical scenarios. Operators will frequently use radios or mobile phones, make and answer calls, and speak to their colocated colleagues while completing their tasks. This complexity can result in extremely high cognitive load and hinder the users’ ability to perform their task.</p>
<p>An understanding of the users’ current cognitive load will enable researchers to implement strategies to adjust the interaction system’s response, presentation, and flow of interaction material and provide users with appropriate support as per their cognitive burden, helping them complete tasks more effectively. Moreover, for complex collaborative tasks for which many users communicate with each other to solve task-related problems, understanding cognitive demands can be particularly helpful.</p>
<sec id="section8-0018720811431258">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Measuring a user’s cognitive load robustly and in real time is not a trivial task. Many researchers have attempted to assess users’ cognitive load using several methods, including physiological, behavioral, performance, and self-reporting subjective measures.</p>
<p>Historically, the most consistent results for cognitive load measurement have been achieved through self-reporting subjective measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720811431258">Brunken, Plass, &amp; Leutner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018720811431258">Paas, Merrinboer, &amp; Adam, 1994</xref>). These measures require users to introspect on their perceived level of cognitive load induced by various tasks by answering a set of assessment questions immediately after the tasks.</p>
<p>Performance-based approaches includes two techniques: primary task measurement, which is based on user’s performance of the task being completed, and secondary or dual-task methodology, based on the performance of a second task that is performed concurrently with the primary task. Primary task measures include task completion times, speed or correctness, and critical errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720811431258">Gawron, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720811431258">Paas, Ayers, &amp; Pachman, 2008</xref>). The dual-task approach has also been incorporated by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720811431258">Leyman, Mirka, Kaber, &amp; Sommerich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720811431258">Marcus, Cooper, &amp; Sweller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018720811431258">Sweller, Merrienboer, &amp; Paas, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018720811431258">Wada, Iwata, &amp; Tano, 2001</xref>) and can effectively be used to measure the degree to which the primary task requires working memory resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720811431258">Kerr, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>The physiological approach of cognitive load measurement is based on the assumption that any changes in the human cognitive functioning are reflected in the human physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720811431258">Kramer, 1991</xref>). The measures that have been used to show some relationship between participants’ mental workload and their physiological behavior include heart rate and its variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720811431258">Mousavi, Low, &amp; Sweller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720811431258">Nickel &amp; Nachreiner, 2000</xref>), brain activity (changes in oxygenation and blood volume, electrocardiography, electroencephalography; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720811431258">Brunken et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018720811431258">Wilson &amp; Russell, 2003</xref>), skin conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720811431258">Jacobs et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720811431258">Shi, Ruiz, Taib, Choi, &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>), and eye activity (blink rate, eye movement, pupillary dilation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720811431258">Backs &amp; Walrath, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720811431258">Lipp &amp; Neumann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720811431258">Marshall, Pleydell-Pearce, &amp; Dickson, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>However, most of those approaches can be physically or psychologically intrusive and may not allow implicit measurement. Moreover, they can sometimes be used only post hoc and may disrupt normal task flow. Although they may be useful approaches in research situations, they are often unsuitable for deployment in real-life applications.</p>
<p>Behavioral measures, in contrast, can provide an objective, nonintrusive, and implicit analysis of users’ cognitive load, as they are based on data collected from the users while they complete the task, without their realizing that their behavioral data are being recorded. The user cannot manipulate the data (as in the case of subjective ratings) and can perform the task naturally without any interference. Behavioral features of cognitive load include eye blinking and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720811431258">Gütl et al., 2005</xref>), mouse clicking and keyboard key presses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720811431258">Ark, Dryer, &amp; Lu, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720811431258">Liu, Wong, &amp; Hui, 2003</xref>), and digital-pen gestures and usage patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720811431258">Oviatt, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Most behavioral features of cognitive load have been extracted from users’ speech signal data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720811431258">Berthold &amp; Jameson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720811431258">Jameson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720811431258">Keränen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018720811431258">Yap, Ambikairajah, Epps, &amp; Choi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018720811431258">Yin, Chen, Ruiz, &amp; Ambikairajah, 2008</xref>). Examples of such features include pitch, prosody, speech energy, and fundamental speech frequency. Some studies have reported an increase in the participants’ rate of speech as well as speech energy, amplitude, and variability in high load conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720811431258">Brenner, Shipp, Doherty, &amp; Morrissey, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720811431258">Lively et al., 1993</xref>). Others have found peak intonation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720811431258">Kettebekov, 2004</xref>) and pitch range patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720811431258">Lively et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018720811431258">Wood, Torkkola, &amp; Kundalkar, 2004</xref>) to be related to high cognitive load. Pitch variability has also been shown to potentially correlate to cognitive load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720811431258">Brenner et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018720811431258">Wood et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from speech signal features, linguistic and grammatical features may also be extracted from users’ spoken language and analyzed for patterns indicating high cognitive load. These features may include speech pauses, self-corrections, repetitions, response latency, and language usage, for example, use of different word categories and parts of speech, such as nouns and pronouns, and grammatical structures. Such features may be collected from users’ spoken or written language and are highly unobtrusive, as the data can be collected without interrupting task flow. Some researchers have looked at linguistic features as indices of high cognitive load, including pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720811431258">Berthold &amp; Jameson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720811431258">Khawaja, Ruiz, &amp; Chen, 2008</xref>), word frequency, and use of first-person plurals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018720811431258">Sexton &amp; Helmreich, 2000</xref>). Various other studies have also used linguistic features for purposes other than cognitive load measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720811431258">Kramer, Oh, &amp; Fussell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018720811431258">Rhee &amp; Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018720811431258">Stirman &amp; Pennebaker, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we study some novel linguistic and grammatical features of cognitive load and analyze various aspects of language use, including word selection, parts of speech, and grammar. These linguistic features can be used as cognitive load indices in domains in which speech or conversational transcripts are used as the main forms of input. They can also be fused with other speech, behavioral, and performance indices proposed by others to enhance the overall performance of a state-of-the-art multimodal cognitive load measurement system.</p>

<title>Aims of the Study</title>
<p>Australia is one of the most bushfire-prone regions in the world, and there are thousands of fires that need to be managed annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018720811431258">Owen, Douglas, &amp; Hickey, 2008</xref>). As the impact of climate change results in more extreme weather events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720811431258">Flannigan &amp; Wagner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720811431258">Fried, Torn, &amp; Mills, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720811431258">Hughes, 2003</xref>), fire and emergency service work is becoming increasingly important and needs to be well managed to save the communities from their effects. We present a study involving a real-life bushfire emergency management task carried out in the field by experienced emergency service operators working as a team in an emergency control room. The study was performed with the objective of analyzing bushfire management operators’ natural speech for linguistic indices of cognitive load while they collaboratively perform bushfire management tasks of different complexities.</p>
<p>The overall aim of the study was to understand how people’s spoken and linguistic behavior changes when working in a team collaboratively and when completing complex and high-cognitive-load tasks compared with low-load tasks. Capturing changes in communicative behavior will help us ascertain whether any members of the team experience high load. This knowledge, in turn, will enable any technology or tool that supports teamwork to adapt to those situations more intuitively so as to support team members’ work processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018720811431258">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>The rationale for our hypotheses is based on human cognitive models and working memory structure and its limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811431258">Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720811431258">Baddeley, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720811431258">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720811431258">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720811431258">Kintsch, Patel, &amp; Ericsson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018720811431258">Sweller et al., 1998</xref>), which affect human language production processes and cause different linguistic patterns in various cognitive load conditions.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that while working collaboratively on high-cognitive-load tasks, participants will speak more with each other to manage the high task complexity. Although a few studies have shown a decrease in spoken communication with an increase in workload (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720811431258">Kleinman &amp; Serfaty, 1989</xref>), we expect that focusing on more cognitive tasks that involve active thinking processes will result in more communication or “thinking aloud,” especially when working in a collaborative team setting, resulting in an increased word count. This hypothesis has been confirmed by many other studies showing that in high-mental-load conditions, as things become more complex, team members communicate more and provide more information and/or explanations to each other as a strategy to deal with increased task complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720811431258">Foushee &amp; Helmreich, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720811431258">Jensen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720811431258">Katz, Fraser, &amp; Wagner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720811431258">Oser, Prince, Morgan, &amp; Simpson, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>We also expect greater use of agreement expressions, for example, “OK” or “Agree,” with low-load tasks and more disagreement among team members as task complexity increases. Our intuition is that people feel more confident and responsible in easy situations than in difficult ones, when they tend to feel more reluctant. Also according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720811431258">Baddeley’s (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720811431258">2003)</xref> working memory model, when people experience high cognitive load and their separate audio and visual working memory resources are overloaded with the task itself, it may interfere with their ability to consciously understand and agree with what is being said by other team members, and people may unconsciously become reluctant, disagree, and/or take some time to understand what is being said.</p>
<p>We also wanted to see how people’s individualistic and collectivistic communicative behavior changes in different cognitive load conditions. It has been found that when working in a group and handling difficult tasks together, people prefer to share their efforts to solve the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720811431258">Kirschner, Paas, &amp; Kirschner, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, we expect people to use personal pronouns differently in different cognitive load situations. A personal pronoun is a pronoun that substitutes for proper or common nouns and can be categorized into first-person singular, such as <italic>I</italic> or <italic>me</italic>; first-person plural, such as <italic>we</italic> or <italic>us</italic>; second-person singular or plural, such as <italic>you</italic>; and third-person singular or plural, such as <italic>he, she</italic>, or <italic>they</italic>. For our objective, we wanted to compare people’s usage preference for singular versus plural personal pronouns. We hypothesize that in tasks of a collaborative nature, there will be an interaction between level of cognitive load and use of singular and plural personal pronouns; that is, as the task complexity (and so the cognitive load) increases, the use of singular pronouns will decrease and the use of plural pronouns will increase.</p>
<p>Again, we expect people to work together more to share the cognitive load as task complexity increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720811431258">Kirschner et al., 2009</xref>), and the difference between their individual and their collaborative working behavior may be visible from their pronominal usage preferences. Use of a singular personal pronoun implies a person’s preference to work on his or her own, whereas use of a plural personal pronoun implies working together in a group. Therefore, considering the linguistic aspects of the team cooperation, we expect that when team members work together more than individually, they will use more plural (team) personal pronouns, such as <italic>we, us</italic>, or <italic>our</italic>, than singular (individual) pronouns.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although the second-person pronoun <italic>you</italic> has both singular and plural properties, semantically it is not possible for any automated analysis tool to discriminate between the two usage types. Therefore, our main focus of the analyses will remain to study the behavior of first- and third-person pronouns and their singular versus plural usage. Nevertheless, the use of the second-person pronoun <italic>you</italic> will still be analyzed to see how its behavior changes with different load levels. However, it is not expected to be a useful cognitive load index.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A bushfire management study was performed by experienced bushfire operators working collaboratively in a computerized incident control room. The study requires the operators to carry out highly complex bushfire management tasks.</p>
<sec id="section12-0018720811431258">
<title>Task Design</title>
<p>The task involved a bushfire management exercise carried out by at least four members of an incident management team (IMT) working in an incident control center. The team members carried out 10 tasks, each about 5 hr in duration, in four states of Australia, including New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and Queensland. Each IMT involved in an exercise comprised the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0018720811431258" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>incident control, for the management of all activities necessary for the resolution of an incident;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>planning, for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information and the development of plans for resolution of an incident;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>operations, for the tasking and application of resources to achieve resolution of an incident; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>logistics, for the acquisition and provision of human and physical resources, facilities, services, and materials to support achievement of incident objectives.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the exercises observed for this study, three main team members or operators were studied, including incident controller (IC) and the officers in charge of the operations and planning functions. Logistics officers were excluded because of unavailability of sufficient data collection equipment.</p>
<p>All exercises were conducted as planned training exercises with the purpose of regular training for the bushfire management personnel. The exercises were conducted in genuine incident control centers. Thus, operators employed usual communication processes they would use in managing real bushfire incidents from the control centers. These processes included communicating information to each other and to other fieldworkers and volunteers via radios and telephones. Participants also used computers, often with multiple screens, for updated fire maps and task checklists and used paper-based reporting tools for updating the fire maps, charts, and boards with current fire status and resource information. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720811431258">Figure 1</xref> shows a bushfire training venue and the use of charts and whiteboards by the participants during an exercise.</p>

<p>In the exercises, a wildfire is reported and an IMT is established. During the course of the exercise, the fire escalates and threatens local assets, such as a forest plantation and a town. The operators then perform the bushfire management activities from the incident control center. During the task, three levels of incident management activity occur randomly:</p>
<list id="list2-0018720811431258" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Low-level task demands, for example, little urgency and processes that are running smoothly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Activity in which the incident escalates; for example, a change in strategy is needed as a result of deteriorating conditions, such as bad weather.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>High level of task demand, for example, urgency and high resource coordination demands.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Each bushfire management exercise was facilitated and monitored by a bushfire management trainer in charge, who observed the operators’ bushfire management activities and arbitrarily presented a subjective rating questionnaire to random operators to rate their experienced cognitive load.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0018720811431258">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 33 male participants (11 teams of three operators) participated in the study. All participants had prior experience in firefighting, and the majority of them also had previous experience in an IMT for bushfire management. All were trained in their role or function and were assumed to be competent for their IMT. All were native English speakers, so English speaking ability differences were assumed to be negligible. The exercises were aimed at personnel’s being able to manage what develops to be a Level 3 incident, which is the highest level of bushfire incident complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018720811431258">Owen et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0018720811431258">
<title>Data Collection and Coding Procedure</title>
<p>The three key roles (IC, operations, and planning officers) were video-recorded, and speech was also captured. We later transcribed the digital audio speech files collected using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018720811431258">Transana (2010)</xref>. Audio captured on the video recorders was also used to verify parts of the dialogue that were difficult to transcribe from the digital audio recorders. The transcribers were instructed not to include personal identification information. The speech transcriptions were then printed in hard copy and given to corresponding bushfire trainers in charge, who coded the transcriptions for cognitive load indication on the basis of their observations and available subjective ratings. The transcriptions were coded for four cognitive load levels according to the following framework developed by the bushfire training experts:</p>
<list id="list3-0018720811431258" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Low load (casual): Participants were involved in communication not related to their task, for example, conversation about personal life.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Medium load (routine): Participants were involved in nonchallenging routine bushfire management tasks.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>High load (challenging): Participants were involved in challenging tasks, for example, handling unexpected events, producing information reports, and completing tasks within time constraints.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Very high load (very challenging): Same as high load; also participants were required to handle disturbances and breakdowns.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A partial sample of an operator transcription annotated with cognitive load is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720811431258">Figure 2</xref>. Operators’ coded transcripts were analyzed by at least three coders, who achieved an interrater reliability of 72%. The coders then discussed further the points of difference in an effort to reach the cognitive load coding framework as described, which resulted in 83% interrater reliability.</p>

</fig>
<p>The electronic versions of transcriptions were then imported into <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720811431258">NVivo (2010)</xref> and coded as per previous manual coding. Then the cognitive load–coded digital transcription file of each operator was processed semiautomatically to extract and separate the operator’s transcription as per each cognitive load level and was saved. These saved files for each operator were then converted semiautomatically to a form usable by Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) automatic text analysis and extraction software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018720811431258">Pennebaker, Chung, Ireland, Gonzales, &amp; Booth, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0018720811431258">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>We conducted detailed analysis of data collected from the study. During the preliminary analysis of the speech transcriptions for all four load levels, we observed that for the low and very high load levels, there were very few transcripts available, and they covered only 6 and 9 of the total 33 operators, respectively. To deal with this insufficiency of data, we merged the low-load data with medium-load data, and very-high-load data with high-load data, by averaging their corresponding participants’ values. We referred to these resulting combined levels as <italic>low load</italic> and <italic>high load</italic>, respectively. Hence, all the statistical analyses and results that follow are based on the data for these two low- and high-load levels.</p>
<p>We used the LIWC tool to automatically extract the linguistic and grammatical features from the operators’ speech transcriptions for both load levels. LIWC extracted the linguistic features as percentages of total words spoken by the operator to deal with operators’ verbosity differences. The software counts the number of words for a specific linguistic or grammatical feature by matching the words from the transcription with its built-in dictionary of linguistic categories. The average dictionary coverage (the percentage of words captured by the dictionary) for the bushfire transcriptions was more than 86%. LIWC has been used by many other studies involving text and/or transcription analyses for purposes other than cognitive load measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018720811431258">Sexton &amp; Helmreich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018720811431258">Stirman &amp; Pennebaker, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section17-0018720811431258">
<title>Word Count</title>
<p>For all operators, the average word count for low-load task was 1,501.91 words, which is lower than that for the high-load task, 1,707.53 words, a difference of 13.69%. Although this trend is exactly as we hypothesized, the difference in the average word count between low-load and high-load levels was not statistically significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0018720811431258">
<title>Words per Sentence</title>
<p>In line with the increased word count, we also expected longer sentences spoken by the operators resulting from more explanations happening with a high-load task. For all bushfire operators, average words per sentence for the low-load task was 9.21 words, which is found to be significantly fewer than that for the high-load task at 11.37 words, a significant difference of 23.44%, shown by a one-tailed <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>t</italic> = −2.92, <italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic> = 1.69, <italic>df</italic> = 32, <italic>p</italic> = .003). This finding suggests an increasing trend of words per sentence, confirming longer sentences and more communication with a high-load task than with a low-load task, as expected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0018720811431258">
<title>Agreement and Disagreement Words</title>
<p>We expected the bushfire operators to show more agreement among each other with low-load tasks than with high-cognitive-load tasks. To test this hypothesis for the study, the average number of agreement words used for the low-load task was found to be 3.48% of total spoken words, significantly higher than that for the high-load task at 2.01%, a difference of −42.07%, shown by a one-tailed <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>t</italic> = 4.93, <italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic> = 1.69, <italic>df</italic> = 32, <italic>p</italic> = .0001). Similarly, the average use of disagreement words for the low-load task is 1.39%, which is significantly lower than that for the high load task at 1.79% (significant difference of 29.19%), shown again by a one-tailed <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>t</italic> = −2.47, <italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic> = 1.69, <italic>df</italic> = 32, <italic>p</italic> = .009).</p>
<p>These results suggest that higher level of cognitive load is associated with decreased agreement and increased disagreement among people working together in a team to solve a problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0018720811431258">
<title>Personal Pronouns</title>
<p>We conducted analysis of the use of personal pronouns to see whether there were any main effects and interaction between cognitive load levels and use of personal pronouns. We expected that bushfire operators would use more singular personal pronouns in a low-load task situation than with a high-load task. We merged first-person singular and third-person singular pronouns together and first-person plural and third-person plural pronouns together and then conducted the following analyses.</p>
<sec id="section21-0018720811431258">
<title>Main effects and interaction between cognitive load and personal pronouns</title>
<p>To check the main effects of the levels of cognitive load (low load vs. high load) and the pronoun types (singular vs. plural pronouns) and the interaction between the two, we performed a two-way repeated-measured ANOVA test.</p>
<p>We found a significant main effect of pronoun type (singular vs. plural pronouns), <italic>F</italic>(1, 65) = 114.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The operators’ use of singular and plural pronouns, on average, was significantly different for low-load and high-load tasks. Specifically, operators used significantly more plural than singular personal pronouns in the high-load situation.</p>
<p>More importantly, the analysis showed that there was a significant interaction between the use of pronoun types (singular and plural) and cognitive load levels (low and high), <italic>F</italic>(1, 65) = 18.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. This finding means that the effect of cognitive load level is different for singular and plural pronouns; that is, operators used more singular pronouns than plural in low-load situations and more plural pronouns than singular in high-load situations, as originally hypothesized. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720811431258">Figure 3</xref> shows the significant main effect and the interaction between cognitive load levels and singular versus plural pronouns.</p>

<title>First-person singular and third-person singular pronouns</title>
<p>The aforementioned analyses showed significant interaction between singular and plural personal pronouns and levels of cognitive load. To further investigate the individual use of different singular pronouns, we conducted simple effects tests. For all operators, their average use of first-person singular pronouns for the low-load task was found to be 2.21% of total words spoken, which is significantly higher than that for the high-load task at 1.6%, a difference of −28%, shown by a one-tailed <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>t</italic> = 1.96, <italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic> = 1.69, <italic>df</italic> = 32, <italic>p</italic> = .02). Similarly, average use of third-person singular pronouns for the low-load task is 0.699%, also significantly higher than that for the high-load task at 0.389% (difference of −44%), shown by a one-tailed <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>t</italic> = 2.27, <italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic> = 1.69, <italic>df</italic> = 32, <italic>p</italic> = .015). These results show a clear trend of overall decreased singular pronoun use linked with increased load.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0018720811431258">
<title>First-person plural and third-person plural pronouns</title>
<p>For all operators, their average use of first-person plural pronouns for the low-load task is 3.20%, which is significantly lower than that for the high-load task at 3.97% (difference of 24%), shown by a one-tailed <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>t</italic> = −2.05, <italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic> = 1.69, <italic>df</italic> = 32, <italic>p</italic> = .02). Similarly, average use of third-person plural pronouns for the low-load task is 1.26%, significantly lower than that for the high-load task at 1.68%, a difference of 33%, shown again by a one-tailed <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>t</italic> = −2.28, <italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic> = 1.69, <italic>df</italic> = 32, <italic>p</italic> = .01). These results demonstrate participants’ overall increased use of plural pronouns for high-load tasks, which shows the need to share the increased load among other team members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0018720811431258">
<title>Second-person pronoun you</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, second-person pronoun <italic>you</italic> can be used for both singular and plural, so the results may be ambiguous. For all operators, we observed that the overall use of the second-person pronoun <italic>you</italic> decreased from 2.46% for the low-load task to 1.86% for high-load tasks, a significant difference of −24%. This result is similar to the behavior of other singular pronouns, but because of its inherent ambiguity in its singularity and/or plurality, it is difficult to conclude whether this difference was attributable to greater use of singular <italic>you</italic> pronouns for low-load tasks.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Analyses of some novel linguistic and grammatical features of cognitive load were carried out. The results confirm that while working collaboratively and performing high-cognitive-load tasks, people speak more with other team members to manage and share the high task complexity. The results show that participants, especially those working in a collaborative team environment, consistently use singular pronouns and plural pronouns differently in different task load situations. Specifically, they used significantly more singular pronouns for low-load tasks than for high-load tasks; that is, the lower the cognitive demand, the greater use of singular pronouns. In contrast, they used significantly more plural pronouns for high-load tasks than for low-load tasks; that is, the higher the cognitive load, the greater use of plural pronouns. These results support the notion that people actually collaborate and coordinate tasks more with each other during highly complex real-world tasks.

<p>The results also suggest that in collaborative interaction situations, when dealing with low-cognitive-load tasks, team members are more confident about the task, prefer to perform tasks individually, and feel more comfortable accepting responsibilities and/or agreeing to the facts or instructions presented by other team members. In contrast, when dealing with complex and high-cognitive-load tasks, they do not agree easily and/or take individual responsibility; rather, they try to involve other team members to share the high and otherwise unmanageable cognitive load. This approach helps them to effectively solve problems during high-load tasks and improve the team’s overall performance by working together and sharing the activities of the task when complexity increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720811431258">Kirschner et al., 2009</xref>). Although these results apply across a variety of people, they may be specific to this combination of tasks in a collaborative bushfire management scenario. Further testing is suggested to confirm that results generalize to other types of applications, such as road or air traffic management tasks.</p>
<p>The linguistic assessment of cognitive load available through analysis of users’ speech is attractive because it offers the potential to provide dynamic support and achieve adaptive system behavior, especially with the availability of appropriate technology for automatic speech recognition. If users experiencing high load can be identified by the system, they can be catered to with extra support, or perhaps through adaptation of the organizational or system behavior, to decrease their overall experienced cognitive load to more manageable levels. For example, in the bushfire management control center scenario, the system may be able to adapt many elements, such as highlighting a critical computer screen or a specific information window, sorting and prioritizing task checklists, showing controlled reminders, filtering e-mail or text messages, redirecting phone calls to the less cognitively loaded operators, and so on.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Future Work</title>
<p>This study provides encouraging evidence and presents some novel linguistic and grammatical features extracted from natural speech as potential indices of users’ experienced cognitive load. These features may be applied to many data-intense and safety-critical task scenarios, such as bushfire management or traffic incident management centers, air traffic control rooms, and call centers, where speech is used as part of day-to-day tasks on the phone or face-to-face. We expect that such promising features can complement other measures of cognitive load, such as physiological or performance features, and form part of a greater multimodal suite of measures acting together as robust indices of cognitive load.</p>
<p>We envisage a system that, after training, would be able to detect and calculate these and other similar speech and linguistic features automatically and to update these at regular intervals, such that an accurate indication of load is available at all times and can be used to update, modify, and adapt information presented to users in real time.</p>
