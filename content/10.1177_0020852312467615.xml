<abstract>
<p>While special advisers play an important role in most Western governments, the research on the subject is limited. This article aims to explain variations in the <italic>ménage à trois</italic> relationships between ministers, senior civil servants and special advisers in two different politico-administrative systems. The theoretical starting point is to conceptualize and explain such trilateral relationships as multiple Public Service Bargains. We find that the differences in Public Service Bargains generate differences in these <italic>ménages à trois</italic> relationships, resulting in different types of functional differentiation as well as differences in the degree of cooperation vis-à-vis conflict. These differences are primarily the result of differences in the interests as well as formal, institutional rules and the competencies of the actors involved. The empirical data include documents as well as interviews with and questionnaires completed by senior civil servants. The countries compared are Belgium and Denmark.</p>
<p><bold>Points for practitioners</bold></p>
<p>Our study confirms that it is important for a ‘ménage à trois’ (ministers, special advisers, SCSs) ‘… to spell out the terms of the bargain applying to political advisers (…)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 128) in order to regulate the relationship between special advisers and SCSs and avoid potential conflicts among them. In addition, the study shows that the number of political appointments plays a role in the relationship. Finally, the study shows that clear differences in the competencies brought to the bargain by the two types of agent may ensure cooperation and mutual respect, whereas an overlapping of competencies may cause rivalry.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0020852312467615" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The permanent senior civil servants (SCSs) in Western democracies are engaged in a ministerial <italic>ménage à trois</italic> in which their relationship with their minister more or less depends on a ministerial adviser whose appointment is based on political criteria other than merit. This reflects the universal need for ministers to have an intimate and politically responsive adviser whom they can trust, a need that seems to become increasingly important for ministers as the number of politically appointed advisers at the apex of bureaucracies in Western democracies increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852312467615">Dahlström, 2009</xref>). While understanding the ministerial <italic>ménage à trois</italic> is therefore vital for understanding the functioning of contemporary government, the research on such advisers is limited (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852312467615">Dahlström, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852312467615">Eichbaum and Shaw, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852312467615">2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Existing research reveals that how the <italic>ménage à trois</italic> is organized and negotiated varies from country to country. The first aim of this article is therefore to contribute to the incipient research on special advisers and identify different types of variation within ministerial <italic>ménage à trois</italic> relationships and explain these variations by investigating why countries with similar political regimes differ in this respect. The countries considered are Belgium and Denmark. The second aim is to contribute to the Public Service Bargain (PSB) literature by specifically considering how a multiple-bargain perspective may explain variations in ministerial <italic>ménages à trois</italic>. As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020852312467615">Lodge (2009: 57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020852312467615">2010: 112)</xref>, it is important to recognize the multiplicity of bargains in contemporary politico-administrative systems. Hence, whereas the PSB perspective primarily addresses how bilateral bargains may be characterized, how they function and how they change, we investigate the trilateral relationship between ministers, SCSs and special advisers.</p>
<p>The next section introduces the theoretical framework, which is followed by a description of the design and methods, followed by national case studies. The article concludes with a comparative discussion and assessment of the theoretical implications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0020852312467615"><title>Theory</title>
<p>PSBs can be defined as ‘explicit or implicit agreements between public servants – the civil or uniformed service of the State – and those they serve. The other partner in such bargains consists of politicians, political parties, clients, and the public at large’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 6). PSBs may include two or more parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852312467615">Hood, 2000</xref>: 10–11, 2001: 20–21). <italic>Ménages à trois</italic> may reflect trilateral relationships in which SCSs serve two different political principals as well as relationships in which the political principal is served by more than one group of servants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852312467615">Hood, 2000</xref>: 10) as, for example, between ministers, SCSs and special advisers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 118). While Hood has elaborated upon <italic>ménage à trois</italic> relationships within managerial PSBs (2000, 2001), few investigations of such relationships within other types of bargain have been carried out. In this article, we argue that differences in multiple PSBs, including agency and trustee bargains and especially the differences in the interests of the actors involved in the bargains, possibly explain differences in <italic>ménage à trois</italic> relationships. However, PSBs are also part of the framework for conceptualizing the different types of <italic>ménages à trois</italic> as the degree to which the respective relationships are subject to various types of cheating behaviour. The PSB literature has discussed cheating in the relationships between ministers and agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312467615">Hood, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852312467615">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>). Special advisers’ cheating behaviour in relation to civil servants has, however, received less attention, for which reason we include the literature on administrative politicization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852312467615">Eichbaum and Shaw, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852312467615">2010a</xref>). The theoretical model is reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020852312467615">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-0020852312467615" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The theoretical model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020852312467615-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>In the next part of the theory, we introduce different types of PSB and consider various examples of cheating behaviour.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0020852312467615"><title>Public Service Bargains</title>
<p>Bargains may be of either a trustee or an agency type of PSB.</p>
<p>In trustee bargains of a consociational type, the civil service constitutes a representative bureaucracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020852312467615">Kingsly, 1944</xref>) in a divided society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 21) acting as trustees loyal to a constitutional order and being ‘above politics’. In addition to the relationship between the minister per se and the civil service, this bargain also involves the civil servant’s relationship with society in general, where the civil service is ‘expected to act as independent judges of the public good (i.e. interests of their beneficiaries) to some significant extent, and not merely to take their orders from some political masters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 26).</p>
<p>The civil service provides what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852312467615">Kaufman (1956)</xref> defines as ‘neutral competence’, meaning the ability to ‘do the work of government expertly, and to do it according to explicit, objective standards rather than to personal or party or other obligations and loyalties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312467615">Aberbach and Rockman, 1994</xref>: 461; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312467615">Eichbaum and Shaw, 2010b</xref>: 8–9). Hence, civil servants are not functionally politicized, since they do not perform functions that are formally considered essentially political. Formal politicization – formal rules allowing recruiting based on political or party-political criteria – is also absent from this type of bargain.</p>
<p>In agency bargains, the civil service is loyal to either successive ministers (serial loyalty), the Schafferian type, or to a specific minister (personal loyalty), the Hybrid type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312467615">Hood, 2001</xref>: 16; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 21). In both cases, civil servants are expected to act at the ‘bidding of the politicians for whom they work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 53). Both represent partnership loyalty, which does not give the civil service any formal autonomy or discretionary power in relation to the minister but does provide access to a relationship with the minister based on trust and confidentiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 116–120). This trust may be unproblematic if the partnership is combined with personal loyalty, as the adviser comes and goes with the minister. If combined with serial loyalty, however, where loyalty is granted to successive ministers, the partnership may, as Hood and Lodge suggest, be described as serial monogamy, where the service is able to ‘act as confidant to successive ministers and governments from different political parties or with different political views and styles’ (2006: 117). Hence, one might expect the degree of trust to be higher in a Hybrid than in a Schafferian type of agency bargain. When the civil servant is an agent of successive ministers, the competence required is again ‘neutral competence’. If the bargain is of a hybrid type, the central competence is that which Eichbaum and Shaw define as ‘responsive competence’ (2010b: 8–9, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312467615">Aberbach and Rockman, 1994)</xref>. This type of competence reflects an ability to assess politics and read situations characterizing the political landscape in which the minister takes action and has to form coalitions, as well as to identify and navigate politically risky situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 102).</p>
<p>Schafferian bargains are not formally politicized, as the permanent civil service is recruited on the basis of merit. Moreover, this bargain is characterized by the absence of functional politicization, as the competence provided is ‘neutral’. In hybrid bargains, agents are recruited to specific functions, which are functionally politicized, for example, as the intimate political adviser to the minister. Furthermore, they are generally recruited on the basis of political criteria and therefore formally politicized.</p>
<p>As reflected above, the basic idea in a bargain perspective is that different types of agent bring different types of competencies to the bargain, as this is essentially what the agent provides in return for a confidential relationship with the minister. A tri-lateral relationship including one political principal and different types of agents therefore presupposes that the latter are involved in different aspects of the politico-bureaucratic exchanges, where personal loyalist types, such as special advisers, possessing a responsive competence, may be more competent to be engaged in the politicized aspects of these exchanges than their serial loyal colleagues in the permanent bureaucracy. In turn, permanent civil servants are expected to bring neutral, expert competencies to the exchange.</p>
<p>Although any PSB is the product of administrative legacies, it is also the result of actors negotiating and maximizing their interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020852312467615">Lodge, 2010</xref>: 112). From a PSB perspective, the basic interests of political principals regarding their relationship with SCSs and special advisers, respectively, are to ensure political responsiveness at minimum cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312467615">Hood, 2001</xref>: 17) in order to minimize policy initiatives being subjected to different types of ‘bureaucratic politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020852312467615">Peters, 2001</xref>) as well as safeguarding the ultimate interest of the government: being re-elected. However, the general interest in ensuring political responsiveness may be balanced against an interest in receiving expert knowledge from the permanent civil service. The PSB perspective has previously overlooked the interests of the permanent civil service, even though the latter may play an important role in shaping and changing PSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852312467615">Salomonsen and Knudsen, 2011</xref>). Ideally, the interest of the permanent civil service in both trustee and agency bargains of the Schafferian type is to bring the best expert knowledge to the policy decisions made by the minister. In addition, the interest of the SCS in a trustee bargain is also to safeguard the interests of society in general. Turning to the special advisers, as the agents in a personal loyalty relationship, they may be regarded as ‘an extension of their minister’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312467615">Aucoin, 2010</xref>: 87), for which reason they might be expected to share the minister’s interests in maximizing the political responsiveness of the permanent civil service.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0020852312467615"><title>Cheating and administrative politicization</title>
<p>From a PSB perspective, bargaining relationships involve parties that either deliver or cheat. As these behavioural options exist for all of the parties involved, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852312467615">Table 1</xref> we delineate four possible outcomes of cheating and delivering behaviour in the ministerial <italic>ménages à trois</italic>.

<fn id="table-fn1-0020852312467615"><p><italic>Source</italic>: Adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>:158.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap></p>
<p>When both parties deliver, we have a balanced bargain characterized by mutual trust, cooperation and mutual respect. In the opposite situation, however, where both parties cheat, the bargain is characterized by distrust and conflict. Yet while distrust also characterizes the final two outcomes in which one of the parties cheats and the other delivers, they may not necessarily be characterized by conflict.</p>
<p>Cheating behaviour differs in different types of bargain. In trustee bargains, the SCSs might cheat by promoting particular interests, which goes against their original mandate to act as ‘the social glue’ in a divided society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312467615">Hood, 2001</xref>: 19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 162). For their part, ministers may cheat by ‘undermining’ the representativeness of the civil service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312467615">Hood, 2001</xref>: 19). In serial agency bargains, the SCS may cheat either by being disloyal to the incumbent minister by including party-political considerations or considerations based on institutional interests and bureaucratic politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020852312467615">Peters, 2001</xref>); in their advice or behaviour, such as performing ‘policy sabotage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312467615">Hood, 2001</xref>: 19); leaking information to the press or even the opposition; or mobilizing interest groups and the like against the policy proposed by ministers. They may also be reluctant to obey ministers’ orders, possibly reflected in a slow response. Ministers’ cheating behaviour may be party-political in nature if recruitment and promotion decisions within a merit bureaucracy are based on party-political criteria.</p>
<p>Special advisers in a personal agency bargain may also demonstrate disloyal behaviour towards the minister by leaking sensitive material to the media or others concerning both the minister’s policy and person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312467615">Hood, 2001</xref>: 19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 165). The minister might cheat, either by blaming special advisers for their own failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 165) or by failing to support their <italic>protégés</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312467615">Hood, 2001</xref>: 19), for example when they enter the ministerial bureaucracy.</p>
<p>To conceptualize that ‘perceptions or accusations of cheating may come about’ in relationships between personal loyalists (special advisers) and serial loyalists (permanent civil service), we introduce the concept of administrative politicization, which identifies how ministerial advisers affect the advice provided to the minister by the SCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852312467615">Eichbaum and Shaw, 2008</xref>: 343, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312467615">2010c</xref>: 135–136). When the relationship between the SCS and the special adviser is characterized by administrative politicization, the SCS’s advice to the minister is in practice subordinate to the advice provided by special advisers. Distinguishing between administrative politicization related to the policy process and policy content, the concept entails both a procedural and a substantial dimension. In the procedural dimension, special advisers prevent the SCS giving advice in what Eichbaum and Shaw describe as ‘a free, frank, and fearless manner’ (2008: 343), for instance by preventing advice from SCS reaching the minister’s desk or questioning the competence of the civil service. The substantial dimension implies that the advice from the permanent civil service may be ‘coloured’ by partisan aspects by ministerial advisers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852312467615">Eichbaum and Shaw, 2008</xref>: 343–344, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312467615">2010c</xref>: 135–136), for example changing the content of advice from the civil service or intervening directly in a department’s operations.</p>

<p>The research is most-similar in design, as we have chosen Denmark and Belgium on the grounds that, despite many similarities with respect to their respective political regimes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852312467615">Table 2</xref>), they exhibit different PSBs (the independent variable). In Denmark, we find a PSB combining serial- and personal-agency bargains, whereas we find a PSB combining serial- and personal agency bargains with a trustee bargain in Belgium.

<p>The empirical data were collected as part of a comparative project on PSBs, including identical questionnaires completed by SCSs in the two countries (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soc.kuleuven.be/io/eng/research/hrm21.htm">http://soc.kuleuven.be/io/eng/research/hrm21.htm</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For the Danish case, some of the data were collected by expert committees established by the Danish Parliament and consist of two surveys conducted in 1997/1998 and 2003 distributed to all of the ministers and permanent secretaries. Information provided by the ministries regarding the functioning and organizational position of special advisers, collected by the National Audit Office (<italic>Rigsrevisionen</italic>), is also included. In addition, all of the permanent secretaries were asked to participate in a survey and an in-depth interview. Of the 19 permanent secretaries at the time, 10 completed the survey and 13 participated in interviews, corresponding to response rates of 53 and 68 percent, respectively. These data were collected between June 2009 and March 2010. The interviews were anonymous, but each respondent was given a number, which is included as a reference in the subsequent analysis. Data on the special advisers’ functions and occupational and educational background were obtained from the website of the Prime Minister’s Office.</p>
<p>For the Belgian case study, the data presented originated from desk research, a survey of open and closed questions, and in-depth interviews carried out between March and May 2009 with the most senior civil servants in the federal civil service. Of the 13 presidents of the federal public services, 11 (i.e. 85 percent) agreed to participate in the research.</p>

<p>The Danish government is organized according to the principle of ministerial governance, with the ministers acting as the political head of the ministerial bureaucracy and having the formal authority and responsibility for decisions taken within the ministry. The bureaucracy is based on merit. Until the mid-twentieth century, the service was not subject to any politicization mechanisms. Nowadays, however, the PSB combines a serial-loyalist agency bargain with elements from a personal-loyalist bargain. The civil service is loyal to successive ministers and provides neutral expertise, but the bargain further implies that it has responsive competence, and the SCSs, in particular, act as the minister’s intimate and confidential advisers on policy and political tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852312467615">Salomonsen and Knudsen, 2011</xref>), except advice on party politics. In spite of this growing functional politicization, formal politicization in the civil service does not exist, either formally or in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020852312467615">Christensen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Since at least 1998, most Danish civil servants have been part of a ministerial <italic>ménage à trois</italic>. In 1998, an expert committee established by the <italic>Folketing</italic> published a White Paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312467615">Ministry of Finance, 1998</xref>) which generally legitimizes ministers’ recruitment of a single special adviser. In 2004, another committee published a second White Paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312467615">Ministry of Finance, 2004</xref>) emphasizing that ‘special advisers are subject to the same requirements of legality, obligation to speak the truth and professional standards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312467615">Ministry of Finance, 2004: 283–284</xref>) as SCSs, although special advisers may provide party-political advice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312467615">Ministry of Finance, 2004</xref>: 287). Furthermore, special advisers enter a personal loyalty bargain with the minister, as they are exclusively appointed by the minister, and their employment is tied to the minister’s term in office. Most, although not all, ministers now employ a special adviser.</p>
<p>Although special advisers represent formal politicization, recruitment practices reveal a more complex picture, as political criteria are applied alongside professional criteria. Hence, in 2009, 47 percent of the advisers held a degree in journalism, whereas 40 percent held a degree in the social sciences, indicating that both competencies related to political communications (journalists) and politics (social scientists) are of importance when recruiting special advisers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020852312467615">Hustedt and Salomonsen, 2011</xref>). In 2010, seven of the 17 advisers had previously been employed by the ministers’ party (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.sst.dk">www.sst.dk</ext-link>, consulted 11 January 2010), indicating that some ministers recruit advisers with whom they share party-political affiliations. These mixed findings are also reflected in the formal descriptions of the advisers in 2010, as most are described as advisers on media and political communications issues (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.sst.dk">www.sst.dk</ext-link>, consulted 11 January 2010). There is a relatively high degree of correspondence between the formal descriptions of special advisers’ functions and the qualitative accounts provided by the permanent secretaries. However, the qualitative accounts reveal that special advisers who are formally described as also being political advisers primarily provide political advice relating to the minister’s party. Hence, of the 12 qualitative accounts of the special adviser’s function provided by their permanent secretaries, two primarily provide advice in relation to the minister’s party (interviews 6 and 8), three primarily provide advice on the minister’s relations with the media (interviews 4, 5 and 10), four provide a combination of the two (interviews 7, 9, 12 and 13), and three provide political advice as well as advice on the media and political communications (interviews 1, 2 and 3). Although the interviews reveal that special advisers are more engaged in political advice than reflected in the formal descriptions, most of these are primarily providing advice pertaining to party politics, and most of them bring expertise regarding political communications to the bargain. This indicates a functional differentiation between SCSs and special advisers regarding advice, as SCSs are reluctant to give advice on the former (party politics) and are not generally competent to provide advice on the latter (political communications). This functional differentiation further implies that special advisers are not deeply integrated into the core activity of the ministry: the development of and advice regarding policy. According to the survey, the permanent secretary is the individual primarily responsible for assisting and advising the minister on the initiation, implementation and inter-departmental coordination of policy initiatives. For example, six permanent secretaries have indicated on this part of the survey report that they are responsible for this coordination, and only one of the six permanent secretaries mentions the special adviser as having any role in putting new policy initiatives onto the political agenda.</p>
<p>The Danish multiple bargain arrangement represents a number of different interests. The ministers’ main interest is to ensure that they receive competent advice that also reflects a degree of political responsiveness. Danish ministers are generally satisfied with the advice they receive from SCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312467615">Ministry of Finance, 2004</xref>: 76–77). However, they find the advice on political communications somewhat insufficient, for which reason the appointment of special advisers, as reflected in the analysis above, primarily represents an attempt to introduce competencies regarding political communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312467615">Ministry of Finance, 2004</xref>: 29).</p>
<p>SCSs are primarily interested in preserving their role as the primary adviser to the minister, since they value the political aspects of their job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852312467615">Salomonsen and Knudsen, 2011</xref>). Hence, Danish SCSs are not merely ‘reactive mandarins’ who have responded to a growing demand to bring more responsive competence into the bargain with the minister; for the most part, they have also welcomed this development in their portfolio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852312467615">Salomonsen and Knudsen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The interests of special advisers have not been systematically investigated. As there is only one special adviser per ministry (and none in some), we might question their ability to ensure political responsiveness from SCSs which is against the service’s interests.</p>
<p>Cheating behaviour in the relationship between the minister and the permanent civil service is considered extremely rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312467615">Ministry of Finance, 1998</xref>: 130). The bargain between these two parties therefore represents a ‘cooperative equilibrium’, characterized by mutual trust and cooperation, with both delivering what is expected of them under the terms of the bargain.</p>
<p>Both of the aforementioned White Papers consider the possibility of special advisers causing procedural administrative politicization and emphasize the importance of the formal rules prescribing that the special adviser is subordinate to the permanent secretary, although the adviser should be given some latitude by the permanent secretary when providing advice to the minister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312467615">Ministry of Finance, 2004</xref>: 187). Moreover, the White Paper explains that special advisers may not provide instructions regarding the substantial (professional) content of notes, speeches and so forth produced by the permanent civil service for the minister. The White Paper also stresses the importance of keeping the permanent civil service as primary political advisers to the ministers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312467615">Ministry of Finance, 2004</xref>: 284). These rules may prevent procedural administrative politicization.</p>
<p>According to the National Audit Office, special advisers are also in practice subordinate to permanent secretaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020852312467615">National Audit Office, 2009</xref>: 24), indicating a low degree of procedural administrative politicization.</p>
<p>This is also the conclusion reached based on the interviews, as none of the permanent secretaries report that their superior position in relation to the special advisers is questioned by either the special adviser or the minister. The permanent secretaries primarily report positive experiences with the special advisers, generally recognizing the value of the function they perform.</p>
<p>One of the permanent secretaries reports on how they begin the cooperation with a special adviser by introducing the adviser to the guiding rules described in the 2004 White Paper (interview 9). Another permanent secretary reports that the special adviser was not initially informed about their position in relation to the rest of the civil service, meaning that the permanent secretary had to intervene and stop the special adviser from directly interfering in departmental operations (interview 7). These incidents reflect teething problems, however, rather than administrative politicization. The relative importance of the SCS’s advice relative to the special adviser is also reflected in the fact that seven permanent secretaries who have fulfilled the survey report that they meet with the minister alone, if not every day (4) then every week (3). Hence, many advisory situations between the minister and the permanent secretary did not include the special adviser. The formal rule subordinating the special adviser to the permanent secretary appears to be an effective regulatory mechanism ensuring a non-conflictual relationship between the two types of agent.</p>
<p>In terms of substantial politicization, the permanent secretaries do not report any instances of special advisers adding partisan interest or inappropriately interfering in the advice given by the permanent secretaries. However, this does not alter the fact that partisan advice is in fact provided by some special advisers, as noted earlier. However, such advice is not given at the expense of the advice provided by the permanent secretary. One of the permanent secretaries thus describes how they include the special adviser’s partisan advice on their own (interview 7). Nevertheless, the functional division between the special adviser and the permanent secretaries is not always unambiguous, as issues related to the minister’s role as party politician and media issues are not always inseparable from advice on political strategies and tactics (interview 3).</p>
<p>Finally, on their own admission, it should be added that the limited administrative politicization experienced by the permanent secretaries depends on the number of special advisers (interviews 1 and 2).</p>
<p>Summing up, the Danish ministerial <italic>ménage à trois</italic> reflects a multiple bargain arrangement, including both serial- and personal-loyalty bargains. The relationships are characterized by mutual trust and respect for the competences each party brings to the <italic>ménage à trois</italic>. The relationship between the civil service and special advisers is therefore more accurately described as complementary rather than competitive or even conflicting. Special advisers do not pose a threat to the neutrality of the permanent civil service or lessen the importance of the advice provided by the permanent civil service. On the contrary, as Page and Wright suggest, they advise on matters in which the permanent civil service is either unable or reluctant to do so (2007). Contrary to the theoretical expectation, both types of agent enjoy a high degree of trust with the minister. Hence, the Danish <italic>ménage à trois</italic> reflects a ‘cooperative equilibrium’ serving the interests of both the minister and SCSs. Ministers are satisfied with the advice they receive from SCSs, including their political responsiveness. SCSs have been able to safeguard their interests by preserving their role as primary adviser to the minister, with the exception of advice on the media and advice purely relating to the minister as a party politician. Accepting a special adviser has contributed to the stable character of the bargain, as the special adviser can protect the SCSs from ministers also demanding party-political advice, which would seriously threaten their ability to balance both the quest for ‘neutral’ and ‘responsive’ competencies in their combined serial–personal loyalty bargain.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0020852312467615"><title>Belgium</title>
<p>The Belgian model of public administration can be regarded as a Weberian bureaucratic system that was originally significantly influenced by the French Napoleonic tradition. Political power is concentrated at the top, and all of the state administration structures must report to the minister and their personal advisers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852312467615">Dierickx, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020852312467615">Stenmans, 1999</xref>). There has always been a strict division of labour between politicians and senior civil servants.</p>
<p>Senior officials take their orders from successive ministers. Their respective careers – competencies and rewards – have been fixed by the government by means of a royal decree since the ‘Camu’ reform of 1937. This means that, in theory, changes are easily made, since they depend on government decisions. According to Hood and Lodge’s typology, senior civil servants can therefore to some degree be regarded as ‘agents’ of their political masters and be characterized as ‘serial loyalists’.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Belgian model borrows several elements from the consociational, trustee type of bargain. First, the parity rule between high-ranking French- and Dutch-speaking civil servants can be seen as a means of ensuring a balance of power in order to preserve the Belgian state. Second, until recently, senior officials enjoyed permanent tenure, and were thus not wholly dependent on the government of the day. Third, even if there are few limitations on the political activities of civil servants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852312467615">Hondeghem, 2011</xref>), they (and the social groups they represent) are expected to be loyal to the state in exchange for their ‘fair share’ in the bureaucracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852312467615">De Visscher et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>After the federal elections in 1999, the new cabinet launched the ambitious Copernicus reform, which was designed to modernize the federal administration in several areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020852312467615">Hondeghem and Depré, 2005</xref>). One of these was to redefine the relationship between the minister and senior civil servants. Life tenure was abandoned in favour of fixed-term contracts (six years, renewable) for the three upper grades of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Senior civil servants are appointed in accordance with the civil service statutes and special laws, but political criteria have always played a substantial role in the recruitment and promotion of leading civil servants. Since the Copernicus reform, office-holders are appointed following a comparative selection procedure operated under the auspices of SELOR, the public sector recruitment agency. Even though ministers have less room for political manoeuvre than before the reform, the results of the initial selections revealed that party-political criteria still carry weight when it comes to picking candidates in the final stage. Among the 14 vacant positions for president of the new ministerial departments, only one went to a candidate from the private sector, and two to candidates close to the Christian-Democratic opposition parties. The other posts were allocated to members of ministerial cabinets or former secretaries-general with a party affiliation close to the political persuasion of the ruling coalition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852312467615">Molitor and de Visscher, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Ministerial cabinets have existed for a very long time in Belgium. Formal politicization does, of course, exist for the special advisers: each minister or secretary of state chooses their own staff as long as they do not exceed the budget allocated for this purpose. Cabinet members usually come from the political parties or interest groups or they are recruited from among trusted civil servants who are on secondment from their administrative unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852312467615">Brans et al., 2006</xref>). Their educational background is heterogeneous, since they are the main personal policy advisers of the ministers. Hence, their competences are not only of a responsive nature, they also bring competencies reflecting the ministerial portfolio to the bargain. Exact figures concerning the staff of ministerial cabinets are not publicized. The overall size of a minister’s personal staff varies from around 50 to 80 persons, but it is important to note that the proportion of policy advisers inside the ministerial cabinets has been growing over recent years, almost doubling from 1989 (13.8/minister) to 2004 (28/minister) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852312467615">Pelgrims and Dereu, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Members of the cabinet originally advised the minister only on the minister’s personal affairs: links to his constituency, relations with the media and the party. The scope of their activities expanded as time passed, and they now provide technical expertise as well as advice related to party politics to their minister and they take on a very important role in coordinating public policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852312467615">De Winter and Dumont, 2006</xref>). As Simon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852312467615">James (2007)</xref> notes:<disp-quote>
<p>The cabinet differs from the political advisor systems described above in that it not only advises the minister but also provides political direction and management to the entire ministry. It issues instructions to the ministry in the minister’s name, and its leading members usually have the right to sign documents on the minister’s behalf, will often represent him/her at external events and will be regarded as speaking in his/her name, both within and outside the ministry.</p></disp-quote>Political office-holders may indeed cheat by means of party-political appointments of senior civil servants. The new appointment procedure leaves some scope for doing so, and most authors agree that, in practice, the mandate system has not permanently abolished informal politicization.</p>
<p>Ministers may also be tempted to shift the blame to their SCS. In our survey, we asked the presidents of the federal public services (= former secretaries-general) to give their opinion on the following statement: ‘When things go wrong in this organization, it is the minister who is responsible’. According to the principle of ministerial responsibility, it stands to reason that the minister is responsible whatever the circumstances. However, since the Copernicus reform, senior managers enjoy – at least on paper – more autonomy and take responsibility for mistakes, putting the former principle under pressure. It is interesting to note that 55 percent of the presidents ‘disagree’ or ‘strongly disagree’ with the above statement. The remaining 45 percent choose the middle position – ‘neither agree nor disagree’ – arguing that the ‘culprit’ would depend on the kind of mistake. One interviewee said:<disp-quote>
<p>If it is an operational problem, it is primarily the local director who is responsible, then (upwards) the director-general and then myself. If it is more of a political problem, then the minister has to take responsibility. Management problems are not the responsibility of the minister, but of the management. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852312467615">Van Dorpe et al., 2011</xref>)</p></disp-quote>However, very few civil servants have ever received a sanction for mistakes.</p>
<p>Finally, since cooperation between ministers and top officials coming from different political parties is commonplace, this situation occasionally generates distrust in the bargaining process between politicians and high-ranking civil servants. Although senior civil servants, once in office, demonstrate a high degree of ‘political alienation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852312467615">Dierickx and Majersdorf, 1993</xref>), ministers nevertheless fear that they would in fact serve their older political master.</p>
<p>Members of the cabinet may also be tempted to cheat, since there is no clear functional differentiation between the cabinet’s role and the SCS’s domain. Nowadays, policy collaborators offer technical expertise as well as advice pertaining to party politics. Moreover, they intervene in all phases of the policy process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852312467615">de Visscher et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852312467615">Pelgrims, 2008</xref>), so that we can speak of a ‘functional colonization’ of the SCS’s prerogatives taking place.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Danish case, where special advisers are subordinate to the permanent secretary, there is clearly a steering relationship between ministerial cabinets and the federal ministries in Belgium. Consequently, procedural as well as substantial administrative politicization has become the rule rather than the exception. It is therefore not surprising that the presidents see themselves more as managers or leaders of their organization than as policy advisers. They all scored very low on this scale (mean = 4/10, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.41).</p>
<p>However, some of our respondents stated that they were more involved in policy-making than before. On a scale of 0 (the minister is in charge and the senior civil servants do not participate) to 10 (the SCS is in charge), the presidents that we interviewed rated their participation in policy-making as 4.3/10 (4.5 for the implementation phase), meaning that they usually participate in the process in coordination with the minister and their staff. But they rarely meet with the minister alone:<disp-quote>
<p>We have very little direct contact with the minister and all of the contact with him is prepared by the cabinet … The cabinet acts as a filter every time … it carries out the final quality control on any proposal from the administration entering the minister’s office.</p></disp-quote>So says one president. The presidents meet the strategic cell more regularly than the minister, with the frequency of meetings ranging on average from ‘monthly’ to ‘weekly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852312467615">Van Dorpe et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of respondents in our survey believe that their relations with the minister and the minister’s personal staff are generally cooperative. An average of 8.4/10 for this question means that there is a very good level of cooperation. This observation is confirmed by the fact that only 18 percent of the presidents consider that ‘the strategic cell interferes in the work of the senior officials’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852312467615">Van Dorpe et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To sum up, the Belgian ministerial <italic>ménage à trois</italic> reflects an unbalanced bargaining arrangement between politicians and civil servants. The ambiguous situation caused by the absence of a clear division of labour between the SCSs and the ministerial cabinets is in the interest of the minister. The members of a ministerial cabinet provide them with flexible policy support and specific expertise and are unconditionally loyal. On the other hand, since party-political nominations are widespread among the SCSs, ministers are reluctant to work closely with their top officials and to reduce the size of their ministerial cabinets. The way things are going, they encourage a vicious circle in which the civil servants are forced to become party members and exercise responsibilities in a ministerial cabinet to satisfy their personal career ambitions and, consequently, to bring the politicians and political parties to promote the officials they have trained in the cabinets. Because the SCSs are resigned or apathetic towards cheating behaviour perpetrated by the minister and the cabinet, the Belgian <italic>ménage à trois</italic> reflects a potentially ‘conflicting disequilibrium’ serving the interests of the minister and special advisers.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the ‘window of opportunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312467615">Kingdon, 1995</xref>) offered by the Copernicus reform to rebalance the relationship between politicians and civil servants is closed. Personal advisers or ministerial cabinets are no longer a salient issue on the political agenda.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0020852312467615" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The first and primarily empirical aim of this article was to conceptualize and explain variations within ministerial <italic>ménages à trois</italic> in Denmark and Belgium. The second, more theoretical, aim was to identify different types of ministerial <italic>ménages à trois</italic> elsewhere than in the managerial bargain as well as investigating the extent to which a multiple-bargain perspective might possibly explain variations in a <italic>ménage à trois</italic>.</p>
<p>Regarding the empirical ambitions, our analysis has demonstrated that the multiple bargains in Denmark (combining serial- and personal-agency bargains) and Belgium (combining serial- and personal-agency bargains with a trustee bargain) each generate different types of ministerial <italic>ménage à trois</italic>.</p>
<p>In Denmark, the <italic>ménage à trois</italic> is typically complementary, cooperative. The number of personal advisers is very low, most of them trained as journalists. Each type of agent has its own field of intervention: political advice combined with the neutral competence of providing expert knowledge of the ministerial portfolio for SCSs, media and party-political advice for special advisers. This reflects a functional differentiation between the two types of agent’s contribution to the politico-bureaucratic exchange, which resembles a classic line-staff organizing principle in which the staff are not integrated into the core production of the ministry, namely policy development and policy advice. However, it does not exhibit any substantial degree of classical conflict relating to the functional differentiation between the line and the staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312467615">Dalton, 1950</xref>: 350), nor does it result in a decrease in both the formal and actual power of the line officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852312467615">Scott, 2003</xref>: 239). Although these special advisers are under the direct responsibility of the permanent secretary, both have a mutual interest in maintaining a trusting relationship between themselves and the third party (the minister). Administrative politicization is very low, since special advisers are neither formally nor in practice in a position to interfere in the relationship between the minister and the minister’s senior civil servants. Cheating is also absent, as neither the minister nor the SCSs have any incentive to carry out such behaviour, as the interests of both parties seem to be handled.</p>
<p>In Belgium, we are faced with a potentially conflicting relationship in favour of the minister and their cabinet. Special advisers are numerous and administrative politicization is widespread, since these advisers, due to their competencies regarding the ministerial portfolio, do not confine their activities to media relations and are involved in and colonize all stages of the policy process. And as ‘an extension of their minister’ in a superior position in relation to the SCSs, they constantly pressure these civil servants in order to ensure political responsiveness. In addition, ministers ‘cheat’ in some cases by introducing party-political criteria in the final stage of the selection process of senior officials. Consequently, most of the SCSs are resigned or apathetic, since they are not in a position to alter the bargain significantly. And as the conflicting bargain apparently serves the interests of the minister, they have no incentive to change the bargain; the failure of the Copernicus reform bears witness to this.</p>
<p>The two types of ministerial <italic>ménage à trois</italic> are reflected in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020852312467615">Table 3</xref>.

<p>In a more general vein, the article has demonstrated how different types of ministerial <italic>ménage à trois</italic> may be identified according to two dimensions: The first dimension relates to the degree of cooperation vis-à-vis conflict reflected in the degree of cheating vis-à-vis delivery. The second dimension relates to the division of labour reflected as functional differentiation vis-à-vis colonization of the advice provided by the two types of agent in the politico-bureaucratic exchange.</p>
<p>Turning to the theoretical ambition – extending the bargain literature by investigating trilateral relationships in multiple-bargain arrangements – by extending our investigations to cheating practices and administrative politicization, we come to the conclusion that <italic>ménage à trois</italic> relationships depend on the combination of the interests of the actors involved in the multiple bargains. This enables us to explain why some relationships are characterized by mutual trust and cooperation between the actors, while others are characterized by distrust, conflict and cheating. However, the analysis also reveals that the type of competencies and formal and/or institutional rules regulating the relationship between the two types of agent may have an impact on the type of <italic>ménage à trois</italic>. Hence, the article demonstrates how different multiple bargains generate different types of complex or combined interest structures, which apparently – in combination with the different types of competencies brought to the bargain as well as the formal and institutional rules in which the multiplicity of the bargain is embedded and regulated – generates different types of ministerial <italic>ménage à trois</italic>. Finally, the article has demonstrated the importance of combining the institutional and interest-based explanations as reflected in the PSB perspective when investigating and explaining relations between not only SCSs and ministers, but also special advisers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our contribution confirms how important it is for such a <italic>ménage à trois</italic> ‘to spell out the terms of the bargain applying to political advisers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312467615">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 128) in order to regulate the relationship between special advisers and SCSs and avoid potential conflicts among them.</p>
<p>Of course, the empirical results have limitations. Our observations rely mainly on accounts from SCSs. It would be interesting to take into account the opinion of the minister and the special adviser. Also, possible variations in the bargain according to policy domains have not been investigated. One might expect that the more the policy domain of any given ministry is politicized in the sense of attracting substantial political, public and media attention, the more the ministerial <italic>ménage à trois</italic> is challenged in order to cooperate when responding to the environment.</p>
<p>Finally, our theoretical conclusions are limited by the fact that the study only includes two types of multiple bargain, including one political principal and two types of agent. Future research should include different types of multiple bargain, reflecting different actors (for example, heads of agencies), different combinations of interests, competencies and/or institutional regulation to further validate both the dimensions suggested for characterizing the <italic>ménage à trois</italic> relationships as well as the explanatory value of the PSB.</p>
