<p><italic>Aims</italic>: The onset and progression of the autoimmune process leading to type 1 diabetes is partly dependent on genetic predisposition and partly on environmental factors. We have implemented a study design where 1-year-old children, from two equally sized, neighbouring but socioeconomically different cities, were compared for the induction of beta-cell autoantibodies. <italic>Methods</italic>: This study comprises 2448 newborn infants, all living in the urban parts of the twin cities, followed prospectively with regular biological samples and questionnaires in a major population-based study. Of these, a random sample of 1497 children were tested for tyrosine phosphatase (IA-2A) and 1409 children for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA). Other documented risk factors of beta-cell autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes, such as family characteristics, dietary factors, and psychosocial factors were also included in the analysis. <italic>Results</italic>: The risk for diabetes-related autoantibodies, both against GADA and IA-2A (&gt;95% cut off), was significantly higher (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) among children from the blue-collar than from the white-collar city. This difference persisted still after adjustment for other previously documented risk factors. Some of these previously known risk factors remained significant in the multivariate analysis as independent explanatory factors, in addition to living in a blue-collar city. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>:</bold> <bold>Factors in the social environment could trigger the induction of diabetes-related autoantibodies in 1-year-old children. These results point out that our present knowledge of factors influencing the autoimmune process might be widen to also include factors in the social environment of the community.</bold></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>For a remarkably large number of our major non-infectious diseases, we still do not know the cause and research is often directed to find markers of individual susceptibility. But when there are differences in risks between defined populations, we also have to look for factors up-stream in the chain of causes. Thus, the individual risk should not be seen separately from the risk of the population to which the individual is a member [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435491">1</xref>]. This is in accordance with the so called “bio-psychosocial health model” introduced by Engel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435491">2</xref>]. The social environment’s effect on health often appears to have the status of an unspecified black box that remains after investigators have controlled for a range of individual characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435491">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435491">4</xref>].</p>
<p>The onset and progression of the autoimmune process leading up to type 1 diabetes (T1D) in young children seems to depend largely on environmental factors, even though genetic predisposition plays a role. There are observations concerning T1D that can hardly be explained by genetic factors: incidence varies greatly with an almost 15-fold difference between European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435491">5</xref>]; risks tend to increase among populations that move from a low- to a high-incidence area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435491">6</xref>]; and monozygotic twins indicate the pairwise concordance for T1D (&lt;40%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435491">7</xref>]. These trends imply a need to focus on the relative importance of factors in the social environment for T1D risk.</p>
<p>The exogenous factors that trigger and/or potentate the autoimmune process in T1D are not fully known, but some environmental factors have been suggested. Virus infections certainly play a role, both as an acute cause of T1D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435491">8</xref>] with infections during pregnancy contributing to diabetes many years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435491">9</xref>]. Increased hygiene is suggested to contribute to the development of T1D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435491">10</xref>] and an imbalance of the immune system may be a common background to the effect of several other possible environmental factors. Several studies indicate that exposure to cow milk proteins during the first months of the child’s life increases the risk of T1D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435491">11</xref>] while long-term breastfeeding seems to be protective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811435491">12</xref>]. There are also data suggesting that gluten exposure may play a role for the onset of T1D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811435491">13</xref>]. Furthermore, high bodyweight and faster weight gain in infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494811435491">14</xref>] may increase the risk to develop T1D in genetically predisposed individuals, the so-called accelerator hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494811435491">15</xref>], as well as other factors causing an increased demand for insulin and thereby beta-cell stress, the beta-cell stress hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811435491">16</xref>]. Such beta-cell stress hypothesis is supported by results indicating that psychosocial factors seem to be associated with the development of T1D, serious life events during the first year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494811435491">17</xref>], low educational level of the mother, and low socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435491">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435491">19</xref>]. These psychosocial factors have all been found to be associated with the development of autoantibodies that are the early start of the immune process that may lead to T1D. Two commonly analysed islet cell autoantibodies that are diabetes-related are autoantibodies to the proteins glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and tyrosine phosphatase (IA-2A), which are markers of on-going beta-cell damage in the pancreas and appear before the onset of T1D. Higher concentrations of these autoantibodies, especially higher concentrations of more than one autoantibody, increase the risk of developing T1D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435491">20</xref>] and can consequently be used as markers to predict the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435491">21</xref>]. It is even suggested as a prognostic factor for T1D in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435491">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811435491">23</xref>].</p>

<title>Aims</title>
<p>Our aim was to investigate whether the social environment, interpreted as two equally sized, neighbouring but socioeconomically different, cities, affected the induction of diabetes related autoantibodies in young children. A study design was implemented where 1-year-old children from two twin cities, Norrköping and Linköping, were compared for concentration of beta-cell related autoantibodies in capillary blood samples. Other documented risk factors of beta-cell autoimmunity and T1D, such as family characteristics, dietary factors, and psychosocial factors were also taken into consideration.</p>

<title>Twin cities</title>
<p>The present study included all children participating in the ABIS study (All Babies in Southeast Sweden, see below) who lived in the urban parts of either one of the two neighbouring so-called twin cities in the southeast of Sweden, Norrköping and Linköping. The sample in this study yielded 1288 children from Linköping and 1160 children from Norrköping. Out of these children, 709 and 788 children, respectively, were tested for IA-2A and 701 and 708 children, respectively, were tested for GADA. Both cities are located in the same county with a population of around 130,000 inhabitants each and situated only 40 kilometres apart. Both cities are part of the same healthcare organisation, i.e. the same county council being responsible for virtually all public health care in the cities. However, the present social structure and also the social history differ between the two cities. Linköping is dominated by high-tech industries and higher educational institutions and could be labelled a white-collar city while Norrköping has a long industrial history and could be labelled as a blue-collar city. The general public health in these two cities differ remarkably, not least concerning cardiovascular diseases where the blue-collar city has higher prevalence of all major cardiovascular diseases and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494811435491">24</xref>].</p>

<title>All Babies in Southeast Sweden (ABIS)</title>
<p>ABIS is a population-based follow-up study in which newborns have been followed prospectively with regular biological samples and questionnaires. The parents of all 21,700 babies in the southeast of Sweden born between October 1997 to October 1999 were asked to participate in the ABIS study aimed to screen T1D-associated autoimmunity and to identify factors related to the risk of immune-mediated diseases, especially T1D. The parents of 17,055 children (79%) gave their informed consent to participate. The participant rate at the age of 1 year was 67.2% (<italic>n</italic>=11,082) children from the initial cohort participating. Drop-out rates were similar in all regions of ABIS, and consequently the present studied subcohort showed similar drop-out rates. The ABIS project has been approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the Faculty of Health Sciences, Linköping University and of the Medical Faculty, Lund University.</p>

<sec id="section6-1403494811435491">
<title>Autoantibodies</title>
<p>Autoantibody analyses were done in a consecutive order, depending on amount of capillary blood and with no special selection bias, on 1-year-old children. A 95% cut-off value for IA-2A (<italic>n</italic>=5635) and GADA (<italic>n</italic>=5765) was determined in the total ABIS cohort as a positive autoantibody value. The autoantibody assay has been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494811435491">25</xref>] and validated in the Diabetes Autoantibody Standardization Program (DASP) with documented good sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494811435491">26</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494811435491">
<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>Data from questionnaires in the ABIS study were also included in this report. The mother answered one questionnaire directly after child delivery; and another when the child was aged 1 year. Both questionnaires concerned a large set of factors that could have a possible association to the development of T1D such as family characteristics, dietary factors, and psychosocial factors. Questions included in this analysis, were explanatory factors documented as risk factors for increased GADA and IA-2A in earlier studies and factors concerning differences in socioeconomic structure between the two cities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494811435491">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data from the questionnaires were optically scanned and manually checked for errors. Bivariate analyses were initially conducted on earlier documented risk factors of beta-cell autoimmunity and T1D to identify variables individually predictive of the development of autoantibodies. Differences were measured by χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435491">2</xref></sup> and, in the case of few observations, Fisher’s Exact test. Independent variables found to be significant at the 5% level were included in the final multivariate models for GADA and IA-2A respectively. Multiple logistic regressions were used to estimate the odds ratios with 95% CI. A <italic>p</italic>-value of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were made using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v. 16.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study shows that there appear to be differences in the risk of diabetes-related autoimmunity among 1 year-old children living in two different socioeconomical environments. Children living in a blue-collar city revealed significantly higher risks for GADA and IA-2A compared to the children from a white-collar city. These differences remained significant even after adjustment for other established and plausible risk factors for the development of diabetes-related autoantibodies. However, in the multivariate analysis, in addition to living in the blue-collar city, some other factors remained significant as independent explanatory factors. These factors were high weight at 1 year of age, coeliac disease in the family, and experience of serious life events in the family before 1 year of age. All these factors have been documented as risk factors in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435491">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435491">21</xref>].</p>
<p>The prevailing hypothesis today is that there are many different modulating factors that may covariate in the autoimmune process leading to T1D. GADA and IA-2A are indicators of this autoimmune status. The risk of developing T1D has been documented to be especially high in genetically predisposed children who repeatedly test positive for two or more autoantibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435491">20</xref>]. Notably, in this study no child from the white-collar city scored both autoantibodies with 95th percentile cut off, while there were 10 children (1.3%) from the blue-collar city who did so. Even though most of the children in a normal population who test positive for one beta-cell autoantibody will not develop T1D, a high titre of an autoantibody indicates that an autoimmune process has started.</p>
<p>A limitation in this study when it comes to the interpretation of the results is the methodological faults in the laboratory analysis. However, there does not seem to be any bias at all in the collection procedure or in the analysis of the samples from the cities, since they were done randomly with no structural order either between the two cities or otherwise. This diminishes possible methodological faults or differences in the method of measurement of samples from the two cities. All blood samples were also tested in the same laboratory and in random batches. The results are coherent between the two different autoantibodies.</p>
<p>What differences in the two neighbouring blue-collar and white-collar cities could explain the difference in beta-cell autoantibody distribution? The relation between social environment and health is widely known, but the mechanisms in which social factors link to specific disease-causing risk factors are often unknown. Earlier studies have shown to correlate socioeconomic factors to the risk of developing T1D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494811435491">25</xref>], although findings concerning the socioeconomic gradient of T1D are too inconsistent to allow firm conclusions: see, for example, review by Borchers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494811435491">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous research have shown that public health in the studied cities differs to a great extent, for example perceived health and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is much higher in the blue-collar city, and the life span is shorter, all of which can be traced back for decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494811435491">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494811435491">29</xref>]. Thus, one could expect that socioeconomic differences, at least partly, could explain the discrepancy in autoantibody distribution between the cities. Factors that could represent this difference between the twin cities, such as educational level and first-generation immigrants, were included in our analysis but could not explain the differences found in autoimmunity. One should always be aware of the risk for ecological fallacy, i.e. that children in these two cities are homogeneous. However, individual social factors for our studied children and their parents such as educational level and foreign origin could not explain the differences found in autoimmunity.</p>
<p>It has been shown that stressful life events at an early age precede the development of beta-cell autoantibodies in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435491">21</xref>]. There are also studies linking stressful life events with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494811435491">30</xref>]. Similar mechanisms could also contribute to the twin cities in our study. These mechanisms towards developing T1D could possibly function on a more structural level, i.e. in the social environment. A blue-collar social environment is characterized by more widespread economical problems, lower education, and higher unemployment rates, which give an increased general level of stress. Living in a stressful community could put stress on the mothers, even mothers-to-be, who in turn transfer the stress over to their children, even to the fetus, with possible implications on the children’s immune system. Comparable to the concept of “passive smoking”, one could launch a “passive community stress” concept. This concept could be defined as stress load and social vulnerability and possibly also infection load and toxic exposures in the close family as a result of living in a more socially deprived environment, which ultimately may affect even the children. The concept of “passive community stress” might turn out to be an important component of the unspecified black box in disease aetiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435491">3</xref>]. Stress might also be inherited over generations. It has been shown that the onset of diabetes might be related to the living conditions of the grandparents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1403494811435491">31</xref>]. If this epigenetic mechanism is applicable, it may also contribute to explain the differences in public health between the blue-collar and the white-collar twin cities.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>There are differences in the prevalence of diabetes-related autoantibodies in young children in two comparable but different social environments even after adjustment for other previously documented risk factors. Factors in the social environment such as “passive community stress” could trigger the induction of diabetes-related autoantibodies in children. These results indicate that our present knowledge of factors influencing the autoimmune process might have to be broadened to include factors in the social environment of the community.</p>
