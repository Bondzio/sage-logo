<sec id="sec1-1462474512473883"><title>Ikponwosa O Ekunwe and Richard S Jones (eds), <italic>Global Perspectives on Re-Entry</italic>, Tampere University Press: Tampere, Finland, 2011; 477 pp.: 9789514483493, £30 (pbk)</title>
<p>In <italic>Global Perspectives On Re-Entry</italic>, Ikponwosa Ekunwe and Richard Jones have edited a text which aims to shed light on the issues facing ex-prisoners returning to society after their release from custody. The book includes chapters from scholars based in North America and Europe and thus provides a selective international perspective on issues of prisoner resettlement. Importantly, the book considers not just the processes of desistance from offending but also the substantial post-custodial challenges faced by both male and female ex-prisoners during the process of attempting to re-establish a ‘normal’ life and these are considered here in areas such as employment and familial relations. The acknowledgement of barriers to re-entry in several of the chapters is valuable since a significant proportion of the currently available resettlement literature emphasizes only the efficacy of different paths to desistance from crime and crucially falls short of considering the arguably much bigger issue of ‘what happens next in the lives of reformed ex-prisoners?’ This text goes some way to addressing this literary shortfall and starts to expose a common theme of social marginality within the ex-prisoner population which evidently transcends national boundaries.</p>
<p>A clear strength of this book is the division of the chapters into two distinct sections. The first is from ‘The Societal/Institutional Perspective’ and the second, critical to any legitimate exploration of the subject matter, comes ‘From the Perspective of the Ex-Offender’. This division is significant since it serves to place the ‘insider’ perspectives of ex-prisoners and their support networks on an equal footing with those of policy makers and representatives of non-governmental organizations. Indeed, particularly strong elements of the book are found in the chapters considering the experiences of family members in managing relationships with serving prisoners and the problematic nature of supporting their re-entry.</p>
<p>While a detailed exposition of all of the chapters included is beyond the scope of this review, a few chapters in particular stand out for a special mention. The first is Jeffrey Ross’ contribution ‘Deconstructing the prisoner re-entry industry/complex’. Developing the existing analysis that a Prison Industrial Complex has evolved in the USA which serves to increase the number of people incarcerated due to commercial interests, Ross critiques the emerging view that a Prisoner Re-Entry Industry may now exist. Crucially, he argues for a stronger conceptual basis for claims of such an ‘industry’ and highlights a failure to consider the long-standing privatization of re-entry services and the impact of the <italic>Second Chance Act</italic> in the USA within existing analyses. Following this, Ross and others from the US Convict Criminology group (Richards et al.) then contribute a persuasive further chapter outlining their recommendations for a more progressive prisoner re-entry policy.</p>
<p>Darren Wheelock, Christopher Uggen and Heather Hlavka’s chapter from the USA on ‘Employment restrictions for individuals with felon status and racial inequality in the labor market’ is also particularly noteworthy. Outlining the extensive disqualifications from a number of occupations based upon felony convictions in the USA, Wheelock et al. highlight the disproportionate impact on African American men due to their over-representation in the penal system and the tendency of current legally enforced employment restrictions to sustain and even exacerbate racial inequality in the labour market. This somewhat bleak analysis contrasts markedly with Leena Mäkipää’s description of ‘The enforcement of supervised probationary freedom in Finland’ whereby certain prisoners may become eligible for release from custody up to six months prior to their parole in order to assist the transition back to society through engagement in work or study programmes while residing at home. Mäkipää does, however, highlight a degree of inconsistent practice between prisons (and therefore unequal treatment of prisoners) due largely to issues of resourcing, structural anomalies in the Finnish prison system and a lack of clarity regarding the aims and regulations of these re-entry arrangements. Regardless, the contrast between the enabling re-entry environment provided to some prisoners in Finland and the restrictive and exclusionary policies of many states in the USA is telling.</p>
<p>I do have one fairly major criticism of this book and it is with the choice of title, since the chapters are from authors almost exclusively based in northern America and Europe. Although the editors pre-empt this predominantly western focus in their introduction to the text, one might reasonably expect contributions from South America, Africa and Asia in a fully ‘global’ collection of perspectives. However, this weakness is somewhat compensated for in the range of subjects explored within the book. The breadth of focus from the various chapters is impressive, ranging from neuro-criminological models of re-entry and desistance in Estonia (Jim Hilborn) through to evaluations of the impact of urban development in Russia on crime and re-entry (Mark Kleyman). The case for the importance of (auto)ethnographic approaches to criminal justice research and policy development is also convincingly made by Michael Lenza. Significantly, the most numerous contributions are from scholars based in the USA and in Finland – due probably to the location of the editors. Yet, as already alluded to above, this serves to provide a consistent and interesting contrast between the policies and practices of re-entry from two radically different criminal justice systems. This is notably so in the final chapter, co-authored by the editors themselves, which provides a comparative set of accounts of post-prison release from Finland and the USA.</p>
<p><italic>Global Perspectives On Re-Entry</italic> will be of interest not only to those concerned with desistance from crime and processes of positive self-change in ex-prisoners, but also to those with a broader interest in the inevitable consequences of social exclusion and marginalized identities resulting from an era of mass incarceration.</p></sec>
