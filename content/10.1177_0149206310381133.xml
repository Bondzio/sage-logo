<abstract>
<p>Many employees feel ethically conflicted at work, but research has yet to identify the specific mechanisms that give rise to this sense of ethical conflict. The authors propose that ethical conflicts occur when companies encourage employees to behave counter to their own sense of right and wrong during the process of organizational socialization. Employees who are subject to these pressures experience psychological distress. The authors’ study of 371 early career lawyers found that divestiture socialization was positively related to ethical conflict and that ethical conflict was related to higher emotional exhaustion and lower career fulfillment. Ethical conflict partially mediated the relationship between divestiture socialization and emotional exhaustion. Narrative comments provided by respondents reinforced the relationship between divestiture socialization and ethical conflict.</p>

<p>Professionals in fields like law, medicine, psychology, and teaching are given extensive training and guidance in resolving the ethical conflicts that can arise in their fields. Given this extensive exposure to ethics training, one might expect that misconduct would be rare in these fields. However, there are signs that even trained professionals experience significant ethical conflict in their work. Many physicians report that their managed care roles lead to conflicts of interest and jeopardize their ability to work within the ethical guidelines of their profession (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310381133">Feldman, Novack, &amp; Gracely, 1998</xref>). There is also a perception that what is taught in law and medical school ethics classes does not reflect the way most lawyers and physicians enact their professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206310381133">Hafferty &amp; Franks, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206310381133">Matasar, 1990</xref>). Why is there a disconnection between the strong ethical guidelines for these professions and real-world practice? Theorists agree that organizations create social contexts that influence employees’ decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206310381133">Brass, Butterfield, &amp; Skaggs, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310381133">Treviño, Butterfield, &amp; McCabe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206310381133">Treviño, Weaver, &amp; Reynolds, 2006</xref>), suggesting that the locus of the problem could be the organizations in which professionals work. That is, it is possible that social pressures in professional firms are in conflict with the standard ethical principles employees learn during the course of their education. These ethical conflicts may lead employees to feel frustrated and emotionally exhausted if they believe their time is spent working at a company that violates their image of a just society.</p>
<p>Conservation of resources (COR) theory provides a framework for understanding how ethical conflict can negatively impact employee outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206310381133">Hobfoll &amp; Freedy, 1993</xref>). According COR theory, individuals find it psychologically taxing to be in situations in which valued resources are lost or inadequate to meet demands. We can consider a person’s sense of right and wrong to be a valued resource because it serves to guide behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206310381133">Bandura, Caprara, Barbaranelli, Pastorelli, &amp; Regalia, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206310381133">Hobfoll (1989)</xref> also noted that both COR and person–environment fit theories posit that a lack of fit between an individual and an environment causes discomfort and can lead to exhaustion. Similar logic has been used to explain the relationship between role conflict and emotional exhaustion—those who experience role conflicts become confused and frustrated, which can generate emotional and psychological strain (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206310381133">Lee &amp; Ashforth, 1996</xref>). The consequence of these demands is burnout, which is chiefly marked by feelings of emotional exhaustion, defined as continuous mental weariness and emotional depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206310381133">Wright &amp; Cropanzano, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206310381133">Zohar, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>As a means of summarizing these issues, we provide a process model of divestiture socialization, ethical conflict, and outcomes. According to our model, a combination of factors leads to perceptions of ethical conflict at work. We believe that divestiture socialization, which consists of tactics designed to “deny and strip away certain entering characteristics of a recruit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310381133">Van Maanen, 1978</xref>: 33) will play a major role in this process. Ethical conflict is expected to lead to emotional exhaustion and, ultimately, to decreased career fulfillment. Our model also proposes that employees’ inherent ethical beliefs will moderate the relationship between divestiture socialization and ethical conflict, such that employees with higher levels of ethical concern will experience greater dissonance in the face of employer pressure.</p>
<p>This study of ethical conflict and emotional exhaustion provides a new frame for several topics of interest for burnout, ethics, and socialization researchers. First, we demonstrate how emotional exhaustion can arise as a result of ethical conflict. Prior research has shown that a negative ethical climate can increase role conflict and role ambiguity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310381133">Jaramillo, Mulki, &amp; Solomon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206310381133">Schwepker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206310381133">Schwepker, Ferrell, &amp; Ingram, 1997</xref>), but evidence showing a direct relationship between ethical conflict and emotional exhaustion in organizations is lacking.</p>
<p>Second, we develop a theoretical argument for the role of particular socialization practices as antecedents of ethical beliefs and behaviors. Socialization research has primarily examined how employees learn about task performance, how employees become committed, and how employees develop social relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310381133">Ashforth &amp; Saks, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310381133">Kammeyer-Mueller &amp; Wanberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310381133">Kim, Cable, &amp; Kim, 2005</xref>). The way employees learn what is considered right in an ethical sense has not been examined. Some scholars contend that not enough attention has been paid to the ways organizational leaders and collectives sanction unethical behavior in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310381133">Brief, Buttram, &amp; Dukerich, 2001</xref>). Over time, these unethical acts become institutionalized as a culture for ethical deviance and, thus, unquestioned by established organizational members. However, those who are comparatively recent hires will be more likely to recognize these unethical acts for what they are.</p>
<p>Third, ethics research has not considered the socialization context. Instead, most studies look only at the relationship between the current organizational climate and the ethical beliefs of established employees (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206310381133">Jones, Felps, &amp; Bigley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206310381133">Schwepker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310381133">Weaver, Treviño, &amp; Cochran, 1999</xref>). We also investigate how organizational actions can <italic>increase</italic> ethical conflicts among employees. This contrasts with research that implicitly assumes that employees are prone to behave unethically, so organizational policies and leadership should keep these impulses in check (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206310381133">Brown &amp; Treviño, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206310381133">Reynolds, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, our study examines early career lawyers, a unique population of employees who are engaged in ethically complicated behaviors. Lawyers must serve competing ethical “masters,” by representing their clients, adhering to the rules of conduct established by state bar associations, and ensuring that their actions are profitable for their employers. To meet these needs simultaneously is difficult, and inexperienced attorneys often place these needs in direct conflict. Thus, we believe this sample provides an excellent starting point for examining issues of ethical conflict among early career employees.</p>

<title>Theory and Hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section2-0149206310381133">
<title>Ethical Conflict</title>
<p>The central variable in our model is ethical conflict. Ethical conflict is a subjective sense that expectations for one’s behavior are inconsistent with one’s beliefs regarding what is right and wrong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310381133">Rokeach, 1968</xref>). This definition of ethical conflict emphasizes the perceived discrepancy between the ethical climate of the organization and the ethics of the individual, whether these are personal ethics or the ethical codes and values that one has picked up through a lifetime of socialization or social learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206310381133">Schwepker et al., 1997</xref>). Ethical conflict primarily arises when one must choose between two competing principles for behavior. In many cases, ethical conflict occurs when there is a divergence between an employee’s own beliefs regarding ethical behavior and the employer’s beliefs regarding ethical behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310381133">King &amp; King, 1990</xref>). For example, ethical conflict could arise if a supervisor encouraged a reluctant employee to be dishonest with a client or if an employee does not want to comply with a supervisor’s encouragement to bill clients as much as possible. Although it is possible for ethical conflict to occur when one’s organization expects greater adherence to conventional ethical standards than the employee would prefer, our focus is primarily on situations in which ethical conflict occurs when the organization expects less adherence to conventional ethical standards than the employee would prefer.</p>
<p>To date, there has not been an explicit empirical linkage drawn between ethical conflict and the COR theory of emotional exhaustion, but the conceptual framework of COR theory does mention several relevant processes. Specifically, a comprehensive review of the literature noted that conflicts between personal values and organizational values are a strong conceptual correlate of the experience of burnout and especially the burnout subcomponent of emotional exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206310381133">Maslach, Schaufeli, &amp; Leiter, 2001</xref>). Similarly, in writing about the problem of ethically corrupt cultures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310381133">Brief et al. (2001)</xref> propose that engaging in actions that are counter to one’s internal ethical codes will produce an unpleasant state of cognitive dissonance that employees will seek to reduce. If one finds that one’s work is directing one’s efforts toward an undesirable end, it will indeed represent a threat toward one’s goal progress. When people see progress toward their important goals being either restricted or acted against (as in this case, where one’s own actions undermine a goal), they will feel less energized and will begin to experience the physiological and psychological symptoms of emotional exhaustion. Returning to our earlier example, an employee who values honesty but is constantly pressured to behave in a dishonest manner will eventually feel like the work is contrary to his or her core values, and this internal state of conflict will tax psychological resources and lead the worker to feel emotionally exhausted from the resulting strain.</p>

<sec id="section3-0149206310381133">
<title>Occupational Socialization</title>
<p>The period of occupational entry creates a shock to new employees’ sense of appropriate behavior, as they move from the abstract facts of the educational environment to more contextually complex professional problems involving real outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206310381133">Schein, 1978</xref>). Employees need guidelines to assess what means are acceptable for achieving the organization’s ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206310381133">Levine &amp; Moreland, 1991</xref>). For occupational entrants, the challenges in making ethical decisions are especially profound because they have not yet established a clear sense of how to behave in the “real world.” Employees often learn that the right way to do things is not always the way things are done. As employees adjust, previous ethical education and training is supported or undermined through socialization pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206310381133">Schein, 2004</xref>) and the organizational climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310381133">Treviño et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206310381133">Treviño et al., 2006</xref>). The implications of socialization tactics for ethical behavior seem straightforward, because socialization is at least partially an attempt to create consistency between organizational values and individual values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310381133">Cable &amp; Parsons, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310381133">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Often socialization activities are specifically undertaken as an alternative to attraction-selection-attrition processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310381133">Cable &amp; Parsons, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206310381133">Schneider, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Although a variety of socialization tactics have been outlined, we believe the divestiture–investiture dimension of socialization is most relevant for ethical behavior. Investiture practices encourage employees to rely on their own sense of what is right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310381133">Cable &amp; Parsons, 2001</xref>), whereas divestiture practices discourage employees from using their extant belief systems, replacing them with the organization’s attitudes and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310381133">Ashforth &amp; Saks, 1996</xref>). We focus exclusively on divestiture socialization because it can be unambiguously tied to employee ethical conflict. Other institutional socialization tactics, like formal programs and frequent contact with other recruits, do not specifically increase or decrease employee reliance on their own code of ethics. Only divestiture specifically measures the extent to which the organization attempts to break down preexisting employee attitudes and beliefs and replace them with the organization’s norms. Moreover, our model is concerned primarily with cases in which the organization has lower ethical standards than the newcomer and is pressuring the employee to engage in actions that might increase ethical conflicts. Ethical conflicts are not likely to occur more frequently for employees who are pressured to increase their ethical behavior. An employee who is discouraged from behaving based on his or her own standards for honesty, and instead is encouraged to adopt the organization’s norms for honesty, is experiencing divestiture socialization. Such pressures are likely to lead to feelings of conflict.</p>

<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Divestiture socialization is positively related to ethical conflict.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Individuals whose sense of right and wrong is affirmed by organizational leaders through a process of investiture socialization will likely feel supported in their work. On the other hand, divestiture involves highly stressful socialization tactics that can include humiliation and harassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310381133">Van Maanen, 1978</xref>). Such tactics will also lead employees to feel like their extant frameworks for operating in the world have been invalidated. The process of divestiture requires employees to behave in a way that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs, and the effort of behaving outside of one’s comfort zone can be highly emotionally and cognitively taxing. Most directly relevant to our investigation, individuals who experience high levels of divestiture socialization report more stress symptoms in the months following organizational entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310381133">Ashforth &amp; Saks, 1996</xref>). Those who feel that their own ethical frameworks are supported and acknowledged will be less likely to feel this sort of stress. Given the intimate relationship between stress and emotional exhaustion, we expect that divestiture socialization will increase emotional exhaustion.</p>

<sec id="section4-0149206310381133">
<title>Outcomes of Ethical Conflict</title>
<p>Our model proposes that ethical conflict acts as a mediating variable between divestiture socialization and emotional exhaustion. Several streams of research support this notion. Organizational activities designed to make ethical priorities clear to employees are associated with positive attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310381133">Treviño et al., 2001</xref>), whereas conflict between the employee’s own beliefs and the beliefs held by the employing organization leads to internal distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310381133">Brief et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310381133">Margolis &amp; Molinsky, 2008</xref>). It may be that a clear sense of positive ethical priorities acts as a psychological, clarifying resource for employees in determining how to behave, whereas ethical conflicts lead to confusion and feelings of being overwhelmed. Experiments have shown that cognitive dissonance produces psychological discomfort and negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310381133">Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994</xref>). Social cognitive theory also posits that individuals regulate their behavior by providing self-sanctions for behavior that violates their own standards for right and wrong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206310381133">Bandura et al., 2001</xref>). Experimental evidence demonstrates that individuals who act in a normatively unethical manner by lying, cheating, and harming others experience negative attitudes such as guilt and negative affectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310381133">Klass, 1978</xref>). Additionally, employees who work in companies with weak enforcement of an ethical climate have higher levels of role conflict and lower job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310381133">Jaramillo et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together, this evidence seems to suggest a positive relationship between ethical conflict and emotional exhaustion. Given the previously hypothesized relationships between divesture socialization and ethical conflict and emotional exhaustion, it also seems likely that ethical conflict partially mediates the relationship between divestiture socialization and emotional exhaustion. Partial, rather than full, mediation is hypothesized because a number of other variables, including role clarity, self-efficacy, and social acceptance, have also been linked to divestiture socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310381133">Bauer, Bodner, Erdogan, Tuxillo, &amp; Tucker, 2007</xref>) and emotional exhaustion or stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206310381133">Blackhart, Eckel, &amp; Tice, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310381133">Blumenthal, Lavender, &amp; Hewson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206310381133">Brouwers, Evers, &amp; Tomic, 2001</xref>) and thus could also serve as potential mediators. In sum, it appears that</p>
<list id="list3-0149206310381133" list-type="simple">

<p><italic>Hypothesis 3a</italic>: Ethical conflict is positively related to emotional exhaustion.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 3b</italic>: Ethical conflict partially mediates the relationship between divestiture socialization and emotional exhaustion.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition to leading to emotional exhaustion, individuals who experience ethical conflict will feel less fulfilled with their careers. A fulfilling career is one that allows a person to express his or her underlying beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310381133">Super, 1970</xref>). Careers require significant time and effort investments. If an employee feels that this energy is actively directed toward socially undesirable ends, feelings of dissatisfaction about his or her career will arise. People seldom feel good about exerting effort toward ends they do not approve of. For example, an employee who has to spend much of the day engaging in conduct he or she sees as dishonest is not likely to feel that this career is expressing his or her underlying beliefs. There is also a strong conceptual relationship between work stress and career fulfillment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310381133">Parasuraman, Purohit, Godshalk, &amp; Beutell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206310381133">Peluchette, 1993</xref>). Thus, if ethical conflict leads to emotional exhaustion, we would expect that it would likewise lead to lower levels of career fulfillment. As with the divestiture socialization–emotional exhaustion relationship, however, we hypothesize partial mediation because other variables, such as job satisfaction, can conceivably be linked to both ethical conflict and career fulfillment and, therefore, might also serve as potential mediators.</p>

</list>
<p>The importance of employee characteristics in the process of organizational adjustment has been demonstrated frequently in previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206310381133">Jones, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310381133">Kammeyer-Mueller &amp; Wanberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310381133">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Ethical beliefs can be defined, for the purposes of the present investigation, as a collection of beliefs indicating that one’s occupational role requires adherence to the ethical standards of the profession. In the context of divestiture socialization, employees with strongly held ethical beliefs will be more sensitive to attempts to change their behavior, much like employees who have an established set of beliefs about work routines are more resistant to organizational socialization efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206310381133">Jones, 1983</xref>). Those with strong ethical beliefs feel it is necessary to closely adhere to professional or occupational ethical standards regardless of situational pressures, whereas those with weaker ethical beliefs feel that adhering to established standards is not necessary and therefore will be more amenable to organizational efforts to change their behavior. In other words, although having strong ethical beliefs should not directly lead to worse adjustment, those employees with strong ethical beliefs will be less likely to feel ethical conflict in organizations that have divestiture socialization than will those employees with weaker ethical beliefs.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>The initial pool of potential participants consisted of 5,831 lawyers who were admitted to the Florida Bar on or after January 2, 2003. To increase the response rate, we employed a number of tactics. For example, following the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206310381133">Dillman (2000)</xref>, for the set of 1,250 lawyers who were mailed paper surveys, we hand addressed (rather than printed) each envelope and used first-class (rather than bulk) mail so that survey packages appeared to be more personal. Large envelopes (9 × 12 inches) were also used so that survey packages could be easily identified among the other mail participants received. Participants who did not return the paper surveys were sent several e-mail reminders containing a web-based version of the survey. Due to budgeting restrictions, funding to send additional paper mailings was unavailable. Therefore, the remainder of the potential participants was contacted via e-mail initially and was also sent several e-mail reminders. Potential participants were employed in both the public and private sectors and specialized in various entities of the law. Although our objective was to contact each of the 5,831 lawyers, given the large number of e-mail failure notices we received in response to initial and reminder e-mails, it seems that a sizeable portion of these individuals did not receive survey materials. Failure of surveys to reach potential participants could have been due to a combination of factors, including outdated or inaccurate e-mail addresses provided by the bar association or the screening of e-mails by spam-filtering software. Each of these factors would have significantly decreased the chances of the study materials reaching participants.</p>
<p>Thus, we calculated response rates in three different ways: (1) based on the total number of participants who responded to our survey, either by indicating their desire (or lack of desire) to participate by selecting the appropriate option on the consent form or returning a blank survey; (2) based on the total potential sample (5,831 lawyers); and (3) based on an estimate of the percentage of the potential sample that was unlikely to receive the survey. Because we did not track e-mail deliverability, the percentage of undeliverable e-mails was based on data from the available literature. Estimates for failed e-mail deliverability vary and are as high as 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206310381133">Kimberley, 2008</xref>), although most estimates are around 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310381133">Duffy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206310381133">Interactive Advertising Bureau, 2006</xref>). To be conservative, we removed 20% from 4,581, as 1,250 surveys were sent via U.S. mail. We also subtracted 75 from this total because 75 of the paper-based surveys were returned as undeliverable.</p>
<p>One thousand ninety lawyers indicated having received the survey. Of those, 564 (51.74%) agreed to participate. After listwise deletion of partial responses, a total of 371 participants completed all of the measures necessary for analyses. Using the first method of calculating the response rate yielded a final response rate of 34.04%. The remaining two methods resulted in final response rates of 6.36% and 7.67%, respectively. Participants reported having worked for their current employers an average of 1.9 years. Mean age was 34.6 years, and just under half (46.9%) of the final sample was male. Statistics made available by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206310381133">American Bar Association (2008)</xref> reveal that 48.7% of law students in 2003 were female, providing some evidence that our sample is unlikely to largely deviate from the population of U.S. early career lawyers, at least with respect to gender.</p>
<p>To gain an alternative perspective regarding the focal employees’ levels of emotional exhaustion and to ensure that our data were not entirely self-reported, we also asked participants to provide the contact information of a coworker, spouse, partner, or close friend so that this person could be sent a short survey. The contact provided by the participant was sent a brief survey requesting ratings of participant emotional exhaustion. Of the 371 participants who provided complete data, 102 contained data from another source (i.e., coworker, spouse, partner, or close friend), and separate analyses were conducted for both the full data set and a subset that provided peer-reported data. We analyzed two models: one including variables measured exclusively with self-reports and a second model including self-reported measures of workload, ethical beliefs, divestiture socialization, ethical conflict, and career fulfillment and peer-reported (from a single person) emotional exhaustion ratings. Put another way, the second model substituted peer-reported burnout ratings for self-reported burnout ratings. We decided not to combine (e.g., average) peer- and self-reported burnout in order to avoid introducing any additional common method variance into our second model.</p>

<title>Scale Construction</title>
<p>To ensure the appropriateness of the measures used in this study for early career lawyers, we developed items to measure workload, ethical beliefs, and career fulfillment in consultation with executive members of the state bar association. Three individuals—a practicing lawyer, a legal ethics professor at a major research university, and the chair of the state bar association’s council on professionalism—developed the items used in our measures specific to this population in collaboration with the primary researchers trained in developing surveys. These individuals possessed a great deal of expertise regarding ethics and ethical issues relevant to lawyers. Survey creation was conducted using a discursive process, wherein the appropriateness of preliminary items was discussed and suggestions for improving the relevance of items for early career lawyers were offered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0149206310381133">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>We controlled for the effects of ethical beliefs and workload on ethical conflict as well as for the effect of workload on emotional exhaustion. It has been frequently demonstrated that workload is associated with higher levels of stress, emotional exhaustion, and dissatisfaction at work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310381133">Spector &amp; Jex, 1998</xref>). A heavy workload leads to these negative consequences partially because of the pressure and responsibility attendant on those with such workloads. Workload can also influence ethical conflict. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206310381133">Ordóñez, Schweitzer, Galinsky, and Bazerman (2009)</xref> argue that, in order to meet challenging goals, employees might engage in unethical behavior, including misrepresenting performance levels or performing and charging customers for unnecessary services. Although employees can choose to behave ethically in response to overly challenging goals, fear of losing one’s job, decreased compensation, or ostracism from one’s peer group might also influence employees to “do whatever it takes” to meet performance goals. Some have observed that in occupations that have quantitative work goals that must be met, like sales or the law, the pressure to perform unethical behavior may be acute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206310381133">Schwepker &amp; Good, 2004</xref>). Provided that workload can increase unethical behavior and that such behavior results in individuals’ experiencing ethical conflict, it seems logical to reason that workload influences the extent to which individuals experience ethical conflict. Thus, workload is important to account for in analyses involving organizational socialization, ethical conflict, and job attitudes. We also include ethical beliefs as a control variable and as part of the analysis of moderator relationships, since it is necessary to include main effects along with interaction terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310381133">Cohen, Cohen, Aiken, &amp; West, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section10-0149206310381133">
<title>Divestiture socialization</title>
<p>Divestiture socialization was measured using five items developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310381133">Ashforth and Saks (1996)</xref>. Participants were asked to rate from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) the extent to which they agreed with statements such as “Where I practice, no one tries to change the values and beliefs of newcomers” (reverse scored) and “I have learned that certain attitudes I hold are not considered acceptable in this organization.” Higher scores indicate greater use of divestiture tactics. Internal consistency reliability (α) for this scale was .67.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0149206310381133">
<title>Ethical conflict</title>
<p>Ethical conflict was measured using six items designed to be especially relevant for practicing lawyers. Lawyers were asked, “How often has each of the following potential value conflicts arisen during your first years on the job as a practicing lawyer?” Items were rated on a 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>frequently</italic>) scale and included “working for clients who I do not wish to represent,” “conflict between professional standards and what I feel is right,” “conflict between duty to law firm/employer and clients,” “conflict between your personal values and the directives of your supervisors,” “working for a law firm that holds values with which I am uncomfortable,” and “working in an area of the law that requires actions with which I am uncomfortable.” Higher scores indicate greater ethical conflict. Internal consistency reliability (α) for this scale was .79.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0149206310381133">
<title>Ethical beliefs</title>
<p>We measured ethical beliefs by asking participants to report the extent to which they “believe it is necessary for a lawyer” to engage in certain behaviors “to ensure adherence to the ethical standards of the field.” This measure was created especially for early career lawyers, as described above. Items included “ensuring that any case that is pursued has sufficient merit to warrant the court’s time,” “providing opposing counsel with any requested information that is complete and accurate in a timely manner,” “taking affirmative steps to ensure that your silence or inaction never misleads another lawyer or decision maker, even if taking such steps goes against your own interests,” “ensuring that any case that is pursued has sufficient merit to warrant the court’s time, even if it could mean fewer billable hours,” and “developing suggestions to encourage rapid resolutions to disputes, even when it might mean fewer billable hours.” Items were rated on a 1 (<italic>never necessary</italic>) to 5 (<italic>always necessary</italic>) scale. Internal consistency reliability (α) for this scale was .79.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0149206310381133">
<title>Workload</title>
<p>Workload was measured by asking individuals the extent to which five items represented “issues that have been challenging” when making the transition “from a law student to a practicing lawyer.” Items included “dealing with deadlines and workload,” “the stress of personal accountability for decisions that affect others,” “the difficulty of handling pressure from supervisory attorneys,” “achieving billable hours,” and “conflicts between work demands and family/personal life” and were rated on a 1 (<italic>not challenging</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very challenging</italic>) scale. Internal consistency reliability (α) for this scale was .70.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0149206310381133">
<title>Emotional exhaustion</title>
<p>To measure emotional exhaustion, we used a previously validated 13-item measure developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310381133">Pines and Aronson (1988)</xref> that focuses primarily on emotional exhaustion. Our focus on emotional exhaustion was made based on prior research showing that this component of burnout is most closely related to role conflicts and ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206310381133">Lee &amp; Ashforth, 1996</xref>). Participants were asked to rate the extent to which they experienced states like “being tired,” “feeling rundown,” and “being unhappy” at their current jobs. Items were rated on a 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>always</italic>) scale, with higher scores indicating higher levels of emotional exhaustion. Internal consistency reliability (α) for this scale was .89. Significant others and coworkers also completed this measure, indicating the extent to which they believed the participant experienced these feelings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0149206310381133">
<title>Career fulfillment</title>
<p>Career fulfillment was measured with five items designed to assess the extent to which participants felt that their work satisfied their work values. Values from the Super Work Values Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310381133">Super, 1970</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206310381133">Scozzaro and Subich (1990)</xref> were used as a guide for developing questions. All questions were prefaced with “My life, since I have been working as a lawyer. . . .” The values included altruism (“has become very satisfying because I have been able to do positive things for people”), pay level and promotion (“has been wonderful because I enjoy the money and the challenge of trying to make it here at my firm”), creativity and intellectual stimulation (“is interesting because the legal challenges are fun”), and task significance (“has been fulfilling because I feel what I do makes a difference in society. One reverse-coded item reflected negative task significance (“has been difficult because I do not feel good about what my firm does.”). Items were rated on a 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) scale, such that higher scores indicate a higher sense of career fulfillment. Internal consistency reliability (α) for this scale was .74.</p>

<title>Survey dimensionality</title>
<p>To ensure that the items loaded on six separate factors, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis using all of the items included in our study. Results revealed that a six-factor model fit the data reasonably well (<inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0149206310381133">

<p>We estimated two alternative models to assess the relative fit of the hypothesized model. In the first alternative model (Alternative 1), the direct path between divestiture socialization and emotional exhaustion is removed. The second alternative (Alternative 2) is a fully mediated model in which the effects of the exogenous variables on emotional exhaustion are entirely mediated through ethical conflict. The difference in chi-square between Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 is significant (<inline-formula id="inline-formula6-0149206310381133">

<title>Full data set</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206310381133">Figure 1</xref>, ethical conflict is most strongly related to divestiture socialization (β = .56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) followed by workload (β = .11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and ethical beliefs (β = –.06, <italic>ns</italic>). Thus, even controlling for workload and ethical beliefs, results offer support for Hypothesis 1. Divestiture socialization was also positively related to emotional exhaustion (β = .29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), in support of Hypothesis 2, while ethical conflict was positively related to emotional exhaustion (β = .27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and negatively related to career fulfillment (β = –.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), in support of Hypothesis 3a and Hypothesis 4a, respectively. To test the partial mediation hypotheses (Hypothesis 3b and Hypothesis 4b), we estimated direct, indirect, and total effects of divestiture socialization on emotional exhaustion and of ethical conflict on career fulfillment. Results are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0149206310381133">Table 4</xref>. Consistent with Hypothesis 3b, divestiture socialization has significant total and indirect effects (and, as noted earlier, a significant direct effect) on emotional exhaustion. Hypothesis 4b is also supported in that the total and indirect effects (and direct effect, as noted earlier) of ethical conflict on career fulfillment are significant.</p>

Results supporting Hypothesis 1, Hypothesis 3a, Hypothesis 4a, and Hypothesis 4b are similar to those for the entirely self-reported data, although this is not independent evidence for or against these hypotheses since all of these analyses also contain self-reported data. Analyses conducted with the combined data set yield a pattern of results for Hypothesis 2 and Hypothesis 3b that differs from that obtained from the self-reported data set. The direct effect of divestiture socialization on emotional exhaustion was not significant. The indirect effect, however, is significant and positive, suggesting the existence of a suppressor variable (i.e., the insignificant negative relationship with divestiture socialization and emotional exhaustion offsets the positive effects of divestiture socialization through ethical conflict, resulting in an insignificant total effect).</p>
<p>In sum, across both the full data set and the combined self- and peer-report subsample analyses, we found consistent support for Hypothesis 1, Hypothesis 3a, Hypothesis 4a, and Hypothesis 4b and mixed support for Hypothesis 2 and Hypothesis 3b.</p>

<title>Moderator analysis</title>
<p>Given the empirical issues inherent to testing moderated models in structural equation modeling, we performed an independent hierarchical moderated ordinary least squares regression analysis to examine whether ethical beliefs might also moderate the relationship between self-reported divestiture socialization and ethical conflict. The independent variables were centered to reduce nonessential multicollinearity and to facilitate the interpretation of the results. In the first step, we regressed ethical conflict onto ethical beliefs and divestiture socialization. In the next step, we tested the potential interactive effects of divestiture socialization and ethical conflict by entering the product term into the regressions. The results did not support the role of ethical beliefs as a moderator of the relationship between divestiture socialization and ethical conflict, as the coefficient for the interaction term was not significant (β = –.01, <italic>p</italic> = .67). Thus, Hypothesis 5 was not supported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Employee reactions to ethical dilemmas at work have become a major concern for both researchers and practitioners. Our research demonstrates that early career lawyers who experience higher levels of divestiture socialization experience more ethical conflict at work; this ethical conflict, in turn, was associated with emotional exhaustion and decreased career fulfillment.</p>
<p>Although our primary goal was to test statistical hypotheses, we also attempted to obtain narrative comments from respondents in order to obtain a richer understanding of the abovementioned relationships. Specifically, respondents were asked to describe a significant area of ethical conflict in their work. Only 81 individuals provided detailed responses. The first author classified responses based on similarities that naturally appeared in the data, consistent with the pattern-matching strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206310381133">Yin, 1994</xref>). This procedure resulted in the emergence six categories of ethical dilemmas: (1) those that were not socialization oriented, (2) those that described feeling pressure to violate laws of professional practice, (3) those that involved misleading clients, (4) those that involved representing the “wrong” side of a case, (5) those that referred to conflicting responsibilities, and (6) those that were performance related. On a confirmatory basis, the second author viewed the initial set of ratings and noted any disagreements (interrater agreement was 89%), and discrepancies were subsequently resolved through discussion.</p>
<p>These open-ended comments regarding the ethical dilemmas faced by participants did add some detail to the ways in which they found handling ethical situations at work challenging.</p>
<p>Supporting our initial contention that ethical conflicts typically arise when employers expect employees to behave less ethically (rather than more ethically), all of our ethical conflict responses suggest that employees would prefer to behave more ethically. Not one respondent indicated that he or she felt constrained or limited by an overly ethical organization. Many reported ethical dilemmas involved problems that were not socialization related (37%) but that were inherent to the practice of the law (e.g., “Two clients, both plaintiffs, one with a consortium claim, started proceedings for a divorce in the middle of their personal injury case. The clients’ various goals significantly changed after filing for divorce.”). Other comments that were not linked to socialization seem to describe pressures from clients to do the wrong thing (e.g., “A client wants to take action to avoid the federal estate tax unlawfully. I explained that that was not legal and would be contrary to the law.”).</p>
<p>Of the comments that were socialization related, violations of the law or practice (33% of socialization-related comments) were exemplified by responses like, “After working with a co-respondent’s firm for two months on a case, our position changed and I was not permitted to advise the attorney I had been working with; I felt it was unprofessional and an unfair surprise.” Actions to mislead clients (29% of socialization-related comments) included, “One of the partners was consistently billing 15 to 18 hours per day, when he had a wife, child, houses, multiple social events, etc. and it would be impossible to bill that much. He was even billing for things that he never worked on that I worked on.” Representing the wrong side (20% of socialization-related comments) was noted almost exclusively by those working as defendants’ council in criminal cases, as was exemplified by statements like, “Defending criminal defendants who admit they are guilty, and being required to harshly question someone who was truly victimized and pick at their version of events.” Dilemmas involving conflicting responsibilities (20% of socialization-related comments) were illustrated by responses like, “My worst situation involved pro-bono work that I was doing that I really cared about that my supervisors determined was in conflict with the agency. I was told to stop the work I was doing because it was it was a conflict of interest. I’m not sure there was a clear conflict of interest.” Finally, performance-related issues (24% of socialization-related comments) were indicated by statements like, “I often did not receive sufficient information from senior attorneys to be able to properly manage cases, despite repeated written and oral requests for information.” Note that category percentages sum to greater than 100% because certain comments are classified in multiple categories.</p>
<p>Taken together, the qualitative comments generally support our contention that organizational pressures do induce employees to behave unethically. It is interesting to note that nearly all the categories of unethical practice involved some form of either deception, concealing relevant information, or both. Even defending a guilty client was related to deception because respondents appeared to feel that representing such clients was tantamount to lying. In fact, we originally planned on coding independently for “misinformation” as a category of ethical conflict, but essentially all of the ethical conflicts would have fallen into this category. It appears, at least for this sample, that <italic>ethical conflict</italic> and <italic>deception</italic> are extremely closely related.</p>

<title>Contributions</title>
<p>Our findings have implications for both the ethics and organizational socialization literatures. For socialization researchers, the current study demonstrates that there is an empirical relationship between divestiture socialization and ethical conflict. Although anthropological research has suggested that such a link might exist (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206310381133">Van Maanen, 1975</xref>), this is the first survey-based study of which we are aware that shows a link between divestiture socialization and ethical beliefs. Some research has shown that role-related stressors are related to negative outcomes for employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206310381133">Saks &amp; Ashforth, 2000</xref>), but this research did not examine the influence of ethical conflict. By considering the ethical implications of socialization tactics, researchers will be better able to understand the full scope of what people really learn when they are starting a new job.</p>
<p>Our results also have implications for the study of ethics in organizations. Ethics research has not previously examined emotional exhaustion or career fulfillment as an outcome. Most studies on ethics suggest that organizations should add new practices to encourage employees to behave more ethically. The present study suggests that organization should also work to eliminate those practices that encourage them to behave less ethically than they would otherwise. It may be advisable to adopt a more positive perspective on ethical behavior and find ways that organizations can better facilitate employees’ preferences to engage in ethical behavior, rather than seeing employee attitudes toward ethics as a problem to be solved. The importance of the socialization phase has also not been previously highlighted in ethics research, meaning that the ethical beliefs and behaviors of employees are not seen when they are first formed. Future research exploring the formation of ethical climates during socialization will better inform both scholars and practitioners interested in improving the ethical climate for business.</p>
<p>We expected to find that those who had stronger ethical beliefs would be more negatively affected by divestiture. Our results did not support this hypothesis. As one anonymous reviewer suggested, it might be that only those with high ethical beliefs will experience true divestiture (since those with low ethical beliefs will readily conform to a less ethical workplace). Future research will have to examine whether this is indeed the case or, alternatively, if all workers experience ethical conflict as a result of divestiture, regardless of their underlying ethical beliefs.</p>

<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>It seems that a substantial number of individuals entering the profession of law do find that there are pressures in the workplace to engage in behaviors that are inconsistent with their own ethical beliefs. Ethical conflicts were often described as being the result of organizational pressure on employees to engage in behaviors that were in opposition to their own ethical standards. The profound effects of socialization into the legal profession on the values and beliefs of law students has been demonstrated previously. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206310381133">Sheldon and Krieger (2007)</xref> found that many law school students learned from their peers that, contrary to what they were learning in ethics classes, they should behave in a more competitive, cutthroat manner. Ethical conflicts were often described as the result of organizational pressures on employees to engage in behaviors that were opposed to ethical standards that were either held personally, endorsed socially, or learned in law school. Our research demonstrates that when early career employees feel that these beliefs and values are undermined, they may experience emotional exhaustion and come to view their careers as less fulfilling.</p>
<p>Legal scholars believe that discomfort and strain brought about by ethical conflict is one reason many newly minted lawyers either leave their first jobs soon after being hired or leave the profession altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310381133">Baker, 1999</xref>). Other evidence suggests that among those who stay with the profession of law, a disproportionate number are dissatisfied, experience great stress, and show high rates of alcoholism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206310381133">Beck, Sales, &amp; Benjamin, 1995</xref>). While workload is certainly a factor contributing to this stress, it is our contention that ethical dilemmas are another major contributor. The results of the present study lend support to the push in legal education for increased recognition of ethical issues as a means of reducing stress and improving career fulfillment among early career lawyers. Our findings also are consistent with previous research showing that divestiture socialization can produce negative attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310381133">Cable &amp; Parsons, 2001</xref>). To avoid the negative consequences associated with early career burnout and emotional exhaustion, law firms should endeavor to ensure that their practices are similar to the overarching ethical rules guiding the legal profession. Consultations that help lawyers describe and resolve the ethical conflicts they experience should be a frequent occurrence. It will likely be necessary to “train the trainers,” meaning that experienced lawyers will need to be trained to provide proper ethical guidance to newcomers. It also may be advisable to develop mechanisms to audit the ethical training that employees receive on the job to prevent the transmission of deviant work attitudes in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206310381133">Levine &amp; Moreland, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results suggest that educational institutions may be contributing to emotional exhaustion by providing students with guidelines for ethical practice that cannot be actualized in the real world of work. Our focus was on lawyers, but the same concerns may apply to business school graduates, who also receive training in ethics that may not correspond to the demands of the workplace. According to a national <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310381133">Ethics Resource Center (2007)</xref> survey, 20% of employees at public companies said that personal conflict with job-related values arises “sometimes or almost always.” To minimize psychological stress and maximize career fulfillment for students, schools should work to empirically identify areas of potential ethical conflict at work and understand how students can realistically respond to these situations. Toward this end, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310381133">American Association for Colleges and Schools of Business (2004)</xref> has called for improvements in ethics education, based on the premise that social contexts influence ethical behavior. Schools may also endeavor to increase their outreach to communities of professional practitioners in an attempt to change the ethical behavior of employees at work. Leaders should be sensitive to the possibility that there are negative messages being sent regarding ethical behavior in their organizations. To minimize these problems, a thorough audit of organizational practices should be conducted with an eye to eliminating any messages that might direct employees to ignore their own ethical beliefs. Opportunities to discuss potential ethical conflicts should be presented to minimize employee emotional exhaustion.</p>
<p>It may seem that we are arguing that divestiture socialization should always be avoided—this is not the case. There are certain occupations where uniformity of behavior is extremely important, so divestiture socialization is required. Examples include the police, military, and emergency medical teams. However, these divestiture tactics should be designed to clarify and support newcomers’ beliefs about ethical behavior and teach them how following the organization’s rules for behavior is consistent with achieving their desired ethical ends.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research Directions</title>
<p>The present study primarily focused on the ways in which behaving against one’s own ethics can lead to stress and discomfort. However, there are reasons to believe that stress and discomfort are not the only effects of ethical conflict. People have a tendency to normalize and justify away unethical actions like organizational corruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206310381133">Ashforth &amp; Anand, 2003</xref>). The study of self-regulatory moral agency suggests that individuals can engage in a variety of defense mechanisms to undermine perceptions of one’s own agency in immoral actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206310381133">Zyglidopoulos &amp; Fleming, 2008</xref>). These disengagement processes include disidentification, moral justification, diffusion of responsibility, misrepresenting the harmful effects, ascription of blame to victims, and dehumanization of victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206310381133">Bandura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310381133">Klass, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206310381133">Schein, 1978</xref>). Of course, given the negative affect generated by conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310381133">Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994</xref>), turnover is also a potential reaction. Future research should examine the extent to which negative socialization pressures generate these types of defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>We chose to focus our research on legal work, which is a complex occupation with a variety of potential ethical dilemmas. Because of the potential for ethical misbehavior in the law and other professions like medicine, there are clear-cut rules that define correct behavior. Lawyers will possibly experience more conflict in the area of ethics precisely because they deal with ethical conflicts so frequently. Conversely, lawyers might experience <italic>fewer</italic> ethical conflicts because they have well-defined ethical rules enforced by an external agency. Individuals in other occupational fields, like management, lack strong rules for ethical conduct and therefore may find that they do not know how to resolve ethical conflicts. In management, there are no clear sets of rules or definitions for the important stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206310381133">Schein, 2004</xref>). Future studies should see if organizational and situational norms are more important for shaping employee reactions in a managerial sample than in our sample.</p>
<p>Although we have used the term <italic>organizational socialization</italic> in this study, we did not measure the behavior of the organization. Rather, we measured employee interpretations of the signals sent by the organization. The idea that rules for conduct in organizations are constructed subjectively is consistent with the legal readings model of policies and procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206310381133">Fuller, Edelman, &amp; Matusik, 2000</xref>). The potential for slippage between organizational plans for ethical conduct and individual employee conduct is likely to be great in law firms, given the relatively individualized socialization that occurs in these firms. It may be that employees are misinterpreting organizational signals for investiture or divesture socialization and, as a result, are engaging in conduct organizational leaders would disapprove of. Laboratory research has shown that individuals who engage in immoral behavior attempt to deflect responsibility for their acts and blame others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310381133">Klass, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310381133">Zimbardo, 1995</xref>). This raises the possibility that individuals are attempting to blame the organization for unethical behavior of their own choosing. Future research might look at the process by which employees come to construe organizational statements or policies as encouraging or discouraging ethical behavior.</p>
<p>There are several questions regarding socialization and ethics that our study cannot answer. First, a prospective study that tracks newcomers from the moment of hire through several stages of the socialization process, rather than using a retrospective report of socialization, would be a welcome addition to the literature. Our measure of divestiture socialization was very general in nature and dealt with all aspects of divestiture rather than focusing on specific ethical divestiture. It could be that other elements of divestiture that have nothing to do with ethics are creating some of the effects we are seeing. This also means that we cannot completely reject the possibility that some participants felt that divestiture socialization was pressuring them to behave in a manner that was more ethical than they actually believed. Future research might consider measures of socialization that more specifically address the ethical content of the socialization being provided to new hires. We also elected to focus exclusively on divestiture socialization, as it seemed the form of socialization most clearly theoretically related to ethical conflict. Future research should investigate how a variety of organizational socialization tactics influence the ethical choices that are made by newcomers. It would also be informative to determine if employees who take a more active role in their own socialization experience lower levels of ethical conflict. Proactive employees have lower levels of role ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310381133">Kammeyer-Mueller &amp; Wanberg, 2003</xref>). Perhaps employees who are self-directed may experience less emotional exhaustion because they will be relying more on themselves than on the organization to determine the appropriateness of their conduct.</p>
<p>Our theorizing regarding divestiture and ethical conflict presumes that there is a misfit between employee values and organizational values that drives feelings of emotional exhaustion. Person–environment fit research has already demonstrated that a lack of correspondence between employee preferences for working conditions and job features are related to psychological strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310381133">Edwards &amp; Van Harrison, 1993</xref>). Future research should examine whether the fit between employee values and organizational values is predictive of emotional exhaustion.</p>
<p>Another criticism of this study is that we rely on self-report data from a single occasion to assess the majority of our relationships, which can result in common method biases. This concern is mitigated somewhat by our demonstration of results from significant others for a subset of individuals. One area where self-reports may be especially valid is for factors that are typically conducted covertly, like deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206310381133">Berry, Ones, &amp; Sackett, 2007</xref>). Organizational newcomers who are anxious to make a good impression will probably make a conscious effort to suppress any displays of psychological discomfort with the organization’s mode of socialization. Thus, we believe that self-reports of ethical conflict, emotional exhaustion, and career fulfillment may be most accurately assessed from a personal point of view. However, we recognize that it might be useful to see if coworkers agree that an organization is actively engaged in investiture or divestiture socialization. Additionally, the use of objective measures or repeated measures might help to reduce common method and other biases in ethics research. For example, physiological measures such as salivary cortisol levels can be used to assess stressful reactions to ethical conflict. Likewise, more behavioral objective measures like drinking and medication use can also serve as valuable measures of responses to ethics-related antecedents.</p>
<p>It is also important to acknowledge that several of the measures used in this study possessed psychometric properties that were less than optimal. For example, the Cronbach’s alpha for the divestiture socialization measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310381133">Ashforth &amp; Saks, 1996</xref>) was .67. Likewise, although the reliabilities of the remaining measures were above the commonly accepted minimum reliability of .70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206310381133">Nunnally, 1978</xref>), reliabilities for the ethical conflict, ethical beliefs, and career fulfillment measures did not exceed .80. One potential explanation for these reliability estimates involves the manner in which the study items were designed—with the intention of fully tapping the content domain of the relevant construct (i.e., to be especially varied with respect to pertinent content). Simultaneously emphasizing construct representativeness and minimal survey length may have resulted in somewhat dampened inter-item correlations and, thus, reliabilities. In addition to concerns regarding the reliability of our measures, we are mildly concerned that the low standard deviations (and variance) and high and low means of the ethical conflict and ethical belief measures, respectively, may have resulted in attenuated effect sizes for certain relationships assessed in our model. Because law students undergo substantial ethical training in law school in order to learn the ethical standards of the profession, one possible explanation for the high mean and low standard deviation of the ethical beliefs measure is that participants felt there were “correct” answers to the items and responded accordingly. Likewise, to some extent, participants could have perceived there to be correct and incorrect answers to ethical conflict items. Given these issues, researchers interested in assessing ethical beliefs and ethical conflict would be well advised to consider ways to improve the measurement of these constructs in future research.</p>
<p>A final limitation regarding the questionnaire involves the extent to which the order of survey questions might have affected results. For example, responses to the qualitative question could have been biased. We asked participants to rate their levels of ethical conflict and ethical beliefs prior to responding to this question, which likely resulted in priming effects, whereby “prior questions sometimes have the effect of directly suggesting what should be said in answer to a question” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310381133">Foddy, 1993</xref>: 63). Consequently, qualitative results should be interpreted with this potential limitation in mind. To help determine the degree to which such biases are prevalent in ethics research, future research might place general, open-ended ethics-related questions before questions that are more specific, so as to provide comparative data.</p>
<p>Additionally, although the linkages in our model are grounded in preexisting theory and, in some instances, supported by prior empirical findings, the cross-sectional nature of our data makes it impossible to make casual inferences regarding the direction of our observed relationships. Thus, future research might longitudinally investigate the relationship between socialization practices in the first few weeks on a job as predictors of emotional exhaustion over time.</p>
<p>The idea that ethical strains at work can influence career fulfillment and emotional exhaustion has not been explored in detail previously, and we believe that future research should look seriously into the ways that behaving in an unethical fashion can lead to severe negative consequences. Within the legal profession, there have been several writers who have described how the current atmosphere of competition and “winning at all costs” may be contributing to alcohol abuse, depression, and a host of other maladaptive effects on early career lawyers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310381133">Baker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206310381133">Beck et al., 1995</xref>). Our study contributes to this largely conceptual and theoretical literature by empirically demonstrating how the context of early career adjustment for some lawyers can either facilitate or impede career fulfillment. Future studies might follow along these lines to determine how pressure to make unethical decisions can influence other facets of the self-image of employees. It may also be that ethical conflicts can lead early career lawyers to exit from the profession altogether, and this occupational turnover deserves research attention as well.</p>
