<p>While the Kriegsmarine’s only aircraft carrier, the uncompleted <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic>, has attracted considerable interest over the decades, this has been limited to technical histories of the vessel. This article explores the origins of the programme and what the German navy believed it needed such vessels for. It examines the design process and the proposed method of operational employment, and seeks to place them in an international context. To date, German efforts have been considered in isolation from the wider developments in aircraft carrier technology during the interwar period. When these are taken into account a more balanced view of the German enterprise emerges.</p>

<p>The Second World War is widely seen as a transitory phase in the evolution of naval power when the era of the battleship ended and that of the aircraft carrier began.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0968344512455974">1</xref></sup> Dominance of the skies became a prerequisite to the control of the oceans. Germany’s failure to develop an effective naval air arm ultimately prevented it from disrupting Allied maritime communications. The causes were the animosity between Großadmiral Erich Raeder and Reichsmarschall Herman Göring, and the inter-service rivalry between the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe for control of German maritime aviation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0968344512455974">2</xref></sup> The failure to complete Germany’s only aircraft carrier, the <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic>, is a crucial, yet misunderstood, component of this question, despite having had numerous technical histories devoted to it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0968344512455974">3</xref></sup> The technical aspects are well understood because one of the vessel’s architects left a comprehensive account to which subsequent histories have added details.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0968344512455974">4</xref></sup> Timothy Mulligan, in reference to the battleship <italic>Bismarck</italic>, has remarked that authors ‘often treat their subjects in isolation from the factors that influence their conception, design and operational use’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0968344512455974">5</xref></sup> This apt critique is even more appropriate in the <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic>’s case, in which the background, concept of operational employment, and development process remain unknown.</p>
<p>The omission stems from the tendency of the historians who produced authoritative accounts of the German navy’s political and strategic evolution during the interwar period to ignore, or dismiss as insignificant, the carrier’s role.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0968344512455974">6</xref></sup> This was understandable given that their object in the 1960s and 1970s was a critical examination of naval policy, and they saw failure to complete a carrier as another manifestation of the fundamental problems that underpinned German naval rearmament. Following this lead, historians have assumed that prestige rather than operational concerns drove the navy’s interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0968344512455974">7</xref></sup> While prestige was important, it is an insufficient explanation as to why considerable resources were devoted to this endeavour. The purpose of this article is to bridge the divide between the existing literature on the Third Reich’s naval policy and the technical literature devoted to the naval platforms themselves. An examination of the <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic>’s development is also useful in understanding the evolution of maritime air power in general and the aircraft carrier in particular. As the latter represented the apex of military technology in the pre-atomic era, it has often been used as a case in works on the process of military revolution and on the factors influencing innovation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0968344512455974">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>German efforts need to be placed in an international context because there were many similarities with the projects of other nations, which in turn implies a far greater degree of German understanding than historians have suggested. Also there were differences that serve as a reminder that technological progress does not follow a linear path, but is dependent on factors unique to a place and time. This article will begin by exploring the origins of the German programme and what the navy believed it needed carriers for. It will then analyse how the navy approached the design and conceived its operational employment. Finally, it will briefly consider the British reaction, as this serves as a good contemporary indicator of how German efforts were perceived.</p>
<p>In an era of rapid technological change the principal naval powers were experimenting with carrier sizes and configurations, and there were major debates surrounding their capabilities and operational employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0968344512455974">9</xref></sup> The British had pioneered the development of carrier aviation and maintained the largest force throughout the interwar period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0968344512455974">10</xref></sup> Both the Americans and Japanese benefited from British assistance in carrier design and, in the case of the latter, the development of naval aviation. This facilitated the process and, although quantifying such impact is difficult, it has been suggested that British knowledge saved the Americans two years of development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0968344512455974">11</xref></sup> After building an experimental carrier, the Americans converted two battlecruisers into large carriers, but the subsequent five purpose-built vessels of the 1930s oscillated between medium and large types before a two-year pause on further construction was taken to evaluate each type’s suitability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0968344512455974">12</xref></sup> The Japanese followed a similar path except that their purpose-built carriers were composed of a wider mix of light, medium, and large vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0968344512455974">13</xref></sup> Concurrently, cruiser-carrier hybrids attracted interest, as they seemed to offer the possibility of simultaneously augmenting cruiser and aircraft numbers available for fleet operations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0968344512455974">14</xref></sup> In practice the idea was flawed as the fragile aircraft and aviation facilities could easily be damaged in combat by both enemy fire and the blast effect from the vessels’ guns. The British abandoned the concept after an initial trial, while in America the idea was intensively debated in military-political circles and had powerful supporters, so that it was not until 1934 that the idea was abandoned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0968344512455974">15</xref></sup> Only the Japanese and Swedish navies operated a small number of cruiser-seaplane carriers, although the idea re-emerged in the early stages of the war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0968344512455974">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>I. The Origins of the German Carrier Programme</title>
<p>The development of German maritime aviation began shortly before the First World War and focused on airships to provide long-range reconnaissance for the fleet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0968344512455974">17</xref></sup> From initially very modest capabilities, by 1917 a large and well-equipped naval air arm allowed the Germans to achieve air superiority in the lower North and Baltic seas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0968344512455974">18</xref></sup> A small number of vessels were converted into seaplane tenders, but plans to convert a liner into a carrier had advanced little by late 1918, and none of this work had an impact on development in the 1930s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0968344512455974">19</xref></sup> The navy recognized that the rapid advances in aviation technology had profound consequences for naval operations, and in 1916 it had opposed the creation of an independent air force to ensure control of maritime aviation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0968344512455974">20</xref></sup> The Treaty of Versailles banned Germany from maintaining military aviation and thus, by extension, from developing carriers. Faced with internal unrest, political instability, and the poor financial state of the Weimar Republic, the navy had neither the opportunity nor the resources to invest heavily in maritime aviation. When funds for clandestine naval rearmament became available following the January 1923 Ruhr crisis, a significant proportion was devoted to the development of an embryonic naval air arm in conjunction with industry and civilian aviation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0968344512455974">21</xref></sup> Given the severe political and financial constraints, the idea of acquiring carriers was not contemplated, although there was limited civilian interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0968344512455974">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1928 the authorization of funds by the Reichstag for the <italic>Panzerschiff Deutschland</italic> was an important development for the navy and allowed it to begin conceiving a long-term building programme. The new commander-in-chief, Admiral Erich Raeder, made the first reference to a carrier in a memorandum drafted in January 1929 for the defence minister, General Wilhelm Groener, on the ideal composition of the fleet once it was freed from Versailles treaty constraints.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0968344512455974">23</xref></sup> Raeder argued for at least one carrier along with a sizeable naval air arm, but, owing to political considerations, references to a carrier were omitted from the <italic>Schiffbauersatzplan</italic> approved by the Reichstag in the spring of 1931. Internally the carrier, referred to as a 10,000 t <italic>Flugdeckkreuzer</italic>, remained part of future planning, and in 1931 maritime aviation was integrated into fleet manoeuvres.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0968344512455974">24</xref></sup> By the autumn of 1932 a more ambitious rearmament plan was adopted as a result of a changing international climate and to assist industry during the recession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0968344512455974">25</xref></sup> The naval segment of the <italic>Umbauplan</italic> foresaw the creation of a naval air arm in 1934 and, although details remained vague, the completion of a carrier by 1938.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0968344512455974">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The National Socialist accession to power in January 1933 progressively loosened political constraints and provided more resources for naval rearmament. Adolf Hitler initially limited the politically contentious aspects of the programme, submarines, aviation, and larger <italic>Panzerschiffe</italic>, so as not to jeopardize a political agreement with Britain. In Raeder’s first personal conversation with Hitler in April, he emphasized the naval role in securing the Baltic and protecting German trade in the North Sea, underlining the importance of aviation and carrier vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0968344512455974">27</xref></sup> The first carrier specification, drafted that summer, expected construction to begin in 1937. It foresaw a modest 10,000 t vessel carrying 25 to 30 aircraft, capable of 32 kt and an endurance of 3000 nm at 20 kt. The need to gather information on foreign carrier programmes was understood as a fundamental prerequisite to prevent later delays.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0968344512455974">28</xref></sup> Within a month of this first specification Raeder indicated that a carrier might be ordered as early as 1935.</p>
<p>By late 1933 the operational role of the carrier had become defined. In the 1920s the small, obsolete German fleet was limited to a defensive strategy in the Baltic against a potential Franco-Polish alliance. The naval leadership was not content with this role, and argued that a more offensive strategy was needed in the North Sea and beyond to protect overseas commerce vital to the German economy. With <italic>Panzerschiffe</italic> combining the firepower of a capital ship with the speed and endurance of a cruiser, Germany could menace French trade throughout the Atlantic. These warships could tie down a large French force in commerce protection by spreading uncertainty. The shift towards an Atlantic-centric strategy evolved gradually between 1929 and 1934, while the operational scheme for a war against France was first explored in 1932.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0968344512455974">29</xref></sup> Reconnaissance was vitally important as <italic>Panzerschiff</italic> operations required tactical surprise to engage commercial shipping and evade superior enemy forces such as the Dunkerque-class battlecruisers then under construction. Existing German light cruisers and torpedo boats lacked the endurance, sustained speed, and, in the case of the latter, sea-keeping ability to operate with the <italic>Panzerschiffe</italic> in the Atlantic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0968344512455974">30</xref></sup> Only four destroyers, then under construction, were thought to be Atlantic capable.</p>
<p>Maritime aviation offered a solution, and there was extensive collaboration with civilian airlines in the development of long-range flying, oceanic navigation, and radio communications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0968344512455974">31</xref></sup> However, land-based aircraft operating from Germany lacked the range to operate beyond the North Sea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0968344512455974">32</xref></sup> Only naval aviation could operate over the ocean, but the few seaplanes carried by the <italic>Panzerschiffe</italic> were limited to operating in good weather. A carrier’s far larger air group could operate in poorer conditions, offering a substantial increase in capability, and the navy was willing to concede cruiser tonnage to build carriers, should it be allowed to join the London Treaty. The shift from a battle line to raiding groups required more smaller carriers rather than one or two large ones. To operate with the <italic>Panzerschiffe</italic> they needed to have considerable endurance (12,000 nm at 20 kt) and be capable of sustained high speed for air operations. They also needed the equivalent armament and protection to ward off destroyer attacks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0968344512455974">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In March 1934 a new <italic>Schiffbauersatzplan</italic> was drafted that, alongside a core of eight <italic>Panzerschiffe</italic>, included three 15,000 t carriers, two for active service and one in reserve.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0968344512455974">34</xref></sup> The shift from small- to medium-sized carriers, transforming the vessels from escorts into capital ships, had numerous causes. First consultations with the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM), had established that a longer flight deck was needed to operate future aircraft.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0968344512455974">35</xref></sup> The perceived weakness of carriers, with some officers referring to them as ‘petrol boxes’, also caused considerable concern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0968344512455974">36</xref></sup> The Washington Treaty stipulated that aircraft carriers, vessels of over 10,000 t designed specifically and exclusively for the purpose of carrying aircraft, were permitted to carry 15 cm guns, and made an extra provision allowing the two American battlecruiser conversions to mount four twin 20.3 cm turrets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0968344512455974">37</xref></sup> The Germans saw this as an indicator that the Americans believed carriers to be capable of surface action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0968344512455974">38</xref></sup> The severe German numerical inferiority meant that the fighting potential of every warship needed to be maximized and prompted Raeder to demand a heavier gun battery for the carriers. As a general rule, the larger a carrier the more stable a platform it provides for operations. Thus the shift towards an Atlantic role also required a larger hull for greater stability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0968344512455974">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the late spring Raeder ordered that the first carrier be added to the 1935 construction plan, alongside a further <italic>Panzerschiff</italic> and two heavy cruisers. Admiral Otto Groos, outgoing head of the Marinekommandoamt, proposed that detailed design work commence in anticipation of actual construction beginning in October 1935.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0968344512455974">40</xref></sup> As there were sufficient indicators to believe that Germany would be released from existing limitations, Raeder directed that planning be based on the navy growing to a third of the size of the Royal Navy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0968344512455974">41</xref></sup> This would allow 45,000 t for three carriers. All staff meetings dealing with the carriers stressed the need to acquire information on suitable designs and operational deployments by foreign navies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0968344512455974">42</xref></sup> Initially the discussions were restricted to a very small circle of staff officers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0968344512455974">43</xref></sup> The small numbers of architects and engineers in the navy’s technical offices were already overwhelmed with design work before the expansion envisaged by the 1932 <italic>Umbauplan</italic> exacerbated the situation. Further acceleration of the pace of naval rearmament required an increase in naval staff and that private shipyards be more closely integrated into the planning process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0968344512455974">44</xref></sup> It was nearly a year after the first specification was produced that a naval architect was appointed to work on the carrier. Wilhelm Hadeler quickly concluded that the navy lacked the necessary information, and as 1934 progressed the Marineleitung was seriously concerned that the lack of information would cause delays to the programme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0968344512455974">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although naval intelligence gathered and analysed foreign press reports and technical journals for information, it obtained little substantive material on carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0968344512455974">46</xref></sup> This was partly because the major powers released little information into the public domain, but mainly the problem was one of not having good access to relevant foreign source material. Until 1933 there were no German naval attachés abroad, and material obtained, such as press photographs of the <italic>Lexington</italic> and <italic>Saratoga</italic>, had little actual value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0968344512455974">47</xref></sup> The Treaty of Versailles did not forbid attachés, but a combination of domestic politics and economic constraints prevented their secondment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0968344512455974">48</xref></sup> When attachés were posted overseas from 1933 the general information available to the navy increased considerably.</p>
<p>Kapt.z.S. Erwin Waßner, the attaché to Britain, received a detailed list of questions on British carriers and maritime aviation; visiting a carrier was considered far more important than inspecting a battleship or modern cruiser.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0968344512455974">49</xref></sup> In February 1934 Admiral Gerald Dickens, the Director of Naval Intelligence, had offered Waßner a tour of a carrier; perhaps unsurprisingly this never materialized. Inspecting foreign warships was a highly political gesture and one that generally required some reciprocal action, yet the Germans were going to great lengths to conceal items of most interest to the British, such as the <italic>Panzerschiffe</italic> and the stockpiling of submarine components. Raeder’s overriding priority was an agreement with Britain over German naval rearmament, and approaching the Royal Navy for information on aircraft and ships that Germany was not allowed to possess was simply out of the question.</p>
<p>Given the sensitivity of the relationship with the British, Berlin exercised considerable control over Waßner’s dealings, and, when in March 1935 he saw an opportunity to ask the Admiralty for information on the Fleet Air Arm, he was ordered not to proceed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0968344512455974">50</xref></sup> Instead, he relied on press reports and informal conversations. Thus his reports remained limited, although they did confirm that there was considerable debate within the Royal Navy on the utility and design of carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0968344512455974">51</xref></sup> The fact that the British had converted, reconverted, and built carriers of differing displacements was seen as an indication of British uncertainty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0968344512455974">52</xref></sup> In 1935 the First Sea lord, Admiral Ernie Chatfield, told Waßner that the British would focus on 15,000 t carriers as this was the best compromise between size and handling abilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0968344512455974">53</xref></sup> In contrast, Dickens was a strong advocate of the hybrid concept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0968344512455974">54</xref></sup> Throughout the 1930s German civilian naval officials would travel to Britain to attend the ‘Navy Weeks’ to gather technical information, and in August 1935 Heinrich Ohlerich, Hadeler’s superior and principal designer of the carrier, went to Portsmouth when it became known that <italic>Furious</italic> would be open to the public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0968344512455974">55</xref></sup> On another occasion German observers viewed <italic>Courageous</italic> when she visited Copenhagen in 1937.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0968344512455974">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the German and American armies forged close links between 1929 and 1934, the navy never created corresponding links with the US Navy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0968344512455974">57</xref></sup> The naval attaché in Washington was able to visit an American cruiser in early 1934, but he never seriously considered approaching the Americans to view one of their carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0968344512455974">58</xref></sup> Open-source material on American naval policy and press reports on fleet manoeuvres were easily obtained, but this information could not answer detailed technical and operational questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0968344512455974">59</xref></sup> In 1938 German military intelligence managed to obtain some undisclosed information on the carrier <italic>Wasp</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0968344512455974">60</xref></sup> What if any impact this had is unclear. This only left the Japanese, but little was known about the Imperial Japanese Navy’s carriers.</p>
<p>The subsequent interaction between the German and Japanese navies throughout 1935, involving a bilateral technology transfer, has been examined in some detail as part of the relationship between the future Axis partners. Although well known, the episode has been somewhat misunderstood from the perspective of the German carrier programme. One group of diplomatic historians has been critical of the navy’s seeming lack of interest in the transfer process, singling out the construction department for criticism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0968344512455974">61</xref></sup> Conversely, technical historians have assumed that, because information was obtained from the Japanese, it must have been influential on the design of the <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic>. As will be shown, both positions need to be qualified, and Japanese assistance, though useful, was not a major factor.</p>
<p>In 1934 German-Japanese naval relations were limited, but at the end of the year a Luftwaffe officer, Oberstleutnant Joachim Coeler, a First World War naval aviator more recently involved in the clandestine maritime aviation programme, travelled to Tokyo.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0968344512455974">62</xref></sup> The naval attaché, Kapt.z.S. Paul Wenneker, managed to persuade the Japanese to grant access to facilities before the details of a reciprocal Japanese attaché in Germany were arranged. Coeler and Wenneker viewed the carrier <italic>Akagi</italic> but, although the trip was judged a success, no information on operational use was gained, nor could Wenneker obtain any subsequently.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0968344512455974">63</xref></sup> One month later the Japanese naval attaché in Berlin offered the RLM the opportunity for a German engineer to study carrier design in Japan for up to a year in exchange for the plans of a modern dive-bomber.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0968344512455974">64</xref></sup> The RLM was interested, but the navy was less so, despite the need for information, because it suspected duplicity on the part of the Japanese as they sought a maximum return for minimum effort.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0968344512455974">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, Admiral Günther Guse, the new chief of the Marinekommandoamt, wanted to send an officer to gain experience of flight operations and tactical handling of carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0968344512455974">66</xref></sup> This was vital to understanding the operational capabilities and the development of equipment. The key question was how rapidly aircraft could be launched and recovered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0968344512455974">67</xref></sup> As the object of another trip was to obtain operational information, the construction department did not believe it was necessary to send an engineer, but the RLM wanted to send an officer to study Japanese seaplanes. The negotiations became protracted as Japanese demands increased. A Japanese naval delegation had been allowed to visit German installations and the <italic>Panzerschiff Admiral Scheer</italic> as part of the January agreement, and the navy was prepared to provide further information on the <italic>Scheer</italic>’s fire-control system in return for carrier information. The Germans recognized the limits of information hitherto received. Rear Admiral Karl Witzell, the head of the weapons department, felt that the <italic>Akagi</italic> had been specially prepared to yield as little as possible to inspection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0968344512455974">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the summer the process had stalled, but then, in return for a larger package encompassing aircraft designs, information on submarine propulsion, fire-control systems, and torpedo technology, the Japanese became willing to give the Germans access to, and technical data on, their carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0968344512455974">69</xref></sup> Two officers and a naval architect could visit Japan for three months. Berlin wanted to dispatch the delegation as soon as possible lest the Japanese autumn manoeuvres were used as an excuse to limit access.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0968344512455974">70</xref></sup> For three months the Germans were given schematics and technical manuals and access to facilities and the <italic>Akagi</italic>.

<title>II. The Design</title>
<p>The Anglo-German Naval Treaty of June 1935 entitled Germany to a fleet 35 per cent the size of the British one and to construct carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0968344512455974">73</xref></sup> This was slightly more favourable than the basis of previous planning and increased the carrier allocation from 45,000 t to 47,250 t.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0968344512455974">74</xref></sup> Once the British provided details of their warships it became apparent that the British carrier displacement had been overestimated, and so in fact only 38,500 t were available. Although the Germans generously underestimated their warships’ displacements to circumvent treaty restrictions, this reclassifying, coupled with the escalating displacement of the carrier design, ruled out three carriers. Raeder advocated completing a 15,000 t carrier and then using the remaining allocation to complete the largest possible vessel (approximately 23,000 t) as this would ensure at least one Atlantic-capable vessel. Another possibility was to construct smaller carriers and use the remaining tonnage for a light cruiser. Neither option appealed to the naval staff, as operational requirements necessitated two Atlantic-capable carriers, and thus it was decided in September to construct two 19,250 t vessels and, using the increased displacement, to install machinery capable of 35 kt and augment the armour scheme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0968344512455974">75</xref></sup> To overcome the stability problems that deck turrets might cause in the Atlantic, the 15 cm guns were moved into casemates along the hull, but as these had a restricted field of fire the battery was doubled to 16 guns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0968344512455974">76</xref></sup> The anti-aircraft armament was also doubled.</p>
<p>The design process occurred at a transitional phase in aircraft development. Biplane fighters, in use until the mid-1930s, could be launched from the hangar deck over the bow, but new, higher-performance monoplane aircraft could not. The question was whether the carriers were to have such a flying-off deck below the flight deck, modelled on the original configuration of the British <italic>Courageous</italic>. The desire to lay down a carrier at the earliest possible point meant that this was the most pressing question in the summer of 1935, and the Japan delegation was asked to send its findings back to Germany on a regular basis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0968344512455974">77</xref></sup> At the end of its tour the delegation recommended a 20,000 t carrier as offering the best compromise between ship handling, platform stability, and embarked air-group size. A flight deck 250 m long and 27 m wide would enable concurrent launches and landings, and provide a deck park for 50 aircraft. Two or three catapults and three lifts to the hangar deck would ensure a reasonable tempo of operations. The Japanese did not recommend the adoption of a flying-off deck and, after the delegation left, the <italic>Akagi</italic> had hers removed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0968344512455974">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two carriers were officially ordered on 16 November 1935. The contract for <italic>Flugzeugträger A</italic> was awarded to Deutsche Werke Kiel (DWK) and it was laid down on 28 December 1936. This was only 20 days after the <italic>Gneisenau</italic> had been launched from the same slipway.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0968344512455974">79</xref></sup> The completion date was set for June 1940. The September 19,250 t scheme was a modern carrier that blended British, American, and Japanese approaches, and the navy believed that its design was vindicated by similar characteristics in other carriers then under construction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0968344512455974">80</xref></sup> The carrier would be capable of 35 kt, have an endurance of 9000 nm at 20 kt, a crew of 1720, and embark an air group of four squadrons, 40 aircraft housed on two hangar decks and operating from a 250 m flight deck. The choice of a larger carrier also stemmed from some good analysis of foreign carrier programmes that showed the seemingly attractive proposition of a light carrier to be flawed. The tiny Japanese <italic>Ryujo</italic> had prompted the small carrier scheme of 1933. Further research showed that the ship became useable only after extensive reconstruction and that <italic>Soryu</italic> and <italic>Hiryu</italic>, under construction in 1934–6, were designated at 10,050 t, but were planned as 17,000–20,000 t carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0968344512455974">81</xref></sup> The 1934 15,000 t scheme looked towards the American <italic>Ranger</italic> that seemed to offer the ideal combination of a large air group and a small, purpose-built hull. By late 1934 the Germans were aware that the design was classed a failure in America and that the next carriers were increased to 20,000 t vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0968344512455974">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>How much influence the Japanese information had is disputed. Kapt.z.S. Werner Fuchs considered it useful, while Hadeler, who was involved in the design from the outset, was less impressed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0968344512455974">83</xref></sup> Apart from settling the issue of the flying-off deck, little Japanese influence may be detected, and it was not instrumental in shaping the design. The navy had looked to Japan primarily for operational and tactical information, but there is no evidence that any substantive insights were gained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0968344512455974">84</xref></sup> Hadeler asserts the dominant British influence, manifesting itself most obviously in the incorporation and layout of the island. The navy saw an island improving the ships’ handling, facilitating the direction of deck operations, albeit restricting the available space, and providing more space for air defence armament and fire control. It was known that the Americans too had rejected a complete flat-top design for the <italic>Ranger</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0968344512455974">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the navy undertook extensive wind tunnel and water-tank model testing to independently evaluate such aspects as airflow over the deck and ship handling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0968344512455974">86</xref></sup> A Japanese lift arrangement was adopted, but two catapults were installed following British and American practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0968344512455974">87</xref></sup> It was understood that the operating environments of the Pacific and Atlantic were dissimilar and required different designs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0968344512455974">88</xref></sup> The intention was to keep the aircraft predominantly below deck, owing to the varying climates in which the carrier would operate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0968344512455974">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>The failure to complete a carrier was the result of a number of factors, but needs to be considered in the context of the rapid expansion of German rearmament that stretched the industrial and manpower resources of the Reich. The 1934 <italic>Schiffbauerstazplan</italic> already exceeded the ability of German yards to deliver ships within the anticipated time frames. By 1935 the navy accepted that a saturation point had been reached, which was delaying further orders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0968344512455974">90</xref></sup> Following the austere Weimar era the sector lacked the capacity and skilled workers for a rapid expansion. The shortage of steel and other materials, and the complexity of new-generation warships, compounded the problem. Orders again ceased in March 1937 when average delays of a year were expected, and by December these had increased to two years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0968344512455974">91</xref></sup> Of the 4 battleships, 5 cruisers, 2 carriers, 15 destroyers, 18 torpedo boats, and 36 submarines ordered by 1935, only 2 battleships, 1 cruiser, 14 destroyers, and 21 submarines were in service by September 1939. Work on the <italic>Bismarck, Tirpitz</italic>, and <italic>Prinz Eugen</italic> consumed 17.7 million man-hours after September 1939.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0968344512455974">92</xref></sup> None of the programmes were supposed to be ready for 1939; the completion date of the 1934 <italic>Schiffbauerstazplan</italic> was 1950. In May 1938 Hitler informed Raeder that he would not need the fleet until the mid-1940s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0968344512455974">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the complexity of carriers it is not surprising that the <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic> was projected to be one of the most delayed. The British, Americans, and Japanese experienced delays with all their carriers, despite methodical approaches and experimental vessels. The desire to order the carrier at the earliest opportunity meant that many of the details relating to carrier-specific equipment had not been finalized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0968344512455974">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been pointed out that the original design team on <italic>Ark Royal</italic> was ‘tiny’ at five, but against this the initial German single-man approach was minute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0968344512455974">95</xref></sup> DWK asked for detailed information months before the contract was awarded, and established a separate design office for the project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0968344512455974">96</xref></sup> Given the number of good technical histories it is not proposed to examine this aspect in detail, but a few points are worth making.</p>
<p>Internationally there were debates about the nature of a carrier’s armament as, until the introduction of higher-performance monoplane aircraft, a carrier air wing remained a comparatively weak instrument. Carriers generally had medium-calibre guns to ensure against surprise cruiser or destroyer attacks. In the USN the carriers were employed independently of the battle line, owing to their considerably higher speeds, and there was strong pressure not only to retain the 8 inch batteries in <italic>Lexington</italic> and <italic>Saratoga</italic>, but also to give new carriers a robust gun armament.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0968344512455974">97</xref></sup> In Germany the idea that a carrier might be able to engage in gunnery action had receded by the late 1930s, and the emphasis was placed instead on speed and the anti-aircraft armament. Operational requirements demanded speed, endurance, and lighter machinery to reduce overall displacement, and so created a considerable problem. While <italic>Panzerschiffe</italic> utilized highly efficient diesels, the carrier’s size and high-speed requirement necessitated another solution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0968344512455974">98</xref></sup> It was decided to equip the vessel with the most powerful machinery ever installed on any warship, based primarily on as yet untried high-pressure steam turbines. It was understood that the size of the power plant, its complexity, the need to adopt a new four-shaft configuration, and the length of the hull were all likely to have implications for the handling of the ship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0968344512455974">99</xref></sup> Delays in assembling and installing the machinery were inevitable.</p>
<p>The navy’s focus on qualitative superiority to counter its numerical inferiority resulted in long delays, as experimental technology was readied for operational employment. As it was a completely new type, much of the equipment for the carrier needed developing. Examples included complex armoured lifts or Voith-Schneider vertical screw propellers fitted into the hull to improve manoeuvrability in harbours and at low speed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0968344512455974">100</xref></sup> Considerable effort went into the ship’s active and passive defences to counter the land-based air threat in European waters. Asbestos–steel fire-curtains were fitted throughout the hangars, as were automatic sprinkler systems and inert gas suppression systems for confined spaces and fuel lines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0968344512455974">101</xref></sup> The anti-aircraft battery was large, composed of 105, 88, and 37 mm guns to be controlled by new fire-control units then under development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0968344512455974">102</xref></sup> A complex catapult system was devised to rapidly launch the fighters, eight aircraft in under four minutes, regardless of weather conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0968344512455974">103</xref></sup> Later it was planned to equip the carrier with extensive radar, fighter-control, and signals intelligence-gathering equipment to support operations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0968344512455974">104</xref></sup></p>

<title>III. The Concept of Operations</title>
<p>The January 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact allowed the navy to focus on Atlantic operations against France. That spring the Marinekommandoamt conducted a war game utilizing the forces envisaged in the 1932 <italic>Umbauplan</italic> to examine the options for employing raiding groups. Two <italic>Panzerschiffe</italic>, a carrier, and heavy cruisers would operate against troop transports and embarkation ports in the eastern Atlantic between Cape St Vincent and North Africa, while other forces conducted commerce warfare throughout the Atlantic. In such a scenario naval aviation was deemed essential as a carrier could undertake reconnaissance and attack enemy shipping over wide distances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0968344512455974">105</xref></sup> Only carrier aircraft could strike the Atlantic ports, as German land-based bombers lacked sufficient range. However, such operations were inherently risky owing to the influence of weather on air operations and exposure to French land-based aviation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0968344512455974">106</xref></sup> This audacious scheme remained the basis of German operational planning throughout the 1930s. It has to be acknowledged that the navy made questionable assumptions about the political context and the availability and suitability of its warships; however, the focus here is only on the role envisaged for the carrier.</p>
<p>In 1934 there were indications that the French wanted two 12,000 t carriers, but by mid-1935 intelligence showed that the focus had shifted to new battleships to counter the <italic>Panzerschiff</italic> threat and the Italians in the Mediterranean.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0968344512455974">107</xref></sup> Intelligence also indicated that the French did not anticipate the Germans ever having more than a handful of seaplanes to support Atlantic operations. Thus with a carrier the German navy would enjoy air superiority outside coastal regions and on the fringes of the French empire. The emphasis on reconnaissance should not be seen as a doctrinal limitation as is sometimes suggested<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0968344512455974">108</xref></sup> but judged in the light of First World War experiences, when on numerous occasions German forces were caught in tactically unfavourable conditions. All warships down to cruisers were initially designed to carry as many seaplanes as possible, but technical issues forced reductions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0968344512455974">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most operational understanding of carrier employment derived from signals intelligence observation of the British.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0968344512455974">110</xref></sup> Despite the British limiting the use of radio communications to the detriment of air operations to prevent such compromise, the navy’s B-Dienst provided a steady stream of useful information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0968344512455974">111</xref></sup> This began in 1934 with the observation of British Home and Mediterranean Fleet exercises in the West Indies that simulated a land-based power attacking one dependent on seaborne commerce.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0968344512455974">112</xref></sup> In 1935 the B-Dienst was specifically asked to examine whether carriers could be employed to protect commerce (and by extension disrupt it) and if aviation could substitute for surface vessels as escorts to capital ships.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0968344512455974">113</xref></sup> This issue was raised by the 1934 war game. While there were limits on how much could be derived from signals intelligence, the importance of naval aviation in reconnaissance, strike, and anti-submarine roles was clear from evaluating British operations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0968344512455974">114</xref></sup> Signals intelligence could provide insights into the composition of the air groups embarked on British carriers, as well as the effects of bad weather on flight operations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0968344512455974">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>In early 1937 Raeder presented to Hitler and other senior Reich officials the concept of combined capital–carrier groups operating against supply lines as the basis of naval planning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0968344512455974">116</xref></sup> The scheme against France incrementally expanded the area of operations until by the winter 1937/8 war game it encompassed the entire north Atlantic. The centrepieces were two battle groups composed of battleships and carriers that would protect German trade and engage French capital ships. The <italic>Panzerschiffe</italic> were detached to operate alongside submarines, and auxiliary cruisers against French commerce and military shipping in the Mediterranean. Naval aviation would contribute considerably to the diversionary effect it was anticipated such operations would have on the French, as the exercise included a carrier strike on Casablanca that was hoped would cause the French to operate defensively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0968344512455974">117</xref></sup> The magazines held sufficient ordnance for the air wing to conduct sustained operations, and eight weeks’ worth of provisions for the crew were to be carried.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0968344512455974">118</xref></sup> The vulnerability issue remained a serious concern. Signals intelligence revealed that the British never operated without destroyer screens, and the war game had shown the need for such protection against submarines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0968344512455974">119</xref></sup> The fact that there were no German destroyers suited to Atlantic operations therefore had implications for their future designs. As with that for the carrier, those for destroyers were plagued by problems of balancing speed, endurance, firepower, and protection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0968344512455974">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>This planning exercise was the last in which France was considered the primary opponent. With Hitler’s May 1938 order to consider also the British as opponents, the navy faced the insoluble problem of having to deal with the vastly superior Royal Navy. In response Raeder tasked Guse to set up a committee to examine which ships were best suited to the new strategic environment. The subsequent debate is often portrayed as one between the conventional balanced fleet and one tailored to prosecuting commerce warfare against Britain with cruisers, as advocated by Helmuth Heye, at the time responsible for operational plans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0968344512455974">121</xref></sup> The assertion that the committee had no interest in carriers, which did not feature prominently in either model, is an oversimplification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0968344512455974">122</xref></sup> By October 1938 the <italic>Planungsausschuss</italic> doubted that the carrier could be used in the Atlantic owing to the problems with the high-pressure steam propulsion and wanted work suspended.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0968344512455974">123</xref></sup> The problem was not carrier-specific, and in fact most of the larger warships under construction were deemed unfit for Atlantic warfare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-0968344512455974">124</xref></sup> Heye saw the potential of naval aviation in commerce warfare and, although he had reservations about carriers, he was not categorically opposed. He was critical of the carrier’s now large size as it would represent a substantial blow if lost in combat.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-0968344512455974">125</xref></sup> In commerce warfare, as now envisaged, smaller carriers would be better. Here was an example of how a fleet tailored to counter the French was not necessarily appropriate to deal with the British.</p>
<p>The argument that the navy generally had little interest in carriers and considered such vessels weak implies that one of the largest German engineering projects was initiated without any identifiable patrons or belief in its utility. Despite the Reich’s aptitude for bureaucratic inefficiency and factional infighting, such an explanation is unconvincing. In fact the carrier project was given considerable resources, which makes it difficult to see the project as a sideshow or paper project. There were only three slipways for capital ship construction; two were occupied by battleships and one by the carrier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-0968344512455974">126</xref></sup> By the end of 1939 around 70 million Reichsmarks had been spent on the carrier. In addition, the machinery for the second vessel had been delivered, new airbases constructed, and a large new dry dock was planned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-0968344512455974">127</xref></sup> By comparison, the construction costs of the <italic>Bismarck</italic> amounted to about 71.6 million RM, while the complete price came to 196.8 million RM, given the expense of the armament and such equipment as fire-control systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn128-0968344512455974">128</xref></sup> Accepting the propulsion issue, and the general delays caused by steel and manpower shortages, construction of the carrier does not seem to have posed any major obstacles. In early 1939 further assistance from the Japanese was turned down.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn129-0968344512455974">129</xref></sup> The <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic> was launched on 8 December 1938 at a huge ceremony attended by many of the Reich’s military-political elite. This first phase of construction had proceeded as planned without any problems, unlike the battleships that were delayed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn130-0968344512455974">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>The outgoing fleet commander, Admiral Rolf Carls, responding to Heye’s first draft in September 1938, saw oceanic raiding groups centred on battlecruisers and carriers as the means to attack British commerce.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn131-0968344512455974">131</xref></sup> Undeniably the naval leadership was battleship-minded, but in the United States too a similar view persisted until the 1940s. In American and British pre-war exercises carriers were regularly declared sunk, to demonstrate their vulnerability. Raeder’s characterization of the limits and capabilities of aircraft in 1937 (endurance, payload, weather dependency, and legal constraints) was a conservative, but largely realistic, assessment of the existing capabilities. Although he saw aircraft primarily as reconnaissance platforms, he acknowledged their strike potential and considered aviation crucial to naval operations.</p>
<p>In late 1938 the operations department prioritized carriers behind battleships, submarines, and new battlecruisers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn132-0968344512455974">132</xref></sup> This made sense, given that the first carrier had only just been launched. Otto Ciliax had warned of the risks of embarking on the carrier programme without sufficient time for experimentation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn133-0968344512455974">133</xref></sup> The fact that the Z-Plan, the culmination of the autumn deliberations, included ‘only’ four carriers should not be taken to mean the naval leadership dismissed the utility of the carrier. Presumably the four were intended as the core of the oceanic raiding groups; rather than a plan, this was simply a gargantuan wish list. Internationally also most pre-war plans focused on battleships. More important was the experience of the winter 1938 war game in which the practicalities of warfare against Britain were examined, the results of which suggested that carriers would be crucial. The Home Fleet, with its two carriers, could continuously patrol the North Sea exits, but with five carriers the British could cover the entire Atlantic between Greenland and Scotland. In an ocean carrier-versus-carrier clash <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic> might prevail, but during the breakout phase into the north Atlantic it would have to deal with land-based aircraft, which underlines the importance of its defences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn134-0968344512455974">134</xref></sup></p>

<title>IV. The British Perception</title>
<p>Historians examining British reactions to German naval rearmament have ignored the implications of a German carrier for British maritime commerce and communications when, in fact, the Admiralty perceived them with great concern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn135-0968344512455974">135</xref></sup> Briefly examining the British position provides a good contemporary barometer with which to gauge German efforts. German interest in maritime aviation had been noted since 1929 when rumours of clandestine flying activities emerged, but, when Britain and France formally protested, the Reichswehrministerium denied the existence of an air arm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn136-0968344512455974">136</xref></sup> Later, although German officers never mentioned carriers in official conversations, they unofficially indicated that they saw aircraft as essential.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn137-0968344512455974">137</xref></sup> In 1934 the Admiralty felt it would be impossible to prevent the Germans from constructing a carrier if Germany entered a naval agreement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn138-0968344512455974">138</xref></sup> It was assumed the Germans would seek to build a carrier to the largest possible design. In the event of an Anglo-German conflict at least two, if not three, carriers would be needed in home waters to ensure a decisive superiority over the probably larger German vessel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn139-0968344512455974">139</xref></sup> British naval intelligence believed the Germans wanted two carriers and would be able to construct them within three years, with one being completed in 1939 and the other in 1942.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn140-0968344512455974">140</xref></sup> When the naval attaché in Berlin examined the issue in February 1935, he reported that it was evident that the Germans had been keenly studying foreign carrier development and that there seemed to be a preference for a medium-sized vessel rather than a larger 22,000 t carrier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn141-0968344512455974">141</xref></sup> If Germany were authorized to construct up to a third of the British tonnage, this would entitle them to 42,000 t and equate to at least three medium carriers.</p>
<p>By 1936 the British believed that the German carriers would be far larger and more effective, and displace over 20,000 t.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn142-0968344512455974">142</xref></sup> Aircraft, owing to their superior speed and numbers, were considered a far greater threat to maritime communications than submarines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn143-0968344512455974">143</xref></sup> As long as Germany was limited to maritime aviation the threat would be limited to the North Sea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn144-0968344512455974">144</xref></sup> The seaplanes carried by warships were not seen as significantly enhancing German capabilities. Carriers would greatly increase the difficulty of trade protection as, with air support, surface raiders could cover more ocean and operate further from focal or assembly points, also in poorer conditions. Thus, this combination constituted the worst-case scenario.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn145-0968344512455974">145</xref></sup> The Japanese showed how effectively carriers could operate against commerce off the Indian coast in April 1942.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn146-0968344512455974">146</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the Admiralty there was a sense that the Germans would inevitably acquire carriers, and planning was conducted on this basis. For example, in March 1938 an exercise was held at sea to examine how large convoys could be protected against combined attacks by warships, submarines, and aircraft. The Red force was composed of battleships <italic>Nelson</italic> and <italic>Rodney</italic> simulating fast battleships, with the carrier <italic>Courageous</italic> and submarines closely resembling the German threat. The results were not encouraging, as the convoys and Blue forces incurred heavy loses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn147-0968344512455974">147</xref></sup> Although intelligence had allowed the British to gain a reasonable insight into German submarine and warship construction, nothing was known about the <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn148-0968344512455974">148</xref></sup> In the German press, reports of naval construction were heavily censored and, even after the launch of the carrier, little information reached the public domain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn149-0968344512455974">149</xref></sup></p>
<p>From September 1939 surface raiders caused havoc to Allied maritime communications through physical destruction and delays caused by the need to reroute and escort transatlantic convoys.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn150-0968344512455974">150</xref></sup> After the destruction of the <italic>Graf Spee</italic> in December 1939 the Admiralty was very concerned about the prospect of more and larger German vessels coming into service, and in January 1940 the director of plans concluded that it was ‘the aircraft carrier <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic> which is likely to provide our most disagreeable problem’. A German carrier in the Atlantic would make it hard to hide convoys and would allow raiders to evade Allied hunting groups. Hence the Admiralty wanted to sink the <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic> before its shortly anticipated completion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn151-0968344512455974">151</xref></sup> As the RAF then lacked the capability to engage warships effectively, and because a continuous submarine presence off Kiel could not be maintained for lack of a suitable base in the Baltic, the Admiralty considered a carrier air strike or utilizing Swordfish aircraft with new long-range fuel tanks operating from Britain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn152-0968344512455974">152</xref></sup></p>
<p>The German occupation of Denmark, Norway, and France in 1940 negated some of the carrier’s utility, as maritime air power could be projected from new airbases deep into the Atlantic. The wartime development of the <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic> only requires brief attention to explain why work ceased. By September 1939 the carrier was 85 per cent complete, most machinery had been installed, and initially work continued unaffected. The prioritization of submarines and the completion of the other surface vessels slowed down construction, but Raeder consented to the completion owing to the ship’s utility in commerce warfare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn153-0968344512455974">153</xref></sup> Only on 28 April 1940, after the completion of the first phase of the invasion of Norway, Operation Weserübung, did Raeder order a halt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn154-0968344512455974">154</xref></sup> The stated reason was a lack of gunnery equipment, which would have delayed the completion by a further 10 months after the vessel itself was finished. The carrier’s original fire-control equipment had been supplied to the Soviet Union as part of the material exchange agreed upon in 1939.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn155-0968344512455974">155</xref></sup> The 15 cm guns were needed for coastal defence in Norway and there was a considerable shortage of anti-aircraft armament, and the carrier lacked almost all its battery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn156-0968344512455974">156</xref></sup> More generally the repairs necessary to many warships involved in Weserübung, and the need that summer to provide flotilla craft and coastal defences for the vast newly occupied coastline, added a further drain on resources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn157-0968344512455974">157</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the problem was political rather than technical, and stemmed from the increasingly bitter feuding between the navy and Luftwaffe. After the war naval officers blamed Luftwaffe intransigence over the development and allocation of naval aircraft as a key factor in the navy’s decision not to prioritize the carrier’s completion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn158-0968344512455974">158</xref></sup> This issue cannot be fully explored here but should be alluded to, since one factor throughout the design process had been the lack of information regarding future carrier aircraft.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn159-0968344512455974">159</xref></sup> When the RLM took over the development and procurement of aircraft in 1933 it devoted little attention to naval aviation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn160-0968344512455974">160</xref></sup> This probably proved fortuitous as eventually navalized versions of Me 109 fighters and Ju 87 dive-bombers were adopted, both of which outclassed British equivalents. However, the development of the multi-purpose Fi 167 stalled.</p>
<p>Between 1934 and 1939 a debate developed between the navy and Luftwaffe over which service had jurisdiction over which aircraft and which missions. In February 1939 an agreement was reached whereby the Luftwaffe would equip and place under naval operational command 9 long-range, 18 general-purpose reconnaissance, and 12 carrier squadrons. However, cooperation throughout the first six months of the war was poor, with the Luftwaffe furnishing little useful support to the navy, the latter being wholly reliant on the small number of seaplanes it directly controlled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn161-0968344512455974">161</xref></sup> Finally, in April 1940, Göring, who had spoken at the launch of the <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic> and considered the carrier to be part of his domain, ordered that the Luftwaffe squadrons earmarked for naval use be reduced in size by up to a quarter. In its final form the air group was to consist of 10 Bf 109 T fighters, 13 Ju 87 T dive-bombers, and 20 Fi 167s. Much of the naval air wing was operational in 1940. The dive-bomber squadrons had been used over Poland, while the fighter squadrons were being formed and would be deployed in the air defence of Norway. The navy thought it unacceptable that naval aviation had been under-resourced and, faced with losing operational control of the aircraft, saw little point in prioritizing the carrier.</p>
<p>The value of British carriers off Norway and in the Mediterranean was shown throughout 1940 and 1941. They proved resilient against overwhelming Luftwaffe attacks, prompting Göring to offer bounties to pilots who inflicted damage on them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn162-0968344512455974">162</xref></sup> During Rheinübung British naval aviation functioned in the manner that both sides had envisaged before the war and, in its immediate aftermath, the Seekriegsleitung acknowledged the importance of a carrier to any Atlantic operations by the surface fleet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn163-0968344512455974">163</xref></sup> In fact discussions about completing the <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic> had already been held in the autumn of 1940, and the issue gained importance when Hitler increasingly became interested in carriers after Rheinübung.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn164-0968344512455974">164</xref></sup> In addition to the completion of one carrier, the conversion of cruisers and civilian vessels into light carriers was envisaged.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn165-0968344512455974">165</xref></sup> By 1942 the surface fleet was concentrated in Norway to undertake operations against Allied convoys to the Soviet Union. It was believed that carriers would greatly enhance the navy’s ability to interdict these supplies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn166-0968344512455974">166</xref></sup> Despite the increased interest it is unlikely any vessel could have been brought into service during the war. As long as the war in the east continued, the navy would not receive a greater share of the Reich’s resources. Resources made available for naval construction were concentrated on U-boat construction.</p>
<p>Drawing conclusions about whether a German carrier could have been commissioned is necessarily difficult, but, when the project is seen in the context of what the navy wanted to achieve and international carrier development, a more balanced picture emerges than hitherto portrayed. In principle it would have been possible. However, the time frame for a fully worked-up carrier and air group had been considerably underestimated. The theoretical aspects of the project were mastered remarkably well in a short time, and the design demonstrates a reasonably good degree of understanding of contemporary carrier development. While war games and plans alone are insufficient evidence, they too show a reasonably good understanding of the operational value of naval aviation. The practical side is more problematic. While the vessel might have been completed in a similar time frame to the <italic>Bismarck</italic> or <italic>Tirpitz</italic>, it would, like all the large combatants, have suffered propulsion problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn167-0968344512455974">167</xref></sup> The navy did well in developing carrier-specific equipment. For example, the arrester system functioned very well, with few accidents in the thousands of landings conducted at shore establishments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn168-0968344512455974">168</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet a carrier is more than the sum of its constituent components, and constructing a fleet carrier without an experimental vessel to test technologies and procedures was a mistake. The <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic> was conceived to conduct simultaneous launch and recovery operations and, while this was possible theoretically, as the Americans established, it was near impossible in reality. Practical experience with the whole system was imperative. Perhaps, though, it is just as important to recognize that the British believed the Germans were capable of bringing a carrier into service; in fact they felt that the Germans would be considerably more effective than the French had been.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn169-0968344512455974">169</xref></sup> Aviation could be hugely destructive in commerce warfare, and the British went to great lengths to ensure that a German carrier did not complicate the trade-protection issue. In April 1942 British intelligence expected that the <italic>Graf Zeppelin</italic> was six months away from operational deployment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn170-0968344512455974">170</xref></sup> On the night of 27/8 August 1942 a force of Lancaster bombers, armed with newly developed Capital Ship Bombs, was dispatched to Gdynia to sink the carrier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn171-0968344512455974">171</xref></sup> Small carriers would have been sufficient and could have been developed quicker, as the British themselves knew. The navy’s problem was that it had over-thought and over-engineered the issue by seeking, in its first attempt, to produce a perfect fleet carrier, rather than one suited to its operational requirements.</p>
