<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For at least a decade, a searching critique has developed in the English-speaking world of what might be called ‘modern management methods’ or ‘managerialism’. The pages of this journal have often published such critiques. One well known aspect of this criticism is found within the critical management studies (CMS) movement, and we tend to think of it as an Anglo-Saxon affair, even if there is acknowledgement that some early intellectual inspiration has come from outside an English-speaking circle, including the German Jürgen Habermas and the Frenchmen Henri Lefebve, Michel Foucault, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel De Certeau, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511431501">Hancock and Tyler, 2008</xref>). Yet, an almost totally unacknowledged contemporary and parallel movement has thrived among French intellectual and activist circles since at least the mid-1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920511431501">2</xref></sup> This movement encompasses a critical view of a range of modern management phenomena including the more specific and nefarious ways in which it affects the workplace as well as a broader examination of the insidious seepage of its ideology, culture, tools, practices, and dominance in almost every domain of everyday life. Given the depth and breadth of the recent writing in this area and our estimation that it is largely unknown to English-speaking, particularly American, criticism this review essay begins to fill a void by outlining the contributions of a selected number of French scholars and activists in the broad domain of critical thinking about modern management.</p>
<p>This work, based on multiple studies and observation, has been conducted in different domains: private enterprise, public service, health care, social work, and education. Not everyone has approached the subject in the same way; neither have authors sought to describe the managerialism phenomenon identically, nor have they found its sources in the same matrix of causes. And the critique has not relied on the same branch of the social sciences and humanities. Whether the entry point to these investigations has come from an a priori deductive theoretical framework or a grounded inductive approach, the notable question has been and continues to be the possible links between workplace dysfunctions and dis-eases (<italic>maladies</italic>) and the division of labor (increasingly subordinated labor versus the self-sustained entrepreneur), between this workplace malady and the ‘new’ management (the role of the managerial class in the development and control of procedures and injunctions of what to do and how to <italic>be</italic>), and between the malady and managerial culture.</p>
<p>As for theoretical frameworks, some authors have relied on the sociology of work, whereas others have been inspired by the sociology of action and of organizations. Some are anchored to the new critical sociology of economics. Most of these perspectives are grounded in ethnomethodology, psychosociology or a variation of ‘clinical situations’ (<italic>la clinique des situations</italic>), that is, the study of actual professional services rendered in socio-health settings. A majority takes an historical approach, inspired heavily by Michel Foucault, making its focus, for example, the decline of the welfare state and processes in play in the deployment and acceptance of neo-liberalism in the heart of society itself. Whatever the route taken and the theoretical position adopted, one fact has dominated all others during the last two decades: the appearance of a profound sociological critique of management (in the most generic sense of the term).</p>
<p>To retrace the major stages of this enterprise in France, we will examine several authors whose work has paved the way, often in a general fashion, toward what is now a wide-ranging and profound critique. Then we will present some of the work that has a more direct bearing on the field itself. Finally, we will present different analytical perspectives of a critique of management across different domains of action.</p>

<sec id="section2-0896920511431501">
<title>Precursors</title>
<p>Since the beginning of the 1990s, Jean-Pierre Le Goff (a philosopher by training; currently a sociologist in the Georges Friedmann Laboratory at the University of Paris I/CNRS) has written multiple works bearing on managerialism. Three of his works are especially relevant: <italic>Le mythe de l’entreprise. Critique de l’idéologie managériale; Les illusions du management. Pour un retour du bon sens;</italic> and <italic>La barbarie douce, la modernisation aveugle des entreprises et de l’école</italic>. For Le Goff the management illusion takes its concrete form via so-called ‘human resource’ approaches to employee relations: Le Goff documents how a disjunction has developed between the reality of the implementation of supposedly ‘modern’ approaches to employee relations and its rhetoric. The reality of this grab bag of managerial tools, which consists of highly developed reporting, evaluation, and control procedures, contrasts radically with the discourse surrounding the subject. Even worse, so-called modern management methods, characterized by formal methodologies, coded signals and language, and a gamut of techniques, have led to angst and anxiety within organizations. This is because of the disconnection between several things: first, the effort required to fulfill the reporting and evaluation systems managers increasingly require of employees, even highly skilled employees such as engineers, reduces the time that they have to perform their operational tasks, detracting bit by bit from the professional skills in which they have been trained, a process that Americans call ‘deskilling’ or ‘deprofessionalization’. Second, the incipient creep into the daily workspace of a managerial philosophy of ‘personal responsibility and accountability’ linked to a close adherence to organizational goals, which drives employees toward an ‘all or nothing’ loyalty to the organization at the expense of affective links to non-work relationships and actions. In fact, writes Le Goff, the ‘human resources’ efforts of managers to socialize employees completely into an organizational life space and culture end up producing just the opposite outcome: an increasing cleavage between the management class and the workers that it directs. There is an essential incompatibility between ‘personal accountability’ and its enforcement via the formalized systems of evaluation and control that managers increasingly rely upon as dictated by management specialists, university- and non-university-based consultants, and management educators.</p>
<p>Another precursor is Alain Ehrenberg (a researcher at the Edgar-Morin Center and Director of Psychotropic Research, Mental Health and Society Center for Medical Research [CESAMES], Sciences, Health, and Mental Health and Society [INSERM], CNRS) with his three successful works, <italic>Le culte de la performance; L’individu incertain</italic>; and <italic>The Weariness of the Self: Diagnosing the History of Depression in the Contemporary Age</italic>. In this series, Ehrenberg reports the findings from a vast anthropological study on contemporary individualism and changes in norms governing public and private life, in a context of a loss of bearings and supports provided by society, a classical Durkheimian approach.</p>
<p>His first book, <italic>Le culte de la performance</italic>, lays out the major lines of his argument: Since the beginning of the 1980s, contemporary life has been grounded in three new images: sports champions as symbols of social excellence; consumption, the vehicle of personal fulfillment; and executive heads, the preferred model of behavior. These new mythologies permit each person to adapt himself or herself to a decline in external discipline, traditionally transmitted via socialization, in favor of autonomy or internal discipline. Personal development and individual initiative are the two targets aimed at by the new rules of social interaction. The reference to oneself as a <italic>modus operandi</italic> applies to the workplace, family, school and elsewhere. This philosophy is less a question of egoistical withdrawal into a private sphere than a reliance on oneself in the name of democratic equality. Ehrenberg writes that because each person is supposedly an equal, each is therefore presumed to take responsibility for problems arising from communal sources. So, the mandate relies on an acute sort of individualism and self-monadic reliance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920511431501">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, here we have a trenchant irony. Although there is a privatization of the public sphere, there is also a publicization of private life. That is, for personal fulfillment, one seeks recourse to public consumption and public approbation. And these boundaries become blurred because across the two domains the individual becomes his or her own transcending force in a world carved up by uncertainty. Hence, his or her success requires more and more of the same tools: a knowhow to communicate, negotiate, motivate, and manage one’s time. But the conquering individual who submits to the injunction of autonomy is at the same time a burden on himself or herself, yielding new sufferings. Depression and addictions are thus the new pathologies of this conception of responsibility, the equivalent of the energy that each must mobilize to become himself or herself.</p>

<title>The Explorers</title>
<p>The precursors’ works have formed a rough template that the following authors have used to pinpoint and hone their respective critiques of modern managerialism. We begin with Vincent de Gaulejac (Professor of Sociology at the University of Paris IX, Dauphine), <italic>La société malade de la gestion. Idéologie gestionnaire, pouvoir managérial et harcèlement social</italic> and <italic>Travail, les raisons de la colère</italic>. His work is in line with the perspective of ‘clinical’ sociology that he has developed over a number of years. Its method is the study of individual life histories, leaning heavily on the singularity of each person’s life journey and experiences. In this way, De Gaulejac articulates the socio-psychological dimensions of what happens when management applies its tools conceived to control not only a person’s behavior but also a person’s mental and emotional state.</p>
<p>From the moment that markets and competition imposed themselves everywhere, each person finds himself or herself in the service of the economy, mobilized by the ongoing quest for short-term performance and quality. As a result, each person is caught in a struggle where the only alternative is to win or disappear. Under conditions like these, the fragile equilibrium between capital and labor held together since the end of the Second World War by the state’s social action is broken, and work with its socialized protections becomes a secondary consideration that is made flexible in order to be adapted better to the exigencies of the market. Practically speaking, new management has turned its back on hierarchical disciplinary systems. But management now validates the sentimental self-adherence by the worker to these new requirements, seeking to transform that person’s vital energy and ideals toward the firm that employs him or her. The individual’s mobility, availability, and adaptability are now the measures of employment potential.</p>
<p>So as to gain legitimacy, managerial power pretends to be neutral and impartial. It neutralizes the contradictions found in the workplace by positivism. It liquidates conflicts of interest by affirming universalistic values. The past is forgotten; the present is devalued. What counts is an exaltation of the future. Management also invents new instruments that pretend to bring transparence where arbitrariness reigns supreme, objectivity where contradictions dominate, and security where instability menaces. In reality, Vincent de Gaulejac reveals the syndrome of ‘quantophrenia’ or the illusion of believing that reality can be understood and mastered through its measurement.</p>
<p>In his more recent <italic>Travail, les raisons de la colère</italic>, De Gaulejac focuses particularly on the rash of self-destructive behavior that has plagued various French enterprises and public services over the last several years. Building on his previous work, he connects these dysfunctional personal manifestations to what he calls ‘psychic exploitation’, today’s modern version of the ‘physical exploitation’ typical of 19th- and 20th-century industrial capitalism. Employees, faced with constant corporate restructuring, invasive evaluation and accountability systems, and permanent precariousness of employment, dive into a kind of ‘<italic>violences innocentes</italic>’ (‘innocent violence’), taking out on one’s self the personal blame for failures that are actually organizationally – or managerially – derived. It is almost a transliteration of C. Wright Mills’s dictum on the relationship between ‘personal problems’ and ‘public issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511431501">Mills, 1959</xref>): how individuals tend to blame themselves for problems that they experience but that are socially or economically derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511431501">Mick, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>How to act in the future? A person must henceforth be considered a subject and not a resource. Vincent de Gaulejac invites us therefore to go back to the heart of politics, to use politics as leverage to promote ‘being together’, to celebrate a society in which individuals are considered citizens, acting together, and whose major preoccupation is to construct a shared world, which beyond ‘being together’, also has a vocation of ‘acting together’. Men and women cannot work and live without having meaning to their acts.</p>
<p>The next ‘explorer’ is Michel Chauvière (Director of Research at the CNRS, CERSA, University of Paris II), and his book <italic>Trop de gestion tue le social. Essai sur une discrète chalandisation.</italic> Chauvière, a well known French author on the subject of social services and social work in France, has elaborated on themes discussed earlier in this review, but in a highly original way, even fashioning his own term – ‘<italic>chalandisation</italic>’ – to underscore the importance of managerial ‘creep’ or the insidious and almost invisible seepage of modern managerial logics into the world of social services, education, health care, and the like.</p>
<p>The invented term cannot easily be translated; the root term, ‘<italic>chaland</italic>’, literally means a ‘shopper’ in old French, and Chauvière’s extension of it suggests a double-edged process of providing merchandise <italic>and</italic> of inciting people to come and shop. In other words, the heart of the matter is preparing, training, and leading people to be like shoppers in realms of non-commercial human activity not heretofore subject to such behavior. What Chauvière describes is an effort inspired by modern managerialism to convert people who are served by public or ‘social’ entities, e.g. schools, social services, hospitals, clinics, to become shoppers as if they were seeking to purchase a washing machine. Because there is no single-word English translation of this word, we shall maintain the original term in French.</p>
<p>So what the author is expressing is actually two interrelated phenomena: first, <italic>chalandisation</italic> is a process that converts people in need of social, educational, and health care services into shoppers. This is done via the almost stealth-like insertion of a seemingly banal set of management techniques, teachings, and tools into the human and health services realm and beyond. These components of managerialism have been well described: a-cultural, a-historical, and generic ideologies, evaluation tools and processes, cadres of appropriately trained ‘professionals’, and the like. The spread of managerialism creates targets for its ‘expertise’, which segue into social arenas heretofore spared its searching look. So, as managerialism becomes more hegemonic, it follows that what takes place is a sort of commercialization of all that is social or traditionally non-commercial. Hence, people in need of social or health services or people needing education, or people seeking the arts all become ‘shoppers’, searching for and employing those organizations that are presumed high performers, efficient and effective, as defined by formal evaluative criteria.</p>
<p>This process leads to two broad types of privatization: first, the rise of for-profit organizations within the most lucrative segments of whichever previously unaffected area is under discussion, studiously avoiding activities that are not profitable. The second type encompasses all these remaining relatively unlucrative parts of the social realm, but still under the pressure of <italic>chalandisation</italic>. These twin phenomena are probably more striking in France than in the USA because, in the former nation, the government has traditionally had a much broader and deeper role in the social, educational, artistic, and similar communities than anything experienced in the latter. But clearly <italic>chalandisation</italic> is increasing in the USA, particularly in educational and health care areas. Another key facet of <italic>chalandisation</italic> is the reduction of the stature of workers in these fields from a professional mentality under professional norms to an emphasis on individual competence, disconnected from professional control, and increasingly under surveillance of managerial logics.</p>
<p>The next ‘explorer’ is Roland Gori (a psychoanalyst and professor of clinical psychopathology at the University of Aix-Marseille 1). His writings are numerous and engaged in the public debate about the ideology of rational-economic man, against the wanderings of scientism in psychiatry and, in a general fashion, against the instrumentalization of all that is human.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920511431501">4</xref></sup> In work done with Marie-José del Volgo (a hospital physician and Director of Research in Psychopathology, University of Aix-Marseille 1), Gori and Del Volgo describe the new social order, the new model of society that they describe as being installed secretly before our eyes (<italic>Exilés de l’intime: la medicine et la psychiatrie au service du nouvel ordre économique</italic>). Mental health is a good entry point for this argument since one sees henceforth how one strives not only to reduce behavioral ‘anomalies’ starting at the earliest age but also to gather all sorts of neuro-biological, economic, and genetic data on populations, in disregard of public liberty. Often Hannah Arendt’s idea of ‘humanity in man’ disappears from public policy processes.</p>
<p>Noting that the medicalization of existence has increased without stop since the 18th century, the authors propose that we have been passing from a society founded on sovereign law to one founded on norms. Like Michel Foucault, to whom they often refer, these authors see an unbridled medicalization of social and psychological problems, adding that this anthropological revolution has in reality installed itself at the heart of economic capitalism, placing itself at its service.<sup>5</sup> However, the individual ‘entrepreneur of himself or herself’ is not as free as is pretended, especially when it comes to one’s own body. Social existence is perpetuated not only under the form of a market, but also by norms and devices of constraint that interiorize notions of performance, optimization, and putative well-being. For these two authors, this reification of the subject and this traceability of behavior constitute a major ontological and anthropological danger, amplified even more by self-reifing practices through free access to the net.</p>

<title>The Institutional Builders</title>
<p>Within the French Association of Sociology (<italic>l’Association Française de Sociologie</italic>) and through a specialized collection of work published by L’Harmattan, Marie Benedetto-Meyer (a sociologist, researcher at SENSE d’Orange Labs), Salvatore Maugeri (a sociologist, <italic>maître de conférences</italic> at the University of Orléans) and Jean-Luc Metzger (a sociologist, researcher at the Pierre Naville Center and an associate at CNAM-LISE) lead a publication and research effort in the sociology of management. They consider that a critical sociology of management must distinguish itself from a technical sociology of management, in order to constitute an ‘emancipating’ understanding. By management, they mean techniques of organization as simultaneously techniques of power; more importantly, these techniques, tied together, are more and more codified. They note also that far from being internally negotiated inside of a collectivity, these techniques are more often imposed from the outside.</p>
<p>They argue that a sociology critical of management must position itself among the mainline disciplines, all the while being wary that the sociology of management will become an auxiliary that continues to deepen management practices. So, in order to tie into the sociology of work, while being cautious of the risk of instrumentalization, they insist on a dynamic definition of management study. Stated differently, the authors see a tension between a minimal level of training of managerial professionals, in the perspective of work well done, and the seizing of power by the group of management experts in the name of collective efficiency by favoring the development of new technologies, the idea of permanent change as a capital resource, and the belief that to manage is to produce social existence. These considerations of what the study of management is must insofar as possible not neglect the importance of macro-social context and the turn toward neo-liberal thought, key to the deployment of the mechanisms of management. Finally, they are sensitive to anything that might have the effect of decoupling technical managerial artifacts from management goals, and they integrate all of this into their sociological critique of management. Their approach is therefore both a collection of analytical approaches and an invitation to bring together analyses of this inflection in the actual life of organizations and their work communities, and necessarily so at an international scale, given the origins of the process. The latest achievement from this project is Benedetto-Meyer, Maugeri and Metzger’s <italic>L’emprise de la gestion. La société au risque des violences gestionnaires</italic>. This collective work explores the articulation between violence, actors, practices, and management resources, relying on examples from France, Egypt, and Brazil, in both commercial and associative spheres.</p>
<p>An important work on the subject is that of Valérie Boussard (a maître de conférences in sociology and researcher in the Laboratoire Printemps at the University of Versailles-SQY): <italic>Sociologie de la gestion. Les faiseurs de performance</italic>. Noting the contemporary omnipresence, hegemony, and ‘naturalization’ of management, the author poses three questions and seeks to respond to each: ‘what is management,’ ‘what does management do,’ and ‘who does management?’ To the first question, her response is that actual management represents an historic rupture in the conduct of organizations, and that it has become a <italic>social form</italic> combining ‘modalities of organization and the division of work, of obedience and conformity, of oversight and sanction’, all completely new. Management practices now postulate that all organizations must be mastered such that all their components, human as well as non-human, can be calculated, predicted, and adjusted. It is a question of optimizing everything: thus is derived the managerial ‘word’ of supreme rationality: conquest, performance, and rationality.</p>
<p>The second question concerns itself more with management tools and practices and places them in relationship with the management imperative. The gap is manifested between ‘the <italic>prescribed</italic> conduct and the <italic>real</italic> conduct of organizations’, which makes the effectiveness of management imperatives a relative thing, showing its limited rationality, which obliges one to consider other variables like ‘punctual strategies and opportunities for actors’. In other words, what organizational actors actually do to adapt and to survive. Real management does not do that which an ideal management enunciates. And yet the idea is diffused very widely, invading everything. How does one explain this? Valérie Boussard replies that the tools of management are also tools of work discipline, masked by the management ‘word’, but it can be questioned as to whether these devices are effective and limitless reinforcements of domination.</p>
<p>The third question bears on management professionals (managers, university professors, consultants etc. in a middle position between capital and labor) and their discursive strategies. Specifically, the focus is on their methods of producing and universalizing management rhetoric, and in presenting them as just, neutral, and virtuous. Management is also a broad professional space inhabited by competing groups and segments. Managers, university professors, and consultants seek to consolidate their own positions and interests in the new organizational space.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Readers will recognize some of the above ideas in work written in English apparently developed in relative isolation from the French critique. For example, Martin Parker’s chapter ‘For Organization’, in his <italic>Against Management</italic>, develops themes of the celebration of the managerial class, the insertion of managerial language and logics into ever increasing venues of human activity, and the role of the professorial class in fostering the hegemonic presence of ‘management’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511431501">Parker, 2002</xref>). Other examples exist as well.</p>
<p>Much of the French critique of the ‘new’ managerialism revolves around the spread of ‘evaluation’ logics, tools, and a supporting ideology, not just to influence organizational performance, but also, and perhaps most importantly, to exert control over organizational actors. In the USA, the notion of control is embedded in management studies often without being labeled as such. Linking evaluation and control seems oddly absent despite clear presentations that do just that. For example, Sanford M. Dornbusch and W. Richard Scott’s <italic>Evaluation and the Exercise of Authority</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511431501">1975</xref>) gave us one of the clearest and least obfuscating presentations on the subject. They write,<disp-quote><p>In a rational system, evaluation is an indispensable process for controlling task performance. If evaluations were absent, rewards and penalties would be distributed in a random and capricious manner. Therefore, it is fundamental to the control of performances that organizational superiors evaluate subordinates’ performances, and that these evaluations help to influence the distribution of organizational sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511431501">1975</xref>: viii).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Text like this is the underpinning of much of the mantra of modern managerialism, reflected in the more common term of ‘accountability’. Instead of describing a straightforward process that is easily understandable to most organizational players, i.e. that their work will be scrutinized, their performance assessed, and their compensation adjusted accordingly, ‘accountability’ today may be viewed as a code word for something more profound: the new requirement that the employee or organization professional accept a personal and emotional stake in his or her work, becoming ‘autonomous’, bearing full personal responsibility for his or her actions, and fully judging his or her worth through these processes. All the while, this reduces the social and economic context to a mere residual detritus in which action occurs. The French critique has sharpened this perspective in a dramatic and convincing fashion through its relentless review of almost every conceivable facet of the managerial imperative, so clearly demonstrated throughout these works.</p>

<p>It is sheer speculation why this unfortunate isolation of the ‘French critique’ exists, and there seem to be two possible reasons: first, the relatively smaller place that schools of business have in the French educational system as compared to the American, British, and Australian systems, where much of this criticism has arisen; second, the lack of widespread and rapid translation of the French literature into English. As for the first reason, whereas Anglo-Saxon CMS is often housed in schools of business, most French critical thinkers are located outside these entities and within traditional university and research settings, and there has been nothing quite like the business school-based rise of CMS as a result. The second barrier, the lack of translation of intellectual work from French to English, is an unfortunate one that is not confined simply to CMS.</p></fn>

<p>It is noteworthy that Gori was one of several initiators who in 2008 organized the movement ‘L’Appel des Appels’ (Call of Calls), an internet organization and petition to oppose ‘…the willful and systematic destruction [by the State] of all that ties together social bonds’. The movement quickly collected 76,000 signatures.
