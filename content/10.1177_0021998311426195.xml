<abstract>
<p>High-temperature stable aromatic thermosetting copolyesters (ATSP) show great promise for use as a matrix in high-strength carbon fiber (C) composites. In this article, we characterize the ablation characteristics of ATSP/C composites using a high-power laser. ATSP/C shows very low recession rates of less than 0.14 mm/s at heat fluxes of approximately 4000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. The backface temperatures for both 1 and 4 g/cm<sup>2</sup> areal densities are well below 250°C. Scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses suggest formation of a stable char that holds the reinforcing carbon fibers. Density of the charred composite is the same along the thickness suggesting uniform charring. Thermogravimetric analysis measurements show that the char yield is around 40–43%.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311426195"><title>Background</title>
<p>A spacecraft reentering the atmosphere is subjected to extreme thermal conditions. As the vehicle contacts the atmosphere at very high speeds, hypersonic shockwaves release high levels of thermal energy that can cause heating and possible destruction of the outer shell. To protect the vehicle from these high temperatures and wind shear, the vehicle's outer shell is typically covered with suitable thermal protective systems (TPS). TPS can be broadly classified into two categories: reusable TPS and ablative TPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311426195">1</xref></sup> Reusable TPS protect the surface by reradiating the heat while insulating the interface. Reusable carbon/carbon composites and foamed silica tiles have been used for relatively mild reentry conditions (&lt;200 W/cm<sup>2</sup>), for instance, those encountered by the Space Shuttle. On the other hand, ablative TPS are designed to act as a sacrificial layer that retains some mechanical integrity and erodes when entering the atmosphere. Ablative TPS work at much higher heat flux values (∼2000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) compared to reusable TPS. Organic polymers that form a stable char and break down into low-molecular weight species, thus providing a cooling effect, have been found to be ideal ablatives. Reinforcing agents are used to hold together the char formed. Phenolic/carbon fiber composites have been used in the earlier Galileo probe. Phenolic resins have high char yields (∼55%). The carbon fiber reinforcement holds the char intact and prevents its dispersion into the atmosphere, thus maintaining integrity of the surface. TPS materials used during the past missions of National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA have been summarized in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311426195">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311426195">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>There has been little work on new ablative materials over the last 30 years. As future space missions get more ambitious with longer reentry times and higher velocities, there will be a need for materials with lower recession rates while minimizing mass. Carbonaceous composites show much lower recession rates, but do not provide the desired cooling effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311426195">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311426195">6</xref></sup> Better performing ablative TPS than those currently available are needed to satisfy the requirements of the most severe crew exploration vehicle missions. A recent NASA research solicitation related to Mars aerocapture and entry suggests a need for two classes of materials – Mars landing with 8 km/s Mars entry and Mars sample return with 12–15 km/s Earth reentry. The first class needs to survive heat fluxes of 200–400 W/cm<sup>2</sup> (primarily convective), and must improve on the current state-of-the-art recession rates of 0.25 mm/s at heating rates of 200 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, while maintaining areal mass below 1.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup> and the bondline temperature below 250°C. The second class of materials, for Mars return, will need to survive heat fluxes of 1500–2500 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and improve on the current state-of-the-art recession rates of 1.0 mm/s at heating rates of 2000 W/cm<sup>2</sup> using areal mass of 4.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup> or less and maintain a bondline temperature below 250°C. In this article, we describe a novel copolyester system that was successfully evaluated against the above parameters using laser ablation.</p>
<p>Aromatic thermosetting copolyesters (ATSP) are a new class of high temperature stable thermosets developed by Economy and co-workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311426195">7</xref>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311426195">8</xref></sup> ATSP is stable up to 350°C in air with a glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) ranging from 240°C to 285°C. The unique feature of this system is its ability to undergo interchain transesterification reactions (ITR) even after curing. ITR are unique reactions that help in interchanging of ester linkages between molecular chains. These surface reactions can occur at high temperatures to form strong chemical bonds. This permits adhesive bonding to itself or any other compound with ester linkages along with recyclability of oligomers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311426195">9</xref>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311426195">10</xref></sup> A schematic of ITR bonding of ATSP composite plies is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311426195">Figure 1</xref>. Because of the high oxidative stability, high char yield (40–45%), and the ability to strongly bond to the reinforcing carbon fibers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311426195">11</xref></sup> ATSP show an unparalleled potential to be used as a next-generation ablative material.

<p>Hydroquinone (HQ), acetic anhydride, trimesic acid (TMA), isophthalic acid (IPA), p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used without modification. Unidirectional carbon fabric of intermediate modulus (0.147 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (4.3 oz/sq yd)) was obtained from Fiberglast. Kapton film-and Teflon-coated fiber glass fabric were acquired from McMaster Carr.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021998311426195"><title>Oligomer synthesis</title>
<p>The synthesis of the two part oligomeric system (one consisting of carboxylic end groups (C1) and the other consisting of acetoxy end groups (A1) closely followed the synthesis from Frich et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311426195">7</xref></sup> Acetoxybenzoic acid (ABA) and hydroquinone diacetate (HQDA) were prepared by acetylation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroquinone, respectively. C1 oligomers were synthesized by melt-condensation of TMA, ABA, IPA, and HQDA (molar ratio 2:6:3:4, respectively) at 260°C. This molar ratio gives oligomers with a wide molecular weight distribution and an average molecular weight of about 1900 g/mol. A1 oligomers were synthesized similarly with TMA, ABA, IPA, and HQDA taken in the molar ratio 2:2:2:7. The average molecular weight of these oligomers is estimated to be around 1750 g/mol. In both the cases, the molecular weight of the oligomers was controlled by the ratio of the reactants. The structures of the monomers and the general structures of C1 and A1 oligomer are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311426195">Figure 2</xref>. On curing, the end groups of the oligomers react to form crosslinked ATSP.

</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311426195"><title>Composite fabrication</title>
<p>A1 and C1 oligomers were dissolved at a ratio of 1:1.1 in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to make a <italic>ca</italic>. 50 wt.% solution using a water bath near boiling. Sufficient oligomers were dissolved to obtain a 55-vol.% carbon fiber composite. The fabric was cut into 21.6 cm squares and then coated with the ATSP solution. To process the composites and remove the volatiles, a custom enclosed Carver hot press was used. Two 0.5-in. thick steel plates were used in order to protect the platens in the hot press. A Kapton film and fiberglass reinforced Teflon peel-ply were placed on either side of the composites to isolate it from the steel plates. The carbon fibers, saturated with ATSP solution, were heated according to the cure cycle shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311426195">Figure 3</xref>.
<fig id="fig3-0021998311426195" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Cure cycle of ATSP.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311426195-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>At 205°C, the vacuum pump was engaged to remove excess NMP. A pressure of 0.7 MPa (100 psi) was applied at the start of soaking the sample at 330°C. After the cycle was complete, the sample was allowed to cool in the hot press to room temperature. The average thickness of the cured composite laminate was around 0.4 mm, and the volume fraction of carbon fibers was <italic>ca.</italic> 50–55%.</p>
<p>The 21.6 cm square laminate was then cut into 5.1 cm (2-in.) square pieces for further consolidation into thicker samples with the required areal densities. To obtain composites of areal mass 1 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (thickness of ∼6.5 mm), 16 single plies with dimension of 5.1 × 5.1 cm<sup>2</sup> were stacked together in a mold [0/90]<sub>4<italic>s</italic></sub> and held at 340°C for 4 h under 2.7 MPa (400 psi) pressure to consolidate them using ITR. To obtain samples with areal mass of 4 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (thickness of ∼25.5 mm), 72 such single plies [0/90]<sub>18<italic>s</italic></sub> were stacked together.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0021998311426195"><title>Laser ablation</title>
<p>The VertiCOIL laser system, a kW-class chemical oxygen–iodine laser, was used to generate the required heat fluxes. This device is capable of continuous-wave powers of approximately 1500 W for a period of 10 min of test time, or 500 W for approximately 45 min of test time. To obtain higher energy fluxes of ∼4000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, the laser beam was focused using AR-and IR-coated stock plano-convex lenses from Thorlabs, Inc. The beam shape was recorded <italic>via</italic> both an IR-sensitive remote camera (viewing the water-cooled 5 kW power meter) and plastic ‘burn blocks’. Exact power flux numbers suffer the uncertainty of no direct power measurement. Data were collected, though, to establish a calibration curve for outcoupled power vs. chlorine flow rate. To estimate the laser power for each shot, the predicted power was averaged over the entire time of each shot. The ‘burn blocks’ also help in estimating the uniformity of the beams. As may be seen in the burn block images after exposing it to the low-intensity laser beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311426195">Figure 4</xref>), spot uniformity was excellent. Some ‘sugar scooping’ was observed, leading the edge intensity to slightly out-weigh the center intensity.
<fig id="fig4-0021998311426195" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Burn block (black acrylic sheet) obtained after exposure to a laser beam at energy flux of 77.7 W/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311426195-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The composite was mounted in front of the laser source, making sure that the beam strikes at the center of the sample. A thermocouple was utilized to monitor the cool side of the ATSP composite. Care was taken during experimentation to place the thermocouple directly behind the point of laser exposure. A tangential cross-flow was provided using an exhaust fan with an air exchange rate of 0.187 s, across the irradiated surface to sweep ablation products out of the beam path. This was intended to minimize the interaction of the ablation products with the beam, so as not to reduce the amount of beam energy actually reaching the surface. The laser ablation testing setup for the composites is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311426195">Figure 5</xref>.
<fig id="fig5-0021998311426195" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Setup used for laser ablation testing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311426195-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The recession rates of the composite were tested at power intensities ranging from 77.7 to 9375 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. The samples were sectioned, and the advancement of the char front was measured using vernier calipers. Recession rate is the depth of ablation divided by the shot time. For samples subjected to high-energy fluxes, where the laser drills a hole in the specimen in addition to charring of the specimen, both the hole and the char recession rates were reported. For samples with ply lifting, the hole and char recession rates were measured from the center of the laser shot on the outermost lifted ply. For several composites fabricated with specific areal mass of either 1.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (designated as samples I and II, 6.5 mm thick) or 4.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (designated as samples III and IV, 25.5 mm thick), extensive characterization was carried out to determine the mechanism of ablation. Backface temperatures of the samples were monitored using a Omega SA1-K thermocouple. The thermocouple was pressed against the back of the test surface <italic>via</italic> a thin steel spring. This measurement is important for ablatives as the temperature has to be maintained below the degradation temperature of the silicone adhesive used to bond them to the spacecraft.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0021998311426195"><title>Characterization</title>
<p>A Hitachi S4700 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to characterize the charred ATSP after ablation. The charred composite was sliced using a diamond saw. The samples were mounted using conducting carbon tape. An accelerating voltage of 15 kV and spot size of 40 were used to obtain pictures. Char profile of the composite was measured according to ASTM E471. The charred composite was cut into a rectangular block (19 × 10 × 10 mm<sup>3</sup>). Subsequent charred layers (∼1 mm each) were ground off, and the weight loss was noted to give an indication of the density. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the charred as well as the virgin composite were conducted using an imaging x-photoelectron spectrometer (Axis ULTRA, Kratos, Chestnut Ridge, NY), equipped with a charge neutralization system. Data were collected using a monochromatized Al-Kα source (15 kV, 300 W) at a take-off angle of 60° with respect to the surface. High-resolution spectra were acquired using a pass energy of 40 eV, producing an energy resolution of 0.2 eV. For charge neutralization, the low-hybrid mode was used with a 200-µm aperture size and 150 W x-ray power. The operating pressure was approximately 1.33 × 10<sup>−7</sup> Pa. XPS survey and high-resolution spectra were collected on the composite surfaces before and after laser ablation. CasaXPS was used to analyze the data. Thermogravimetic analyzer (TGA 2950-TA) was used to study the charring behavior of the ATSP composites. Composites with 50% volume fraction of fibers (56% of fibers by wt) were cut and tested in the Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen at different heating rates of 10, 5, 2, and 1°C/min.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311426195">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311426195">Figure 6</xref> shows the recession rates of ATSP/C at different energy fluxes. Of all the samples, two samples each with areal densities of 1 and 4 g/cm<sup>2</sup> were characterized to obtain the backface temperature. The spot sizes varied for different heat fluxes as the beam was focussed to achieve higher energies. The spot area was calculated by measuring the dimensions of the spot on the sample after ablation. The values are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311426195">Table 2</xref>. Each sample showed some signs of bulging post-laser exposure. For the low-energy fluxes (&lt;200 W/cm<sup>2</sup>), the samples show very little or no surface charring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311426195">Figure 7</xref>). On the other hand, samples exposed to high-energy fluxes show that a small hole is drilled in the center of the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311426195">Figure 8</xref>). The region with the maximum intensity drills a hole in the sample removing all the carbon fibers and the ATSP matrices. This can be attributed to the very aggressive conditions of laser testing (presence of oxygen compared to vacuum, much higher power intensities), which led to the sublimation and possibly, oxidation, of not only the charred polymer matrix, but also charred reinforcing carbon fibers. Charring was also observed in the region surrounding the hole, and this is denoted by the char recession rate. Hole recession gives an idea of the stability of the composite at the particular heat flux, whereas the char recession gives an idea of the lateral conduction of this heat flux away from the point of maximum intensity. The disparity in the ablation behavior for samples subject to high-and low-energy fluxes can also be explained by the varied mechanism of recession of a carbon ablator at different temperature ranges. Two major mechanisms are responsible for surface recession in a carbon ablator – oxidation of carbon and sublimation, which are dictated by the surface temperature. It is well known that the diffusion controlled oxidation mechanism is dominant above 1000°C, whereas the sublimation occurs above about 3000°C. Radiation equilibrium temperature when calculated from Stefen Boltzmann's law is 1658°C for 77.7 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 2746°C for 471 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 4890°C for 4028 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and 4973°C for 4294W/cm<sup>2</sup>. Although the ATSP/C does not absorb all the energy it was exposed to, this gives us a good idea about the regime we are in. The sublimation temperature for carbon is around 3642°C. This suggests that diffusion controlled oxidation is dominant for the conditions I and II, and sublimation is dominant for the conditions III and IV. This explains that for samples I and II, the carbon fiber remained intact and the ATSP resin around it charred. In case of higher energy fluxes (samples III and IV), the laser beam drills a hole due to the sublimation of the carbon fiber. The range of recession rates obtained by ATSP/C samples at different heat fluxes are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311426195">Table 1</xref>. Samples were exposed to a range of heat fluxes to gauge the performance. Required laser power intensities of 200 and 2000 W/cm<sup>2</sup> were exceeded, and the composite specimens instead received <italic>ca.</italic> 400 or 4000 W/cm<sup>2</sup> resulting in maximum recession rates of 0.008 and 0.13 mm/s, respectively. Thus, the ATSP composites outperformed the desired goals for recession rates of less than 0.25 mm/s at low power and 1 mm/s at high power, even though the measured power intensities were over twice what was expected. The recession rates did not exceed 0.14 mm/s even at very high-energy fluxes of &gt;4000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, whereas the char recession rates were below 0.2 mm/s. The maximum recession rate of 0.42 mm/s was observed at energy flux of 9375 W/cm<sup>2</sup>.

<p>In addition to the recession rate, the important parameter to quantify is the backface temperature. Backface temperature measurements help in determination of the optimum areal density to maintain temperatures below degradation of silicone adhesives (&lt; 250°C). The temperature of several ATSP composites on the side opposite to the laser beam was recorded with a mini surface-mount thermocouple (<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311426195">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311426195">10</xref> show a representative curve showing the temperature measurement when the laser is in operation (i.e. when Cl<sub>2</sub> gas is flowing) and afterwards for both the thin ATSP sample (I) and thick ATSP sample (III).

<p>With minute-long exposures, the cool side of both 25 mm thick samples maintained temperatures below 54°C. The 6 mm samples, going by readings from the surface thermocouple, maintained a cool side temperature below 200°C. The maximum temperatures from the thermocouple are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311426195">Table 2</xref>. These data are encouraging that even if the areal mass is reduced (a desirable improvement over current state-of-the-art), the bondline temperature remains well below decomposition temperatures of high-temperature silicone adhesives. Samples exposed to higher energy levels (&gt;1000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) resulting in smaller spot size suffer from the uncertainity in the backface temperature measurements due to the loss through lateral conduction and radiation cooling. Also, the reduction in thermal conductivity due to formation of low-density char causing ply lifts leads to lower backface temperatures in high-energy flux samples. But for the lower energy fluxes (&lt;1000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>), the spot size were larger, thus reducing any lateral heat conduction losses. Moreover, the heat loads are lower, leading to lower radiation losses.</p>

<p>Samples after laser ablation were observed under an SEM to determine the nature of char formed. Closer inspection with SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311426195">Figure 11</xref>) of the ATSP composites after laser ablation testing at 4028 W/cm<sup>2</sup> illustrates that there is significant char formation that continues to hold together the carbon fiber tows in the laminates. This confirms that ATSP on burning forms a stable char that will help in keeping the structure intact.

<p>The composite char density profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311426195">Figure 12</xref>) suggests that the char density is constant throughout the thickness of the sample indicating uniform ablation. The density consistently remains around 0.8–0.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup> compared to 1.53 g/cm<sup>3</sup> for the virgin composite.

<p>ATSP/C composite was analyzed with XPS before and after testing to better understand the mechanism of ablation. Survey spectra of the composite before and after laser ablation showed only oxygen and carbon as expected. A representative repeat unit of ATSP is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311426195">Figure 13</xref>. The different states of C and O are labeled with numbers. High-resolution spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311426195">Figure 14</xref> shows the individually fitted XPS curves for various states of carbon C(1s) in ATSP. The C(1s) states in the XPS spectra confirms a typical spectra of polyesters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311426195">12</xref></sup> and carbon fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311426195">13</xref></sup> The probable states of ATSP are assigned based on earlier literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311426195">13</xref></sup> The composition of individual states are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311426195">Table 3</xref>. As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311426195">Figure 14</xref>, there is substantial decrease in the percentage of carboxyl carbon indicating loss of C–O bonds. This can be attributed to the decomposition of ester linkages into smaller molecules like CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and O<sub>2</sub>. The percentage of benzylic carbon in the charred composite doubled indicating formation of carbonaceous char.

<p>The O (1s) spectra of ATSP is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311426195">Figure 15</xref>. The overall percentage of O atoms goes down after laser ablation. Oxygen loss in the form of CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and CO, acetaldehyde led to reduction of O(1s) peak. The charred composite has a much higher C/O ratio of 95.43:4.57 (20.9) than that of the virgin composite 82.7:16 (5.2).

<p>TGA of the composites was carried out at different heating rates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311426195">Figure 16</xref> shows the weight loss profiles of these composites. The composites are stable even over 400°C which reiterates the high-temperature stability of this resin system. The weight loss ranges 25–27% depending on the heating rate. In the temperature range of testing, carbon fiber is stable and should not contribute to the weight loss. As the composite consists of 49% of carbon fibers by weight, the total weight loss translates to a char yield for the ATSP of 40–43%. This is lower than the char yield of phenolic resins (50–55%). Even though the char yield is lower, the crosslinked ATSP char is able to hold together the reinforcing fibers. Also, higher weight loss associated with ATSP (∼57–60%) compared to phenolics (∼45–50%) translates into higher amount of low-molecular gases evolved. Higher proportion of these gases can potentially help in providing a better cooling effect during aerodynamic heating thus reducing the recession rate.

<sec id="sec11-0021998311426195" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>ATSP/C composites show excellent ablative properties when tested using laser ablation. The recession rates were less than 0.14 mm/s at heat fluxes greater than 4000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. The bondline/backface temperatures remained well below 250°C. XPS analysis confirmed the loss of ester linkages on laser ablation leading to high proportion of benzylic carbons. The char density remains almost constant along the thickness indicating uniform extent of charring. SEM confirms that the char holds the structure together and does not let it disintegrate. Although the char yield is lower than the phenolic resins, the char is able to hold the fibers together. The slightly higher weight loss of ATSP vs. phenolic resin probably leads to a better cooling effect that can help reducing the recession rates.</p>
<p>Due to the low recession rates coupled with stable char formation over a range of heat fluxes, ATSP show potential to be used as a next-generation ablative for future space exploration missions.</p>
