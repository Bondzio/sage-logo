<body>
<p>Michael Halliday’s contribution to the field of linguistics is vast. His work, in particular his theory of grammar as a functional meaning-making resource, has been of use to researchers in areas such as child language development, language education, discourse analysis, sociolinguistics and computational linguistics. All of Halliday’s theories and descriptions of language have been published in a 10-volume edition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612467254">Halliday, 2007</xref>). For those not yet ready to delve into that extensive 4000-page collection of Halliday’s work, <italic>The Essential Halliday</italic> is a more accessible place to start.</p>
<p><italic>The Essential Halliday</italic> contains 20 chapters, each foregrounding a key concept of Halliday’s theory of language. This differs from the organization of the 10-volume <italic>Collected Works</italic>, which is organized by specific topical domains such as the language of science and linguistic studies in English. <italic>The Essential Halliday</italic> includes chapters on the context of culture and of situation, acts of meaning, function in language (including a separate chapter exploring Halliday’s metafunctions), grammatical metaphor, markedness and the trinocular vision of language. These chapters draw on examples from both child and adult language use contexts and outline some of the key uses, levels and contextual influences on language from a Hallidayan perspective. Important concepts highlighting the natural messiness of language, including indeterminacy and complementarity and complexity of language use, which are less explored in the available introductory books on Hallidayan theory, are also afforded chapters here.</p>
<p>The different levels of language relevant to Halliday’s theory are explored in detail for their systemic properties as meaning-making resources with individual chapters on intonation, the semantic system and semiotics, as well as a chapter exploring text and the level of discourse. There is also a chapter outlining variety and variation in language use at the levels of dialect, register and code.</p>
<p>Finally, there are chapters which provide discussions on the applicability of Halliday’s theories to specific topical domains. For example, there is a chapter on linguistic computing and one on language teaching, learning and development, which also includes extracts outlining Halliday’s thoughts on other theories of language learning such as nativist and environmentalist approaches.</p>
<p>The chapters are organized alphabetically by the concepts they cover. Some of the concepts are afforded more attention and detail than others, perhaps because of their more extensive treatment in the <italic>Collected Works</italic>. Each chapter begins with a short editor’s summary introducing the key concept, followed by a number of selected extracts from the <italic>Collected Works</italic>. A benefit of the chapters being organized in this way is that it provides readers with a chance to identify a specific area of the theory they wish to explore and see it discussed and illustrated several times in different contexts, using different examples from Halliday’s work. This repeated exposure throughout a single chapter allows for a gradual building of knowledge on a particular concept and may assist those readers having trouble with grasping the complexities of this theory of language. A potential negative, especially for readers wishing to use the complete book to gain an overall understanding of the theory – as was my intention in reviewing this book – is that the alphabetical organization, set up for ease of access to the theory, can sometimes be detrimental for the coherent development of knowledge and connections of the theory as the reader moves through the chapters of the book. For example, particularly prominent concepts in Halliday’s theory, such as the metafunctions, do not appear until midway through the book because of the alphabetical organization of concepts. There is also no suggested guide for readers should they wish to read all the chapters of the book in order to get a complete picture of the theory. However, fortunately, the concepts and their encompassing terminology are constantly introduced and revisited across the individual chapters of the book, helping to both reinforce the key concepts of Halliday’s theory and create an understanding of the interrelatedness of these different concepts. Additionally, Chapter 1, ‘Acts of Meaning’, acts as an introduction to Halliday’s functional and meaning-oriented approach to language, setting the scene for several of the main concepts that are concentrated on in more detail in later chapters. This can help those readers wishing to use the entire book as it has been aimed – as an interface to the <italic>Collected Works</italic>.</p>
<p>Important additional features of the book include an index which directs readers to extracts exploring key terms, and an extensive bibliography highlighting Halliday’s work and the work of other linguists working in, drawing on or influencing Systemic Functional theories. Should readers want to read further on a particular concept, an additional readings section is provided at the end of each chapter, directing readers to specific sections and chapters of the more extensive <italic>Collected Works</italic>. At times, as would be the case with any venture involving the selection and compilation of extracts from a larger work, readers may find themselves being asked to recall specific extracts and examples not present in this particular edited version. While this can sometimes cause confusion and coherency issues, it does not detract from the importance of this book as a scaffolding resource for Halliday’s linguistic theories.</p>
<p>In summary, this edited volume provides an extensive exploration of the features of Halliday’s theories second only in depth and coverage to the original <italic>Collected Works</italic> themselves. Webster’s edited collection of selected extracts might best be described as a rather large annotated bibliography that provides readers with a useful summary of the essential aspects of Halliday’s theories. For this reason, <italic>The Essential Halliday</italic> would be a useful resource for those wanting to gain an understanding of the fundamental features of a Systemic Functional approach to language and linguistics. It would be of particular use to those looking for a theoretical step up from what is offered in the various Systemic Functional Linguistics introductory texts that are available.</p>
