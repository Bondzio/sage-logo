<abstract>
<p>The low-velocity impact response of thermoplastic honeycomb core sandwich structure with aluminum skin has been investigated by conducting drop-weight impact tests using an instrumented drop-weight impact tower. At first, the shear modulus of the thermoplastic honeycomb core and flexural modulus of the skin were investigated through a series of flexural test. Later in the study, the indentation test was conducted to the specimen in order to investigate the indentation characteristic. It was found that the indentation characteristic of this sandwich structure can be analyzed using a Meyer indentation law. The impact response of the thermoplastic honeycomb core sandwich structures was predicted using a simple energy-balance model which meant for energy absorption in bending, shear and contact effects. In addition, the energy-balance model was also used to identify the energy partitioning during the impact event. The result shows that the energy absorption profile was relatively constant over the range of impact energies, suggesting that the fraction of energies does not vary with impact conditions.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311410475" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nowadays, there has been a growing interest in the use of structural sandwich composite panel ranging from automotive and marine applications to aircraft and space structures. Furthermore, the building and consumer industries have also shown interest in the study because of their excellent properties such as superior bending stiffness, low weight, improved stability, excellent thermal insulation, good acoustic damping, fire retardant, ease in machining and ease in forming among others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410475">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410475">2</xref></sup> Sandwich panels consist of two thin face sheets and a lightweight thicker core. Commonly used materials for facings are composite laminates and metals, while cores are made of metallic and nonmetallic honeycombs, cellular foams, balsa wood, or trusses. The facing carry almost all the bending and in-plane loads and the core helps to stabilize the facings and defines the flexural stiffness and out-of-plane shear and compressive behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410475">3</xref></sup> The behavior of sandwich structure mostly depends on the properties of core material, especially under the impact loading. In addition, the impact damage resistance of the sandwich structure is mostly influenced by the face sheet type and core thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410475">4</xref></sup> A major disadvantage that limits the usage of the sandwich structure is their poor resistance to localized impact loading, which can cause damage that can lead to a reduction of properties for the sandwich structure.</p>
<p>A number of studies have been carried out to investigate the impact response of sandwich structures. Surveys of the past studies show that localized impact loading on a sandwich structure can result in various types of damages that can lead to significant reductions in its properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410475">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311410475">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410475">8</xref></sup> A limited number of studies has focused on modeling the impact response of sandwich structure. Several studies that predict the impact response of sandwich structure were using the energy-balance model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410475">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410475">10</xref></sup> Staal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410475">11</xref></sup> predicting the failure loads of impact damaged honeycomb sandwich panels using nonlinear finite element models and understand how this type of damage causes panels to fail at reduced loads. Foo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410475">12</xref></sup> investigate the impact response of sandwich structure numerically by modifying the energy-balance model and finite element model. Comparison with experimental load–displacement curves demonstrated that the numerical model was capable of modeling the behavior of composite sandwich panels under the quasi-static impact loading. The aim of this study is to apply a simple energy-balance model in order to predict the low-velocity impact response of the thermoplastic honeycomb core sandwich structure with aluminum skin. In this study, the accuracy of the model was investigated by varying the drop height of the impactor as well as the incident energy during the impact event. The model was then used to investigate the energy partitioning which explained the fraction of energies during the impact event.</p>

<p>The thermoplastic honeycomb core structures examined in this study were supplied in the form of large panels by DK Composite Sdn. Bhd. The cell size of the core (face to face) was approximately 5 mm. The thickness of the thermoplastic honeycomb core investigated in this study is 30 mm. Details of key properties for the thermoplastic honeycomb used are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311410475">Table 1</xref>. The thermoplastic honeycomb cores were cut into dimensions of 200 × 35 mm<sup>2</sup> wide using a band-saw machine. The face sheet of the sandwich structures was based on 0.05 mm thick aluminum sheet. Individual aluminum sheet was cut to the same dimensions as the thermoplastic honeycomb core by using a metal sheet cutter machine. The aluminum sheet skins were bonded to the thermoplastic honeycomb cores using an Araldite Rapid Epoxy with an Araldite Rapid Hardener. In preparing the sandwich structure, the adhesive has been applied uniformly to both top and bottom part of the thermoplastic honeycomb core. Later the resulting structure was clamped under light pressure for about 15 min. The cured sandwich panels were then ready for testing.

<p>Impact test was conducted using a 2.1 kg instrumented drop weight impact machine with a 12.5 mm diameter hemispherical nose impactor. The projectile was released starting from the height 0.01 m up to 1 m. By varying the drop height, incident impact energies were investigated at each drop height. The impact force was measured using a Kistler 9333 A piezo-electric load cell located just above the hemispherical nose impactor and the variation of this with time was recorded by dedicated computer. At first, the tests were conducted on simple beam-like samples. The sample was simply supported on a two 12.5 mm diameter stainless steel cylinder positioned on movable angle supports. Tests on the sandwich panel were supported over a span of 156 mm wide calculated according to the ASTM D 5023-95 a. Three measurements were taken for each height to quantify the average behavior of this material.</p>
<p>The indentation test was performed using Instron 4505 mechanical test machine by modifying the support system from three-point bend configuration to a solid support system. The test was conducted on sandwich panels at crosshead displacement rate of 1.5 mm/min. During the test, bending was suppressed by placing the samples on a solid steel support to avoid any flexural displacements on the beams. The applied load, <italic>P</italic>, and the resulting indentation, <italic>α</italic>, were assumed to obey Meyer's indentation law given as:

In order to determine the shear modulus, <italic>G</italic> of the core material, a series of three-point bend test were conducted on samples of different length supported over different spans. The length of the tested samples was between 100 and 250 mm. The samples were placed on a 10 mm cylindrical support, where each sample was at midspan around 5 mm from the center of the supports. The samples were then loaded at crosshead displacement rate of 1 mm/min. The results showed that the span length, <italic>L</italic> and applied force, <italic>P</italic> were related to each other by this equation,
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0021998311410475"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410475-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>where <italic>A = bd</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>c</italic> with <italic>b</italic> is the width of the sample, <italic>c</italic> the core thickness and <italic>d</italic> the distance between the mid-planes of the face sheets. The experimental data then were analyzed by plotting <italic>δ</italic>/<italic>PL</italic> against <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>. The resulting curve of the graph gives out a slope which is equal to 1/48<italic>D</italic> and the intercept on the <italic>y</italic>-axis equal to 1/(4<italic>AG</italic>).</p>
<p>A series of compression test for honeycomb core sandwich structure was investigated by using an Instron 4505 machine at crosshead displacement rate of 1.5 mm/min. The compression response of the sandwich structure was measured using a detector and variation of stress–strain was captured by the dedicated computer.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311410475"><title>The energy-balance model</title>
<p>In order to predict the impact response of the thermoplastic honeycomb core sandwich structure with aluminum skin, the energy-balance model was used. Assume that the test responds in a quasi-static mode. When the projectile makes a contact with the structure, at the same time the structure has reached its maximum deflection. During the deflection, the sums of kinetic energy of the projectile have been applied to deform the structure. The total energy used can be divided into two parts; the energy used to deform the structure in bending/shear and the energy dissipated in contact effects. According to the principle of the conservation of energy, the energy balance model can be derived as the following:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0021998311410475"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410475-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>where <italic>E<sub>b</sub></italic>, <italic>E<sub>s</sub></italic>, and <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> refers to energy dissipation in the form of bending, shear, and contact effects. The force–displacement relationship for a simply supported beam can be defined as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0021998311410475"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410475-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>where <italic>G</italic> is the shear modulus of the sandwich core and <italic>A</italic> the area of the sandwich structure. In Equation (5), the first bracket shows the bending deformations of the sandwich structure and the second bracket refers to the shear deformation occur in the sandwich. Next, the energy absorbed due to shear and bending deformations at maximum force, <italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub>, can be determined as follows:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-0021998311410475"><label>(5)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410475-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>After integration, <italic>E<sub>bs</sub></italic> becomes:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula6-0021998311410475"><label>(6)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410475-eq6.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>By using the Meyer's Law, the contact effects between the sandwich structure and the impactor can be calculated by integrating Equation (1) as given:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula7-0021998311410475"><label>(7)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410475-eq7.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>By substituting the Equation (6) and (7) into Equation (3), the sum of energy-balance equation for the system turns out to be:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula8-0021998311410475"><label>(8)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410475-eq8.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>This energy-balance model is the summed of energy absorption in bending, shear and contact effects. Moreover, this model can be applied to predict the maximum impact force, <italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub> at each impact energies.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0021998311410475"><title>Indentation properties of the thermoplastic honeycomb core sandwich structure</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410475">Figure 2</xref> shows typical load–indentation curves of 30 mm thick sandwich structures at crosshead displacement rate of 1.5 mm/min. The samples were tested on a flat rigid support. From the load–indentation plot, the values show a linear curve which indicates that the indentation increase with the loading. As the load–indentation data fit the Meyer contact law in Equation (1), the average was calculated to get the actual value of parameter <italic>C</italic> and <italic>n</italic>. The average value of contact coefficient <italic>C</italic> and <italic>n</italic> were 3.95 × 105 N/mn and 1.024. From the plot, the value of parameter <italic>C</italic> and <italic>n</italic> in the Meyer's Law dictate the shape and slope of the load vs. indentation curves. Similar observation has been made elsewhere following flexural tests on foam-based sandwich core with composite skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410475">14</xref></sup> It suggests that the data from the load–indentation curves are subsequently used to determine the indentation constants <italic>C</italic> and <italic>n</italic> that can contribute in predicting the impact response of the structure. Aligned with that, the increase in load significantly affected the global stiffness of the specimen. As expected, there was a through-thickness damage occurred in the structure. This corresponds with the visible damage associated with the penetration of the indentor, as also reported in Dear and Lee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410475">15</xref></sup>

</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311410475"><title>Impact response of the thermoplastic honeycomb core sandwich structure</title>
<p>In order to predict the suitability of the energy-balance model for predicting the impact response of the sandwich structure, the experiment starts by investigating the variation of impact force with drop height. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311410475">Figure 3</xref> shows a series of impact tests of sandwich structure where the drop height varied from 0.01 m up to 1 m, while maintaining the impact mass of 2.1 kg. The plot indicates that the impact force does appear to be dependent on the drop height, as the value of force increases with the drop height. Through these finding, it also showed that the maximum impact force was increases with impact energy before reaching a plateau at approximately 680 N. At this point, the force has reached the threshold point where both the impact force and energy have been reduced to a certain level which indicates the damage has started to generate over the structure. The reduction in force is subjected to a descent of flexural rigidity of the sandwich structure that mainly affected by the damage.
<fig id="fig3-0021998311410475" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Relationship between maximum impact force and impact energy for the sandwich structures. Span, 156 mm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410475-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The impact test was then continued to investigate the effect of varying the impact energy on the impact force of the sandwich beams. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311410475">Figure 4</xref> shows the variation of the maximum impact force with impact energy for experimental and theoretical values. The theoretical values were calculated from the energy-balance model. According to the figure present, the plot shows dissimilar results between the two approaches. The theoretical approach shows a value that gives a linear result on the graph, while the experimental data show an initial rise in force with increasing impact energy before reaching a plateau at 700 N. A post-impact examination of the samples pointed out that for energies above 5 J, all specimens failed pursuant to a top surface buckling failure of the skin directly under the point of impact. Here, it indicates that the damage has already started to generate in the core. Hence, it could not offer a significant support to the aluminum skin during the impact. Meanwhile, the variation between the experimental and theoretical value most likely caused by the friction occurred during the impact event. Clearly, the energy-balance model predicts a value of force for a given impact energy. By using the equations from the model, the impact energy appears to be dependent on the impact force. Therefore, varying the impact energy should yield a higher impact force. The solid lines in the figure indicate that a simple energy-balance model is capable of predicting the maximum impact force for a given incident energy. Similar investigation had been made elsewhere following the impact test on aluminum honeycomb core sandwich structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410475">10</xref></sup> The authors suggest that this value or result can be used to model the impact response of a sandwich structure.
<fig id="fig4-0021998311410475" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The relationship of maximum impact force and drop height between experimental and theoretical values.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410475-fig4.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>In order to gain a greater understanding of the impact event, the energy-balance model was used to partition the energy in the sandwich structure. Here, the fraction of energy dissipated in bending, shear and contact effects in Equation (3) was determined for the range of energies considered. Assuming that the energy-balance model is an elastic response, the energy dissipation in cell buckling or core crushing mechanisms is not taken into account due to its difficulty to quantify. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410475">Figure 5</xref> shows the energy absorption profiles correspond to a range of impact energies. From the data, it is apparent that approximately 50% of the incident impact energy is absorbed in shear effects within the core. The figure also shows that only 5% of the impact energy of the carriage is absorbed in bending of the sandwich beam during the impact. In this case, the core was especially designed for energy absorption as it eliminates the loss of crush strength. Mechanically, core crushing is a complex mechanical phenomenon characterized by the appearance of various folds and failures in the hexagonal structure. This phenomenon is known for its energy-absorbing capacities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311410475">16</xref></sup> It is interesting to note that the energy absorption profiles are relatively flat over the range of impact energies, suggesting that partition of incident energies does not vary with the impact conditions as reported in Hazizan and Cantwell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410475">10</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec8-0021998311410475"><title>Failure modes in the sandwich structures</title>
<p>Following the impact, failure modes in the samples were investigated in order to identify the type of failure occur at a different level of energies. Initial failure on samples impacted at energies just before the damage initiation threshold took the form of skin indentation, debonding, and buckling in the uppermost skin of the sandwich structure. Skin indentation was likely the most dominant mode of failure in sandwich structure. This type of failure occurred due to the highly localized impact load, which consists of local yielding and deformation of the loaded facing into the core. Meanwhile for the debonding mechanism, it does not only reduce the stiffness of the structure but also make it susceptible to buckling. The failure modes of the sandwich structure at the lowest level of incident energy can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311410475">Figure 6(a)</xref>. The failure modes of sandwich structures with honeycomb core were studied by Daniel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410475">3</xref></sup> For the sample that experienced incident energies above the damage initiation threshold, different modes of failure were observed. It includes buckling failure in the top skin and the core, skin debonding and shear cracking in the core. It is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311410475">Figure 6(b)</xref>. As the core was primarily selected to carry the shear loading, at this point the maximum shear stress has reached the critical value or shear strength of the core material and thus prone to damage. This is not surprising since the sandwich structure has a lightweight core and the aluminum skin is too thin, which could not protect the core from high shear stresses.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410475">Figure 7</xref> shows typical stress–strain plots for the sandwich structure following compression test at crosshead displacement rate of 1.5 mm/min. Clearly, stress–strain curve is quite linear and dropped shortly after the peak stress and become plateau which suggesting some forms of instability. This is because the core materials absorbed a significant amount of energy before it reaches the limit which is the maximum compression strength point. The compression modulus and strength obtained from the curve were 0.013 GPa and 2.25 MPa. After certain level, the stress increased back at strain of 0.8. Clearly, the stress increased because the structure did not fail after reaching the plastic region. Indeed, severe crushing in the thermoplastic material core can be seen but there is no visible damage for the skin.

</fig></p>
<p>In order to determine the strength of the sandwich structure under compressive loading, a series of cycled compression loading tests were carried out at crosshead displacement rate of 1.5 mm/min. In this test, three different cores had been tested which includes the thermoplastic honeycomb, aluminum honeycomb, and paper-coated polyamide honeycomb cores. Instead of changing the parameter of the sample, load–unload compression cycle was applied uniformly to the sample in order to determine the extend in which the structure can sustain the load. Another purpose of conducting this test was also to identify the behavior of the structure after undergoing multiple compression load. The compression sample was first loaded uniaxially in the circumferential direction to approximately 50% compressive strain. The samples were then allowed to re-equilibrate for 5 min (unloaded). After the re-equilibration, the sample was loaded unixially again for at least three times.</p>
<p>With the same approach, the three types of honeycomb had been compared to investigate which of the honeycomb materials can sustain longer in multiple compressive loads. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410475">Figures 8</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410475">10</xref>, aluminum honeycomb core gets the top spot with the highest peak stress value followed by paper-coated polyamide honeycomb core and thermoplastic honeycomb core. Despite the result, the most important reason of investigating the behavior of the core is to know how long it can sustain the compressive load. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410475">Figure 8</xref> shows that the thermoplastic honeycomb core material can sustain the multiple compressive loading the longest compared to the other honeycomb cores as both aluminum and paper-coated polyamide honeycomb core was crushed and become plateau after second loading. From the figure, the compression loading of the sample gives a linear increase with the slope continuously reduced as the number of loading hysteresis increases. Generally, this honeycomb is made from polypropylene (PP) which also can be assumed as a ductile material. From this, the relation of the PP properties to the behavior of the core under repeated loading was obvious as the core tends to retain its compressibility since the core can recover back to its original form during equilibrating (unloading) process.

</fig>
<fig id="fig9-0021998311410475" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Stress–strain curves following load–unload compression test of aluminum honeycomb core at crosshead displacement rate of 1.5 mm/min.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410475-fig9.tif"/>
</fig>
<fig id="fig10-0021998311410475" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>Stress–strain curves following load–unload compression test of paper honeycomb coated with polyamide core at crosshead displacement rate of 1.5 mm/min.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410475-fig10.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>After a certain amount of loading, it can be seen that the maximum stress proportionally decrease as the strength of the core has reached its maximum with densification occurs in the core. As a matter of fact, densifications were detected on the sample as the core did not return or recover back to its original form after the third loading was applied. However, it is interesting to note that the thermoplastic honeycomb core could endure such a multiple amount of compressive load applied to the system compared to the other types of honeycomb. Unlike thermoplastic honeycomb, aluminum honeycomb can also be considered ductile as it is made from metals. But however, in this test, aluminum honeycomb experience very little re-equilibrate (unloading) which unable it to recover back to its original form. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311410475">Figure 9</xref>, the aluminum honeycomb is proportionally increased in the first loading but starting from the second loading, the aluminum becomes plateau after approximately 2.5 MPa. Hence even though the aluminum honeycomb did experience such recovery, it also shows that the honeycomb cannot withstand repeated loading at the same time as it needs more time to recover back to its original state. Meanwhile for paper-coated polyamide honeycomb, it possessed brittle properties, which can easily fail after a single compression as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410475">Figure 10</xref>. The linear increase in second and third loading shows that the honeycomb experiences some catastrophic failure for which recovery is impossible after the first compression. Even though their strength is higher than the thermoplastic honeycomb, but still they cannot recover back from the first compression load. From this, it tells that the thermoplastic honeycomb could retain its compressibility under repeated loading system. Similar results were also obtained by Pagget<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311410475">17</xref></sup> in the behavior of composites under compressive load–unload test. A comparison of results and properties as a function of type of core was illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311410475">Table 2</xref>.

<p>The low-velocity impact response of thermoplastic honeycomb core sandwich structure had been studied, and initial tests were carried out to characterize the mechanical properties of the skin and core materials. It showed that the properties are sensitive to the geometry of the sandwich structure. Following the properties, indentation test on simple beam-like structures had shown that the average load–indentation plot gave out similar results of contact parameter <italic>C</italic> and <italic>n</italic>. It also proved that a simple Meyer Law can be used to characterize the indentation response.</p>
<p>Low-velocity impact tests on the thermoplastic honeycomb core sandwich structure had shown that the dissipation of incident energy during the impact can be used to predict the impact response of the sandwich structures. In addition, the simple energy-balance model successfully predicts the energy breakdown of incident energies during the impact event. This statement proves that the partition of energy depends on the geometry and condition of the sandwich structure. Aligned with that, various types of damages occurred due to the impact loading. The damages most likely depend on the properties of the material from the structure.</p>
