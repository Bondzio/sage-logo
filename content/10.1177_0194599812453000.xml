<p>AAO-HNS members with a self-identified subspecialty interest either in sleep medicine or general otolaryngology were asked to complete an online survey, each respondent rated (5-point Likert scale) the perceived quality of their education and training and the role of specific factors in selection, both for procedure categories (eg, all hypopharyngeal) and individual procedures.

<p>Response rate was 27% (163/610). Sixty-five percent of respondents rated their surgical OSA education and training during postgraduate continuing medical education (CME) courses as of high quality, compared with 39% for residency/fellowship and 4% for medical school (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). For individual hypopharyngeal procedures, over 40% of respondents reported limited training (except for tongue radiofrequency), and over 30% raised concerns about scientific evidence and reimbursement. Surgeon personal experience suggested treatment benefits without clearly favoring individual procedures. Respondents noted that patients were reluctant to undergo procedures, despite treatment recommendations, particularly maxillomandibular advancement. The sleep medicine subgroup reported higher ratings for education and training quality, research evidence, and personal experience with hypopharyngeal procedures. Concerns about adequate education and training, the quality of research evidence, and reimbursement issues were major factors in procedure selection.</p>

<body>
<p>The surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) includes procedures designed to treat airway obstruction occurring in the palatal and/or hypopharyngeal (also called retrolingual or retroglossal) regions. One approach to developing surgical treatment plans is characterizing the pattern of airway obstruction, selecting procedures according to the individual patient’s pattern. Although no gold standard exists, multiple evaluation techniques suggest that the prevalence of obstruction in the palatal region is more common than in the hypopharyngeal region but that the latter is often involved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812453000">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812453000"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812453000">3</xref></sup> Over the past 15 to 20 years, procedures have been developed to treat or applied to treat hypopharyngeal obstruction in adults with OSA: genioglossus advancement, hyoid suspension, midline glossectomy, tongue radiofrequency, tongue stabilization, and maxillomandibular advancement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812453000">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the United States, one recent study concluded that approximately 35,000 OSA surgeries are performed annually and that only 20% of these surgeries include procedures designed to treat hypopharyngeal obstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812453000">5</xref></sup> This proportion is notably lower than the proportion with hypopharyngeal obstruction suggested in the aforementioned studies of airway obstruction patterns. Surgical decision making takes into account not only the patient’s history, physical examination, and other evaluations related to the pattern of obstruction but also surgeon training,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812453000">6</xref></sup> the 3 components of evidence-based practice (research evidence, surgeon personal experience, and patient preferences),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812453000">7</xref></sup> and any reimbursement barriers. The objectives of this study were to examine the latter group of factors in order to characterize those that surgeons perceive as affecting selection of procedures designed to treat hypopharyngeal obstruction and to compare those factors among surgeons with a self-identified subspecialty interest in sleep medicine to general otolaryngologists.</p>
<sec id="section6-0194599812453000" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This survey was sent to selected surgeon members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS), as of mid-2010. To identify a sample of actively practicing US surgeons (based on the previous study),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812453000">5</xref></sup> the target population was limited to US members who were regular or military members (excluding life, in-training, inactive, or retired) and who completed residency training between 1977 and 2009. Among this population, 2 groups were identified based on self-selected subspecialty interests in their AAO-HNS member profile; Group 1 (Sleep) included all with interest in sleep medicine, and Group 2 (General Otolaryngology) was drawn from the pool with interest in general otolaryngology without other subspecialty interests. The General Otolaryngology group was selected by matching 2:1 to the Sleep group according to year of residency training completion, based on an expected lower rate of response among the General Otolaryngology group and the goal of having similar sample sizes.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://SurveyMonkey.com">SurveyMonkey.com</ext-link>, Palo Alto, California) to preserve respondent anonymity. Potential respondents were contacted using electronic mail sent from the AAO-HNS (with unique SurveyMonkey link), and nonrespondents were subsequently contacted by the AAO-HNS (twice), UCSF Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery (once), and SurveyMonkey (4 times). As an incentive, all respondents were entered in a drawing to receive $100 honoraria. Responses were collected between November 2011 and February 2012.</p>
<p>The survey specifically indicated that all questions referred to the evaluation and treatment of adults. The first 3 questions assessed the perceived quality of education and training during medical school, residency and/or fellowship, and continuing medical education (CME) courses. Responses were provided as either none, reflecting no education or training, or on a 5-point Likert scale, anchored by 1/poor and 5/excellent.</p>
<p>The survey then included a number of questions related to categories of or individual procedures: surgical treatment overall, palate surgery, hypopharyngeal surgery overall, specific hypopharyngeal procedures (genioglossus advancement, hyoid suspension, midline glossectomy, tongue radiofrequency, and tongue stabilization), and maxillomandibular advancement. Surgeons were asked to rate their level of agreement with the following statements, reflecting the importance of each factor in procedure selection: surgeon training (“I have received the necessary education and training to perform . . . ”), research evidence (“There is sufficient evidence supporting the value of . . . ”), surgeon personal experience (“My personal experience is that . . . improves outcomes”), patient preferences (“Despite my recommendations, patients are reluctant to undergo . . . ”), and reimbursement issues (“Reimbursement or other third-party payor issues limit my ability to perform . . . ”). Responses were provided as not applicable or not familiar with this or on a 5-point Likert scale anchored by 1/strongly disagree and 5/strongly agree. The survey then asked which category of or individual procedure was most affected by each factor and, separately, which factor was most important in selection for each category of or individual procedure. There were 63 questions related to factors and procedure selection.</p>
<p>Finally, each respondent was asked about their practice setting, number of providers within group, whether they had performed specific procedures in the past year, and the number of surgical procedures (total, palate, and hypopharyngeal) performed within the past year.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed collectively and separately for the Sleep and General Otolaryngology groups. Demographic and practice characteristics were examined using descriptive statistics. To evaluate differences between groups, <italic>t</italic> tests (continuous variables) and chi-square testing (categorical variables) were used.</p>
<p>For questions concerning factors affecting procedure selection, frequency statistics as well as mean ± standard deviation were calculated for all Likert scale ratings (not applicable or not familiar with this responses excluded). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test evaluated differences in the distribution of responses (based on frequency statistics) between the groups, given the nonparametric nature of the data. The multinomial logit model compared (1) the category of or individual procedure most affected by each factor and (2) which factor was most important in selection for each category of or individual procedure.</p>
<p>Aggregate responses are reported as percentages (categorical or dichotomous) or mean ± standard deviation. <italic>P</italic> values &lt; .05 were considered statistically significant. This study was approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The Sleep and General Otolaryngology groups included 217 and 434 matched AAO-HNS members, respectively. Nine Sleep and 32 General Otolaryngology members had missing/incorrect e-mail and telephone numbers; this produced a sample of 208 and 402 contacted members in the groups. Overall, 191 surgeons initiated the survey (94 Sleep, 97 General Otolaryngology), but 28 completed less than 20% of the survey (survey responses excluded). The remaining respondents completed 98% of the survey questions. The response rate was therefore 27% (163/610) overall, including 38% (79/208) in the Sleep group and 21% (84/402) in the General Otolaryngology group.</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599812453000">
<title>Demographics and Practice Setting</title>
<p>Respondents were 16% (26/163) female, with age 48.0 ± 7.8 years and residency completion year 1995.4 ± 8.3 years. The sample was predominantly non-Hispanic white (88%), with 3% Hispanic white, 1% black/African American, and 8% Asian; there were no Native American/Pacific Islander or American Indian/Alaskan Native respondents. There were no group differences.</p>
<p>Ten respondents, all in Sleep group, completed a fellowship with emphasis on sleep medicine or surgery. Respondents were members of practice groups with 7.0 ± 8.4 otolaryngology providers, with a greater number in the Sleep than the General Otolaryngology group (8.7 ± 8.0 vs 5.5 ± 8.5; <italic>P</italic> = .015). The practice setting was reported as: 21% urban teaching, 16% urban nonteaching, 14% suburban teaching, 39% suburban nonteaching, and 10% rural; there was no group difference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812453000">
<title>Performance of OSA Procedures</title>
<p>Almost all (96%) respondents had performed OSA surgery within the prior year. Respondents reported performing 26.6 ± 39.6 surgeries (palate, hypopharyngeal, or combination) within the past year, with a greater number by the Sleep group (39.1 ± 41.7 vs 15.0 ± 33.9; <italic>P</italic> = .0001). There were 21.8 ± 31.5 palate procedures performed, with a greater number by the Sleep group (29.5 ± 27.1 vs 14.7 ± 33.7; <italic>P</italic> = .003). The reported number of hypopharyngeal procedures was 9.1 ± 18.0, also with a greater number by the Sleep group (16.5 ± 22.5 vs 2.4 ± 8.0; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The Sleep group performed a wider variety of hypopharyngeal procedures. The proportion of respondents who performed specific individual procedures in the prior year were: genioglossus advancement (17% for the entire group, 33% Sleep vs 1% General Otolaryngology; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), hyoid suspension (24%, 43% vs 6%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), midline glossectomy (25%, 38% vs 12%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), tongue radiofrequency (37%, 47% vs 27%; <italic>P</italic> = .01), tongue stabilization (11%, 18% vs 5%; <italic>P</italic> = .008), and maxillomandibular advancement (5%, 10% vs 0%; <italic>P</italic> = .003).</p>

The proportion reporting high quality (rating 4 or 5) of education and training increased (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) from medical school (4%) to residency and/or fellowship (39%) to CME courses (65%). The Sleep group perceived <italic>lower</italic> quality during residency and/or fellowship but higher quality in CME courses. Respondents completing residency in 2000-2009 and 1990-1999 had higher ratings for education and training during residency and fellowship but <italic>lower</italic> ratings for CME courses than respondents with residency completion in 1977-1989 (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 for Wilcoxon rank-sum tests); there were no statistically significant differences for 1990-1999 versus 2000-2009 for either rating. The proportions with a perceived high quality (rating 4 or 5) of education and training during residency and fellowship and from CME courses, respectively, were 24% and 78% (1977-1989), 43% and 68% (1990-1999), and 44% and 53% (2000-2009).</p>

<p>The level of agreement about sufficient research evidence was lower than for education and training for surgical treatment overall, palate surgery, and tongue radiofrequency but was higher for maxillomandibular advancement (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Thirty percent to 40% responded with rating 1 or 2 out of 5 for all individual hypopharyngeal procedures (data not shown). Levels of agreement were higher among the Sleep group than the General Otolaryngology group for hypopharyngeal surgery overall and for maxillomandibular advancement.</p>
<p>Surgeon personal experience regarding improvement in outcomes was broadly rated more favorably by the Sleep group, except for lower ratings for tongue radiofrequency and tongue stabilization (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .02); in some cases the magnitude of the differences was small. Surgeons generally disagreed with the statement that patients were reluctant to follow treatment recommendations, except for maxillomandibular advancement, where patient reluctance was most commonly reported (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 against all others). Surgeons agreed with the statement that reimbursement issues limited the ability to perform certain procedures, with the highest level of agreement for maxillomandibular advancement, followed by hypopharyngeal procedures, then palate surgery (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .02 for comparisons).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812453000"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref> presents the procedure category or individual procedure for which selection was felt to be most limited by each factor. The selection of maxillomandibular advancement was identified by half of respondents as limited by education and training, with a substantial group also citing hypopharyngeal surgery overall. The General Otolaryngology group felt that education and training in hypopharyngeal procedures was more limiting than for maxillomandibular advancement, and the opposite was true for the Sleep Group. Concern about scientific evidence was cited as a limitation broadly for all hypopharyngeal procedures but not maxillomandibular advancement. Selection of procedures based on surgeon’s unfavorable personal experience was not unique to specific hypopharyngeal procedures, but a higher proportion (especially for General Otolaryngology) identified this as important in palate surgery selection. Patient preferences were identified as important for surgical treatment overall (especially for General Otolaryngology) as well as maxillomandibular advancement and, to a lesser extent, hypopharyngeal surgery overall. Reimbursement issues were cited broadly, including for hypopharyngeal surgery overall and with somewhat more influence on the selection of tongue radiofrequency and midline glossectomy.</p>

For surgical treatment overall and palate surgery, patient preferences and reimbursement issues were most important among those who identified single factors. For hypopharyngeal surgery overall and specific hypopharyngeal procedures, surgeon training was cited most commonly; this was especially true for the General Otolaryngology group. The perceived quality of research evidence was almost as important for hypopharyngeal procedures and was more often cited by the Sleep group. Reimbursement issues were identified as most important for tongue radiofrequency.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that fewer hypopharyngeal procedures are performed than expected, based on the prevalence of hypopharyngeal obstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812453000">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812453000"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812453000">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812453000">5</xref></sup> Procedure selection is undoubtedly complex, perhaps especially so for hypopharyngeal procedures, and this study is the first to examine factors considered relevant by surgeons but unrelated to history and physical examination.</p>
<p>Surgeons, especially general otolaryngologists who perform OSA surgery, report not having the necessary training and education for hypopharyngeal procedures (except tongue radiofrequency). Furthermore, they identify this deficiency as a primary factor in procedure selection. Limited exposure to hypopharyngeal procedures in US residency programs has been reported previously by Shen;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812453000">6</xref></sup> the present study confirms that a majority of surgeons do report not receiving necessary training in medical school, residency, or nonsleep medicine/surgery fellowship and that there is no difference in perceptions of residency graduates from 2000 to 2009 compared with 1990 to 1999. Procedures identified with the least exposure (maxillomandibular advancement, genioglossus advancement) were also cited previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812453000">6</xref></sup> Although oral-maxillofacial surgeons have substantial training in maxillomandibular advancement, their training in unique medical and technical aspects relevant to OSA patients is unclear.</p>
<p>Concern regarding research evidence was cited as a key factor influencing hypopharyngeal procedure selection. Most hypopharyngeal surgery research consists of case series,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812453000">4</xref></sup> and survey responses indicate a desire for better evidence. Evidence was rated more highly among the Sleep group than the General Otolaryngology group, suggesting that CME courses, a primary source of surgeon education and training, could include greater emphasis on hypopharyngeal surgery evidence. It is not clear whether the differences in research evidence ratings reflect awareness (affected by CME courses) or perception regarding evidence quality (the Sleep group may be biased by having performed some of this research).</p>
<p>Surgeon personal experience is often overlooked as a critical element of evidence-based practice. Experience was reported as less important than other factors, which may be true or simply reflect tendencies of individuals (not just surgeons) to discount their own experience in decision making. The Sleep group reported a more favorable personal experience with surgical treatment and most individual procedures. This result is congruent with their self-identification of this subspecialty interest that could be the result of more education and training and/or more favorable experience, both reported here.</p>
<p>Patient preferences, defined as patients’ reluctance to follow treatment recommendations, were reported as most prominent for maxillomandibular advancement, compared with other individual procedures. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recently completed an OSA surgery literature review that highlighted the potential benefits of maxillomandibular advancement, albeit with almost no examination of procedure risks or inclusion of hypopharyngeal surgery literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812453000">8</xref></sup> In addition to the lack of education and training in maxillomandibular advancement cited previously, the procedure’s morbidity may contribute to patients’ reluctance to undergo the procedure, even when recommended.</p>
<p>This study has important limitations. There is a finite ability to evaluate important questions related to procedure selection. Our survey was pretested with colleagues and was designed to measure the absolute and relative importance of factors, but we were unable to explore these relationships in detail. In particular, issues of surgical training, research evidence, surgical experience, patient preference, and reimbursement issues are tied to each other and therefore may be confounding. This survey considered surgeons’ personal perceptions and attitudes without examining unconscious influences. Other general limitations of survey studies also apply: potential question misinterpretation, recall bias, and selection bias.</p>
<p>We utilized established methods for enhancing survey response, including those related to survey design, repeated contact of nonrespondents, and incentives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812453000">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812453000"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812453000">11</xref></sup> We employed a commonly used survey website, but unfortunately direct e-mails from the site were blocked from some potential respondents, requiring the use of alternative contact methods. The response rate of 27% is considered satisfactory, particularly with physicians, for whom response rates have been lower than the general public.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812453000">9</xref></sup> Although there are few electronic surveys of otolaryngologist–head and neck surgeons, our response rate is substantially higher than at least one recently published survey sponsored by the AAO-HNS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812453000">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sleep medicine is a growing field within otolaryngology–head and neck surgery, practiced by surgeons with a subspecialty interest and general otolaryngologists. This study could stimulate improvements in education and training in medical school, residency/fellowship, and postgraduate CME courses. Practicing surgeons will rely on the latter, but efforts should be directed to the medical school and residency/fellowship curricula, particularly the latter, where our specialty has greater control. Options include requirement of adequate training for residency program accreditation and continued expansion of the role in certification examinations, similar to the focus on other subspecialties such as facial plastic surgery. Concurrently, this study identifies substantial concern regarding hypopharyngeal surgery research evidence—the basis for informing treatment decisions and clarifying reimbursement issues.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Procedure selection should be based on the 3 components of evidence-based practice: research evidence, surgeon training and experience, and patient preferences. This study has identified factors important for hypopharyngeal surgery that ideally would not have primary roles: concerns about scientific evidence, lack of necessary surgeon education and training, and reimbursement issues. It also points to inherent drawbacks of certain procedures, such as patient reluctance to proceed with maxillomandibular advancement.</p>
