<abstract>
<p>The antibacterial activity of naturally colored cottons (NCCs) is evaluated. Compared to the conventional white cotton, brown NCC was found to exhibit excellent antibacterial activity with a reduction rate of 89.1% and 96.7%, when in contact with two species of bacteria,<italic> Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, respectively, while the antibacterial effect of green NCC was faint. To investigate the antibacterial mechanism of NCCs, pigments have been extracted from NCC fibers for further determination of their antibacterial activity using the disk diffusion method, and the chemical nature of extracted pigments was also analyzed. The results are as follows: the pigment from brown cotton fibers showed significant inhibition against the two challenge bacteria, while the resistance capacity of the pigment from green cotton fiber was insignificant, indicating that the antibacterial efficacy of NCC fibers was highly related to the chemical nature of the pigment. Diagnostic results indicated that the pigment from brown cotton belonged to condensed tannins, and the pigment from green cotton fiber was identified as flavonoids. The effect of high-temperature treatment on antibacterial activity of the pigment extracted from brown cotton was also examined. It showed that the general textile high-temperature curing conditions decrease its antibacterial activity, but the antibacterial activity still has a satisfactory retention, indicating a durable natural antibacterial performance of brown NCC to the high-temperature curing technology.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0040517512447585" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Naturally colored cottons (NCCs) are cotton varieties endowed with natural colors during their developing period. Since 1988, when Sally Fox developed two hybrids with a fiber quality suitable to be machine-spun, NCCs have attracted a great deal of attention for their ecological and economical advantages. Compared to conventional white cotton, they need not be dyed with synthetic dyes, not only saving the dyeing cost, but also avoiding health hazards and environmental pollution. Although more than ten cotton varieties with different colors have been reported breeding successfully worldwide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512447585">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512447585">2</xref></sup> only brown cotton and green cotton have been marketed due to their relatively better fiber quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512447585">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512447585">4</xref></sup> NCCs have been the concern of the textile materials, due to the worldwide requirements to develop the sustainable textile industry.</p>
<p>Except for the existence of pigment, the fundamental physical structures and main chemical compositions of NCCs are similar to that of white cotton fiber, which show natural convolution, a cuticle, secondary wall, lumen, and consist of pectin, wax, cellulose, hemicellulose and ash.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512447585">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512447585">6</xref></sup> However, the content of the chemical compositions of NCCs is significantly different.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512447585">5</xref></sup> The wax content of NCC fibers is much higher than that of white cotton fiber, and the cellulose content is relatively lower than that of white cotton fiber, leading to the lower moisture regain and tensile strength of fiber.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512447585">4</xref></sup> Hence, the textile processing properties of NCCs are inferior to the white cotton. But fortunately, the higher content of metal ions in ash gives NCCs antiflammability properties with the Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) value from 22.4 to 25.4 depending on the species of NCCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512447585">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512447585">8</xref></sup> The LOI of NCCs is much higher than that of white cotton, which is about 19.0. Natural pigments, as the source substance of the colors of NCCs, render NCCs UV radiation protective properties, which permit NCCs to be processed into natural sun-protection textiles possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512447585">7</xref></sup> The pigments, probably together with the wax, have also been found to serve as a defense against mildew and soil-borne pathogens, resulting in much lower rate of biodegradation of NCC fibers than that of white cotton and conventional dyed cotton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512447585">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the effect of pigments in NCCs on the activity of anti-skin-pathogenic bacteria is still unknown. The purpose of this work was to investigate the antibacterial performance properties of two common NCCs (brown and green cotton), to determine the antibacterial effects after heat treatment, and to evaluate whether the general high-temperature curing finishing process decreases their antibacterial activity or not. The chemical composition of pigments was also analyzed according to their UV spectra and chemical properties.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0040517512447585" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>The NCCs were <italic>Caixuan</italic> series supplied by Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhejiang, China. Gram-positive <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC No. 6538) and Gram-negative <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC No. 4352), obtained commercially from Hangzhou Tianhe Microorganism Reagent Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China, were chosen as representative species. All of the reagents were analytical grade and were purchased from Hangzhou Mike Chemical Instrument Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040517512447585"><title>Antibacterial assessment</title>
<p>The degree of antibacterial activity of NCCs was evaluated according to AATCC Test Method 100-2004. The control specimen was the conventional white cotton. The test and the control fibers first underwent extraction with petroleum ether for 24 h using a Soxhlet extractor in order to remove the surface wax, and then were sterilized with ethylene oxide and were desiccated at 60 °C after being tidied up in a fiber bundle by hand-drawing. Sterilization of the NCCs should be avoided in the autoclave because they would suffer a significant color change when the heat temperature exceeds 90 °C,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512447585">10</xref></sup> with the probable chemical structure change of pigment due to the heat. The sterilized swatches (0.6 g each) were placed separately in sterile Petri dishes and inoculated evenly with 1.0 mL of bacteria suspension. These inoculated swatches were then aseptically transferred to the 250 mL wide-mouth glass jar. The bacteria suspension should contain 1–2×10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units (cfu) of the bacteria/mL diluted from a 24 h broth culture of the test bacteria in nutrient broth. After inoculated cotton swatches were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h, 100 mL of sterile normal saline was poured into jars and was vigorously shaken for one minute. Then, 1 mL of eluted bacteria liquids were plated on nutrient agar after being suitably diluted and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Afterward, the viable colonies of bacteria on the agar plate were counted and the percent reduction of bacteria was calculated by following formula:

</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040517512447585"><title>Extraction and purification of pigments</title>
<p>5 g of brown cotton fiber were put into 450 mL of distilled water in a beaker and sonicated at 60 °C, 40 kHz and 70 W for 2 h using an ultrasonic cleaner (JK-2200DB model, Hefei Kinic Machinery Manufacture Co., Ltd, China). The liquid was wrung out of the fiber and was filtered through filter paper (Whatman No.1) using a Büchner funnel. Filtrates were vacuum evaporated at 50 °C with an R-201D rotary evaporator (Zhengzhou Yaron Instrument Co., Ltd, China) until the solution became turbid. Subsequently, one-quarter volume of methanol was added to precipitate the pigment. The solid precipitate and the upper clear solution were well-separated after centrifuged at 8000 rpm by an Anke TDLSO-2B centrifuge (ShangHai Anting Scientific Instrument Factory, China). The solid pigment was re-dissolved in water and re-precipitated twice. The obtained solid pigment was then lyophilized in a CoolSafe 110-4PRO freeze-dryer (Labogene, Denmark) to obtain the pigment powder, for the following investigation.</p>
<p>The pigment powder from the green cotton was prepared by the same process as that used for brown cotton, except that the pigment of the green cotton was extracted with chloroform and was crystallized by adding methanol. Since the extracts of white cotton, when using either water or chloroform as the solvents, had nearly nothing left after being evaporated to dryness, the small amount (10 mL) of concentrated solution evaporated from the extracts served as the control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0040517512447585"><title>Bacteria growth inhibition by pigments</title>
<p>Lyophilized powders of the brown cotton pigment and green cotton pigment were dissolved in distilled water and methanol, respectively, to prepare pigment solutions at the concentration of 5 mg/mL. The concentrated white cotton extracts served as the control. The antibacterial activity of pigment solutions was carried out according to disk diffusion method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512447585">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512447585">12</xref></sup> with two test bacteria, <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. Briefly, sterilized filter papers (Whatman No.1, cut with a diameter of 6 mm) were soaked in prepared pigment solutions and then dried. The paper disks obtained were then placed on the agar plates, on which the bacterial suspension in sterilized normal saline was uniformly spread. After 5 min standing, the plates were turned upside down and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Finally, the diameter of the clear zone of inhibition shown on the plates was measured in millimeters, and the data was the average of five measurements.</p>
<p>The color of NCCs is easily changed by heat treatment indicating the probable structure change of pigments by heat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512447585">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512447585">13</xref></sup> So it is essential to investigate the influence of the heat treatment on the antibacterial activity of the pigment. The bacterial growth inhibition of the brown cotton pigment after being treated with high temperature was conducted as above. For the high-temperature treatment process, the pigment was pretreated at 100 °C for 3 min and 180 °C for 2 min, typically the drying and curing conditions in NCCs processing, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512447585">14</xref></sup> In this test, samples were prepared in quintuplicate, and mean values of the diameter of the inhibition zone were calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0040517512447585"><title>Qualitative analysis of pigments</title>
<p>Various methods including chemical analysis and spectroscopic analyses were tried to analyze the chemical nature of the pigments extracted from the NCCs, and the effective methods were reported. For the green cotton pigment, drops of the shift reagents including 1% (w/v) methanol solution of sodium acetate, sodium hydroxide, aluminum chloride and aluminum chloride-hydrochloric acid were added into the methanol solution of green cotton pigment, respectively, and the UV-Vis spectra (by a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 UV-visible spectrophotometer) of these solutions were measured. Similarly, 1 mL of reagents including 1% (w/v) aqueous solution of sodium borohydride, magnesium acetate, boric acid, ferric chloride, lead acetate, gelatin (pH 4) as well as HCl/magnesium, formaldehyde-HCl and anisaldehyde-H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution were added into about 4 mL of the aqueous solution of brown cotton pigment and the methanol solution of green cotton pigment, respectively. After 5 min at room temperature, the reaction appearance and changes in the mixed solution such as solid precipitation or color change was observed.</p>
<p>A ThermoElectron Nicolet 5700 FT-IR spectrophotometer was used to collect the transmission spectra. The infrared spectra of the pigment powders were collected using KBr pellets in a frequency range between 4000 and 450 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The resolution was 4 cm<sup>−1</sup> and there were 100 scans for each spectrum.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0040517512447585"><title>Antibacterial properties of NCCs</title>
<p>After 18 h incubation, the bacterial population densities of three kinds of cotton fibers inoculated with <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512447585">Figure 1</xref>. Compared to the control (white cotton), the population density of the two challenge bacteria on green cotton fiber did show a slight but insignificant decrease, and the reduction rates were both less than 20%. As for the brown cotton, the population density of the two challenge bacteria decreased significantly, indicating great antibacterial activity, with the percentage of reduction up to 96.4% against<italic> K. pneumoniae</italic> and 89.1% against <italic>S. aureus.</italic> The significantly different responses for the two challenge bacteria to the three cotton varieties may be due to the differences of the chemical composition of fibers such as pectin, wax, sugars, metal ions and, especially, the pigments in the fiber.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512447585">5</xref></sup> However, it was unlikely, and also unnecessary, to investigate all of the components influencing the antibacterial activity of cottons since most of these substances, except the pigments, would be minimized or removed during the scouring process before utilization. Pigments, the special component of NCC fibers, are different in the brown and green cotton, and may contribute to the different antibacterial performances due to their possibly different active constituents. It is necessary to extract pigment compounds from fibers for the investigation of their antibacterial activity.

<sec id="sec10-0040517512447585"><title>Antibacterial activity of the pigments</title>
<p>Extraction efforts have attempted to obtain the pigments from fibers by using various solvents with different polarities, including petroleum ether, <italic>n</italic>-hexane, benzene, ether, ethyl acetate, chloroform, methanol and distilled water. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512447585">Figure 2(d)</xref>, are the appearances of the dissolved cotton pigments in different solvents after putting 0.2 g of brown and green cotton fiber, respectively, into 8 mL of various solvents in a test tube for 10 days at room temperature. It was evident that the pigments could be most easily dissolved out in distilled water and chloroform, for brown and green cotton, respectively. The method used for extraction and purification of pigments, in this paper, was the optimized method. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512447585">Figure 2(c)</xref>, the hue of the pigment powder extracted was in agreement with that of the corresponding fiber, and the color of the extracted brown and green cotton were much lighter than their corresponding original fibers, indicating the successful extraction of pigment from the NCCs. The investigation suggested that the pigment compounds in the two colored cottons may be quite different.
<fig id="fig2-0040517512447585" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Pictures of the original and pigment extracted cottons, and extracted pigment powder, as well as the appearance of the pigment in cottons dissolved out in different solvents.

<p>The antibacterial activity of the obtained pigments was tested against <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> with the concentrated extracts from white cotton serving as a control. The antibacterial activity was achieved by measuring the diameter of the zone of inhibition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512447585">Figure 3</xref> shows the inhibition by pigments extracted from green cotton and brown cotton, as well as the extract from white cotton, toward two challenge bacteria. It was evident that around the paper soaked in brown cotton pigment aqueous solution a significant inhibition zone against <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> was exhibited, with the mean diameter of the inhibition zone of 14.4 mm and 12.8 mm, respectively, however there was no evident inhibition for the extracts from green cotton and white cotton against the challenge bacteria. It proved that the extracts obtained from white cotton and green cotton possessed no antibacterial effect.

</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0040517512447585"><title>Influences of high-temperature treatment on antibacterial activity of pigments</title>
<p>The antibacterial properties of the brown pigment compound after being treated at 100 °C for 3 min and 180 °C for 2 min were also investigated. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512447585">Figure 4</xref>. The inhibition zones of the papers soaked with heat-treated concentrated white cotton extracts (the control) were still invisible, indicating no antibacterial performance. The antibacterial activity of the pigment after high-temperature treatment had all suffered a certain level of decrease, and the mean diameter of the inhibition zones were 13.8 mm and 11.0 mm for brown cotton pigment treated at 100 °C and at 180 °C against <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, as well as 12.2 mm and 9.8 mm against <italic>S. aureus</italic>, respectively. The antibacterial activity of the pigment had a slight decrease after being treated at 100 °C, while the antibacterial effect decreased much more for that treated at 180 °C. The results indicated that the present drying and curing process such as in durable press finishing would result in an inevitable decrease in antibacterial activity of brown cotton fabrics, but the retention of the antibacterial activity was not as bad.

<sec id="sec12-0040517512447585"><title>Chemical composition of pigment in green cotton fiber</title>
<p>Currently, little is known on the exact structure of pigments whether from green cotton or from brown cotton even though much effort has been employed in this area. The pigment in NCCs is far from an easy matter to be isolated and identified. There is a report that the methanol extracts from green cotton and brown cotton both consist of flavones or flavonols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512447585">15</xref></sup> As the previous extraction assay indicated that the pigments in brown cotton were hydrophilic compounds and that the extracting efficiency by methanol was low, it was unreasonable to identify the brown cotton pigment using the alcohol extracts. In this work, the pigments used for identification were all extracted using the solvent in which they were most soluble and purified by crystallization.</p>
<p>The green cotton pigments were identified from the ultraviolet spectrum. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512447585">Figure 5</xref> shows the ultraviolet spectrum of green cotton pigment dissolved in methanol with or without the addition of shift reagents. The solutions revealed two UV absorption bands at 235 to 280 nm (band II) and 300 to 400 nm (band I), which was very similar to the characteristic ultraviolet spectra of flavonoids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512447585">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512447585">17</xref></sup> Various shift reagents with exclusive specificity toward flavonoids were added to the analysis of the position of phenolic hydroxyl groups. When excess sodium acetate solution was added to the pigment solution, the maximum absorption of band II was shifted from 240 nm to 260 nm in its ultraviolet spectrum, which indicated the presence of a 7-hydroxyl of the flavonoid. The peak of band I shifted 50 nm toward the longer wavelengths after an excess of sodium hydroxide solution was added, indicating the 4-hydroxyl existence. The spectrum of the pigment solution after adding with aluminum chloride-hydrochloric acid was almost the same as that of the untreated. Compared to the spectrum of pigment solution after adding only aluminum chloride, however, its band I had shifted 23 nm toward shorter wavelengths, indicating that the 3-hydroxyl and 5-hydroxyl do not exist or are substituted by <italic>O</italic>-glucosides or methoxyls, respectively, and also indicating pyrocatechol on the B-ring. In conclusion, the pigment of green cotton could be a class of flavones or 3-<italic>O</italic>-glucoside flavonoids.
<fig id="fig5-0040517512447585" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Effect of shift reagents on UV spectrum of green cotton pigment dissolved in methanol.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517512447585-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The FT-IR spectrum of the pigment from green cotton is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512447585">Figure 6(a)</xref>. The spectrum of the pigment from green cotton revealed a stretching band of an intermolecular bonded hydroxyl group at 3388 cm<sup>-1</sup> with very strong methylene and methyl stretching frequencies appearing at 2918 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 2850 cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Close to a strong carbonyl stretching band at 1709 cm<sup>-1</sup>, two medium intensity chromattic bands of skeletal stretching vibration of aromatic ring were observed at 1608 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1383 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The band at 1467 cm<sup>-1</sup> can be attributed to the C–H deformation of methylene and methyl. A broad, strong band at 1223 cm<sup>-1 </sup>was due to the stretching vibration of carbon single bonded oxygen that connected the aromatic rings and substituents, such as methoxyl, glycosyl and other groups. The strong band appearing at 1165 cm<sup>-1</sup> may be the other stretching band of carbonyl which usually absorbs in the 1210–1163 cm<sup>-1</sup> region. The medium shoulder appearing at 1108 cm<sup>-1</sup> may arise from the aromatic ether connecting the A ring and B ring. The absorption at 804 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 720 cm<sup>-1</sup> were assigned to the out of plane bending vibration of the saturated C–H bond and aromatic C–H bond, respectively. The group functionalities and molecular structure of the pigment from green cotton, which revealed in the spectrum, were basically in conformity with the flavonoids.

<p>It is unacceptable to consider the pigment of brown cotton as flavonoids. The brown cotton pigment extracted by water revealed two UV-Vis absorption peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512447585">Figure 7</xref>), which were at 202 nm and 275 nm, and without an obvious peak in the 300–400 nm range, the standardized UV spectroscopy of flavonoids. From the observation of the reaction with diagnostic reagents, the chemical properties of brown cotton pigment were analyzed, and the results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512447585">Table 1</xref>) did not fit that of the flavonoids. Added with the aqueous solution of ferric chloride, the pigment solution presented an obviously blackish-green color, and added to lead acetate solution a flesh-colored precipitate was observed. This evidence indicated that the pigment of brown cotton could be preliminarily characterized as phenols. When HCl/magnesium, sodium borohydride and boric acid were added to the pigment solution, respectively, there were no obvious reactions. These negative reactions, as well as the data presented in the UV spectrum suggested the absence of flavonoids, such as flavones, flavonols, dihydroflavones, dihydroflavonols and chalcones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512447585">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512447585">19</xref></sup> The magnesium acetate was added to the pigment solution and no change was observed, indicating the lack of existence of the ingredients with a typical anthraquinone structure. A drop of pigment solution was added on the silica gel plate and sprayed with anisaldehyde-H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution, and an orange spot was observed. The aqueous solution of pigment became turbid when gelatin solution (pH 4) and formaldehyde-HCl were added, respectively, and a flesh-colored precipitate was presented after 10 min, then the mixture of solution was filtered, and the filtrate exhibited a faint brown color. These were the characteristic chemical reactions of condensed tannins, so the main component of pigment from brown cotton most probably belongs to condensed tannins. There was no visible reaction when the methanol solution of green cotton pigment was added to formaldehyde-HCl, and the pigment spot on silica gel plate turned red instead of orange when sprayed with anisaldehyde-H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution, indicating no tannins existed in green cotton pigment extracts.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512447585">Figure 6(b)</xref>, the FT-IR spectrum of the pigment from brown cotton revealed a strong, intermolecular bonded phenolic hydroxyl group stretching at 3415 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and coupled with weak bands of stretching methylene groups at 2933 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which may be attributable to the methylene in the 4-position of the end flavan-3-ol monomer unit. The main vibrational bands that were observed in the middle of the spectrum included ring skeletal bands at 1618 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1404 cm<sup>-1</sup> and finally an aryl alkyl ether symmetrical stretching at 1116 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The spectrum of the pigment from brown cotton was much similar to the spectra of condensed tannins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512447585">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Condensed tannins, obtained from plants, have desirable biological activities such as antioxidization, antinflammation, antimicrobial, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512447585">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0040517512447585">22</xref></sup> It is generally accepted that the mechanism of antimicrobial activity of these plant polyphenols is related to their ability to complex irreversibly with amino acids in proteins through hydrogen bonding as well as covalent bonding, thus inactivating the enzymes, surface adhesions and cell envelop transport proteins of microbes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512447585">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517512447585">24</xref></sup> It is reasonable that the great antibacterial activity of brown cotton could be attributed to its inherent pigment, the condensed tannin-based substance. However, the tannin-based pigment could become deeper after being treated, probably indicating a change in pigment structure and it may be the reason why the decrease of antibacterial activity of brown cotton pigment, with the heat treatment, occurred.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0040517512447585" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The degree of antibacterial activity of NCCs and pigments were evaluated. The brown cotton, as well as the pigment extract, was found to possess excellent antibacterial activity. However, the antibacterial activity of green cotton and its pigment were both insignificant. The results suggested that the antibacterial activity of NCC fibers was relevant to their pigment compositions. The antibacterial activity of the brown cotton pigment suffered some decrease after heat treatment, especially after being treated at 180 °C, but still had a good retention. The identification results showed that the main chemical compositions of pigments in green cotton and brown cotton belong to flavonoids and condensed tannins, respectively.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the identification work is based on the crude pigments which need to be further isolated and identified in the future. Furthermore, our study only focused on the antibacterial property of brown cotton pigment influenced by the high temperature generally used in textile finishing procedure, the effects of the long-term home laundering, solar radiation and other conditions on its antibacterial activity are also worth investigating.</p>
