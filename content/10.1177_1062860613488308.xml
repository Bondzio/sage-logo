<title>Background</title>
<p>Maimonides Medical Center is a 700-bed academic medical center with more than 70 primary care and subspecialty programs serving a diverse urban patient population. The Committee of Interns and Residents (CIR) is a house staff union representing more than 13 000 interns, residents, and fellows across the country. Part of CIR’s core mission is to improve the quality of care delivered in teaching hospitals by giving residents a voice in hospital decisions, redesign of work processes, and education. This value is closely aligned with Maimonides’ commitment to improving the quality and safety of care the medical center provides. During collective bargaining discussions in early 2011, the parties agreed to establish a Joint Quality Improvement Committee (JQIC) composed of senior clinical leadership, graduate medical education, and CIR resident leaders from various specialties. Maimonides also agreed to reserve funds for incentive bonuses to resident physicians if mutually agreed on quality improvement goals were met.</p>
<p>In spring 2011, the JQIC began meeting monthly to evaluate potential projects and determined that improving the hospital’s medication reconciliation process met the criteria of being a major patient safety priority for the health system and a highly resident-driven process. Medication reconciliation, the process of collecting and maintaining a complete and accurate list of patients’ medications, is vital to reducing medication errors and is a priority intervention for the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s 5 Million Lives Campaign and The Joint Commission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1062860613488308">
<title>Selecting a Joint Quality Project</title>
<p>Members of the JQIC developed a chart review process through which residents would review samples of medical records from each teaching service to evaluate whether medication lists were appropriately reconciled at discharge. In May 2011, baseline rates of appropriate reconciliation ranged from 33% to 66% across surgery, orthopedics, psychiatry, pediatrics, and internal medicine departments, which accounted for the majority of patient discharges and the majority of residents employed by Maimonides.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1062860613488308">
<title>Interventions</title>
<p>To educate their colleagues, resident leaders developed a noon conference lecture on the importance of medication reconciliation and created a concise reference tool that house staff could download onto their smartphones via the CIR Web site. Resident members of the JQIC also undertook additional training to become “super users” of the hospital’s electronic health record (EHR) and began serving as a unit-based resource for colleagues with questions about the medication reconciliation tool and other features of the EHR. Finally, some of the JQIC members developed a credentialing process and helped their colleagues demonstrate competency in the medication reconciliation process by observing 2 complete reconciliations at discharge.</p>
<p>Because it engaged house staff across the hospital’s clinical departments, the JQIC was able to identify and resolve several inconsistencies in the medication reconciliation processes between departments. Initiation of this project also was timed to coincide with an upgrade to Maimonides’ EHR, and the JQIC served as a direct conduit to hospital clinical and administrative leadership to address systems issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1062860613488308" sec-type="results">
<title>Year 1 Results</title>
<p>After 1 year, qualitative medication reconciliation compliance improved by at least 20% in internal medicine, psychiatry, and orthopedics, and house staff in these departments received an incentive bonus. JQIC members in other departments are continuing to complete department-specific audits and address deficiencies of individual residents. To sustain improvement, residents presented the medication safety primer to new house staff at orientation and, during the fall, will deliver refresher lectures to departments that discharge patients.</p>
