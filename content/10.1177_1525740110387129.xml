<abstract>
<p>This study examined and compared patterns of errors in the oral definitions of newly learned words. Fifteen 9- to 11-year-old children with language learning disability (LLD) and 15 typically developing age-matched peers inferred the meanings of 20 nonsense words from four novel reading passages. After reading, children provided oral definitions for target words. Oral definition errors were categorized and proportions were computed. Results indicated that the LLD and typical groups showed similar error proportions in indeterminate (<italic>p</italic> = .055), false (<italic>p</italic> = .506), and semantic (<italic>p</italic> = .370) categories. Different error proportions were found for phonological (<italic>p</italic> = .048), sentence (<italic>p</italic> = .031), substitution (<italic>p</italic> = .001), and syntactic (<italic>p</italic> = .023) categories. Similar patterns of errors were found for frontier and unknown words for the LLD group. These patterns provided evidence that children with LLD have difficulty gaining partial word knowledge during reading tasks.</p>

<p>What does it mean to know a word? Is it picking out the right meaning from a choice of four? Using the word correctly in conversation? Is it giving an appropriate definition? The delineation between not knowing and knowing a word’s meaning is not always clear, which is reflective of the dynamic nature of word knowledge. To capture the shades of gray in word knowledge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525740110387129">Dale (1965</xref>, p. 898) proposed a continuum involving the following stages: (a) “I never saw the word before”; (b) “I know there is such a word, but I don’t know what it means”; (c) I have “a vague contextual placement of the word”; and (d) I have the meaning of the word “pinned down.” In their studies of word knowledge in adult language users, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525740110387129">Durso and Shore (1991)</xref> preferred a classification scheme that assumed three levels of word knowledge: unknown, frontier, and complete. They used the <italic>frontier</italic> label to describe words that were familiar, related to a specific episodic context, but could not be defined. In the present study, the <italic>frontier</italic> label was adopted. Although these stages may not completely capture the word learning process in a detailed way, they do allow consideration of what has been termed <italic>partial word knowledge</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387129">Schwanenflugel, Stahl, &amp; McFalls, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740110387129">Wagovich &amp; Newhoff, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of partial word knowledge is associated with the type of information that is involved with knowing a word, specifically, phonological, semantic, syntactic, morphologic, and (in literate individuals) orthographic information. Current models of lexical processing and access assume that these components are separate, yet neurologically interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525740110387129">Caramazza, 1997</xref>). Because of the separate nature of word components, individuals may have the feeling of having heard a word but are unsure of its meaning (e.g., Dale’s Stage 2). Or, individuals may know exactly the meaning of what they want to say but cannot find the right word (i.e., tip of the tongue phenomenon). With repeated exposures across multiple contexts, the phonological, semantic, syntactic, morphologic, and orthographic features of words become more strongly connected and result in what is outwardly observed as complete word knowledge.</p>

<title>Word Learning in Reading</title>
<sec id="section2-1525740110387129">
<title>Typically Developing Children</title>
<p>In the early years of vocabulary development, word learning occurs through the oral-auditory channel. In the upper elementary grades, word learning also occurs through the visual channel during reading. Without any kind of instruction or guidance, children are able to learn words as they read silently for enjoyment or for school-related assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740110387129">Nagy &amp; Herman, 1987</xref>). Nagy and his colleagues found that after one pass of reading a grade-level passage without explicit instruction, 418 typical third, fifth, and seventh graders had a .05 chance of learning a word from context, as measured through correct response on a multiple choice task. A later meta-analysis calculated a higher probability of .15 for learning words incidentally from context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740110387129">Swanborn &amp; de Glopper, 1999</xref>). This initial probability of learning a word appears quite low, underscoring that word learning is a gradual process and that multiple encounters are needed for complete word learning. Considering the number of words that children are exposed to during reading throughout the year, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740110387129">Nagy, Anderson, and Herman (1987)</xref> calculated that a typical fifth-grade child would learn approximately 800 to 1,200 words per year from reading alone.</p>
<p>The growth of partial word knowledge during reading has been demonstrated in several studies of elementary and middle school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740110387129">Nagy, Herman, &amp; Anderson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387129">Schwanenflugel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740110387129">Swanborn &amp; de Glopper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740110387129">Wagovich &amp; Newhoff, 2004</xref>). Relevant findings emerged from these studies, which assessed the dynamic nature of word learning with a variety of tasks, including checklists, multiple choice questions, interviews, and definitions. Children as young as fourth-grade gain partial word knowledge through exposure to words during incidental reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387129">Schwanenflugel et al., 1997</xref>). Following one exposure to target words, children showed improved word discrimination but not improved syntactic, general semantic, or detailed semantic word knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740110387129">Wagovich &amp; Newhoff, 2004</xref>). In other words, children showed the most basic step from not knowing a word (Dale’s Stage 1) to recognizing the word (Dale’s Stage 2) after one exposure during reading. Furthermore, this vocabulary growth occurs differentially, depending on individual word factors. Specifically, words that are concrete, are nouns, and have high imageability are related to stronger vocabulary growth after minimal exposure during reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740110387129">Schwanenflugel et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis of the content of the students’ definitions has also provided insight into partial word knowledge growth during reading. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525740110387129">Fukkink, Blok, and de Glopper (2001)</xref> tested 30 students in second, fourth, and sixth grades. Students were read a short passage containing 12 abstract and concrete words whose meanings were implied but not explicitly defined in the text. After listening to the passage, the students provided definitions that were scored according to percentage of correct attributes, presence of false attributes, and contextualization (whether the definition included specific words from the original context). Analysis of the content of the students’ definitions indicated that younger children included more false attributes in their definitions than older children. The meanings of abstract words were more difficult to understand from the text, and children of all ages included more false attributes in those definitions. Finally, the researchers observed that many definitions related specifically to the context provided in the text. Thus, students’ initial hypotheses of words’ meanings may be only partially correct and are likely to be tied to the specific context in which they were read. As children gain word knowledge, they must unlearn false attributes, learn correct attributes, and decontextualize the meaning.</p>
<p>Thus, reading is an important area for children to independently build complete and partial word knowledge. Over the course of an academic year, typical children read thousands of unknown and partially known words, and they gradually refine their understanding to exclude false attributes and include correct attributes. This growth of partial word knowledge cannot be assessed through static measures of vocabulary, such as the common “Show me X” picture-pointing format. The studies described here used multiple and complementary methods for assessing word knowledge, including checklists, oral definitions, and multiple choice tasks. Relevant to this study, a more thorough analysis of children’s errors in these tasks may also be helpful for understanding the development of word knowledge in children with language learning disability (LLD).</p>

<title>Children With Language and Reading Disability</title>
<p>Although typically developing children are able to learn new word meanings through reading, children with reading and language disorders are not as successful inferring new word meaning from written contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525740110387129">Cain, Oakhill, &amp; Elbro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525740110387129">Steele &amp; Watkins, 2010</xref>). A meta-analysis of 20 experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740110387129">Swanborn &amp; de Glopper, 1999</xref>) suggested that students of differing ability levels learn words in the same way, although their rate of learning differs.</p>
<p>More recent research has found that differences in text may affect good and poor readers’ ability to construct meaning for unknown words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525740110387129">Cain et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525740110387129">Cain, Oakhill, &amp; Lemmon, 2004</xref>). Two groups of 7- to 8-year-old children, totaling 30 participants, were matched for word decoding skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525740110387129">Cain et al., 2003</xref>). One group had good reading comprehension and the other had poor reading comprehension. The materials in this study differed from previous experiments that used natural reading contexts in that children read original passages containing nonsense words with novel meanings. The words’ meanings were explained through context that was either directly adjacent to the words or later in the text. Learning was measured through participants’ definitions of the novel words, scored on a scale of 0 to 2. The good and poor comprehenders performed similarly when the informative context was directly adjacent to the word. However, the poor comprehenders performed more poorly when the informative context was presented later in the text. In a later investigation, Cain and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525740110387129">2004</xref>) determined that learning differences between adjacent and far contexts were not the result of short-term memory differences or memory for the content of the passages. However, working memory, as measured through listening span and counting span tasks, did distinguish children with good comprehension from children with poor comprehension.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525740110387129">Steele and Watkins (2010)</xref> found that children with language-based learning disabilities also experienced difficulty inferring novel word meaning from text. They examined word learning in 9- to 11-year-old children with LLD and typically developing same-age peers. The children read four passages containing nonsense words, whose meanings could be inferred from the reading passage. The nonsense words appeared either two or five times. In addition, informative context was either directly following the target word in the adjacent context or separated by one neutral sentence from the target word in the nonadjacent context. Word learning was assessed with a dynamic assessment including (a) oral definition interview with graduated prompting, (b) oral definition given contextual clues, and (c) a multiple choice task. Findings indicated that children with LLD performed more poorly than age-matched peers on both oral definition and multiple choice tasks. Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525740110387129">Cain et al. (2003)</xref>, closer position of informative context was not associated with greater word learning. In addition, the number of exposures and part of speech (noun or verb) did not affect word-learning performance for either group. Methodological differences in participant selection, nonsense word construction, and reading passage construction may account for these differences.</p>
<p>Thus, children with LLD and reading comprehension delays are not able to infer the meanings of new words from reading at the same level as typically developing children, even when matched for decoding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525740110387129">Cain et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525740110387129">Cain et al., 2004</xref>). Following these findings, an important question remains: If children with LLD are not learning the correct meaning, what, if anything, are they learning about words?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1525740110387129">
<title>Errors in Word Learning</title>
<p>Early studies of oral word learning were primarily concerned with whether children with LLD learned word meanings and whether they performed similarly to their typically developing peers. Looking more deeply at the types of errors that children make when labeling items, more recent studies have provided some insight into the partial word learning process for children with LLD.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525740110387129">Lahey and Edwards (1999)</xref> examined the type of naming errors that children with LLD made during the picture naming task of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525740110387129">Lahey &amp; Edwards, 1996</xref>). It is not surprising that they found that children with LLD made more errors than control participants without impairments. More specific, the children with LLD made more semantic-associated errors (i.e., providing a word related semantically to the target word) and, to a lesser degree, they made more phonological errors than their typically developing peers. The researchers offered several possible explanations for the observed pattern of errors, including diffuse mental representation, poorly differentiated lexical items, or poorly organized mental representations of children with LLD.</p>
<p>Weak or diffuse semantic representations resulting from impaired ability to store semantic information have been suggested by other researchers as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525740110387129">Alt, Plante, &amp; Creusere, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740110387129">McGregor, Newman, Reilly, &amp; Capone, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740110387129">McGregor et al. (2002)</xref> studied the semantic representation of age-appropriate words by 16 school-age children with LLD and 16 typically developing control children who were between 5 and 8 years old. Children named, provided definitions, and drew stimulus words. Naming errors were coded as semantically related, indeterminate, or phonologically similar. Results showed that the complexity of the children’s drawings revealed a continuum, from no knowledge to minimal knowledge to complete knowledge. The LLD group made more naming errors than the control group, and both groups made more semantically related errors than other error types. In addition, for both groups, words that were incorrectly named received lower drawing scores and lower definition scores. The authors concluded that retrieval of known information could not account for their findings. Rather, the errors in naming were interpreted to be the result of sparse or missing semantic representations for these age-appropriate words.</p>
<p>Additional evidence has supported the hypothesis of poor representation of the semantic features of words. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525740110387129">Alt et al. (2004)</xref> recruited 52 children between 4 and 6 years old with and without LLD to participate in their study. They explicitly taught semantic features of 12 nonsense words through an interactive computer program. For nouns, children with LLD received a lower score than the children who were typically developing for every semantic feature tested. For verbs, children with LLD received a lower score for the sound feature only. Children were also asked to recognize the correct pronunciation of the words from a group of four and to produce the label for the words. Unlike typically developing children, children with LLD were just as likely to choose the correct label as any of the three foils (two were phonologically related and one was phonologically unrelated). The authors interpreted this finding as an indication that the children with LLD had weak phonological representation of the word labels. However, the problems went beyond merely learning the labels for words; they also showed an impaired ability to acquire the details of word meanings.</p>
<p>These studies suggest that children with LLD have primary difficulties learning semantic information, in addition to phonological information. Furthermore, the locus of difficulty may be in learning or storing phonological and semantic information, rather than retrieval of information, for words learned through the oral-auditory channel. These results have important implications for how best to address the word learning challenges of children with LLD. Additional information about the kinds of errors that older children make during reading would be a helpful addition to this body of literature and would allow speech-language pathologists and other educators to make informed decisions about appropriate intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1525740110387129">
<title>Study Questions</title>
<p>The aim of the current study was to better understand the process of word learning during reading for children with LLD through examination of their errors in an oral definition task. This method looked at word learning from a different perspective. Rather than investigating errors in labels, errors in expressive content knowledge were addressed through analysis of oral definitions. The following questions were posed:</p>
<list id="list1-1525740110387129" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What types of oral definition errors do children with LLD and same-age typically developing peers make in a novel word-learning task?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are different patterns of oral definition errors observed in children with LLD and same-age typically developing peers?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are different patterns of oral definition errors observed for frontier words and unknown words in children with LLD and same-age typically developing peers?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Children with LLD were expected to show a different pattern of errors from typical children. Considering the word learning difficulty for children with LLD, more responses that were unrelated to the target word were expected. On the other hand, typically developing children were expected to show proportionally more errors that were more closely related semantically and syntactically to the target definition. For both groups of children, definitions of frontier words were expected to show more errors that were related to the target definition.</p>

<title>Children with language learning disability</title>
<p>Fifteen children in Grades 4 and 5 with an age range of 9 years 11 months to 11 years 5 months (<italic>M</italic> = 10 years 7 months) were included in the LLD group. Children in the LLD group had an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for special education services. In this particular school district, children with LLD who received academic support for language from a special education teacher would not receive duplicate support from the speech-language pathologist. School personnel indicated that this practice was to provide services in the least restrictive environment (M. Henning, M. Johnson, &amp; T. Niccum, personal communication, February 13, 2008). Thus, all of the participants had a language learning disability, but their services were provided by either the speech-language pathologist or the special education teacher, but not both. The LLD group included children with expressive-only and mixed receptive-expressive language impairment. They had typical hearing, no neurological problems (such as epilepsy or traumatic brain injury), and adequate speech intelligibility, determined through teacher report of school records and observation. It is clear that the children with LLD were a heterogeneous group, which does reflect a typical school caseload. However, the heterogeneity and small sample size also will prohibit generalizing of findings to a broader population.</p>

<title>Reading passages</title>
<p>Four original reading passages, approximately one page long, double spaced, without illustrations, were written for the larger study. The Flesch-Kincaid readability formula (calculated automatically within the spelling and grammar function of Microsoft Word) was used to rate three passages at a first-grade level and one at a second-grade level. The passages were written such that the context provided information about each target word; however, there were no devices used to draw attention to the informative context (e.g., “For example . . .” or “This word means . . .”). Instead, the participants were required to infer, or draw conclusions about, the meanings of the words from the passages.</p>
<p>Target words were 20 one-syllable nonsense words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525740110387129">Balota et al., 2002</xref>), with five target words per reading passage. To control for position of words within sentences, each target word was placed as the last word in the sentence in which it first appeared. Explicit informative context appeared only once, after the first presentation of each target word. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525740110387129">Steele and Watkins (2010)</xref> for more detailed information on passage construction and target word information. A sample reading passage is included in the appendix.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1525740110387129">
<title>Oral definition assessment</title>
<p>The definition assessment was completed orally. Each target word was written on a 4 × 6 note card and shown to the participants. The following questions were used to elicit responses: “Can you say this word?” and “Can you tell me what X means?” Additional prompts, adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740110387129">Nagy et al. (1985)</xref>, were provided as needed to elicit the most information that the participants could express. Specifically, if participants gave an incomplete response, they were told, “That’s part of it. Can you tell me something else about X?” If a vague definition was given, they were asked, “Can you tell me more or give me an example?” If participants refused to answer or did not know, they were asked, “Does X remind you of anything?” Given these prompts, the most accurate and complete responses were analyzed. For example, consider a child who gave a vague response and was prompted for more information. If the child responded to the prompt with “I don’t know,” the vague response would be analyzed, since it was more complete and accurate than “I don’t know.” In the original study, additional contextual clue prompts were given if needed; however, responses following contextual clues were not analyzed for this study. Responses were orthographically transcribed in real time by the first author, who later scored the responses using a 3-point scale. For reliability, a second examiner, a doctoral student in speech and hearing science who was trained in the scoring system, scored 20% of the definitions (100 words). Reliability of 91% was obtained for use of the oral definition scoring rubric. Scoring information and examples are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1525740110387129">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Multiple choice assessment</title>
<p>A written multiple choice task was given following the oral definition assessment. The format for the multiple choice items was adapted from that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740110387129">Wagovich and Newhoff (2004)</xref>. Each target word was presented in the phrase, “What is the closest meaning for the word X?” Four choices followed, including (a) correct syntactic category and correct semantic information, (b) correct syntactic category and incorrect semantic information, (c) incorrect syntactic category and incorrect semantic information, and (d) none of the above. All of the options were thematically related to the topic of the reading passage. The order of the first three choices was randomized across items. The “none of the above” option always appeared as choice d. For example, the meaning for the word <italic>zear</italic> was a game similar to bowling. The options were (a) to bowl, (b) to clean up, (c) nasty, and (d) none of the above.</p>

<title>Error Response Categories</title>
<sec id="section18-1525740110387129">
<title>Study Question 1: What patterns of error responses were observed for the two groups?</title>
<p>To answer this question, definitions that were not completely correct (received fewer than the full 3 points) were examined, resulting in the identification of two broad response types: associated and unrelated. <italic>Associated</italic> responses bore some relationship to the target definition, showing that the participant had gained partial word knowledge. <italic>Unrelated</italic> responses were errors whose content was not related to the target definition. Participants displaying these errors did not show that they had gained any new information about the target word. The children with LLD had 212 (85.83%) unrelated error responses and 35 associated errors (14.17%). The typically developing group had 64 (41.83%) unrelated responses and 89 (58.17%) associated responses. Because the data were non-normally distributed categorical variables, a nonparametric analysis was conducted. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test confirmed a significant group difference (<italic>z</italic> = −4.133, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The mean rank was 22.13 for the LLD group and 8.87 for the typical group. Overall, the children with LLD produced more unrelated responses compared to the children who were typically developing.</p>
<p>The broad categories of unrelated and associated responses were further divided into subcategories. Identified were four unrelated subcategories—indeterminate, false, sentence, and phonological—and three associated subcategories—semantic, syntactic, and substitution. All errors fell within one of these seven subcategories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1525740110387129">Table 4</xref> for definitions and examples). A second examiner, a 2nd-year graduate student in communication sciences and disorders, was trained in use of the category system until reaching 95% reliability with the first author. The second examiner then independently scored 20% of the oral definition errors using the subcategory system. Reliability of 88% for use of the subcategory system was obtained.</p>

<title>Frontier and Unknown Words</title>
<sec id="section22-1525740110387129">
<title>Study Question 3: Were different error patterns observed for frontier words compared to unknown words?</title>
<p>The determination of frontier word knowledge is difficult. As previously noted, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525740110387129">Durso and Shore (1991)</xref> used the term <italic>frontier word</italic> to describe words that participants could not define but found familiar, indicating partial word knowledge. Other researchers have used discrimination of target words from nonsense words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740110387129">Wagovich &amp; Newhoff, 2004</xref>) and correct multiple choice responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740110387129">Nagy et al., 1987</xref>) as indicators of partial or complete word knowledge. For the current study, <italic>frontier words</italic> were defined as those for which the participants incorrectly responded on the oral definition task but correctly responded on the multiple choice task. <italic>Unknown words</italic> were defined as those for which the participants incorrectly responded on both tasks. <italic>Known words</italic> were those words for which participants correctly responded on both tasks. Since the current study investigated definition errors, known words were not analyzed. Thus, definitions of words for which participants correctly responded on the multiple choice task (i.e., frontier words) were compared to definitions of words for which participants incorrectly responded on the multiple choice task (i.e., unknown words). Each participant had a unique set of words that were unknown or frontier.</p>
<p>First, a broad analysis was conducted using the larger associated and unrelated categories. For unknown words, the LLD group had 112 (88.89%) unrelated responses and 14 (11.11%) associated responses, and the typically developing group had 24 (72.73%) unrelated responses and 9 (27.27%) associated responses. Thus, as would be expected, both groups produced more unrelated responses for unknown words. There was no significant group difference for proportion of associated and unrelated responses for unknown words (<italic>z</italic> = −.088, <italic>p</italic> = .935). For frontier words, the LLD group had 100 (82.64%) unrelated responses and 21 (17.35%) associated responses, and the typically developing group had 65 (54.17%) unrelated responses and 55 (45.83%) associated responses. These results indicated a significant group difference (<italic>z</italic> = −4.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The LLD group produced a similar proportion of unrelated responses for frontier and unknown words, whereas the typically developing group produced relatively more associated responses for frontier words. It should be noted that even for frontier words, the majority of error responses for both groups were unrelated.</p>
<p>The subcategories of error responses were also analyzed to compare frontier to unknown words within each group. The file was split by group, and the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was conducted. The dependent variables were proportions of error responses for each subcategory for frontier words and unknown words (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1525740110387129">Table 6</xref> for number and proportions of errors for frontier and unknown words). For the LLD group, there were no significant differences in error response patterns for frontier and unknown words: indeterminate (<italic>z</italic> = −.039, <italic>p</italic> = .969), false (<italic>z</italic> = −.314, <italic>p</italic> = .754), sentence (<italic>z</italic> = −.135, <italic>p</italic> = .893), phonological (<italic>z</italic> = −.663, <italic>p</italic> = .507), semantic (<italic>z</italic> = −.454, <italic>p</italic> = .650), syntactic (<italic>z</italic> = −1.633, <italic>p</italic> = .102), and substitution (<italic>z</italic> = −.405, <italic>p</italic> = .686). For the typical group, a significant difference in error response patterns for frontier and unknown words was found only for the syntactic (<italic>z</italic> = −2.684, <italic>p</italic> = .007) error category, although substitution errors approached significance (<italic>z</italic> = −1.913, <italic>p</italic> = .056). Syntactic and substitution errors were more frequent with frontier words. No significant difference in error response patterns was found for indeterminate (<italic>z</italic> = −.773, <italic>p</italic> = .440), false (<italic>z</italic> = −1.067, <italic>p</italic> = .286), sentence (<italic>z</italic> = −1.000, <italic>p</italic> = .317), phonological (<italic>z</italic> = −.365, <italic>p</italic> = .715), and semantic (<italic>z</italic> = −1.869, <italic>p</italic> = .062).</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>Results from the primary study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525740110387129">Steele &amp; Watkins, 2010</xref>) indicated that, overall, children with LLD learned the meanings of fewer words during an incidental reading task compared to their typical peers, as shown by lower oral definition and multiple choice scores. This study sought to extend those findings by determining whether children with LLD made similar types of errors in oral definitions of newly learned words compared to typically developing children. In general, the results suggested that when the children with LLD were wrong, it was sometimes for different reasons from the typical group. The pattern of oral definition errors and the comparison of oral definition errors to multiple choice responses can be interpreted to indicate that children with LLD made fewer gains in partial word knowledge than their typical peers.</p>
<p>Specifically, children with LLD produced more responses that were sentences containing the target word (e.g., “She <italic>pive</italic>”), rather than definitions of the target word. Also, compared to the typical group, they produced more res- ponses that were related phonologically to the target word (e.g., “<italic>Beal–bell</italic>”). On the other hand, the typically developing children more frequently made errors in syntax while maintaining the correct semantic meaning (e.g., “Eating their afternoon snack” for “afternoon snack”). The typical children also substituted one target definition for another more often than the LLD group (e.g., substituting <italic>wock</italic> for <italic>beal</italic>). Despite these differences, the two groups expressed similar proportions of errors that were indeterminate, false, and semantic.</p>

<title>Group Similarities</title>
<p>The most common error response for both groups was saying some form of “I don’t know.” The proportion of this response did not differ between groups, although it did approach significance (<italic>p</italic> = .055). The frequency of this indeterminate response would suggest that the children did not map or remember enough information to provide an oral definition. The second most common error for both groups was a false response, in which the given definition bore no observable relation to the target definition. In other words, their answer was simply wrong. Again, the proportion of this response did not differ between groups. This finding was not completely unexpected, as previous studies have indicated that several encounters with words across different contexts are needed for children to learn word meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740110387129">Nagy et al., 1987</xref>) and that little specific semantic information is gained during brief exposures to words in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740110387129">Wagovich &amp; Newhoff, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of children’s definitions following minimal exposure to novel words during a story listening task has shown that inclusion of false attributes in definitions is a common occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525740110387129">Fukkink et al., 2001</xref>). The methodology of this study does not answer why children would have difficulty supplying a correct definition. Further research will be needed to determine whether the word-learning breakdown resulted from difficulty identifying the novel word as an unknown word in the passage, problems inferring the meaning of the word from the passage, or difficulty remembering the meaning of the word.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1525740110387129">
<title>Group Differences</title>
<p>Group comparisons were limited by the small sample sizes of the groups, requiring caution in generalizing findings to a broader group. However, in this study, children with LLD responded differently from their typical peers in several ways. The typical peers made relatively more semantic substitution and syntactic errors, and the children with LLD made more phonological and sentence errors. The typical group’s third most common error response was a semantic substitution, in which the definition for a different target word was given (i.e., a right definition for a wrong word). This may indicate that these children were able to infer semantic information but were not able to connect that information to the orthography of the target word. Similarly, syntactic errors also indicated that children were able to infer semantic information about the word, albeit without the appropriate syntactic information. Although technically considered errors, the substitution and syntactic responses indicated that partial word learning had occurred. Furthermore, the group differences were suggestive of the typically developing children’s relative skill in inferring information from the text, a skill that may be more limited in children with LLD.</p>
<p>On the other hand, children with LLD more frequently responded with phonological associations and sentence definitions, compared to their typical peers. It should be noted that these error patterns were infrequently used by children with LLD. Interpretation of phonological and sentence errors is difficult. One hypothesis would be the use of phonological association in the absence of any semantic information. Thus, when a child with LLD was asked to provide a definition but had no semantic information available, that child may have proceeded to a close phonological relative for which he or she had a semantic representation. Further research is required to test this hypothesis. In the sentence definition error, children used the target word in a sentence without defining the word. For example, when asked what <italic>tean</italic> meant, one child said, “She’s done <italic>tean</italic>.” This type of response may have been given by children who did not infer enough information to provide a definition but desired to provide a response other than “I don’t know.” Or, this error also may have indicated a problem in definitional skill, which has been shown to be an area of difficulty for children with LLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525740110387129">Marinellie &amp; Johnson, 2002</xref>). These speculations will need to be addressed by further research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1525740110387129">
<title>Partially Known Words</title>
<p>It is not surprising that typically developing children made more partial word knowledge gains, in addition to more complete word knowledge gains. This conclusion was drawn from two major findings. First, the majority of responses (85.83%) in the LLD group were unrelated to the target definition, whereas more than half (58.17%) of the typical group’s responses were associated. Thus, at this broad level of comparison, the typical children were seen to produce significantly more responses that were semantically related to the target definition, which is suggestive of greater growth in partial word knowledge. The investigation into more specific error types, in which the typically developing children produced more substitution and syntactic error types, also supported the conclusion of partial word knowledge. Second, the results of the analysis comparing frontier words to unknown words further supported the finding of greater growth in partial word knowledge for the typical children. Recall that frontier words were defined as those words for which children responded incorrectly on the oral definition task but correctly on the multiple choice task. Typically developing children more frequently responded with a substitution or syntactic definition error for frontier words.</p>
<p>An interesting and unexpected result was that children with LLD showed no difference in error types between frontier and unknown words. Because children with LLD scored above chance levels on the multiple choice assessment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525740110387129">Steele &amp; Watkins, 2010</xref>), this finding cannot be completely explained by random guessing. Again, broad conclusions must be tempered by the small sample size. However, one possibility may be that children had difficulty recalling the correct meaning. The oral definition task may have been so difficult that they were not able to adequately present their knowledge in this expressive task. Expressive language delays were a likely contributor to their poor performance on the oral definition task. Using Dale’s steps of knowing a word to compare the two groups, it may be that the typically developing children were higher on the continuum, such as Stage 3 (i.e., “I recognize the word and know it has something to do with . . .”), whereas the children with LLD were lower on the continuum, such as Stage 2 (i.e., “I recognize it, but I don’t know what it means.”). These hypotheses require further investigation.</p>

<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>One of the main findings, supported by previous research, was that after minimal exposure to novel words, children with LLD gain very little information and in many instances gain incorrect information. Thus, clinicians are advised to provide frequent encounters with words to learn their meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525740110387129">Jenkins, Stein, &amp; Wysocki, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525740110387129">Rice, Oetting, Marquis, Bode, &amp; Pae, 1994</xref>). Complete word learning occurs when children are able to decontextualize the word’s meaning from the initial context in which it occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525740110387129">Fukkink et al., 2001</xref>). Also, children must unlearn false attributes they have assigned to words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525740110387129">Fukkink et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1525740110387129">Stahl and Fairbanks’s (1986)</xref> meta-analysis on vocabulary interventions pointed to multiple exposures to words across multiple contexts as a primary component of successful vocabulary interventions for typical children. Clinicians may accommodate this need by using classroom vocabulary items, preteaching core curricular vocabulary, and collaborating with classroom teachers to provide contextually rich, multiple exposures to target vocabulary items.</p>
<p>Unlike the typically developing groups, some children in the LLD group used the target word in a sentence when asked to provide a definition. Previous research has also indicated that children with LLD produce less mature definitions than their typically developing peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525740110387129">Marinellie &amp; Johnson, 2002</xref>). These results pointed to the need for intervention in appropriate definition form for some children with LLD. Definition skill is a functional goal because elementary-age students are often asked to provide definitions as a way to measure their understanding of curricular vocabulary. In fact, an assessment of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525740110387129">Illinois Learning Standards (2008)</xref> for Grades 4 through 6 requires students to explain vocabulary words completely and accurately. In addition, the ability to provide a definition requires a strong understanding of the meanings of words and the metalinguistic ability to reflect on the needs of one’s communication partner. Intervention in definitions should be embedded into a vocabulary program, rather than taught as a splinter skill.</p>
<p>A final implication is the need for dynamic assessment to show growth in partial word knowledge. Clinicians are advised to consider alternative assessments, including dynamic assessment, for children who come from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525740110387129">Gutiérrez-Clellen &amp; Peña, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525740110387129">Laing &amp; Kamhi, 2003</xref>), although its use is helpful for determining a more complete picture of children’s abilities regardless of background. Graduated prompting is one type of dynamic assessment that may be used for inferring novel word meanings from context. For example, after reading a passage containing real, novel words, a student’s proficiency could be determined through a hierarchy of tasks, including (a) oral definition without assistance, (b) oral definition with questions to elicit more information, (c) oral definition with a contextual clue, and (d) choosing the correct definition from a field of possibilities. Following the suggestion of Laing and Kamhi, scoring would follow the number of prompts given. A score of 4 would be given for a correct answer in Step a, 3 for a correct answer with Step b, 2 for a correct answer with Step c, and 1 for a correct answer with Step d. Using the error categories from this study as a framework, clinicians may also gauge what types of errors children make. It should be noted that dynamic and informal assessments are only one component of a complete investigation into a child’s language abilities. However, these types of assessments may help speech-language pathologists monitor progress in a more detailed manner, predict performance with instruction, and identify appropriate instructional techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525740110387129">Laing &amp; Kamhi, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study analyzed oral definition responses to gain greater understanding of the types of errors that children with LLD make when learning the meanings of novel words. Although the results were limited by a small sample size, relevant findings emerged that may drive future research efforts. Children with LLD and typically developing children made many similar errors, but they also differed significantly in some categories. These differences in the pattern of errors and the comparison of errors to multiple choice responses suggested that children with LLD made fewer gains in partial word knowledge, compared to their typically developing peers. Further research will be needed to address growth of partial word knowledge more comprehensively and to determine intervention strategies that improve both partial and complete word learning during reading for upper elementary children.</p>

<title>Appendix</title>
<p>My school is too far away to walk to. I get there on a <bold>marn (high, nonadjacent)</bold>. I wish I could walk to school like some kids do. <italic>In the morning, I stand and wait to be picked up</italic>. The doors of the <bold>marn</bold> open and I get in and find a seat by my friend. Then the <bold>marn</bold> has to go pick up other people, too. Finally, the <bold>marn</bold> drops us off at school. I go to the playground to play with my friends. We like to play soccer and kickball. Sometimes we <bold>jine (low, adjacent)</bold>. <italic>We line up and take off as fast as our feet can go</italic>. When we <bold>jine</bold>, I usually lose. If I keep trying, I know I will get faster. Usually we can only play for a few minutes. Then the bell rings. It’s time to go inside.</p>
<p>In my classroom, my desk is in the very front, next to the window. Mrs. C, my teacher, put me in the front because I talk too much when I sit in the back. First, Mrs. C takes attendance and does the lunch count. Then we listen to announcements. Then it’s time for math. We are learning how to multiply and divide. I like math because I’m good at it. But my favorite is <bold>moof (low, nonadjacent)</bold>. Mr. M comes three times a week to teach us. <italic>We get to paint and to make things out of clay</italic>. When we don’t have <bold>moof</bold>, we have P.E. This week, we <bold>zear (high, adjacent)</bold>. <italic>We roll the ball and try to knock down the pins</italic>. Sometimes when I <bold>zear</bold>, I only knock down one or two. But next time we <bold>zear</bold>, I will knock them all down at once. At least I am going to try. It gets very loud in the gym when we <bold>zear</bold>. Everyone is cheering and shouting. I have so much fun when we <bold>zear</bold>.</p>
<p>After school, my brothers and sister and I go to the after-school program. First, we sit down and we <bold>sape</bold>. It’s usually something gross. <italic>But I eat the snack anyways because I’m hungry</italic>. After we <bold>sape</bold>, we do our homework. Then, we can do lots of different things. We can read or draw or play games. We stay at the after-school program for an hour. I am so happy when my dad picks us up! That means I don’t have to take the <bold>marn</bold> home.</p>
<p>Note: For review, the target words are in bold with informative context in italics. The word conditions (adjacent, nonadjacent, high, low) are in parentheses following the target word. In the participant version, this information was not included and all text was in normal font.</p>
