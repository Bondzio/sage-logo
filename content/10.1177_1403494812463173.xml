<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Good eating practices during childhood promote optimal growth and cognitive development, and may help prevent the metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812463173">1</xref>]. Children spend a large part of their day in school. More than 80% of Danish children attend municipal schools and, according to a national Danish survey, children aged 8–14 years consume 40–45% of their daily energy intake during school hours and after school activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812463173">2</xref>]. Consequently, municipal schools are a highly relevant setting for nutritional interventions to optimise development and prevent later disease. Also, this setting offers the opportunity to reach all children regardless of ethnic and socioeconomic background.</p>
<p>Compared to other Nordic countries, very few schools in Denmark offer school meals, so most Danish children rely on packed lunches brought from home. Recent data suggest that lunch packs and snacks eaten in school by 8–10-year-old Danish children should include more wholegrain foods, fruit, vegetables, and fish, and less sugar and salt in order to fulfil the dietary guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812463173">2</xref>]. Whole grains, fruits and berries, root vegetables, cabbage, legumes, game, seaweed, fish, nuts, and rapeseed oil are characteristic foods of the Nordic countries. In parallel with the Mediterranean diet, these foods may improve cognitive function and prevent cancers and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812463173">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812463173"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812463173"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812463173">6</xref>] which account for about 43% of all deaths worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812463173">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812463173">8</xref>]. Recently, consumption of traditional Nordic foods has been associated with reduced mortality in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812463173">9</xref>] and a few randomised trials in high-risk persons have shown improvements in cardiovascular risk markers with diets high in Nordic foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812463173">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812463173">11</xref>]. Additionally, eating foods from one’s own geographical region may reduce the environmental burden of transport and production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812463173">3</xref>].</p>
<p>A number of multicomponent school-based interventions have been conducted mainly to reduce the prevalence of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812463173">12</xref>]. Most school interventions have made nutritional improvements through modification of existing menus and school lunches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812463173">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812463173"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812463173"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812463173"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812463173"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812463173"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812463173">19</xref>] or increased availability of fruit and vegetables (for review see Knai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812463173">20</xref>]), in combination with physical activity and nutrition education. To our knowledge, no randomised controlled trial has assessed the impact of introducing a full meal concept covering lunch and all snacks during the school day, while at the same time performing careful measurements of children’s dietary intake, nutrient status, physical activity, health, and cognitive function.</p>

<title>Aim</title>
<p>This paper describes the rationale and design of the Optimal well-being, development and health for Danish children through a healthy New Nordic Diet (OPUS) School Meal Study. The study was a comprehensive randomised trial assessing the impact of serving school meals based on the New Nordic Diet (NND) on dietary intake and nutrient status, growth, early disease risk markers, wellbeing and absence from school, cognitive function, food waste, and cost, as well as social and cultural features of the school meal intervention.</p>
<p>OPUS School Meal Study is part of the OPUS Centre, which also investigates the effect of the NND on body weight and risk of lifestyle diseases in adults. Nutritionally, OPUS is inspired by the pan-European multicentre study DIOGenes that investigated the effect of protein and glycaemic index on obesity and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812463173">21</xref>].</p>

<title>Study design and recruitment</title>
<p>OPUS School Meal Study was a cluster-randomised controlled unblinded cross-over study. For two 3-month periods during the school year 2011–12, children received school meals based on the NND and their usual packed lunch (control) in random order. A number of measurements were performed at baseline, at month 3 by the end of the first dietary period, and at month 6 by the end of the second dietary period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494812463173">Figure 1</xref>). As the schools joined the study one by one, the first dietary period began between August and December 2011, and data collection ended in June 2012.</p>

<p>Children from 46 school classes (3rd and 4th grades) at nine Danish schools were invited to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria for each school were: (1) location in the eastern part of Denmark (Zealand and Lolland-Falster); (2) at least four classes in total at 3rd or 4th grade; (3) suitable kitchen facilities available for food production during the school day; and (4) a high motivation for participation, as determined by the study team. When more than nine schools were eligible for participation, we took logistical matters such as geographical distance and distribution into consideration. Moreover, our aim was that ≥50% of the schools should belong to municipalities where (a) the equivalence-weighted income with net interest was below the national mean for families with children and (b) the percentage of households in which the adults had only a short school education (≤10 years) was above the national mean for families with children, as defined by Statistics Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812463173">22</xref>]. Exclusion criteria for the children were diseases or conditions that might obstruct the measurements or put the children at risk if eating the diet (e.g. strong mental handicaps, severe nutrient malabsorption, and strong food intolerances or allergies, where the family had been told by a doctor that the child would be at risk of anaphylactic shock) and concomitant participation in other scientific studies that involved radiation or blood sampling.</p>
<p>Initially contact was established with 39 schools from the eastern part of Denmark. Thirty-three of the schools were contacted by telephone by a study investigator who had a strong network within Danish municipal schools; six schools contacted the project on their own initiative. Nine of the schools were included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1403494812463173">Figure 2</xref>); three of the schools were from municipalities with a low-income level and a low level of education among families with children. Written information about the study was sent to the families of all 3rd and 4th graders and the families were invited to an information meeting. In order to include families of various socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, several information meetings were held at each school; reminders were sent out through the school’s intranet and, when relevant, language interpreters translated at the meetings. Children from the 3rd or 4th grades were selected in order to intervene at an early age at which anthropometry and blood values would not be influenced by puberty for most of the children, yet be old enough to participate in the measurements without their parents being present.</p>

<p>Due to the cross-over design, all participating children received school meals based on NND for 3 months and their usual packed lunch (control) for another 3 months, in random order.

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1403494812463173-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>Written informed consent was obtained from all custody holders of the child, along with a screening questionnaire including questions on specific dietary needs related to allergies, intolerances, or religion. Custody holders of the children who withdrew without explanation received a questionnaire about reasons for drop out. The study protocol was approved by the Regional Research Ethics Committee (H-1-2010-124) and the trial was registered in the database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (no. NCT 01457794).</p>

<sec id="section5-1403494812463173">
<title>Randomisation</title>
<p>The nine schools were randomly assigned to the order in which the classes would receive NND or control by use of R statistical software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>). Randomisation was performed in clusters corresponding to year group, so that all 3rd-grade classes at a particular school received the NND and control in the same order, and the 4th-grade classes at that school received the NND and control in the opposite order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494812463173">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-1403494812463173">
<title>Dietary intervention</title>
<p>During the 3-month NND period, the children were served a mid-morning snack, an ad-libitum hot lunch meal and an afternoon snack. Twice a week dessert was served, consisting either of fresh fruit or of a fruit-based dessert. The meals were free of charge for all children and produced locally at each school by trained chefs and kitchen personnel hired for the study. Small groups of children participated in the cooking every day. The recipes were designed to cover 40–45% of the children’s daily energy intake based on the energy requirement of an 11-year-old boy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812463173">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812463173">23</xref>]. Lunch was served either in the class room or in a common eating area. The 15 minutes usually set aside in Danish schools for eating during the lunch break was increased to 20–25 minutes during the NND period. The children were encouraged to taste everything and to keep a reasonable plate-distribution with vegetables and starchy foods filling the majority of the plate. All snacks were suitable for eating “on-the-go”. The menus for OPUS School Meal Study were developed by chefs (Meyers Madhus, Frederiksberg, Denmark) with feedback from nutrition scientists from the Division of Nutrition, The Technical University of Denmark. A 3-week menu was developed for each of the four seasons and repeated three times in each season. Each week included a soup day, a fish day, a meat day, a vegetarian day, and a buffet day on Fridays; the buffet consisted of pre-made leftovers from the first four days of the week and was incorporated in order to reduce food waste. Halal-slaughtered and non-pork meat options were provided and consideration was given to mild allergies e.g. by provision of nut-free snack bags whenever necessary.</p>
<p>The lunch meals and snacks followed the guidelines of the NND, a dietary system developed by the OPUS Centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812463173">3</xref>]. NND is based on seasonal ingredients with a strong health-promoting potential which are grown and produced locally in Denmark and other parts of the Nordic region; 75% of the foods are intended to be organic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812463173">3</xref>]. NND contains more berries, cabbage, root vegetables, legumes, fresh herbs, potatoes, wild plants and mushrooms, whole grains, nuts, fish, shellfish, and seaweed, and less meat than the average Danish diet; rapeseed oil is the preferred source of fat. The macronutrient distribution of the NND is targeted to follow the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812463173">23</xref>]. Ten principles sum up NND in the context of the OPUS School Meal Study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812463173">Table I</xref>).</p>

<title>Engaging activities</title>
<p>In order to involve the children, give them a sense of ownership of the project, and motivate them to try new foods and dishes, each child spent 3–5 half-school days during the NND period in the kitchen cooking, presenting, and serving the menu of the day to the other children. For ethical reasons, all children in the participating classes were given this opportunity and were offered the school meals regardless of their participation in the trial.</p>
<p>The teachers were acknowledged as ambassadors for the project; they were therefore involved and informed early in the planning phase. During the intervention, the teachers were encouraged to participate in the lunch meals. Prior to study start, the class teachers were given a box of teaching materials about the human body, the clinical measurements, and taste sensorics, including background information about NND and suggestions for related educational activities and games. Use of the material was optional, but the teachers were instructed not to use the material about NND during the control period.</p>

Information on the child’s sleeping habits was collected through questionnaires, and instructions on dietary recordings and physical activity/sleep measurements were provided individually. Pubertal status was self-evaluated in five categories based on breast development in girls and pubic hair in boys (Tanner stages) as validated by Morris and Udry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812463173">24</xref>].

Concomitantly, to measure physical activity and sleep, the children were asked to wear an ActiGraph in an elastic belt tightly at the right hip for 7 days and 8 nights, and to remove it only during water activities, i.e. showering or swimming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812463173">26</xref>]. Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated by a 10-min intermittent running test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812463173">27</xref>] carried out in the physical education lessons by the teachers who had been given a thorough instruction at baseline.</p>

<title>Clinical measurements</title>
<p>Clinical measurements were performed in a double-decker truck equipped as a mobile laboratory; approximately one school class was examined per day. Measurements were conducted in the morning after the children had emptied their bladder, had been fasting since midnight, and were wearing only light clothing. Height was measured using a stadiometer and with the child holding his head in the Frankfurter plane, body weight was measured using a digital scale and waist circumference was measured at the level of the umbilicus. Body composition was assessed by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scanning. Blood pressure and heart rate was measured by an automated device and 35 ml fasting venous blood was drawn from the arm. Blood glucose and haemoglobin were analysed immediately after sampling. The remaining blood was immediately stored as plasma, serum, and whole-blood at −80°C for later analysis of nutrient status (e.g. whole-blood fatty acid composition, ferritin, and 25(OH)-vitamin D), growth and bone markers (e.g. insulin-like growth factor-1 and osteocalcin), hormones (e.g. parathyroid hormone, ghrelin, and leptin), metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory markers (e.g. cholesterol, triacylglycerol, insulin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and adiponectin), and metabolomics. If written consent had been given, an extra 5 ml blood was drawn for storage as buffy coat, red blood cells, and plasma in Copenhagen University Biobank for Experimental Research (CUBE; Department of Human Nutrition, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen).</p>

<sec id="section12-1403494812463173">
<title>Cognitive function and self-rated learning and wellness</title>
<p>Reading and mathematics proficiencies were assessed during regular school lessons by the class teachers using Danish standard tests for the age group. The D2 Test of Attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812463173">28</xref>] was also performed and self-rated learning and wellbeing were assessed using visual analogue scales. If separate written consent was given by the custody holders of the child, records of school absence during the study period were obtained from the school administrations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1403494812463173">
<title>Social and cultural features</title>
<p>Telephone interviews with parents supplemented with anonymised registry data from Statistics Denmark (Copenhagen Denmark), and a postal survey among school teachers were conducted to assess whether the children’s acceptance of the NND was influenced by their socioeconomic background, family food habits and attitudes, some individual factors, and the social school and class environment, and whether the school meal programme influenced family life in relation to food and eating. To investigate the implementation and impact of the school meal programme on the everyday life of the children in school, an intensive qualitative investigation was conducted at two schools, including field studies, focus group interviews with children, and in-depth interviews with chefs, teachers, and other relevant staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1403494812463173">
<title>Food waste and cost</title>
<p>At two of the schools, food waste was measured for 5 days on three occasions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494812463173">Figure 1</xref>). The children’s plates were weighed and photographed individually before and after lunch and the total waste from all the children’s plates was weighed. Food costs in the NND period were estimated based on the budgeted ingredient quantities for preparation of the school meals combined with ingredient wholesale prices obtained from leading food wholesalers in Denmark. Costs of kitchen personnel and equipment were also estimated.</p>

<sec id="section15-1403494812463173">
<title>Pilot study</title>
<p>From January to April 2011 we conducted the OPUS School Meal Pilot Study in order to test our recruitment and measurement procedures, questionnaires, logistics in the mobile laboratory, training of the kitchen staff, and different logistic routines for cooking, serving, and eating the meals with the children. The pilot study was also used to validate the WebDASC and the waist-worn ActiGraphs for sleep measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812463173">26</xref>] and to develop the teaching material. Eighty-one 3rd- and 4th-grade children from a school in the north-eastern part of Denmark participated.</p>

<title>Statistical considerations</title>
<sec id="section17-1403494812463173">
<title>Primary outcomes and power calculation</title>
<p>Two relevant primary outcomes in separate scientific areas were identified: (1) a MS score based on individual z-scores for waist circumference, mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triacylglycerol, and the Homeostasis Model Assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR); and (2) concentration performance derived from the D2 Test of Attention.</p>
<p>Prior to recruitment, power calculations were performed based on a mixed linear model including diet (NND or control) as fixed factor and pupil as random factor, with 5% significance level and 80% statistical power using the statistical software R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>). Different scenarios of school numbers (8–12), number of 3rd- and 4th-grade classes per school (4–6), number of participating children per class (18–25), and intra-pupil correlation coefficients (0.5–0.9) were considered. Assuming nine schools with four classes per year group, 19 completing children per class, and an intra-pupil correlation coefficient of 0.5, a total of 673 completing pupils would give a detectable difference between the NND and control diet of 0.11 standard deviation. The power calculation was based on the MS score from the pilot study (<italic>n</italic>=74) which had an estimated standard deviation of 2.943. This would correspond to a 0.11×2.943=0.32 point difference in the MS score, which, for instance, translates to a difference of 2% in waist circumference in combination with a 0.05 mmol/l difference in HDL cholesterol, assuming no differences in MAP, triacylglycerol, or HOMA-IR. This was assessed to be attainable and relevant, and a total of nine schools was considered to be logistically manageable. We assumed that an estimated 25% of the invited families would not consent to participate and allowed for a 15% drop out after inclusion; accordingly, we would need to invite about 1055 children for the study to obtain approximately 673 completers.</p>

<title>Presentation of baseline characteristics and drop outs</title>
<p>The characteristics presented are based on the study population at the time of the baseline clinical measurements in the OPUS truck. Continuous variables were checked for normality by Shapiro-Wilk’s test and visual inspection of histograms. Body weight was not normally distributed and is presented as median (25–75th percentile). The remaining continuous variables are presented as mean±SD. Gender is shown as <italic>n</italic> (%) and the remaining categorical variables as %. Parental education was evaluated based on the parent in the household with the highest education. Five categories were used: (1) Lower secondary school or lower (≤10 years); (2) high school or comparable; (3) academy profession programme; (4) short vocational education; (5) Bachelor’s degree or comparable; and (6) Master’s degree or higher (≥17 years) based on the standard classifications of education defined by Statistics Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812463173">29</xref>]. Body weight status (underweight, normal weight, and overweight)was determined based on age- and sex-specific cut-offs defined to pass through body mass index of 18.5, 25, and 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at age 18 years, as according to Cole et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812463173">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1403494812463173">31</xref>]. Comparison of baseline characteristics between drop outs and completers was performed using unpaired t-test and Mann–Whitney U-test for normally and non-normally distributed continuous variables, respectively. Categorical variables were tested by chi-squared test. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 22 and 24 classes from 3rd and 4th grade, respectively, participated in the study. Among these, the parents of 834 children (82% of invited, school range 71–92%) gave written consent to participate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1403494812463173">Figure 2</xref>). The children included were 8–11 years old and had an even distribution of boys and girls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812463173">Table II</xref>). The mean body mass index for age z-score and the percentage of overweight/obese children varied considerably between the nine schools (from −0.07 to 0.37 z-score and from 10% to 19%, respectively). Comparable numbers of children were overweight and underweight (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812463173">Table II</xref>). Pubertal status was reported in 798 children; 77% of boys and 54% of girls had not entered puberty (Tanner stage 1): of the boys, 19% were in stage 2 and 4% in stage 3, of the girls, 36% were in stage 2 and 10% in stage 3. One boy had reached Tanner stage 4; none of the children had reached stage 5.</p>

<p>Sixty-nine (8.3%) of the children included withdrew during the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1403494812463173">Figure 2</xref>). The major reasons for drop out were change of school or class (<italic>n</italic>=29), dislike of or too time-consuming measurements (<italic>n</italic>=17), and dislike of the NND school meals (<italic>n</italic>=13). A chi-squared test showed that the five educational categories could be collapsed into two categories, i.e. whether or not a Bachelor’s degree or comparable had been obtained. Accordingly, a higher proportion of completers as compared to drop outs belonged to households with at least a Bachelor’s degree or comparable (56.6 vs. 38.1%; <italic>p</italic>=0.004). Drop outs and completers did not differ with respect to any of the other baseline characteristics presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812463173">Table II</xref>.

<p>Twelve 3rd-grade classes and 11 4th-grade classes received NND in the first dietary period. The mean number of days on which school meals were served to each class was 55 (range 49–61) days in the first dietary period and 55 (range 48–60) days in the second dietary period.</p>

<sec id="section20-1403494812463173" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The OPUS School Meal Study is the largest study conducted to date assessing the impact on nutrition and health of a full school-day meal package rather than targeting individual components of the school lunch. The school meals were designed to be tasteful and nutritionally balanced and were tested in a setting resembling the real-life conditions in which school meals could be served.</p>
<p>We assess the potential effects on various aspects of children’s nutrition, development, and health. Moreover, we have included thorough quantitative and qualitative measurements to understand the social and cultural effects of the intervention as well as measurements of food waste and food cost with strong relevance for future strategies for implementing school meal programmes.</p>
<sec id="section21-1403494812463173">
<title>Study population and drop out</title>
<p>Of the 39 schools contacted, several of those from low-income and low-education municipalities were either not interested or unable to provide kitchen facilities for 6 months. Consequently, we were unable to reach our goal of inviting ≥50% schools from municipalities with an income and education level below the national mean; this was only the case for three of the nine participating schools. According to Statistics Denmark, 10.9% of Danish families with children have lower secondary school or less as their highest level of education, whereas 14.6% have at least a master’s degree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812463173">22</xref>]. Although our study population was slightly better educated than this background population, we managed to include children with various socioeconomic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812463173">Table II</xref>). The number of overweight/obese boys in the present study was comparable to the numbers reported by Pearson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1403494812463173">32</xref>] based on school health examination records in children from Copenhagen aged 5–8 years and 14–16 years. No data for underweight was given by Pearson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1403494812463173">32</xref>]. Our inclusion rate of 82% was high compared with the 59–74% parental consent obtained in three earlier large American school interventions that also included blood sampling from the children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812463173">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812463173">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812463173">19</xref>]. We experienced that the concept of eating regional and Nordic “home-cooked” meals designed by chefs and produced with consideration for the environment had a strong appeal to the families invited and the school staff involved in the trial. Few previous school meal interventions have included blood samples from all children in their design, and to our knowledge none have included DXA scans. Although the clinical measurements included an overnight fast, a whole-body scan, and a blood sample in a setting where the children were not accompanied by their parents, &gt;97% of the children scheduled were examined at each laboratory truck visit. This number is higher than the 74% reported in the intervention schools in the study by Trevino et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812463173">13</xref>] but comparable to the 98% reported by the Healthy Study Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812463173">19</xref>], two American trials.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that OPUS School Meal Study is comprehensive and includes repeated blood samples, 7-day dietary records, and a number of other measurements at home and at school, a very low drop out was achieved. Also, the number who withdrew because they disliked the NND school meals was lower than we had expected, considering that the concept of having hot school lunch with new foods and dishes is very different from consuming a cold packed lunch as most Danish children do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812463173">2</xref>]. We wonder whether the fact that the meals were free contributed to the low drop out. The lower drop out among parents with high as compared to low education may be a question of time, resources, and ability to understand and use the material related to the measurements. Also, the motivation to participate in a health-oriented project may be higher among parents with a university degree.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1403494812463173">
<title>Primary outcomes</title>
<p>We decided on two primary outcomes of the OPUS School Meal Study. The first is the continuous MS score, which incorporates the sum of the effects on early MS markers. The MS is a cluster of risk factors, which is strongly associated with overweight, risk of cardiovascular disease, and mortality in adults and has increased in children over the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1403494812463173">33</xref>]. In children, the components of the MS are highly affected by age and pubertal status, which makes it difficult to apply one single definition of the MS, and the relevant cut-off point, which indicates increased risk, has not been established. The prevalence of the MS is very low among normal weight children, which makes it difficult to use as an outcome in school intervention studies. Using the continuous MS score eliminates the loss of information that occurs when continuous measurements are dichotomised and allows us to adjust for age, gender, and pubertal stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1403494812463173">33</xref>]. The MS score may be positively affected by the fish, rapeseed oil, fruit, berries, vegetables, and whole grains of the dietary intervention. As recommended by Eisenmann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1403494812463173">33</xref>], we have decided to base the score on metabolic markers aligned with the definition of the MS in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1403494812463173">34</xref>].</p>
<p>The other primary outcome is a measure of children’s concentration performance. Observational studies and randomised trials have indicated that nutrients such as n-3 LCPUFA and iron, as well as the timing and composition of meals may be important for cognitive performance in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1403494812463173">35</xref>]. However, evidence is limited and little is known about the effect of introducing balanced school meals rich in fish on the cognitive performance in large samples of healthy children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1403494812463173">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>One strength of the present study is the high statistical power, which, due to the large sample size and the cross-over design, allows us to detect differences of only 0.11 SD in the outcome variables.</p>
<p>Although it can be debated whether such a small detectable difference in for example, the MS score is clinically relevant, we argue that it is relevant in a public health perspective for early health and prevention of lifestyle diseases. Another strength is the unique dataset from more than 800 children at baseline. These data will fill scientific gaps in our knowledge about healthy children’s current nutrient status, body composition, and bone health and allow us to investigate cross-sectional associations between diet, health, and cognitive performance.</p>
<p>Health and life expectancy are known to be inversely related with socioeconomic status. Conversely, the participants of randomised controlled trials in healthy children are often highly selected and from health-conscious families of high socioeconomic status. A recent report from the Danish National Food Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812463173">2</xref>] showed that 18–22% of Danish 8–10-year-olds and 12–14-year-olds whose parents are either unemployed or unskilled workers do not eat lunch at all. Another strength is therefore, that we have included schools from areas with various socioeconomic characteristics and have managed to include the majority of children in the 3rd and 4th grades. This increases the chance of reaching those children who may benefit most from healthy school meals.</p>
<p>One limitation is the intervention period of 3 months, which may be too short to assess the impact of the intervention on, for example, growth. Also, it may take some time for the children to get used to eating some of the new foods and dishes. During the planning phase of the study, we realised that it would have been difficult to maintain the motivation and compliance of control schools and families had a 6-month parallel design been chosen. Moreover, such a design would have required almost a doubling of the sample size in order to achieve the desired statistical power, making it logistically impossible to perform the measurements within a single school year. Finally, it can be criticised that the dietary intervention only covers an estimated 40–45% of the children’s daily energy intake. However, this study is a proof-of-concept designed to provide evidence of the effect of serving school meals on children’s health and performance, rather than changing the full diet of the children.</p>
<p>As opposed to public health multicomponent interventions, we did not attempt to teach the children and their families to eat healthier diets or be more physically active through behavioural modifications and education programmes. The reasons for involving the children in cooking, serving, and presenting the meals were to motivate them to try new foods and dishes and to create a positive peer-effect, thereby increasing compliance with the meals. This means, however, that if we demonstrate effects of the school meal intervention on health and development, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that this was due to the participation in meal preparation, the use of the teaching material, or a socially improved class environment rather than an actual physiological effect of consuming the meals. However, since each child only participated in the meal preparation a total of 3–5 half-school days during the study, and few schools have reported use of the teaching material, we find this rather unlikely. We will be able to take into account the potential carry-over effect by statistically adjusting for the order in which the school classes received the NND and control. Moreover, our social and cultural investigations will give us an understanding of these aspects of the intervention.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A high inclusion rate was achieved as well as few drop outs. Although their parents were slightly better educated than the background population, children from various socioeconomic backgrounds were included, and the prevalence of overweight resembled the prevalence found in Danish school health examinations. The OPUS School Meal Study will be the first randomised controlled trial to determine whether a full school-day meal package based on Nordic foods improves children’s diet, nutrient status, health, wellbeing, cognitive performance, and early disease risk markers.</p>
