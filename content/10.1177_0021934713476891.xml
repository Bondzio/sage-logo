        <p>There are two central propositions in our epistemological essay on culture and
          communication in human communities. The first is that Western scholars tend to study
          African and Asian cultures in relationship only to Western culture. Therefore, one may see
          comparative studies of American and Japanese responses to communication or British and
          Nigerian systems of values and respect. What is rare is to see how Japanese and Nigerian
          cultures interact, compare, or contrast. The second proposition is that most research work
          done in the social sciences and communication carries forth concepts and ideas grounded in
          Western epistemology. Ideas that originate in ancient Asian and African cultures are
          slighted for those that have emerged out of the Greek-Roman cultural matrix. By exploring
          the concept of destiny, we seek to demonstrate how African and Asian concepts can provide
          important information about the way humans communicate. Thus, <italic>nkrabea</italic> and
            <italic>yuan</italic> from the Akan and Chinese cultures are examined for communication
          implications.</p>

      <title>A Prologue to Cultural Dialogue</title>
      <p>There are two central propositions in our epistemological essay on culture and
        communication in human communities. The first is that Western scholars tend to study African
        and Asian cultures in relationship only to Western culture. Therefore, one may see
        comparative studies of American and Japanese responses to communication or British and
        Nigerian systems of values and respect. What is rare is to see how Japanese and Nigerian
        cultures interact, compare, or contrast. The second proposition is that most research work
        done in the social sciences and communication carries forth concepts and ideas grounded in
        Western epistemology. Ideas that originate in ancient Asian and African cultures are
        slighted for those that have emerged out of the Greek-Roman cultural matrix. By exploring
        the concept of destiny, we seek to demonstrate how African and Asian concepts can provide
        important information about the way humans communicate.</p>
      <p>There are those who question why these ideas have not become standard within the discourses
        on communication, culture, and behavior. In the first place, the studies of human
        communication that we use in the West are largely derived from European classical ideas
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934713476891">Ishii, 2001</xref>). Thus, the works
        of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, and other ancient Europeans inform the modern
        discussions of rhetoric, interpersonal communication, and even intercultural communication.
        What we mean is that the assumptions of those fields are situated in the context of Europe’s
        own history. However, we have come to understand over the past 30 to 40 years that in order
        for social scientists, artists, and communicationists to create a universal theory of human
        communication, we need to open our minds to the varieties of human experiences. Fortunately,
        the field of communication has numerous interculturalists who have added to the plural
        understanding of how humans communicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021934713476891">Miike, 2002</xref>). Africanists have sought to advance the philosophy that agency is a
        component of all cultures, and therefore, in any academic discipline, it is reasonable to
        expect that people from various societies will have concepts that are useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021934713476891">Karenga, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934713476891">Mazama, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Since we know from the research of many scholars in intercultural and international
        communication that Asian and African communities often operate on the basis of different
        value assumptions than those in the West, it is important that we continue the creation of a
        body of work that supports global theorizing in culture and communication. Consequently, we
        have spent considerable time seeking to bring societies and cultures together through
        examination of major concepts, such as face, trust, respect, and power. Globalization and
        new technologies have made the world smaller, producing more awareness of conflicts. Yet
        there are other interactions that should allow us to entertain approaches to major human
        concepts that we have not experienced before. To make the world better, by which we mean, to
        make humans more satisfied with their lives and situations, we must know more about each
        other.</p>
      <p>Western domination of intellectual ideas about Asia and Africa has often meant that the
        authentic voices of Asian and African people have rarely been heard. Of course, in the case
        of the ancient histories of Asia and Africa, there are considerable literatures, but yet
        there has been limited information that has made its way into the discourse on
        communication. Few scholars in the West are familiar with the classical African
        philosophers, such as Duauf, Amemomope, Merikare, Akhenaten, Imhotep, and Amenemhat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021934713476891">Asante, 2000</xref>). While more Westerners
        know Confucius and Laotzu, they are essentially ignorant of other Asian thinkers. The
        efforts made by Asian scholars in the past decades have been noteworthy in the advancement
        of Asian approaches in communication theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021934713476891">Chen &amp; An, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021934713476891">Chen &amp; Chung, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021934713476891">Dissanayake, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021934713476891">Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021934713476891">Miike, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021934713476891">Miike &amp; Chen, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021934713476891">2006</xref>). Significant work has been done on Asian
        concepts in communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021934713476891">Kim,
          2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021934713476891">Miike, 2009</xref>).
        Although it is recognized that the hegemony of European-centered ideology and theories
        continues to dominate the thinking of communicationists, progress is being made in
        reinterpreting how Asian culture is seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021934713476891">Miike, 2010</xref>). In the same vein, numerous Afrocentric
        scholars have articulated the value of African ideas for communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021934713476891">Asante, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021934713476891">Blake, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021934713476891">Karenga, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934713476891">Mazama, 2003</xref>). The process is an ongoing one that
        will continue to benefit critical thinkers.</p>

        <title>Toward a Conference of Ideas Around Destiny</title>
        <p>This essay interrogates the complex dimensions that people in China and Ghana understand
          about the idea of destiny. In ancient European thinking, destiny carried the idea of
          Fates. It had the meaning of something that is bound to happen to a person; it might even
          be called fortune or luck. What we wanted to explore in this article is how this term has
          come into use in an African and an Asian context. Of course, we are unable to discuss all
          of the examples in Asia or Africa and therefore have limited our discourse to meditations
          on the use of the concept of destiny in China and Ghana. Actually, in China, we have
          utilized the dominant Han culture, and in Ghana, we have used the dominant Akan culture as
          sites for our exploration of destiny. Thus, the limitations of this article are clear: We
          are not trying to explain all of Asia or all of Africa, yet we believe that an
          understanding of these two powerful cultures might give us some insight for intercultural
          relations.</p>
        <p>Destiny is not the only concept that scholars have examined for its variation in culture.
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021934713476891">Harry C. Triandis (1993)</xref> has
          contended that individualism and collectivism have often been used to provide a universal
          framework for cultural variation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021934713476891">John
            Mbiti (1992)</xref> examined the idea of religion in African culture with an eye toward
          demonstrating how Africans arrive at different conclusions than Westerners. Some people
          claim that Asians are more high context and indirect whereas White Americans are more low
          context, verbose, and direct. Communication modes among Asians tend to be more nuanced,
          more complex, and less straightforward as they are more skillful than Western counterparts
          in deciphering nonverbal cues and the surrounding context. White Americans, more sender
          oriented than Asians, who are more adept in expressing complicated nuances and unspoken
          underlying meanings, are theorized to be more direct and low context in their interaction
          with others.</p>
        <p>The intricate concept of face in Asian communication is inextricably interwoven with
          Asians’ predilection for high-context communicative behavior. Some claim that this
          predilection has its roots in Confucianism. From this philosophy, it is argued that the
          greatest spiritual achievement in one’s life is the search for a harmonious relationship
          with others. Among the values that are highly valued are duty, sincerity, loyalty,
          modesty, deference to authority, and avoidance of direct confrontation. Western
          philosophical traditions are thought to be more linear in explaining the process of
          interpersonal relationships. Westerners tend to experience more difficulties and
          challenges in accommodating and acculturating to the subtle ways of Asian communicative
          behavior than the more versatile, flexible, and culturally informed Asians, who are better
          able to adapt to Western culture and lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021934713476891">Chai &amp; Fontaine, 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>While the cultures of Asia and Africa are complex, dynamic, diverse, heterogeneous, and
          infused with their own distinct histories, cultures, and character, they must also be seen
          for their diversity. Yet the idea of destiny may hold useful lessons for the concept of
          cultural agency. In Ghana in West Africa, the idea of <italic>nkrabea</italic> is similar
          to the Chinese idea of <italic>yuan</italic>, and yet as can be expected, there are
          differences. Exploration of the similarities and differences will assist in building a
          truly intercultural understanding. Numerous scholars are approaching concepts with a more
          intense concentration on the thoughts of those usually unheard in the Western academy
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021934713476891">Bellegarde-Smith, 2005</xref>).</p>

    <sec id="section3-0021934713476891">
      <title><italic>Nkrabea</italic> and <italic>Yuanfen</italic></title>
      <p>In Akan culture, the idea of <italic>nkrabea</italic> is at the base of a spiritual
        relationship a person has to reality and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021934713476891">Opoku, 1975/2010</xref>). Thus, some people think that a
        certain form of destiny, such as to become a leader of a community, is reflected in the term
          <italic>nkrabea</italic>. Yet one does not have to “see” the future or “hear” voices that
        dictate one’s personal direction in order to experience <italic>nkrabea</italic>. However,
          <italic>nkrabea</italic> allows a person to expect a positive relationship with nature,
        family, friends, and ancestors. When two people meet, they are meeting as two individuals
        with different <italic>nkrabea</italic>, and therefore in the meeting, they are always
        working out the relationship of their <italic>nkrabea</italic> to each other.</p>
      <p>Consequently, to the African in Ghana, success in human relationships or communication
        might be said to depend upon <italic>nkrabea</italic>. On the other hand, to the Chinese,
        intercultural relationships, interpersonal relationships, and success of interactions depend
        on <italic>yuan.</italic> Relationships in China are viewed multidirectionally, the primary
        cause is within the control of individuals, and the guide is from Confucianism because it is
        seen as the principle ethos for humanistic being. The choice is up to the individual whether
        to display benevolence (<italic>ren</italic>) and righteousness (<italic>yi</italic>) in a
        relationship. In other words, a relationship may succeed on the premise of making wise
        choices that may lead to a healthy outcome of the relationship. <italic>Yuan</italic> may be
        considered secondary to the person’s decision. In the Buddhist version of the philosophy,
          <italic>yuan</italic> is considered to be pivotal in determining the length of
        relationship, the time and place of encounter, and the process in which the relationship
        grows or digresses. Therefore, while Chinese may attempt to ensure that all goes well in
        their association by making “right” choices based on the ethos of Confucianism, the outcome
        could still turn out to be disastrous in the absence of <italic>yuan</italic>. Europeans
        tend to believe that interpersonal relationships can be worked out through personal effort;
        to the Chinese, without positive <italic>yuan</italic>, nothing may seem to work. Africans,
        especially in the Akan culture, believe that many things are determined even before birth
        and therefore a person’s <italic>nkrabea</italic> is always at work. A person’s life is
        spent seeking to ensure that he or she is on the path toward his or her destiny. Some people
        may never find the path, and when they are dislocated, they are under great stress and
        pressure to do all within their power to make the proper decisions in order to regain a
        sense of place and location on the road to destiny. Among the Chinese, <italic>yuan</italic>
        has been defined as something that supports, assists, or cooperates with an event rather
        than being the precise cause of it. Thus, <italic>yuan</italic> is different from
          <italic>yin</italic>, which is the direct cause of something. <italic>Yuan</italic> can be
        called the circumstantial or secondary cause, whereas <italic>yin</italic> may be called the
        direct or fundamental cause of action. <italic>Yuan</italic> anchors all interpersonal
        relationships. They can last only as long as <italic>yuan</italic> is present. Consequently,
        relationships are dissolved when <italic>yuan</italic> is no longer present.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section4-0021934713476891">
      <title><italic>Yuan</italic> in Chinese Society</title>
      <p><italic>Yuan</italic> has its origin in Buddhism and is found in the beliefs of
        predestination and fatalism. The development of interpersonal relationships, particularly in
        traditional Chinese society, is held to be predestined, predetermined, and unalterable.
        While Confucianism specifies the roles and rules in dealing with different relationships
        between (a) the ruler and the ruled, (b) fathers and sons, (c) husband and wife, (d)
        siblings, and (e) friends, it does not explain the complexities and intricacies of
        interpersonal relationships. <italic>Yuan</italic> fills the gap.</p>
      <p>Chinese scholars have used the lotus plant to explain the difference between
          <italic>yin</italic> and <italic>yuan</italic>: <disp-quote>
          <p>The lotus seed is the <italic>yin</italic>, but it cannot grow by itself into a plant;
            rather its growth is aided by human effort, soil fertilizers, sunlight, air, and a pond
            or earthen pot filled with water. These are the necessary conditions for the growth of
            the lotus plant and, as such, are the assisting <italic>yuan</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934713476891">Sun, 2008</xref>, p. 96)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>In order for a thing to exist, the <italic>yuan</italic> must be present and ignited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934713476891">Sun, 2008</xref>). There is the beginning
        (ignition) of <italic>yuan</italic> to start with, and the decline of <italic>yuan</italic>
          (<italic>yuan qi yuan mie</italic>) explains the life cycle of things, including
        interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934713476891">Sun,
          2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>The meaning of <italic>yuan</italic> may be broken down in three main categories, according
        to (a) the duration, (b) the quality or nature of relationship formed, and (c) the type.</p>
      <p>Two different kinds of <italic>yuan</italic> are found in the category of duration:
          <italic>yuanfen</italic> and <italic>jiyuan</italic> (<italic>yuan</italic> of opportunity
        or chance). <italic>Yuanfen</italic> is thought to have permanent influence, and
          <italic>jiyuan</italic> is the <italic>yuan</italic> of temporary interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021934713476891">Yang &amp; Ho, 1988</xref>).
          <italic>Yuanfen</italic> determines all lasing relationships involving family members,
        relatives, friends, or colleagues. <italic>Jiyuan</italic>, on the other hand, is thought to
        exist when two or more persons find themselves riding on the same tour bus, staying in the
        same hotel, or even experiencing similar misfortunate. The quality of <italic>yuan</italic>
        can be broken down into good <italic>yuan</italic> (<italic>liang yuan</italic>) and bad or
        evil <italic>yuan</italic> (<italic>nie yuan</italic>). Good <italic>yuan</italic> is said
        to be a gift from heaven, while <italic>nie yuan</italic> stems from the manufacturing of
        negative karma (<italic>zao nie</italic>); the effect is not an act of heaven but, as we see
        also in Akan culture, the consequences of human acts. A long-lasting friendship is thought

          <p>The formation of interpersonal relationships is held to be predestined and therefore
            unalterable. <italic>Yuan</italic> is said to predetermine whether a relationship will
            be characterized by attractive or repulsion—which is why some relationships are
            harmonious and fortunate, whereas others are awkward and even disastrous. Close
            relationships—such as those between father and son, or husband and wife—are supposed to
            result from <italic>yuan</italic>; and so are superficial acquaintanceships—such as
            those formed following a casual meeting. Indeed, <italic>yuan</italic> is said to exert
            its influence in virtually all interpersonal relationships . . . on the basis of

            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021934713476891">Chang and Holt (1991)</xref> are

          <list-item>
            <p>Presence or absence of association: As stated earlier, success or failure in
              relationships between two people is dependent on whether two people “have
                <italic>yuan</italic>.” Two common expressions to describe such situation are
                <italic>yu yuan</italic>, meaning “to have <italic>yuan</italic>,” and <italic>wu
                yuan</italic>, meaning “not to have yuan.” For the Chinese experiencing <italic>wu
                yuan, yuan</italic> is used as a defense mechanism to save one’s face and as a form
              of consolation. For example, a couple may love each other (presence of emotions) but
              the unfortunate existing conditions do not allow them to be together; hence they
              comfort themselves by saying, “Perhaps in the next life, we can have
                <italic>yuan</italic>.”</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Bad relationship: <italic>Nie yuan</italic> describes a “bad relationship.”
                <italic>Nie</italic> is an extremely derogatory term that simply means “very bad,”
              or the relationship cannot work out. An example is when two people, each married to
              someone else, develop feelings for each other. It could also apply to when two people,
              married to each other only to find out later that they do not love each other, finally
              get a divorce.</p>

                yuan</italic> is when two people meet and one party feels very comfortable and
              connected with the other. Even two people with very different personalities may
              experience <italic>tou yuan</italic></p>

              matched <italic>yuan</italic>, one party feels uncomfortable with the other person not
              because of differences in personality incompatibilities but because of a feeling that
              the association with the other is “just not right.”</p>

            <p>Human <italic>yuan: Ren yuan</italic> refers to people who are generally very likable

        <p>A recent preliminary study among a sample of Hong Kong residents, of whom 86% were
          college students between the ages of 18 and 33, revealed a significant, positive
          correlation between participants’ belief in <italic>yuan</italic> and relationship
          satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934713476891">Chen, 2009</xref>). In
          another study, among the Taiwanese participants, extended interviews with 10 graduate
          students revealed that the Buddhist conception of <italic>yuan</italic> plays a
          significant role in structuring how Chinese think about their interpersonal relationships
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021934713476891">Chang &amp; Holt, 1991</xref>). In
          another study that explored contemporary conceptions of <italic>yuan</italic>, surveys
          distributed to more than 500 students from a Taiwan and Hong Kong university resulted in
          three themes: (a) conceptions of <italic>yuan</italic> and <italic>yuanfen</italic>, (b)
          belief or disbelief in <italic>yuan</italic>, and (c) relationships involving
            <italic>yuan</italic>. Using statistical analysis to examine the responses, the authors
          found that 62% of the participants subscribed to the notion of <italic>yuan</italic> as
          changeable, unpredictable, or uncontrollable. The category on whether participants believe
          or do not believe in <italic>yuan</italic> revealed that a high percentage of them
          subscribe to the Chinese sayings attributed to <italic>yuan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021934713476891">Yang &amp; Ho, 1988</xref>). It appears
          that many Chinese still believe in the power of <italic>yuan</italic>; however, they also
          feel that whether a relationship works out or not can be affected by the individual.
          Indeed, in the classic book <italic>The Art of War</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934713476891">Tzu Sun (2008)</xref> says one of the “heads” that must be
          answered by the one who will engage in war is “with whom lie the advantage derived from
          Heaven and Earth” (p. 17).</p>
        <p>Although the association between <italic>yuan</italic> and traditional Buddhist beliefs
          has weakened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021934713476891">Yang &amp; Ho,
            1988</xref>), the belief in <italic>yuan</italic> is a reality for most young Chinese
          today (particularly, students), given the results of four studies that have so far been
          conducted in the past 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021934713476891">Chang

            1988</xref>). These young people see themselves as “the modern Chinese,” who are
          separate from both Westerners and traditional Chinese but still maintain a stronghold of
          Chineseness in their cultural beliefs and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021934713476891">Bond, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021934713476891">Goodwin &amp; Findlay, 1997</xref>). <italic>Yuan</italic>
          is no longer seen as fatalistic but is considered “fatalistic voluntarism,” in which the
          conception of relationships is no longer dichotomized as either predestined or brought
          upon by personal choice and effort but, rather, is seen as a combination of the two
          forces.</p>
        <p>Three elements in fatalistic voluntarism are highlighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934713476891">Sun, 2008</xref>):</p>

        <p>Representing a crossroads of the old and new, the concept does not seek to negate the
          importance of <italic>yuan</italic>, but it empowers the individual to take responsibility
          for his or her actions. Fatalistic voluntarism provides an explanation when a relationship
          is not working out, using <italic>yuan</italic> as the reason for its negative outcome,
          thereby creating equilibrium and possibly peace of mind. By attributing failures to some
          external, unknown, but credible forces alleviates an individual from blaming others or
          himself or herself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934713476891">Sun, 2008</xref>).
          Freedom plays a significant role in Chinese cultural understanding along the continuum of
          yuan traditional beliefs (fatalistic determinism and predestination) at one end and
          modernistic yuan beliefs (congeniality, harmony, and comfort) at the other end.</p>
        <p>The culture of China is ancient. Among the earliest philosophers in China were Confucius
          and Laotzu. While Confucianism has much impact in the social and political value system,
          Buddhism came in during the Han dynasty as a philosophy with elements of karma and
          predestination. Actually, karma is associated with the idea of what we were born with, and
          predestination is an aspect of what we can expect. <italic>Yuan</italic> predetermines
          whether two people are able to get along and establish a close bond and relationship. The
          predestined affinity or enmity between the two parties depends largely on whether they
          have <italic>yuan</italic> or no <italic>yuan. Yuan fen</italic> is the idea that when
          things happen to a person in a wonderful way, the person has experienced <italic>yuan
            fen</italic>. This is a good quality. Thus, when communication between two persons
          appears to be easy, comfortable, and without problems, it is possible to say that
            <italic>yuan fen</italic> exists in that situation.</p>

      <title>Origin of <italic>Nkrabea</italic> in Ghana</title>
      <p>The classical civilizations of Africa are Kemet and Nubia, two Nile Valley cultures that
        have influenced many aspects of African life from libation to burial, from ancestral
        reverence to reincarnation. Ghana is located in West Africa and among the many ethnic groups
        in Ghana are the Akan, the largest group, with kinship affinity to ancient Kemet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934713476891">Meyerowitz, 1960</xref>). Among the Akan,
        there is a general belief in human destiny. The idea of destiny recognizes both the power of
        the unknown as well as the limitations of human beings. The word for destiny in the Akan
        language is <italic>nkrabea</italic>. Everyone is born with <italic>nkrabea</italic>; there
        cannot be a human without it because it is something that comes with birth itself. It is
        composed of several important elements. In the first place, the verb <italic>kra</italic>
        means to “take leave of” or to bid farewell to the realm of the unknown so as to capture the
        idea that when one is born, one is actually saying goodbye to Providence.
          <italic>Nkrabea</italic> literally means “the manner in which a soul departs for the
        earth.” One may call this “fate,” “life,” “granted life,” or “prescribed lot.” The idea also
        carries with it the manner of one’s death; that is, it is fixed beforehand and remains
        unchanged.</p>
      <sec id="section7-0021934713476891">
        <title>The Wisdom of the Elders</title>
        <p>Since the Akan believe that a person receives his or her <italic>nkra</italic> from the
          Divinity prior to entering the earth, the <italic>nkra</italic>, message, is a link
          between the human and the divine. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021934713476891">Kwame Gyekye (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021934713476891">Kofi
            Asare Opoku (1975/2010)</xref>, two of Ghana’s leading intellectuals, understood, there
          are numerous expressions in Akan that refer to the <italic>nkrabea</italic> of a person.
          For example, the Akan have these important sayings:</p>
        <list id="list4-0021934713476891" list-type="simple">

            <p><italic>If wood remains in the water for a thousand years, it will never become a
                crocodile.</italic></p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>In these passages, the Akan philosophers are stating the precise idea that all things
          have their own <italic>nkra</italic> as dictated before they began to function. In fact,
          wood will remain wood and will never become a crocodile because the destiny of wood and
          the destiny of a crocodile are different. One can say that the tree that sheds its leaves
          is not a tree of the tropic regions because the destiny has already been decided. Like the
          tree or the crocodile, the human being has a particular destiny. While the idea of destiny
          is often thought of in connection with free will, determinism, and punishment, the African
          thinkers who designed the concept for the Akan society had their own reasons for doing so.
          As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021934713476891">Gyekye (1995)</xref> observed, in
          Akan, if a thing is named, then it is real. Furthermore, each human being has one head,
          but heads differ; so it is with destiny. There are many destinies according to the number
          of human beings, but all humans have destiny. Thus, the Akan notion of
            <italic>nkrabea</italic> is tied to Divine Providence in a way that
            <italic>yuanfen</italic> is not. Indeed, Western humanism also emphasizes the idea of
          the evolution of human beings that may run in a different manner than
            <italic>nkrabea.</italic> The Akan thinkers found their notion of
            <italic>nkrabea</italic> in the experiences of human being. Thus,
            <italic>abrabo</italic>, human life, determines the location of all thoughts about
            <italic>nkrabea</italic>. In the mind of the Akan, one cannot live in a village among
          other human beings and not see that destiny is real. Quite frankly, if one observes life,
          one will see that different people have certain propensities, talents, and abilities, and
          that some other people demonstrate in their lives the reality of fortune, misfortune,
          disappointments, joys, and richness whereas others do not experience life in the same way.
          This is the basis for <italic>nkrabea</italic>; it is found in the individuality of the
          human experience.</p>
        <p>We can see that there are individuals who seem to have good fortune all the time, and
          then there are those who seem to be constantly in trouble. These are the ideas that
          suggest <italic>nkrabea</italic> to the Akan thinker. However, if a person commits an act
            (<italic>asiane</italic>) not influenced by destiny, which means that it is an
          accidental act, then he or she will not commit it again. Such an act is easily corrected.
          Yet if a person commits an act that is influenced by destiny, this is shown to be a part
          of the person’s unalterable character. It is the persistence of an activity that dictates
          whether or not it is a part of destiny. The Akan say that it is your destiny that makes
          you who you are. The same is true for every individual, and therefore, the key for human
          society has to be the uniqueness of each person in communication with others. There is an
          expression, <italic>obiara ne ne nkrabea</italic>, which literally means “each person has
          his own destiny.”</p>
        <p>The centrality of human beings in the universe is a part of the African idea of destiny.
          This means that the person must show respect and reverence for both the visible and the
          invisible spheres of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021934713476891">Magesa,
            1998</xref>, p. 72). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021934713476891">Magesa
            (1998)</xref> says of the finality of the human being that “sociability with all people
          and harmony with the universe is the guiding ethical principle” (p. 72). Now what are the
          implications of this principle for communication? It is important to remember that in the
          Akan view, the human must be in harmony with both the animate and the inanimate worlds in
          order to claim the energies and vital forces in them.</p>
        <p>The Akan say, “<italic>Nkrabea mu nni kwatibea</italic>.” This means that the destiny one
          has been assigned cannot be escaped. In effect, the order that has been given is settled
          and cannot be altered unless one carries out certain rituals to alleviate the harshest
          aspect of one’s destiny. So for <italic>nkrabea</italic> to be fixed does not mean that it
          is immutable; it means only that if one believes that his or her destiny is negative, then
          ritual is necessary to change the destiny. However, it is not easy. One must learn to come
          to terms with one’s destiny rather than try to change it.</p>
        <p>It is believed that a person’s <italic>okra</italic> receives his or her destiny before
          birth. Thus the <italic>nkrabea</italic> is often called the <italic>hy3bea</italic>,
          which means “the way and manner in which one’s destiny was ordered.” Once the
            <italic>okra</italic>, similar to Western idea of soul, has been imprinted with destiny,
          a person enters the world with certain attributes that would assist in achieving the
          destiny. Since the idea of destiny is not like saying that one’s destiny is to be a
          teacher, engineer, lawyer, or any other professional occupation but, rather, like saying
          that one’s character will reflect justice, mercy, truth, righteousness, and goodness, one
          can see just how critical it is for a person to communicate with others. Everyone wishes
          for a good destiny. It is an indication that the person “fits” well in the community of
          ancestors as well as among the living. A good destiny is <italic>akraye</italic>; a bad
          destiny is called <italic>akrabiri</italic> in Akan. When one seems to have
            <italic>akrabiri</italic>, a bad destiny, as indicated by how one gets along with
          others, treats one’s parents, interacts with strangers, communicates with the elders, and
          “fits” into the society, it is a serious existential problem that can be dealt with only
          through ritual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021934713476891">Owusu-Frempong,
            2005</xref>).</p>
        <p>One finds similar ideas among other groups of Africans. For example, among the Yoruba of
          Nigeria, the idea of destiny is also well developed. A good destiny is
            <italic>olori-re</italic>, and a bad destiny is <italic>olori-buruka</italic> in Yoruba.
          Among the Yoruba, the idea of destiny is called <italic>ipinori</italic>, that which is
          given to the <italic>ori</italic>, the head. The Yoruba believe that a person receives
          this in one of three ways. A person may kneel and <italic>choose</italic> his or her
          destiny; this is called <italic>A-kunle-yan</italic>, “that which is chosen.” One may
          kneel and <italic>receive</italic> one’s destiny; this is called
            <italic>A-kunle-gba</italic>, “that which is given.” An individual may have a destiny
            <italic>attached</italic> to him or her; that is <italic>A-yan-mo</italic>. Both the
          Akan and the Yoruba believe that while in theory, destiny is unalterable, in practice,
          there are some factors that can influence it for good or evil. A person may consult a
          divinity to have a good destiny maintained or prolonged. The Yoruba believe that a good
          destiny that is accompanied by a bad character is disaster. Among the Akan, it is said
          that <italic>Opanyin ano sen suman</italic>, that is, “the wisdom of the elders is worth
          more than any amulet or charm.” This is not a fatalistic concept. People tend to work to
          have their destinies prolonged and changed. It is only the inexplicable traits of humans
          that are explained by destiny. Consequently, how one communicates with another human being
          can be affected by destiny, particularly if one is a victim of an inexplicable character
          issue. For example, if a person is constantly misunderstanding the intentions or the
          language of another, then it might be considered a problem of destiny. On the other hand,
          if a person is able to communicate with another without difficulty, then it is also a
          function of destiny. Of course, if one has a problem with communication, the Akan idea of
            <italic>nkrabea</italic> demands that the person seek measures to correct the course of
          destiny. The key objective is to hold back chaos. The Akan belief is that humans are not
          the masters of the universe; they are only the beneficiaries and therefore must live in
          harmony with it. The universe has existed long before humans and will exist long after
          humans; it is important to maintain the idea of humility, even as humans walk upon the
          earth. The Akan say the earth is <italic>Asase Yaa</italic>, a sacred place, and must be
          walked on carefully and softly.</p>
        <p><italic>Nkrabea</italic> also suggests <italic>nkra</italic>, life, which corresponds to
          the ancient African idea of <italic>ankh</italic>, life, or living. During the rise of the
          ancient Kemetic civilization in 3400 BC, the African people along the Nile River found the
          concept of <italic>ankh</italic> as a key to their culture. The Akan culture is related to
          ancient Kemetic culture in fundamental ways that have been pointed out in numerous
          articles and books. Ritualized structures and symbolic processes suggest a direct
          connection between Akan and the classical Nile Valley civilizations of Africa in the
          concepts of naming, kinship, and destiny.</p>
        <p>One of the central ideas in ancient African cultures is <italic>maat</italic>, which is
          usually rendered justice, balance, harmony, order, truth, righteousness, and reciprocity.
          Thus, when one discovers in a communicative relationship an adequate or proficient sense
          of unity, one can say that <italic>maat</italic> exists. Similarly, in a person’s home,
          when the chairs, paintings, beds, sofas, cabinets, and vases are said to be in perfect
          unity, then <italic>maat</italic> also exists in that space as an expression of destiny, a
          good destiny for the items in the room. This is the essence of <italic>nkrabea</italic>,
          the idea of destiny, that is the key to understanding human relationships.</p>
        <p>The Chinese and the Akan philosophy see the notion of destiny as being greater than the
          human being. The Chinese idea of <italic>ming yuan</italic> carries with it the notion of
          fate that comes from a source outside of the human, hence, <italic>yuan</italic> from
            <italic>ming</italic>, heaven. In Africa, the Akan say that <italic>nkrabea</italic> is
          from <italic>Nyame</italic>, that is, from a divine energy greater than humans.</p>

        <title><italic>Nkrabea</italic> and the Concept of Personhood</title>
        <p><italic>Nkrabea</italic> must begin with the concept of the person. In the Akan culture,
          a person is basically composed of several components: <italic>okra, mogya,
          sunsum</italic>, and so on. But people are also members of an <italic>abusua</italic>,
          family, and exist in the context of community, which includes both the living and the
          dead. Therefore, all communication has certain ritualized ideas of respect and loyalty
          based essentially on the concept of family.</p>

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Even the idea of kinship reflects this closeness so that age groups share common mothers
          and common siblings. There are no first cousins, only brothers and sisters, mothers and
          fathers, uncles and aunts.</p>
        <p><italic>Nkrabea</italic> suggests that each human is unique and has value apart from
          others but this value is meaningless without community. No person is without
            <italic>nkrabea</italic>, although many people will never discover their
            <italic>nkrabea</italic>. Only through conscious communication with other people can one
          truly discover <italic>nkrabea.</italic> The reason for this is because within the
          community of humans, there is an endless variety of possibilities, and it is when we
          interact with others that we observe that which completes us, makes us feel whole,
          satisfies us, and brings us to <italic>maat</italic>. In ancient Africa, the priests would
          say, “<italic>Amen-hotep</italic>,” meaning “the divine is satisfied,” when an action that
          was considered difficult or extraordinary had been achieved. One wanted to arrive at the
          point when every action, however small or large, would seem natural, expected, like water
          running off of a duck’s back. It is then that one would have achieved all the
          possibilities of <italic>nkrabea</italic> because there would be order, balance, and
          harmony.</p>

      <title>A Concluding Word</title>
      <p>Western consciousness carries the conviction that adults are masters of their fate.
        Unexpected events and mysterious coincidences challenge this cultural bias. For Westerners,
        however, these challenge can evoke a spiritual response—greater openness to dimensions of
        life that lie beyond autonomous personal control. Having a strong connection to their
        extended families and institutions, the Akan and the Chinese have a complex sense of
        personal agency in the interest of family and community. As we have shown, the concepts of
          <italic>yuan</italic> and <italic>nkrabea</italic> as well as other ideas must be explored
        in any attempt to construct a clear pathway to a holistic philosophy of communication. An
        appreciation of the various manifestations of African and Asian cultural concepts will
        broaden and enlighten the discourse in communication and other disciplines.</p>
