<abstract>
<p>This article considers some of the impacts of armed political conflicts on field supervision where supervisor and student are affiliated with different sides, as exemplified by the Jewish supervisor/Arab student dyad in social work training in Israel. This conflict, it suggests, impedes the development of a trusting supervisory bond, makes it difficult for supervisors to provide candid feedback and evaluation, and impairs the students’ development of professional identity. The article ends with detailed recommendations for dealing with the many practical issues that arise in field supervision in the context of armed conflicts.</p>

<p>The need for supervisors to exercise cultural sensitivity in supervising trainees/students of a different ethnic or religious group than their own is by now a commonplace of the helping professions. Supervisors are expected to be familiar with their supervisees’ cultures, to accept their cultures, and to take their norms and values into account in their supervisions. A large body of literature exists to help supervisors work effectively with supervisees of a large variety of ethnic and cultural groups. Examples include African Americans, Caucasian-Asian or Hispanic and many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872812447635">Burkard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020872812447635">Ladany et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0020872812447635">Toporek et al., 2004</xref>). There is also literature aimed at helping White supervisors work effectively with Black supervisees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872812447635">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872812447635">Cook and Helms, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0020872812447635">Leong and Wagner, 1994</xref>). Both sets of literature discuss culturally-based differences between supervisor and supervisee and the communication problems they cause. Both emphasize the pitfalls of stereotyping and prejudice, and the impact of therapists’ values and assumptions on their perceptions of the supervisee, the supervisor, and the supervisory relationship. In addition, the literature on the White supervisor/Black supervisee dyad also elaborates on the strong feelings (e.g. anger, guilt, mistrust, inferiority/superiority) that may enter into the supervisory relationship, and the problems created by its inherent power differential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872812447635">Bradshaw, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0020872812447635">Williams and Halgin, 1995</xref>). Both sets of literature offer training models that focus on helping supervisors identify and work through their feelings and perceptions with regard to the supervisee’s ethnic or racial group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812447635">Bernard and Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0020872812447635">McRoy et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0020872812447635">Peterson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0020872812447635">Ryan and Hendricks, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0020872812447635">Sue et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These sets of literature, however, do not address many issues that may arise in another type of supervisory dyad: namely, where supervisor and supervisee are affiliated with opposite sides of a violent political conflict. The issue is important because violent political conflicts exist in many parts of the world today. Israel and the former Yugoslavia are perhaps the most notable examples, but increasing numbers of countries in Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa are also potentially beset by them.</p>
<p>Wherever they occur, such conflicts tend to become part of the fabric of everyday life and to arouse strong emotions on all sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812447635">Al-Krenawi et al., 2004</xref>). They have been shown to affect the therapeutic relationship where therapist and patient are affiliated with opposing sides. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0020872812447635">Volkan (1994)</xref> has discussed their impact based on the experience of Cyprus. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872812447635">Gorkin (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0020872812447635">Yovell (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0020872812447635">2003</xref>) have discussed the impact of the longstanding Israeli-Arab conflict on the psychotherapy of Palestinian Israeli clients with Jewish Israeli clinicians. It would be surprising if the conflict did not affect the supervisory relationship in such situations as well.</p>
<p>This article considers some of those impacts in social work. A recently published book by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0020872812447635">Ramon (2008)</xref> deals with various aspects of social work in the context of political conflict in a variety of countries. Among others, the issues discussed include relations with clients, social work education and professional training, trauma, and a range of local issues particular to specific countries. This is the first book that deals in any depth or breadth with social work in the context of violent political conflict. It does not, however, discuss field supervision.</p>
<p>As the different sides of a violent political conflict are usually of different cultures and differ markedly in their power vis-a-vis the other, the literature on culturally or racially mixed supervisory dyads may be informative and helpful in improving the quality of supervision where the parties are affiliated with different sides of a violent political conflict as well. Without in any way slighting the contribution of those literatures, this article tries to cover issues that are outside their purview.</p>

<title>Background information</title>
<sec id="section2-0020872812447635">
<title>The conflict</title>
<p>The ongoing political conflict in which Israel has been embroiled since its inception has passed through various phases and definitions. It began with Arab objections to the influx of Jews into the region in the early part of the 20th century. Prior to the establishment of the state in 1948, the conflict was acted out mainly between the Jewish and Arab inhabitants of the area, as local Arabs attempted to prevent the Jewish settlement of the land. With Israel’s War of Independence, when the newly declared state was attacked by five Arab armies, the conflict morphed to one with the Arab states and has remained so for several decades, through several more wars. Then, with the rise of the Palestine Liberation Organization on the one hand, and the signing of the Israel–Egypt peace accord and the cessation of wars with the Arab states on the other, the conflict was re-defined as a conflict with the Palestinians in the territories which were acquired by Israel in the 1967 war and are beyond Israel’s internationally recognized borders. On the whole, the Arabs within the state of Israel did not participate either in the wars between Israel and the Arab states or in the terrorism that has beset the country throughout its existence. Many, however, have family and other personal ties with Palestinians beyond the borders. Even those who do not are deeply troubled by their plight and identify with their sufferings in the course of the violent conflict with Israel. In addition, they were, and still are, generally viewed as a hostile population by the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872812447635">Benziman and Mansoor, 1992</xref>) and by substantial portions of the Jewish citizenry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872812447635">Bar-Tal and Teichman, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020872812447635">
<title>Terminological issues</title>
<p>Arab citizens of Israel variously term themselves Arab-Israelis, Palestinian-Israelis, and Palestinian citizens of Israel, depending on their self-identity, or self-perception, vis-a-vis the state of Israel, the Arab people as a whole, and the Palestinians in particular. Along similar lines, scholars choose their nomenclature in accord with their political beliefs or with demands for political correctness. In this article, unless otherwise indicated, the terms ‘Arab-Israeli’ and ‘Palestinian’ are used to refer to the Arab, or Palestinian, citizens of Israel. These persons are distinguished from the rest of the Arabs in the Middle East and from the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank by virtue of the facts that they live within the pre-1967 internationally recognized borders of the state and are accorded the rights of Israeli citizenship. In this article, I have chosen to use the term ‘Arab-Israelis’ (shortened to ‘Arab’ as an adjective; e.g. ‘Arab students’, ‘Arab supervisors’) when speaking in my own voice, but have adopted the term ‘Palestinian’ when referring to scholars who use it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020872812447635">
<title>Cultural and power differences</title>
<p>Arab-Israelis make up nearly 20 percent of the population of the state of Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872812447635">Central Bureau of Statistics, 2006</xref>). The Arab and Jewish populations in Israel are characterized by both cultural differences and power differences. Arab political scientists in Israel repeatedly point out that Arabs in Israel are a non-assimilationist minority who differ from Israeli Jews in language, religion, nationality, and culture (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812447635">Al-Haj, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812447635">Barakat, 1993</xref>). Scholars in the helping professions, many of them Arab Israelis, observe major differences in concepts of the individual and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872812447635">Al-Krenawi, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812447635">Al-Krenawi and Graham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872812447635">Dwairy and Van-Sickle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872812447635">Haj-Yahia, 1995</xref>). Moreover, although Israel’s Declaration of Independence envisions a state with equal rights for all its citizens, Arab Israelis are a badly discriminated against group (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812447635">Al-Haj and Rosenfeld, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020872812447635">Haidar, 1994</xref>). They suffer open discrimination in matters ranging from education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872812447635">Adva Center, 2000</xref>) and healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872812447635">Epstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872812447635">Epstein and Horev, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020872812447635">Horev, 2008</xref>) through wages and employment (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020872812447635">Khattab, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0020872812447635">Kraus and Yonay, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0020872812447635">Lewin and Stier, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This article focuses on the Jewish supervisor/Arab student dyad in social work training in Israel. Israeli institutions of higher education have non-discriminatory admissions policies and in recent years there have been increasing numbers of Arab students in most college and university departments. In some Social Work faculties, Arab-Israeli students make up as much as 25 to 30 percent of the total enrollment. Upon graduation, most of them are employed in jobs where they deal with Arab clients (e.g. in municipal services in Arab areas) or a mixture of Arab and Jewish clients. The vast majority of social workers in Israel are Jewish, however. As a result, most Arab-Israeli social work students receive fieldwork supervision by Jewish supervisors, while many Jewish Israeli supervisors have at least some Palestinian Israeli supervisees over the years.</p>
<p>The following discussion is based on a) research on this and related subjects that I have carried out over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872812447635">Baum, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872812447635">2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812447635">2007</xref>), b) my long experience as an instructor and tutor of social work students and field supervisors, and c) existing literature on social work and psychological intervention in the shadow of violent political conflicts in Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872812447635">Baum, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812447635">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872812447635">2011</xref>) and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0020872812447635">Ramon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0020872812447635">Volkan, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Three areas of impact can be identified: the supervisory bond, feedback and evaluation, and the development of students’ professional identity.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020872812447635">
<title>The supervisory bond</title>
<p>Successful field instruction requires agreement on goals, agreement on the tasks needed to achieve them, and an interpersonal bond characterized by mutual trust, acceptance, and confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872812447635">Fox, 1998</xref>). Several studies carried out in Israel show that forming such a bond may be difficult for Arab students and Jewish supervisors. Two studies of the supervision experiences of Arab-Israeli social work students and their Jewish Israeli field supervisors show that there were supervisors who felt their Arab students did not trust them, that they themselves felt wary of ‘hurting’ the students, and that there were ‘taboo’ topics that could not be discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872812447635">Haj-Yahia and Roer-Strier, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0020872812447635">Roer-Strier and Haj-Yahia, 1998</xref>). More recently, a study of Jewish Israeli field supervisors quotes them as expressing uncertainty about how open and honest the relationship could be and saying that they believed that establishing a trusting supervisory relationship with an Arab student requires a greater investment in time and effort than establishing such a relationship with a Jewish student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447635">Baum, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature on social work field supervision observes a range of obstacles to developing and maintaining the desired supervisory bond. These include, among others, the inherently hierarchical nature of the relationship and the fact that supervisors must give supervisees ongoing feedback and evaluate their progress and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812447635">Bernard and Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872812447635">Bogo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020872812447635">Falender and Shafronske, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872812447635">Freeman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0020872812447635">Kadushin and Harkness, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0020872812447635">Murdin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0020872812447635">Shulman, 1993</xref>). Racial and cultural differences may also create obstacles. The literature on culturally and racially mixed dyads similarly notes tendencies to avoid discussing racial and cultural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872812447635">Constantine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872812447635">Estrada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020872812447635">Helms and Cook, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020872812447635">Hird et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020872812447635">Jernigan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0020872812447635">Pope et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0020872812447635">Sue and Sue, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The difficulties in agreeing on goals and the means to attain them may be attributed to conflicting values stemming from cultural differences. Such difficulties have been noted in the literature on the White supervisor/Black supervisee dyad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0020872812447635">Ryan and Hendricks, 1989</xref>). The literature on White supervisor/Black supervisory dyads similarly notes that the relationship can be fraught (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872812447635">Black et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872812447635">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872812447635">Estrada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020872812447635">Hird et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020872812447635">Jernigan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0020872812447635">Williams and Halgin, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The protracted and very much alive conflict, however, certainly exacerbates the difficulties. Strictly speaking, the violent conflict has been between Israel and the Palestinians beyond the country’s internationally recognized borders. The Arab citizens of Israel have largely refrained from taking part in the violence. Many, however, have family ties with Palestinians beyond Israel’s borders, identify with their situation, and harbour negative feelings towards Jews and the state of Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020872812447635">Ghanem, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0020872812447635">Levinson et al., 1995</xref>). Substantial proportions of Jewish Israelis, for their part, view Arab Israelis as a ‘hostile minority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0020872812447635">Mahameed and Guttmann, 1983</xref>) who hate them and desire the destruction of the state (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020872812447635">Keren et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0020872812447635">Mayseless and Gal, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The mutual suspicions and antagonisms have been shown to affect the therapeutic relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872812447635">Gorkin (1987)</xref> reports efforts on the part of Jewish therapists to distance themselves from their Arab patients, derived not only from ambivalence towards Arab culture but also from deep-seated fear of close contact with ‘the enemy’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0020872812447635">Yovell (2003)</xref> provides vivid examples of transference and counter-transference suspicion and hostility in his therapy with Palestinian Israeli patients. Writing about psychotherapy against the background of the conflict in Cyprus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0020872812447635">Volkan (1994)</xref> discourses at length about the ‘enemy presence’, which, he claims, tends to occupy our thoughts and to dictate our unconscious processes, and gives rise to special transference and counter-transference responses in the therapeutic encounter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020872812447635">Gorkin et al. (1985)</xref> suggest that even where Arab patients choose to work with Jewish therapists, as some do, developing trust is likely to be problematic, since most Arab patients are ambivalent about the therapist’s Jewishness. Given the documentation of the penetration of the conflict into the therapeutic relationship, it is unlikely that it would not affect the supervisory relationship in similar ways. Indeed, several of the supervisors interviewed by the author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447635">Baum, in press</xref>) spoke of difficulties they experienced or anticipated in establishing a good supervisory alliance with their Arab supervisees against the background of the ongoing conflict.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0020872812447635">
<title>Feedback and evaluation</title>
<p>Ongoing feedback and formal evaluation are integral parts of fieldwork instruction and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872812447635">Bogo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872812447635">Freeman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020872812447635">Kadushin, 1992</xref>). Most supervisory sessions include feedback on the students’ interventions and skills, as well as observations about their personal motives, abilities, and limitations. Under the best of circumstances feedback and evaluation are extremely sensitive processes, and all the more so with students. Given students’ limited experience and skills, their supervisors usually have to point out a great many oversights, errors, and blind spots. The students, for their part, have to muster a great deal of ego strength to take such commentary as well intentioned and helpful rather than as simply critical.</p>
<p>Several factors may impair the ability of Jewish Israeli supervisors to provide incisive feedback and evaluation to their Arab students. One is the fear of ‘hurting’ their Arab students. Haj-Yahia and Roer-Strier report that supervisors told that their fear of ‘hurting’ their Arab students led them to temper their demands and expectations of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872812447635">Haj-Yahia and Roer-Strier, 1999</xref>). The author similarly found that many supervisors considered the pros and cons of making concessions to their Arab trainees on account of these and other difficulties they faced, which Jewish trainees did not.</p>
<p>The literature on supervision of Black trainees by White supervisors, which reports similar behaviors, attributes them mainly to supervisors’ fears of being labeled racist if they seem to come down too hard on their Black students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020872812447635">Jernigan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0020872812447635">Williams and Halgin, 1995</xref>). Similar fears have been reported to me by Jewish supervisors of Arab students in Israel, who told that they were especially careful in expressing their feedback lest it be construed as reflecting anti-Arab feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447635">Baum, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Three other sources of inhibition may also be suggested. The first is the distrust that the supervisors feel from their Arab students. Supervisors who sense that their supervisees distrust them may withhold feedback in the effort to win their trust. Supervisors who have gained their supervisees’ trust may be less than candid in their feedback and evaluations for fear of losing it.</p>
<p>A second possible source lies in the supervisors’ negative feelings towards Arabs. Supervisors who share the distrust towards Arabs that the ongoing conflict has engendered in many Jewish Israelis may censor their feedback and evaluations of their Arab students so as to keep those feelings, which are unacceptable in the supervisory process, from rising to the surface.</p>
<p>A third possible source may be guilt feelings towards Arabs on the part of some Jewish supervisors. In a study of Jewish Israeli social work students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872812447635">Baum (2006a)</xref> found expressions of guilt both about the discrimination against Arab citizens in Israel and about the occupation of the territories acquired by Israel in the 1967 war. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872812447635">Gorkin (1987)</xref>, therapists’ guilt reactions stemming from the belief that Israel caused harm to its Arab citizens produced counter-reactions consisting, among other things, of efforts to compensate the patient and internal pressure to avoid conflict.</p>

<title>Development of professional identity</title>
<p>Students develop their professional identities mainly through their interactions with their clients and supervisors. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020872812447635">Friedman and Kaslow (1986)</xref>, acceptance by their clients as ‘real therapists’ helps them to slowly attain a sense of professional responsibility and competence. Given their lack of experience and undeveloped professional skills, most student therapists are likely to have at least some clients who doubt their abilities. Some encounter clients who are dissatisfied with their performance and who drop out of the therapy soon after they start it.</p>
<p>Arab social work students in Israel encounter much more blatant rejection on account of their being Arabs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447635">Baum (in press)</xref> and Roer-Streir and Haj Yahia (1998) report that Arab trainees were sometimes rejected by service users who viewed them as the ‘enemy’ and refused to accept services from them. Such rejections, so early in the students’ professional development, sap their self-confidence and undermine their ability to form a professional identity as competent social workers.</p>
<p>Moreover, supervisors are instrumental in the students’ development of a professional identity through their provision of feedback and evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872812447635">Bogo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872812447635">Freeman, 1985</xref>) and through serving as role models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872812447635">Fox, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020872812447635">Hensley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0020872812447635">Kadushin and Harkness, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0020872812447635">Murdin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0020872812447635">Pettes, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0020872812447635">Shulman, 1993</xref>). Feedback and evaluations are essential to the students’ development of professional skills and perspective, as well as to their developing awareness of their strengths and weaknesses and other qualities as clinicians. Supervisors’ wariness in providing candid feedback to their Arab students and their leniency towards them may impede these processes.</p>
<p>The impediments to the supervisors’ serving as effective role models would come from the ambivalence of Arab students towards their Jewish supervisors. Even where the students view their supervisors as ‘good’ professionals, they may see them as representatives of the enemy group. Such ambivalence could make it difficult for the students to perform two actions that the literature regards as essential to students’ development of professional identity. One is to learn from or imitate the supervisor’s actions as a social worker. The other, in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872812447635">Fox (1998)</xref>, is to ‘transform interactions with and characteristics of their field instructor into inner regulations’ (p. 64).</p>

<title>Practical issues and recommendations</title>
<p>The main question that arises from the above account is how to deal with the difficulties of supervision where supervisor and supervisee are on opposite sides of an armed political conflict. This is a very large and complex issue, beyond the scope of this article. The following pages address a smaller but basic question that must be addressed first. This is whether the supervisor should bring the existence and implications of the conflict into the supervisory sessions, and when.</p>
<p>According to Haj Yahia and Roer-Streir’s studies, the national identity of the supervisor and student and the tensions in their relationship that arise from the violent conflict are ‘taboos’ beyond discussion, as are terror attacks, the reactions to them, and the Arab students’ experiences and suspicions of rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872812447635">Haj-Yahia and Roer-Strier, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0020872812447635">Roer-Strier and Haj-Yahia, 1998</xref>). More recently, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447635">Baum (in press)</xref> found that Jewish supervisors were most reluctant to speak of these issues.</p>
<p>Reasons for the avoidance include the widely-held belief that political issues are irrelevant to supervision, just as they are to clinical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872812447635">Bar-On, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812447635">Berman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0020872812447635">Shamai, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0020872812447635">Shamai and Bohem, 2001</xref>), as well as supervisors’ fears of the strong negative feelings that acknowledging the conflict and making room for it may evoke, whether in themselves or in their supervisees. The avoidance, however, may have undesirable consequences. As shown above, when the nationalities of the students and supervisors place them on opposite sides of a violent conflict, the conflict is an inevitable and even salient feature of their relationship. Excluding the conflict means excluding an important aspect of the realities of student and supervisor alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0020872812447635">Ramon et al., 2006</xref>). It creates a falsity in their relationship, which makes it impossible for either supervisor or student to get beyond their initial distrust and to communicate with candour and freedom. It also makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for students to share with their supervisors experiences with clients and colleagues that are related to their nationality, and to obtain help in dealing with them. It also relays the wrong message to the student – that there are subjects that should not be spoken about – which the student may carry into his or her work as a professional.</p>
<p>Most writers on supervision in racially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020872812447635">Jernigan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0020872812447635">Williams and Halgin, 1995</xref>) and culturally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020872812447635">Hird et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0020872812447635">Ryan and Hendricks, 1989</xref>) mixed dyads strongly recommend discussing the issue. The writers on racially mixed dyads emphasize that excluding racial issues from the supervision teaches Black students to exclude the issues from their clinical work. Studies of culturally mixed supervisory dyads have found that discussion of cultural variables in the supervisory relationship increased supervisees’ satisfaction with supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020872812447635">Gatmon et al., 2001</xref>) and was associated with positive supervisory experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020872812447635">Hilton et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Acknowledging the reality of a violent political conflict in supervision may be more difficult and complex than acknowledging racial or cultural differences. This is because of the strength of the negative feelings that the conflict arouses, whether hate and hostility, threat or fear, or shame or guilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0020872812447635">Kaminsky and Bar-Tal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0020872812447635">Mayseless and Gal, 1996</xref>). Writing on inter-racial supervisory dyads, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0020872812447635">Peterson (1991)</xref> observes that although issues of race and ethnicity are anchored in past history, they are also very much attuned to and influenced by the realities of the present on both an individual and systemic level. When the conflict is a current and very much alive one, as is the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians today, the divisive issues and feelings are constantly refueled and intensified with every act of violence, whichever side commits it. Yet it is precisely the strength of the feelings that make it so important to acknowledge the conflict in supervision, no less than in therapy.</p>
<p>Although the conflict creates difficulties for both student and supervisor, it is the supervisors’ responsibility to deal with its repercussions in the supervisory relationship, so as to enable the full professional development of their students on the other side of the political divide. The literature on supervision emphasizes the importance of creating a safe environment in which supervisees can speak freely, without fear of being judged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020872812447635">Hensley, 2002</xref>). Where the supervisor and supervisee are identified with different sides of a violent political conflict, even more is required. Supervisors must also create a situation in which their supervisees can bring up their experiences, including experiences of rejection, and feelings related to their being part of a group identified with the rival side of the political conflict.</p>
<p>As part of their responsibility, supervisors must also actively address any politically-based hostility or rejection faced by their students. Superficially, the surest way to spare trainees from a rival group rejection by clients, with all its deleterious consequences, is to assign them clients from their own group. Thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872812447635">Haj-Yahia and Roer-Strier (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0020872812447635">Roer-Strier and Haj-Yahia (1998)</xref> suggest that Arab Israeli students in their first year of fieldwork training be assigned only Arab Israeli clients. Such exclusive assignment, however, may have its own undesirable consequences. As observed both in studies of the Jewish-Arab supervisory dyad in Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447635">Baum, in press</xref>) and in studies of the White–Black supervisory dyad in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020872812447635">Kadushin, 1985</xref>), such assignment can lead to the supervisor’s own exclusion from the process, which precludes the provision of adequate supervision. Moreover, assigning students exclusively same group clients constricts their opportunity to choose, even when they become professionals, to work with clients from the other group as well. The task, and challenge, for supervisors is to assign their trainees clients from the other group without exposing them to rejection. The way to do this is for the supervisor to first explore the matter with the prospective client, much as they explore whether the client is willing to accept a student trainee. Trainees should be assigned only clients who are willing to accept them.</p>
<p>With respect to timing, both the racial and cultural literatures recommend that supervisors raise the issue of the difference between them and the student early on in the supervisory process. This recommendation applies equally to supervision with a client affiliated with the opposing group in a violent political conflict. Mentioning the issue early on, without pressing the student to talk about it, signals that the supervisor is aware that it is a relevant issue and is open to discussing it at such time as the student is ready. In addition, it is advisable for supervisors to mention the fact of a terror attack whenever it occurs – both to acknowledge its impact on both their own and their students’ feelings and to prepare the student to cope with the negative reactions they may receive from clients and colleagues affiliated with the other side.</p>
<p>With this, it should not be assumed that every interaction and every decision can be attributed to the conflict. Moreover, it would be a mistake for supervisors to walk on eggshells, so to speak. Withholding negative feedback and lowering demands, whether for fear of ‘hurting’ the student or of being accused of prejudice, can only hamper the students’ learning and professional development. It is also recommended that where supervisors have difficulty speaking freely and candidly to students from the other group and holding them to the same standards of performance as students from their own group, they should be given help in doing so. Such help might take the form of preparatory training and ongoing supervision and support.</p>
<p>To be able to do all that has been suggested above, supervisors must, first of all, undertake constant self-examination to identify and work through their stereotypes and prejudices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447635">Baum, in press</xref>), as well as their feelings towards their supervisees on the other side of the political divide. The need for identification and working through applies not only to negative feelings like anger, fear, aversion, and stress, but also to more positive emotions such as curiosity, pity, and enthusiasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447635">Baum, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>This work they should not be left to do on their own. Schools of social work should do more than they apparently do to prepare their field supervisors to supervise trainees affiliated with a rival group. While cultural sensitivity is an integral part of the training and supervision of field supervisors working with racial, ethnic, and religious minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0020872812447635">Sue et al., 2007</xref>), there is as yet little recognition of the need for political sensitivity. For the sake of their student trainees, schools of social work must take a more proactive role in helping their field supervisors to develop it. They should encourage and help the supervisors to acquaint themselves with the emerging knowledge on the impacts of political conflict on students and supervisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447635">Baum, in press</xref>). Equally important, they should provide ongoing forums where field supervisors can examine, discuss, and work through their attitudes and feelings towards their supervisees identified with the rival group, as well as share the doubts, difficulties, and dilemmas they encounter in supervising them.</p>
