<p>To review a book, the reviewer must read the book (although some reviews read suspiciously like the back cover blurbs). If ordinary readers find themselves reproducing the high school experience of slogging through <italic>Silas Marner</italic> or <italic>The Mayor of Casterbridge</italic>, they will discard the book impatiently and fire up a session of TOTAL WAR-NAPOLEON. The reviewer must continue, as he is not reading for himself, but for the putative purchaser of the book or the possible student or researcher building a bibliography.</p>
<p>Ian Bogost’s <italic>How to Do Things With Videogames</italic> is no doubt written for students of the media in general and of video games in particular. It has the qualities of a good university work. The scholarship is solid enough, with 178 video games and several references for each chapter listed at the end. The chapters are rigorously constructed; each theme is treated within seven pages, with a margin of error of one page. Occasional asides suggest the author’s deeper culture, as when he traces the DNA of football to the Roman arena games. The title is rather misleading. The reader would expect suggestions for the use of games in different fields, teaching or practicing certain competencies, or possibly experimentation with simulations.</p>
<p>In fact, the author shows how different aspects of life, art, and work find themselves in video games. The fields are art, empathy, reverence, music, pranks, transit, branding (in the commercial sense), electioneering, promotion, snapshots, texture, kitsch, relaxation, throwaways, titillation, exercise, work, habituation, disinterest, and drill. Many of these seem forced, and their inclusion is made possible by the absence of definition of a game, except as a medium compared with the press and television. Games as venue for practical jokes—pranks—comes across as a distorted idea, although this may be due to this reviewer’s allergy to practical jokes. By music, Bogost in fact means dance simulators, so that while the concept may work as a support to play, it is not exactly an obvious game. A throwaway is a game with low commitment, in energy or learning effort, and so is more exactly a toy. Textures are represented by analogies, which makes for the clever twist of a simulation of an analogy, which brings us definitely into the realm of philosophy.</p>
<p>In all, the book is interesting as an exercise in stretching the definition of video games in as many directions as possible. As we have a sociology of games, and a history of games, <italic>How to Do Things With Videogames</italic> is best understood as a study in the philosophy of games. The twists and turns of all the aspects treated in games do lead to a meaningful reflection, that video games are spreading from the world of gamers to the world of ordinary people. Bogost underlines the difference between a gamer’s game, epitomized by Sid Meir’s CIVILIZATION, and what he calls a tame game, a game for ordinary people, exemplified by STONE CITY, a game on working in an ice cream parlor. A gamer’s game is long and complex, proposes many variables, and requires concentration and hard thinking, whereas a tame game is quick to learn and basically provides a simple pleasure, such as making ice cream cones.</p>
<p>The effort is clever, although it is likely to be of interest more to the gamers than to the ice cream makers. In the end, Bogost says in many words that some people like long and complex activities, and others like simpler ones, which adds little to our understanding. His whole project only makes sense by ignoring most of the thinking that has gone into games before computers, which seems to be an unfortunate tendency in recent works on games. Basically, a computer game is a programmed model of some actual activity, sometimes a real game, such as football, sometimes an undertaking like running a war or a civilization. For a long time, we have had models of complex human activities, such as wars, that are built with physical objects like maps, counters, and attending rulebooks. The machines are useful in managing such models because they accelerate the analyses, but they are not in themselves a new media.</p>
<p>Perhaps the effort at ignoring the general world of games is deliberate. Bogost makes a very strange statement in his introduction:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And unlike playground games or board games, videogames are computational, so the model worlds and sets of rules they produce can be far more complex. (p. 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Either he is ignoring the very complex games published by editors such as Simulations Publications, which later became Decision Games, or he is using an unstated, but limitative, definition of game. Let us exclude the possibility that he has never heard of these games. The war games in question are very complex indeed, running to 30 or 40 pages of rules with a few hundred playing pieces. Many of these games now have a computer tool for managing the complex calculations and movements, available from Decision Games, so that the computer adds no complexity, but accelerates the management of complexity. Bogost is trying too hard to sell the magic quality of video games.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <italic>How to Do Things With Videogames</italic> reminds this viewer of modern atonal music. It is a very clever production; it demonstrates the author’s talent and wit, and can be of interest to those who appreciate mastery of a style. However, just as the atonal music has little to do with the general world of music, the book is disconnected from the wider world of games and does not contribute much to our understanding of games, or even computer games. An article in this journal on the theme would have been a sufficient contribution to the subject of games for nongamers.</p>

<p><bold>Pierre Corbeil</bold> holds degrees from the University of Toronto (Canada) and from the Université de Montréal (Québec). After war games, historical games, and intercultural games, he became interested in entrepreneurship and has published a collection of games on that subject, <italic>Entreprendre par le jeu.</italic> Recently, he received North American Simulation and Gaming Association’s (NASAGA) coveted Ifill-Raynolds Award for Lifetime Contribution to the field of gaming. He believes that games favor invention over classification and defines history as the illusion of reality recreated generation after generation. He still plays war games and writes science-fiction (in French).</p>
