<abstract>
<p>This study explores the behavior of textile fabrics under thermal exposures. The performance of thermal protective textile fabric systems with different structural features was evaluated under laboratory simulated thermal exposures. The study demonstrated that the protective performance of textile fabric systems varies with different types of thermal exposure. To provide effective protection in flame and radiant-heat exposures, the most important fabric properties to address are emissivity, absorptivity and thermal resistance. In hot surface exposures, the compression property of the fabric systems is the primary feature to consider for protection. Hot water and steam exposures produce mass transfer through fabrics. In the presence of water or steam jet pressure, fabric compression is a primary factor in protecting the human body. The findings obtained in this study can be used to engineer fabric systems that provide better protection from various thermal exposures.</p>

<body>
<p>According to the United States Fire Administration Statistics, every year nearly 75,000 to 85,000 firefighters are injured while fighting fires, rescuing people, and responding to hazardous material incidents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512461707">1</xref></sup> Industrial workers are subjected to workplace injuries due to electrical flashes, slag burns, gaseous burns, flame burns, scalds, and chemical burns. While the majority of such injuries are minor, a significant number are debilitating and career-ending. Protective clothing is the only barrier between these workers and the skin burns that can result from thermal hazards; thus, the performance of this clothing must be constantly updated by implementing new fabric systems that have been evaluated in the laboratory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512461707">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512461707"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512461707">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The performance of protective clothing varies with the type of exposure, the structural features of the clothing, and the characteristics of the fabric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512461707">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512461707"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512461707"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512461707"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512461707"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512461707"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512461707"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512461707">9</xref></sup> Loose-fitting clothing with controlled fullness and appropriate closures provided better thermal protection than close-fitting clothing when flash fire experiments were performed on a manikin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512461707">2</xref></sup> Loose-fitting clothing has more air gaps than close-fitting clothing and the air gaps improve the thermal protection. The style, size, fit, ease, and drape of garments together with attributes such as cuffs, pockets, and closures affect the number of air layers between the wearer’s body and the garment, improving the thermal protective performance of the clothing in flame exposures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512461707">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512461707"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512461707">5</xref></sup> The impact of clothing features on thermal protective performance in flame exposure using the PyroMan flash fire manikin evaluation system was also investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512461707">6</xref></sup> It has been shown that if the number of air gaps inside the clothing structure is high, the body is better insulated and the clothing provides better thermal protection in flame exposure.</p>
<p>Heat and mass transfer to a wearer’s body can be improved by careful selection of textile fabric. Textile fabric is generally a porous media that comprises two phases—solid (consisting of solid fibers) and gas (consisting of water vapor and dry air).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512461707">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512461707">11</xref></sup> The compression property of the fabric plays an important role when thermal energy is transferred through a person’s clothing to the person’s body through physical contact with a hot object.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512461707">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512461707"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512461707">14</xref></sup> Significant compression mainly reduces the amount of the gaseous phase inside the fabric structure, which in turn lowers the thermal insulation of the fabric. As a result, the thermal protective performance reduces. The heat transfer in flame and radiant-heat exposures is controlled mainly by the gas and vapor phases in the fabric structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512461707">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Benisek and Phillips<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512461707">7</xref></sup> analyzed the thermal protective performance of single layered and double layered fabrics in high intensity flame exposures. They found that the thickness and weight of fabrics affected their protective performance, and that the protection of double layered fabrics was much higher than that of single layered fabrics. The thermal protective performance of single layered fabrics was affected by changes in the intensity of thermal exposure and by the thickness and weight of the fabric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512461707">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512461707">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a combined exposure of flame and radiant-heat that resembled an actual fire hazard scenario, the thermal energy transmitted through fabric could cause skin burn injuries, especially in radiant-heat exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512461707">16</xref></sup> The thermal energy transfer rate was lower in thick fabrics than in thin fabrics and air permeability did not significantly affect the transfer of thermal energy. The air permeability has little or no impact on thermal protective performance.</p>
<p>The fabric weight and thickness are the main properties to consider while analyzing fabric performance in low intensity radiant-heat exposures. Through statistical analysis, it has been confirmed that fabric weight and thickness are positively associated with thermal protective performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512461707">17</xref></sup> Fabrics with a high weight and thickness entrap more dead air than thinner fabrics, and this air could help to insulate the wearer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512461707">18</xref></sup> However, the thick fabrics store more energy than thin fabrics in low intensity radiant-heat exposures, and this stored energy is released due to a better contact between fabric and human skin during and after the exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512461707">9</xref></sup> This released energy causes a quick burn injury on the wearer’s skin and consequently lowers the performance of the thermal protective clothing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512461707">19</xref></sup> The textile fabrics absorb moisture due to perspiration from a sweating firefighter; this absorbed moisture increases the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of textile fibers, lowering the thermal protective performance of the fabric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512461707">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512461707">20</xref></sup> In contrast, it was also notable that if a fabric absorbs a significantly high amount of water (more than 15% of its weight), this situation ultimately provides a cooling effect to the firefighters by reducing the thermal energy transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512461707">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>If moisture that has accumulated inside the fabric structure turns to steam during a thermal exposure, the steam could diffuse toward the skin depending upon fabric characteristics, leading to skin burn.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512461707">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0040517512461707"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512461707"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517512461707"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0040517512461707">25</xref></sup> Similarly, water used by firefighters to extinguish flames may generate steam in the environment and thus be transferred through a firefighter’s clothing to produce skin burn. The water vapor permeability is the most important fabric property to consider for effective protection in steam exposures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512461707">21</xref></sup> An impermeable membrane inside the fabric layers might significantly prevent steam transfer and reduce the burn injuries of the wearers. A thick fabric with an impermeable membrane provides better protection from steam than a thick fabric with a semi-permeable membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0040517512461707">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512461707">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ackerman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0040517512461707">26</xref></sup> characterized high performance textile fabric systems in hot liquid (water, water based drilling mud, canola oil) exposures at 85℃. The drilling mud (manufactured by SAGDRIL) and canola oil were mainly used to simulate industrial and kitchen hazards, respectively. It was observed that both the density and heat capacity of water at 85℃ were the highest among all liquids, whereas the viscosity of water at 85℃ was the lowest. It has been found that the protective performance of the textile fabric systems depended on fabric properties (e.g., weight, thickness, air permeability, finishing) and the heat capacities of the liquids. It has also been found that air permeability of a fabric system was negatively associated with protective performance and that fabrics with encapsulated fiber finishing provided the best protection against all types of hot liquid. Fabric performance was the lowest for hot water; this was thought to be mainly because the heat capacity of hot water is higher than the heat capacity of drilling mud and canola oil.</p>
<p>Based on the above discussion, a great deal of research made considerable efforts to characterize thermal protective fabrics under specific thermal exposures. However, few or hardly any researcher studied the characteristics of fabrics or fabric systems under all types of thermal exposures. In this study, based on Mandal and Song’s recent study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0040517512461707">27</xref></sup> the behavior of textile fabrics under thermal exposures was explored and characterized. The performance of thermal protective textile fabric systems with different structural features was evaluated under laboratory simulated thermal exposures.</p>

<p>In manufactured thermal protective clothing, three layered fabric systems are generally used—an outer shell, a moisture barrier, and a thermal liner. In this study, high performance fabrics were selected for the three layers based on fiber content, weave structure, and thickness, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512461707">Table 1</xref>. The fabrics employed are commercially available and commonly used in the manufacturing of thermal protective clothing. By assembling these fabrics, various fabric systems (single layered, double layered, and three layered) were developed and their physical properties were measured according to American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) standards (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512461707">Table 2</xref>).

<sec id="sec3-0040517512461707"><title>Test conditions and approaches</title>
<p>The protective performances of the selected single layered, double layered, and three layered fabric systems (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512461707">Table 2</xref>) were tested by bench-scale tests. For testing in dry condition, fabric systems were preconditioned for 24 hours at 21 ± 1℃, 65 ± 2% relative humidity. Then fabric systems were subjected to thermal exposures long enough for the time required to generate a second degree burn on human skin to be calculated. Three samples of each fabric system were tested. The mean deviation of calculated burn time was maintained within the limits of  ± 2.5%.</p>
<p>During thermal exposure, the energy transmitted through the fabric system was measured every 0.1 seconds by a skin simulant sensor. The modified ASTM F 1930-00 (standard test method for the evaluation of flame resistant clothing for protection against flash fire simulations using an instrumented manikin) standard method was followed to predict the second degree burn injury. In this process, the skin simulant sensor worked according to the skin model. The thermal energy transmission within the sensor was represented as a transient, one dimensional heat diffusion problem in which the temperature within the human skin (epidermis layer) and under the human skin (dermis, subcutaneous layers) varies with skin depth and exposure time. Using this skin model, the skin burn injury was calculated based on Henrique’s burn integral equation.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0040517512461707"><title>Flame exposures</title>
<p>Protective performance in flame exposure was measured using the modified ISO 9151 testing approach shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461707">Figure 1</xref>. The flame was delivered from a Meker propane gas burner with a diameter of 38 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461707">Figure 1(a)</xref>). The burner was adjusted to deliver a heat flux of 84 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. The fabric sample (10  cm × 10  cm) was mounted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461707">Figure 1(b)</xref>) above the burner using the specimen support frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461707">Figure 1(c)</xref>) with the outer layer of the fabric system facing the burner. The fabric sample was protected from the heat source before and after the test run. At the time of the test, the burner was placed under the fabric sample and the flame was delivered for a time that depended on the fabric system. The thermal energy transferred through the fabric sample was measured using a skin simulant sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461707">Figure 1(d)</xref>) mounted on an insulation board (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461707">Figure 1(e)</xref>) and located behind the fabric sample. The heat flux history measured by the skin simulant sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461707">Figure 1(f)</xref>) was recorded and the second degree burn time was calculated by the software program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461707">Figure 1(g)</xref>).

<p>To measure fabric protective performance in radiant-heat exposure, the cone calorimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512461707">Figure 2</xref>) test was conducted with a modified ASTM E 1354 testing approach. Heat was generated by a truncated cone-shaped electrically heated (5000 W, 240 V) coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512461707">Figure 2 (a)</xref>) adjusted to deliver a heat flux of 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup>.

<p>The hot water exposure test was conducted using a modified ASTM F 2701 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512461707">Figure 4</xref>) method. The fabric system sample was mounted on an inclined (45°) sensor board (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512461707">Figure 4 (a)</xref>) made of nonconductive, liquid and heat resistant material. The sensor board had two skin simulant sensors—an upper sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512461707">Figure 4 (b1)</xref>) representing a direct exposure point of the fabric system to the hot water, and a lower sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512461707">Figure 4 (b2)</xref>) representing an off-direct exposure point of the fabric system to the hot water. Hot water was prepared in a circulating bath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512461707">Figure 4 (c)</xref>) and its temperature was maintained at 85℃ using a temperature control device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512461707">Figure 4 (d)</xref>). The hot water was circulated through a circulation valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512461707">Figure 4 (f)</xref>) attached with a flow controlled valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512461707">Figure 4 (e)</xref>). This circulation process helped to warm-up the water pipe in order to regulate the water temperature within the pipe at 85℃. Using a water tap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512461707">Figure 4 (g)</xref>), the hot water was passed through the water outlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512461707">Figure 4 (h)</xref>). By employing a thermocouple at the front of the outlet, the water temperature was constantly monitored. It was observed that the temperature at the outlet reached closed to 85℃ within 0.5 seconds immediately after opening the water tap. Then, the fabric sample was continuously exposed to the hot water for a duration that was calculated to generate a second degree burn according to the fabric system being tested. The thermal energy (in the form of heat and mass transmitted through the fabric sample) at the direct exposure points was measured using skin simulant sensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512461707">Figure 4 (b1) and (b2)</xref>).

<p>During flame exposure, the flame was produced through the controlled combustion of flammable propane gas. The flame generates a jet of hot gaseous molecules that move toward the fabric surface. As the moving air mass imposes thermal energy on the fabric system, convection is the primary mode of heat transfer in flame exposure. As some thermal energy radiates from the flame surface toward the fabric, radiation is the secondary mode of heat transfer in flame exposure. In radiant-heat exposure, electromagnetic waves radiate from a conical electrical heat source toward the fabric system, imposing electromagnetic energy on the fabric system; therefore, radiation is the primary mode of heat transfer. Physical contact between the fabric system and a hot surface results in conduction being the primary mode of heat transfer in hot surface exposure. Convection (moving water molecules) is the primary modes of mass and heat transfer in steam and hot water exposures.</p>
<p>The protective performance of fabric systems varies under each type of thermal exposure. Flame, radiant-heat, and hot surface exposures transferred mainly heat through the fabric system; whereas, mainly a mass transfer through water containing a large amount of thermal energy occurred in steam and hot water exposures. During mass transfer, liquid and vaporized water molecules diffuse along their concentration gradients. As the steam exposures occur with a high pressure, it is expected that vaporized water molecules will have a greater momentum than liquid water molecules present in hot water exposures. In turn, the mass transfer rate is greater during steam exposures than during hot water exposures.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517512461707">Table 4</xref>, <italic>T-</italic>stat values for fabric air permeability in flame, radiant-heat, and hot surface exposures are negative, whereas, <italic>T-</italic>stat values for fabric thickness are positive in the same exposures. Negative <italic>T-</italic>stat values indicate a negative association between air permeability and second degree burn time. The association between fabric thickness and second degree burn time is positive in flame, radiant-heat, and hot surface exposures. <italic>P</italic>-values of fabric air permeability in flame, radiant-heat, and hot surface exposures are 0.42, 0.45, and 0.19, respectively. As all fabric air permeability <italic>P</italic>-values are greater than 0.05, it can be inferred that fabric air permeability is not a significant factor in second degree burn time. The negative downplay of fabric air permeability in these exposures indicates that thermal energy should necessarily blow through the fabric systems. It has been hypothesized that thermal energy transfer mechanisms through multiphase, non-homogeneous fabric systems entail a combination of absorption, re-radiation/reflection, conduction, and possibly forced convection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512461707">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512461707">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512461707">16</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>P</italic>-values of fabric thickness under flame and radiant-heat exposure are 0.002 and 0.001, respectively. The <italic>P</italic>-values indicate that thickness is a highly significant fabric property for effective protection under flame and radiant-heat exposures. The values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517512461707">Table 4</xref> also suggest that fabric thickness is not a highly significant property to protect a wearer from burn injury in a hot surface exposure [(<italic>P</italic>-value)<sub>hot  surface</sub> = 0.07, &gt;0.05]. Heat transfer in hot surface exposures proceeds through a pressure or load on the fabric system that is not present in flame and radiant-heat exposures. Consequently, the thermal energy transfer mechanism through the fabric systems in hot surface exposures differs from those in both the flame and radiant-heat exposures. Relationships between fabric thickness and second degree burn time in flame, radiant-heat, and hot surface exposures are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461707">Figure 6</xref> to individually explain and compare the exposures in detail.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461707">Figure 6</xref> confirms the <italic>T-</italic>stat values that showed a positive association between fabric thickness and second degree burn time. In comparison between flame and radiant-heat exposures, it is clear that the coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) between fabric thickness and second degree burn time is different. This infers that there is a different level of association between fabric thickness and second degree burn time in the case of flame and radiant-heat exposures. In flame and radiant-heat exposures, thermal energy is imposed on the multiphase (solid and gaseous) fabric systems and the incident thermal energy may be partially reflected, and/or absorbed, and/or transmitted depending on the fabric system’s emissivity or absorbtivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512461707">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0040517512461707">28</xref></sup> The emissivity (<italic>ɛ</italic>) of a fabric system is strongly dependent upon the nature of its surface optical properties. The surface optical properties are basically influenced by the method of fabrication, finishing, temperature/thermal cycling and chemical reactions during thermal exposures. A fabric system with maximum emissivity (<italic>ɛ</italic> ∼ 1) reflects less thermal energy than a fabric system with minimum emissivity (<italic>ɛ</italic> ∼ 0); therefore, thermal energy imposed on fabrics with high emissivity is mostly absorbed inside the fabric system and/or transmitted to the skin. In this study, mainly Kevlar/PBI and Nomex fabric were used. According to Song’s study, the emissivity of these fabrics is nearly 0.9; in turn, these fabrics have a significant contribution to absorb and/or transmit thermal energy toward human skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0040517512461707">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The thermal energy transmitted through a fabric system comes into direct contact with the skin and may generate burn injury. Also, thermal energy absorbed inside the fabric system can move toward the wearer’s skin and generate burn injury. Normally, thick fabric systems provide higher protection against thermal hazards because they contain more trapped air than thin fabric systems. The trapped air volumes act as an insulator, lowering the transmissivity of the fabric system, and hence reducing the penetration rate of thermal energy from the fabric system to the skin. Adding a moisture barrier and a thermal liner to a fabric shell will substantially increase wearers’ protection by increasing the amount of air phase and trapped air volume.</p>
<p>Although a three layered fabric system might contain more air between the layers than a single layered fabric contains in its pores, the insulating effect of the additional air space might be compromised by the increase in thermal energy that can be stored inside the fabric layers. This stored energy might be transmitted to the wearer’s skin over time. This energy would transmit regardless of whether the fabric is compressed or not. As fabrics usually compress when the wearer moves this compression may reduce the thermal protective performance of the fabric system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512461707">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512461707">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, that the coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) in flame and radiant-heat exposures were 0.8386 and 0.972, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461707">Figure 6</xref>) infers that fabric thickness may be strongly related to thermal protective performance (second degree burn time) in radiant-heat exposure compared to flame exposure. This is because in radiant-heat exposure thermal energy is mostly transmitted through the fabric system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0040517512461707">29</xref></sup> while in flame exposure thermal energy imposed on the surface of the fabric system mainly spreads horizontally and/or bounces back to the environment depending upon the configuration of the exposure. Therefore, fabric thickness plays a more significant role in heat transmission to the wearer in radiant-heat exposure than in flame exposure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been identified from the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461707">Figure 6</xref> that the coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) in the hot surface exposure is much lower than those in flame and radiant-heat exposures. At a particular thickness, the second degree burn time in hot surface exposures is also much lower than those of flame and radiant-heat exposures. To explain these phenomena, it is necessary to understand the behavior of thermal energy imposed on a fabric system in a hot surface exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512461707">Figure 7</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512461707">Figure 7</xref> shows that there is a physical contact between the hot surface and the fabric system in a hot surface exposure. The contact resistance between the fabric system and the hot surface may vary depending on the surface roughness of the fabric system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512461707">Figure 8</xref>). A fabric system with a rough surface (i.e. with high contact resistance or a high static frictional coefficient) will have a tiny air gap on the interface between the fabric system and the hot surface that reduces the thermal energy transfer inside the fabric system. A smooth fabric system surface (i.e. with a low contact resistance or a low static frictional coefficient) allows good thermal contact between the hot surface and the fabric system, increasing the thermal energy transfer inside the fabric system.

</fig></p>
<p>Compression of the fabric system decreases the air volumes in the fabric. Absence of an air phase inside a compressed fabric system (between the wearer’s skin and a hot surface) lowers the insulation of the fabric system; hence, the protective performance is decreased. When the solid fibre phase inside the fabric system predominates, the thermal conductivity is enhanced and the extinction coefficient of the fabric system becomes high. Thermo-physical properties (density, volumetric heat capacity) of the fabric system may also deteriorate depending on the compression in the fabric system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512461707">8</xref></sup> The rapid transmission of thermal energy through a compressed fabric system generates a quick burn on the wearer’s skin. Contact resistance between the fabric system and the wearer’s skin is also reduced with fabric compression, and this situation aggravates the thermal energy transmission toward the skin.</p>
<p>Fabric systems AFD and FAD have the same thickness, but the protective performance of AFD is almost twice that of FAD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512461707">Table 3</xref>). This is because in the FAD fabric system, the moisture barrier is present in the outer layer, whereas in the AFD fabric system the moisture barrier is present in the inner layer. The moisture barrier in the FAD fabric system comes into direct contact with the hot surface. The moisture barrier contains polyurethane coatings that may catch fire to melt easily (ignition temperature ∼ 370℃).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0040517512461707">30</xref></sup> Melting or ignition of the moisture barrier does not maintain the integrity of the fabric system, which enhances the transfers of thermal energy toward the skin, reducing the time requirement to generate a second degree burn. A molten surface of moisture barrier also reduces the contact resistance between hot surface and fabric system and, in turn, causes the poor protective performance of a fabric system. These phenomena are less profound for an AFD fabric system as the outer layer in these fabric systems comprises a specialized Kevlar-PBI fabric that has a high ignition temperature (∼600℃) and greater surface roughness; consequently, the integrity of the fabric system is maintained and it efficiently slows heat flow toward the skin. The findings for fabric systems AF and FA can be similarly compared; these fabric systems have similar thickness and air permeability but the burn time is higher (protection higher) for AF than for FA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512461707">Table 3</xref>) due to the position of the moisture barrier, which is in the inner layer of AF and in the outer layer of FA.</p>

<p><italic>P</italic>-values for thickness and air permeability were less than 0.05 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0040517512461707">Table 6</xref>) and thus both thickness and air permeability significantly affect fabric protective performance in hot water and steam exposures. The findings in this paper show that fabric thickness plays a significant role in heat transfer under hot water and steam exposures. Fabric air permeability is pertinent if mass transfer (hot liquid) results in skin burn;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512461707">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517512461707">24</xref></sup> thus, in hot water and steam exposures air permeability of the fabric system is expected to be a significant property. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0040517512461707">Table 6</xref>, the <italic>T-</italic>stat values for thickness and air permeability are positive and negative, respectively, indicating that thickness and permeability have positive and negative relationships, respectively, with second degree burn time. As thick fabric systems provide more insulation than thin fabric systems,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512461707">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512461707">11</xref></sup> heat transfer is less and second degree burn time is higher in thick fabric systems than in thin fabric systems. However, the presence of air pores in a highly air permeable fabric system may enhance the transfer of mass and reduce the time requirement for a second degree burn. For example, although the AE fabric system is thicker than the B fabric system, the second degree burn time of the AE fabric system is less than that of the B fabric system. A possible reason for this difference in second degree burn times might be that the air permeability of the AE fabric system is higher than the air permeability of the B fabric system. Here, it can be hypothesized that, although thickness and air permeability both have significant effects on protective performance, one property may dominate the other. To analyze this hypothesis, the <italic>P</italic>-values of thickness and air permeability in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0040517512461707">Table 6</xref> were further examined.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0040517512461707">Table 6</xref> shows that fabric system thickness <italic>P</italic>-values (0.02 and 0.03) are higher than fabric system air permeability <italic>P</italic>-values (0.006 and 0.001), inferring that fabric thickness is a less significant property than fabric air permeability in protection from hot water and steam exposures. These findings can be rationalized by the observation that heat transfer is less expedient than mass transfer in hot water and steam exposures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0040517512461707">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512461707"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517512461707">24</xref></sup> As the thickness <italic>P</italic>-values are close to 0.05, and air permeability <italic>P</italic>-values are significantly less than 0.05, it can be inferred that thickness has a minor/marginal impact on fabric protective performance while air permeability has a strong impact on fabric protective performance. The association between air permeability and second degree burn time under hot water and steam exposures is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512461707">Figure 9</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512461707">Figure 9</xref>, fabric systems with zero air permeability (B, AF–FAD) show greater second degree burn times than the fabric systems with higher (&gt;0) air permeability (A, AC, AE). An inference test confirmed that the second degree burn time of a fabric system with zero air permeability (an impermeable fabric system) is significantly higher than the second degree burn time of a fabric system with higher air permeability (a permeable fabric system). This observation can be explained by Darcy’s Law which states that the mass transfer through a porous medium (fabric system) is

It seems that impermeable fabric systems (B and AF–FAD) do not allow the transfer of hot water or steam through the fabric systems. As a result, the time requirement for a second degree burn increased, enhancing the protective performance of the impermeable fabric systems.</p>
<p>Here, an interesting finding is that, although the B fabric system was impermeable, its second degree burn time was significantly lower than the second degree burn times of the other impermeable fabric systems (AF–FAD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512461707">Figure 9</xref>). A possible factor is that the B fabric system is the thinnest of all the impermeable fabric systems, and the B fabric system has a single layer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512461707">Table 2</xref>). It can be stated that multilayered (double or triple), thick fabric systems (e.g., AF–FAD) provide better protection than non-layered, thin fabric systems (e.g., B). This is quite reasonable because both hot water and steam apply a certain amount of pressure/load which ultimately compresses the fabric system, reducing air volumes inside the fabric systems and lowering the thermal insulation afforded by air. In the compression stage, a multilayered, thick fabric system contains more air than a non-layered, thin fabric system. As a result, the thermal protective performance of a multilayered, thick fabric system is better than that of a non-layered, thin fabric system, especially when heat transfer occurs with hot water and steam exposures. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512461707">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0040517512461707">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0040517512461707">27</xref></sup> Contact with hot water or highly pressurized steam might cause thermo-physical properties of the fabric system (surface tension, thermal conductivity, heat capacity) to change, allowing hot water and steam to enter the fabric system more easily and thus increasing the chance of scald burns on the wearer. Multilayered, thick fabric systems can store more hot water than non-layered, thin fabric systems and would be expected to generate body burns more slowly. On entering a fabric system, steam may condense to hot water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512461707">Figure 10</xref>), and generate scald burns on the wearer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517512461707">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0040517512461707">31</xref></sup> In a multilayered, thick fabric system this condensation may occur far away from the skin causing less burn injury than in a non-layered, thin fabric system.

</fig></p>
<p>The presence of a thermal liner affects the protective performance of multilayered, thick, impermeable fabric systems. For example, the two outermost layers of the AF (double layered) and the AFC/AFD/AFE (three layered) fabric systems are the same: shell fabric and moisture barrier. However, the AFC/AFD/AFE fabric systems comprise an extra layer of thermal liner in their innermost part (in contact with the wearer’s skin). Due to this added thermal liner, the thermal insulation property of the AFC/AFD/AFE fabric systems is higher than that of the AF fabric system. Consequently, the AFC/AFD/AFE fabric systems resisted heat transfer more effectively than the AF fabric system; that is, the protective performances of the AFC/AFD/AFE fabric systems were higher than the protective performance of the AF fabric system. The thickness of a thermal liner is also important to protective performance. For example, there is a gradual increase in the thickness of the thermal liners in AFC, AFD, and AFE fabric systems. The thickness of AFC, AFD, and AFE fabric systems also gradually increases. As expected, protective performance increases in the order of AFC, AFD, and AFE.</p>
<p>It has also been found that impermeable fabric systems comprising the same number of layers (double layered or three layered) and thickness show significant differences in second degree burn time under hot water and steam exposures (<italic>P-</italic>value &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512461707">Figure 9</xref>). Although AF and FA fabric systems have the same number of layers and thickness, the protective performance of the FA fabric system is higher than that of the AF fabric system in both hot water and steam exposures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512461707">Table 3</xref>). Similar observations were made for AFD and FAD fabric systems where, although the fabric systems are of similar thickness, the protective performance of the FAD fabric system is higher than that of the AFD fabric system in both hot water and steam exposures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512461707">Table 3</xref>). These results are rationalized by considering the difference in position of the moisture barrier in the protective fabric systems. To understand these results, heat and mass transfer is depicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512461707">Figure 11</xref>) through two differently configured impermeable fabric systems comprising the same number of layers and the same thickness: System 1 consists of an outer layer comprising a moisture barrier; System 2 consists of an outer layer comprising a shell fabric and the moisture barrier is in its inner layer.
<fig id="fig11-0040517512461707" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Heat and mass transfer mechanisms through fabric systems in hot water and steam exposures.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517512461707-fig11.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512461707">Figure 11</xref> shows that in Systems 1 and 2, the incoming hot water or steam is deflected from the moisture barrier. If the moisture barrier is in the outer layer of the fabric system (System 1), much of the heat hazard is deflected long before it reaches the wearer’s skin. If the moisture barrier is in the inner layer of the fabric system (System 2) the hot water or steam is transmitted close to the wearer’s skin. Thus a burn injury is less likely in System 1, which is analogous to fabric systems FA and FAD, than in System 2, which is analogous to fabric systems AF and AFD. It is interesting that the effects of the moisture barrier position are opposite in the cases of hot surface exposure and hot water or steam exposure. This opposite behaviour is likely due to the different thermal energy transfer mechanisms in hot surface exposure versus hot water/steam exposures.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0040517512461707"><title>Summary and conclusion</title>
<p>The present research subjected several protective textile fabric systems to laboratory-simulated flame, radiant-heat, hot surface, and hot water/steam exposures and characterized their protective performances with respect to a skin burn model. The findings demonstrate that the protective performance of fabric systems varies according to the characteristics of the fabric system and the type of thermal exposure.</p>
<p>The amount of thermal insulation and the emissivity or absorbtivity of a fabric system primarily control its protective performance in flame and radiant-heat exposures. It can be concluded that a fabric system surface with a low emissivity enhances protection through a high reflection and low absorption and/or low transmission of thermal energy inside the fabric system. Insulation from flame and radiant-heat exposures was found to be provided by air volumes inside the fabric system that prohibited thermal energy transfer to the sensor (i.e. the wearer). In hot surface contact, hot water splash, and high pressure steam exposures, a certain amount of pressure is imposed on the fabric system; this pressure caused fabric compression which reduced both the contact resistance between the fabric system and the sensor (human skin) and the air volume insulation provided by the fabric system, enhancing heat transfer toward the sensor and reducing the protective performance of the fabric system. Thermo-physical properties (e.g. thermal conductivity, heat capacity) of the fabric systems changed in various thermal exposures. Hence, fabric system may char or pyrolize, reducing their protective performance.</p>
<p>In addition to the heat delivered in hot water and steam exposures, mass transfer through the fabric system may present the primary concern. The study suggests that impermeable fabric systems can reduce mass transfer and enhance the protective performance of the fabric system. Better protection is obtained by stopping or minimizing the mass transfer at the contact point in hot water and steam exposures. Otherwise, a significant amount of hot water and condensed steam might be stored inside the fabric system and might be instantaneously delivered to the human body.</p>
<p>In future, modeling of critical fabric characteristics identified in this study will be employed to optimize the thermal protective performance of the fabric systems. Knowledge gained from modeling experiments will aid the development of clothing that protects against all types of thermal exposure. In another approach, an empirical determination of the variation of thermo-physical properties of fabric systems as a function of thermal exposure type and time will help in the design of fabric systems geared to specific hazards.</p>
