<body>
<p>Over the years, many nurse scholars and practitioners have debated the value of philosophical and theoretical perspectives for the profession and discipline of nursing. Others debate which philosophical or theoretical perspective is relevant for practice. Members of the discipline of nursing debate the notion of which comes first: theory, practice, or research while still debating the role of advanced nursing practice.</p>
<p>In practice, nurse leaders ponder what the best approach is when one may have a different philosophical perspective than the organization. Advanced practice nurses may brood when others place parents in an extended care facility, concerned that they are not respecting the elder’s wishes and desires, and thus the nurses may not be following their own nursing theoretical perspective. There is much to consider about all of these issues.</p>
<p>The book being reviewed here is <italic>Philosophical and Theoretical Perspectives for Advanced Nursing Practice ( 5<sup>th</sup> ed.)</italic>, edited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477152">William K. Cody (2013)</xref>. Cody has written extensively from nursing’s humanbecoming perspective and currently serves as the Director of Nursing, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois. This book provides much to deliberate for the discipline of nursing and for some of the issues explicated above. Our reviewers Drs. Patricia L. Thomas and Thomas Doucet consider this new edition. Let us see what they have to say.</p>
