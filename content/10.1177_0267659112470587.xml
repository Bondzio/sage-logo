<p>And so typically begins the polite dialogue in a Letter to the Editor. For the larger readership, it is engaging to consider additional perspectives regarding a previously published paper. Letters to the Editor reaffirm the relevance of a journal’s content. Despite going through peer review, the final paper can still elicit commentary or criticism because reviewers are not infallible. The editor sometimes courts controversy by publishing these critiques but the readers benefit as authors and letter writers verbally spar. The advantage in this spirited dialogue goes to the authors because they have the last word by issuing a reply, and the readers are once again in the position to serve as final judges of whose arguments make the most sense. In some instances, a Letter to the Editor is not critical, but instead provides additional information the original authors may have omitted—an overlooked citation or first-hand insight into an event not previously well known. Regardless, it makes for lively reading and all who partake come away further enlightened.</p>
<p>Similarly, published Commentaries offer readers another way to see “live” dialogue between authors and their peers. This practice was established in <italic>Perfusion</italic> four years ago when edited transcripts of the discussions following presentations at the annual seminar of the American Academy of Cardiovascular Perfusion began to appear in the same issue with the original article. Consider the presenter of a paper: she or he has done all the work to justify presentation at a national program. Then, after delivery, moderators open up the meeting for comments from the audience. The presenter has no idea what may be coming, but has to respond to clarify or correct a misinterpretation. Many times, the discussants reaffirm similar experiences on the topic that, once again, adds additional perspective to what the audience has just heard. Sometimes, the discussant adds a word of caution, as can be seen in this issue regarding the advisability of intraoperative washing of stored red blood cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112470587">1</xref></sup> It is one manifestation of peer review at its finest.</p>
<p>The editorial board of <italic>Perfusion</italic> recently had a meeting with the publisher’s representatives who provided a report on the health of the journal. The news is encouraging: the Impact Factor is trending upwards and in 2011 it was 0.918, an increase of 0.173 over the previous year. Another revealing data point is the rejection rate for <italic>Perfusion</italic> is now approximately 45%, up significantly from 2009 when it was 9%. This confirms that the editorial board can be more selective, therefore, increasing the quality of articles accepted for publication. Other encouraging news revealed that the number of institutional subscriptions to <italic>Perfusion</italic> is trending upward and showed an 18% increase compared to last year. Online full-text downloads of articles have become an important new feature of all journals and, once again, the news is encouraging: at the end of August 2012, there had been 35,018 downloads—an increase of 69.9% when compared to the same months in 2011.</p>
<p>Finally, about this issue: consider the variety of subject matter that ranges from trends in cardiopulmonary bypass in China to ECMO to organ perfusion to so-called mini-bypass for a selected patient population. The meta-analysis by Ahmed and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112470587">2</xref></sup> is a serious attempt to objectively assess the performance of cardiac surgery personnel. Using this methodology, additional systematic review might be performed for other team members. Performing outcome analysis, as the authors note, “…is crucial for the assessment of competence and performance as it not only gauges individual performance, but also gives an evaluation of the effectiveness of the entire healthcare system.” A powerful tool, indeed, and <italic>Perfusion</italic> is proud to publish this important work.</p>
<p>So, in closing, “Thank you for your comments.” We eagerly look forward to continued dialogue.</p>
