<p>A topic as grave and sombre as suicide merits serious consideration and fortunately, this volume does just that. Using a rigorous, scientific and strictly unsentimental perspective, it deals with the various aspects of suicidal behaviour.</p>
<p>Suicide was and continues to be a major societal and psychological problem. Whether it was farmers ending their lives due to crippling debts and the vagaries of the monsoon, glamourous models bidding adieu to their lives or school children writing ‘finis’ to their chapter of life, suicide has been and continues to be, heartbreakingly pervasive. Long ago, as an undergraduate student, there were certain lines which I read from a much loved textbook which have resonated over the years. Schneidman (1969) wrote ‘the person who commits suicide puts his psychological skeleton in the survivor’s emotional closet. . .’ (p. 22).</p>
<p>The volume is divided into two major sections. Section I focuses on the theoretical aspects of risk assessment and consists of nine chapters, while Section II has six chapters dealing with the assessment of people-at-risk. This conceptual division is logical and well-planned.</p>
<p>In Section I, the chapters included focus on psychological perspectives (O’Connor), empirical assessment of risk (Morrow, Bryan and Appolonio), as well as a consideration of neurobiological factors (Trivedi and Varma), and a discussion of cultural (Colucci), gender (Osvath, Voros and Fekete) and developmental (Orden and Miller) issues in risk factor assessment. The remaining chapters focus on the relationship between suicide and homicide (Mukherjee, Kumar and Mandal) and the impact of media reporting of suicides (Kidwai). Overall, these are thought-provoking and meaningful chapters which provide a succinct coverage of the quantum of work done in this area.</p>
<p>Taking a biopsychosocial perspective, O’Connor uses three psychological models which provide an understanding of suicidal behaviour. These models include the escape model, the cry of pain model and the differential activation model of cognitive reactivity and offer an explanation of the mechanisms and processes involved in suicidal behaviour. The implications for both assessment and interventions are clearly presented. The main contention is that psychological processes are a common pathway to mental disorder and suicidal behaviour. A similar model is espoused by Morrow, Bryan and Appolino who point out that it is important to recognise when a patient has entered a heightened state of risk (i.e., risk assessment), and to respond appropriately. Suicide risk is considered from two dimensions: baseline risk (predispositions to suicide, previous attempts and impulsivity) and acute risk which necessitates a consideration of aggravating variables such as stressors, sym-ptomatic presentation, hopelessness, nature of suicidal thinking and protective factors.</p>
<p>The search for biological markers of suicidal behaviour is highlighted by Trivedi and Varma. The underlying neurobiological factors are discussed using both transmitter-non-specific and transmitter-specific neuro-endocrine studies. The genetic component in the suicidal diathesis has also been discussed. McAuliffe seeks to explore the association between problem-solving difficulties and repeated deliberate self-harm (DSH), which is conceptualised as a maladaptive coping response. On the basis of studies, it was found that problem-solving ability mediates the relationship between stress and DSH. It was also found that repetitive acts of DSH were associated with escape and revenge motives and that repeaters showed impairments in terms of their approach to problems and actual problem-solving.</p>
<p>The chapter by Mukherjee, Kumar and Mandal focuses on the culture of violence and explores the distinction between suicidal tendencies and violence directed towards the other. The commonality between suicide and homicide is highlighted using different perspectives.</p>
<p>In the chapter on cultural issues, Colucci advocates the use of varied perspectives in understanding suicidal behaviour. These include a recognition that religion and spirituality are meaningful issues for suicidal patients. One tends to agree with the author’s contention that quantitative methods are simplistic and reductionistic, and qualitative techniques would be more useful while investigating the client’s beliefs about the afterlife. There is also a need to define which aspects of religiosity and spirituality are protective against suicide. Suicide prevention would necessitate an understanding of what the act of suicide symbolizes and represents for that person and the c to express and manifest these meanings.</p>
<p>Several significant findings are presented in the chapter on gender issues. These include the fact that while suicide attempts are greater in females, there is a stronger association between attempted and completed suicide in males. A profile of ‘typical’ male and female attempters is provided and three different peaks have been discussed. The first peak is the young-aged group, next is the middle-aged group and the third peak is the old-aged group. This indicates an association between significant psychosocial crises and suicide attempts.</p>
<p>The next chapter focuses on developmental issues. They focus on distal and proximal risk factors using the life span approach, the authors (Van Orden and Miller) focus on warning signs common across the life-span using the mnemonic IS PATH WARM?, where suicidal ideation, substance abuse, purposelessness, anxiety and agitation, feelings of being trapped, hopelessness, withdrawal, anger, recklessness and mood fluctuations are included. They highlight the fact that the relation between hopelessness and suicidality is one of the most robust findings. Two age groups are particularly vulnerable which include late adolescents (15–18 years) and the elderly.</p>
<p>Disproportionate media coverage is explored in the chapter by Kidwai. She points out that the reporting of suicides can trigger copycat suicides in the mass public. Another significant finding is that suicide contagion can be decreased by factual and concise media reporting. The World Health Organization (2000) has advocated restraint and provided guidelines for the reporting of suicide. These include not publishing photographs or suicide notes and not reporting the specific method used. Media were also asked to play a more proactive role in helping to prevent suicide.</p>
<p>Section II of the book deals with the assessment and prediction of suicidal behaviour. The chapter by Mukhopadhyay has a straightforward listing of measures that assess suicidal ideation and behaviour across the life-span. This approach may be useful from a research angle. However, no attempts have been made to raise issues pertaining to the measurement of this complex phenomenon. The next chapter by Misra, Sabharwal and Kumar presents interesting information pertaining to the significant association between substance abuse and suicidal behaviour. Using different types of studies (psychological autopsy, cases and longitudinal), the authors have lucidly elucidated the association between various substances of abuse and suicidal behaviour. Pompili et al. in their thought provoking chapter have pointed out that the risk of suicide in Bipolar Disorder patients is approximately 25–90 times higher than the general population rate. They also discuss the short-term predictors of completed suicide which include a strong wish to die, suicidal ideation or plans, the communication of suicide intent during depression and having few reasons for living. Treatment options for these patients are also discussed.</p>
<p>The chapter by Schaller and Wolfersdorf focuses on what would almost seem a truism in this area: Depression and suicide. They point out that psychiatric disorders are an important risk factor for suicidal behaviour. Several interesting findings emerge from their analysis of research in this area. For instance, they cite studies which show that among inpatients, young schizophrenic men are at a similar risk to commit suicide as patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Using epidemiological and psychological autopsy studies, they opine that 40–60 per cent of all people who died by committing suicide suffered from a primary depressive disorder. The risk factors for suicide are also discussed. These include female gender, younger age and the existence of a psychiatric diagnosis. In this context, studies which compare non-suicidal and suicidal depressed patients are also considered.</p>
<p>The penultimate chapter deals with suicidal behaviour in military settings (Mehlum and Nrugham). The risk factors examined include the military lifestyle and loss of meaning. This can lead to distress or mental pain termed as ‘psychache’ by Shneidman. The final chapter focuses on patterns and trends in adolescent suicide in Asia (Leung et al.). Psychological, environmental and socio-cultural risk factors have been discussed. These include a high prevalence of mental disorders, substance abuse, family dynamics, schooling and examination expectations. In addition, the role of the media and Internet (with many websites providing detailed instructions on how to commit suicide) has also been explicated. Warning signs and prevention issues are also included.</p>
<p>Many of the chapters in this book are research-based and empirically derived and allusions to anecdotal accounts are few and far between. While this is the strength of the volume, it is ironically, also its weaknesses. Apart from Chapter 1 (O’Connor) and a reference to literary texts such as Hamlet (Trivedi and Varma) there are few experiential accounts of this quintessential human phenomenon. The personal suffering, misery and desperation which ultimately culminates in suicide and the impact on the family and other survivors which undoubtedly was the raison d’être of this volume, are rarely considered.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to summarize or encapsulate in a few sentences, what this volume has to offer. It presents a detailed, exhaustive and comprehensive account as well as many valuable insights into the phenomenon of suicide. Various researches have been cited and it is laudable that the goal is to achieve not only a better understanding of suicidal behaviour but to formulate prevention strategies as well.</p>
<p>There was a haunting song, called Gloomy Sunday composed by Rezso Seress, a Hungarian pianist in 1933, sung by various artistes and referred to as the Hungarian suicide song. It spoke of ‘the end of the world, the end of hope.…’. Fortunately, for us, books of this genre come with the message that there is a way to understand, counter and to prevent this ultimate human tragedy.</p>
