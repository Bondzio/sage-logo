<sec id="sec20-0300060513479875"><title>Objective</title>
<p>The function of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate1 (Rac1) in the progression of cervical cancer is unclear. This study used RNA interference technology to explore the involvement of Rac1 in the regulation of cervical cancer cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-0300060513479875"><title>Methods</title>
<p>A short hairpin (sh) RNA plasmid targeting Rac1 was constructed and transfected into HeLa cells. Rac1 mRNA and protein levels were investigated by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. Cell proliferation and cisplatin chemosensitivity were determined using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. The Matrigel™ assay and flow cytometry were used to assess cell invasion and apoptosis, respectively. The concentration of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in cell supernatants was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-0300060513479875"><title>Results</title>
<p>Rac1 expression was significantly downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels in HeLa cells transfected with Rac1 shRNA, and the cell proliferation and invasion capability of cells was decreased. Rac1 downregulation was associated with a decrease in MMP-2 secretion, and increased cell chemosensitivity to cisplatin and cisplatin-induced apoptosis.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0300060513479875" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, with ∼55 000 new cases and ∼310 000 deaths annually, ∼80% of which occur in developing countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300060513479875">1</xref></sup> Due to effective implementation of cytological screening and treatment protocols, the incidence and mortality rates for cervical cancer in developed countries have both declined dramatically over the past two decades. Disease incidence, however, remains high in regions where there is a lack of resource for cervical cancer screening, such as South America, Africa and South-East Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300060513479875">2</xref></sup> In particular, nearly one-third of patients will die from recurrent, metastatic or pharmacoresistant forms of cervical cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060513479875">3</xref></sup> Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying proliferation, invasion and survival in cervical cancer is critical, in order to facilitate the development of appropriate therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) is highly expressed in cervical premalignant lesions and cervical cancer cells, which suggests that it may play an important role in cervical cancer progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060513479875">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>RAC1</italic> gene encodes a 21-kDa GTP-binding protein belonging to the Rho family of small GTPases, which regulate cellular function during embryonic development and tumour invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300060513479875">5</xref></sup> Rac1 is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells, regulates formation of lamellipodia, and plays an important role in tumourigenesis, invasion and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300060513479875">6</xref></sup> Rac1 is overexpressed in many malignant tumours including testicular cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, leukaemia and oral squamous cell carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513479875">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513479875"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060513479875"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060513479875"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060513479875">11</xref></sup> Depletion of Rac1 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) may strongly inhibit lamellipodia formation and cell invasion in glioblastoma and breast cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060513479875">12</xref></sup> In addition to controlling the actin cytoskeleton, Rac1 regulates cell invasion by stimulating signalling pathways. It has been reported that Rac1 controls the expression and activity of different matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-14, to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513479875">13</xref></sup> The MMPs belong to a family of proteases, among which MMP-2 and MMP-9 in particular are known to play crucial roles in tumour invasion, angiogenesis and subsequent distant metastasis by proteolytic degradation of ECM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300060513479875">14</xref></sup> Mendoza-Catalán et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060513479875">4</xref></sup> have shown that Rac1 is overexpressed in cervical premalignant lesions and cervical cancer cells, but no further research into the mechanism by which Rac1 affects cervical cancer has been published.</p>
<p>In order to explore the role of Rac1 in cervical cancer progression, the present study used RNA interference (RNAi) technology to knock down Rac1 expression in HeLa cells and then determine the effects on cellular proliferation, invasion, apoptosis and chemosensitivity to cisplatin. It was hoped that the findings may provide experimental evidence for further molecular mechanisms in relation to the malignant progression of cervical cancer and adjuvant chemotherapeutic strategies for this disease.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0300060513479875"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title>
<p>HeLa cells, a human cervical epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line (obtained from the Scientific Research Foundation of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the absence of antibiotics at 37 ℃ in a humidified atmosphere, containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cisplatin was purchased from the Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group (JiangSu, China).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0300060513479875"><title>Rac1 shRNA and transient transfection procedure</title>
<p>A commercially-available vector, pGPU6/GFP/Neo (Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co, Shanghai, China), was used to generate short hairpin (sh) RNA specific for Rac1. The human <italic>RAC1</italic> gene-coding sequence was obtained from GenBank® (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/</ext-link>) where four sets of shRNA sequence targeting the human <italic>Rac1</italic> gene are listed: Rac1-sh294 (5′-GCCTACTGATCAGTTACACAA-3′); Rac1-sh320 (5′-GCATTTCC TGGAGAATATATC-3′); Rac1-sh365 (5′-GCCAATGTTATGGTAGATGGA-3′); Rac1-sh394 (5′-GAATCTGGGCTTATGGGATAC-3′). A nonspecific shRNA was designed as a negative control (Rac1-shNC) (5′-GTTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′). These oligonucleotides were synthesized and subcloned into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Pst</italic>I restriction sites of the vector at 22℃ for 1 h. HeLa cells were plated in six-well plates at a concentration of 6 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well, and incubated overnight. Cells were then transfected with Rac1-shRNAs (2 µg plasmid in 250 µl DMEM) using 5 µl Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Untransfected HeLa cells were included as a blank control group. The success of the transfection was determined 48 h later by inverted fluorescence and phase-contrast microscopy (LEICA DMIL-PH1, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) using three randomly-selected fields of vision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0300060513479875"><title>RT–PCR analysis of Rac1 mRNA</title>
<p>Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) analysis was performed as follows. Total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells per well) using TRIzol® (Invitrogen). The RT reaction was performed with 1 µg total RNA in 20 ‐µl reactions using the ImProm-II™ Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), incubated at 42 ℃ for 15 min and heated at 94 ℃ for 5 min. The primer sequences for Rac1 were 5′-GCGGCACCACTGTCCCAACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCGCCGAGCACTCCAGGTA-3′ (reverse), and for β-actin were 5′-AGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGCCAGGGG TGCTAAGCAGT-3′ (antisense). PCR was performed using a Roche LightCycler® (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) under the following conditions: 30 amplification cycles of denaturation at 94 ℃ for 30 s, annealing at 58 ℃ for 30 s and extension at 72 ℃ for 50 s, followed by a final extension at 72 ℃ for 10 min. PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Relative band intensities were detected using ImageJ software (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). The density of each band was normalized against that of β-actin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0300060513479875"><title>Western Blot analysis of Rac1 protein</title>
<p>Cells (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells per well) were lysed by precooled lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium docecyl sulphate [SDS], pH 7.4) and the protein content of the lysates was assessed using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Equal amounts of cell lysate (20 µg) were separated by 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Blotted membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween (TBST, pH 7.6) at room temperature for 1 h. Blots were then incubated overnight at 4 ℃ with a 1 : 400 dilution of antihuman Rac1 mouse monoclonal antibody followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with a 1 : 1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse goat monoclonal antibody (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). After each incubation, membranes were washed three times each for 15 min using 0.05% TBST. Protein bands were visualized using a diaminobenzidine colouration kit and electrochemiluminescence analysis system (Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0300060513479875"><title>MTT assay for assessment of cell proliferation and chemosensitivity to cisplatin</title>
<p>Exponentially growing HeLa cells were seeded into 96-well microtitre plates at a concentration of 5 × 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060513479875">4</xref></sup> cells per well, and allowed to attach overnight before Rac1 shRNA transfection. Following 24, 48, 72 and 96 h of culture, cells were incubated with 20 µl of MTT (5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at 37 ℃ for 4 h after which the medium was decanted and the reaction stopped with 150 µl of dimethyl sulphoxide (Sigma-Aldrich). The spectrometric absorbance of each sample was measured at 490  nm by an automatic microplate reader (Bio-Rad).</p>
<p>For assessment of chemosensitivity, exponentially growing cells were seeded into 96-well microtitre plates at a density of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well, and left overnight at 37° C. Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with 0 – 40 µg/ml cisplatin for 24 h before incubation with MTT, as described above. The proliferation inhibition ratio was calculated from the spectrometric absorbance of each cisplatin group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0300060513479875"><title>Matrigel™ invasion assay</title>
<p>Transwell® chambers with 8 -µm pore size polycarbonate membranes (Costar®, both from Corning, Lowell, MA, USA) were coated with 60 µl Matrigel™ (Becton, Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and incubated at 37 ℃ for 30 min. A 200 -µl suspension of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells was seeded onto the upper chamber and cultured with serum-free DMEM medium for a further 24 h at 37 ℃. Lower chambers were filled with 600 µl DMEM /10% FBS. The Matrigel™ was scraped away and the remaining polycarbonate membranes were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 10 min. The number of cells invading the Matrigel™ and attaching to the lower surface of the membranes were counted by light microscopy (Olympus BX40, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0300060513479875"><title>ELISA for detection of MMP-2</title>
<p>Cells were incubated for 48 h after transfection and the culture supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature (Centrifuge L-600, Shanghai Lixinjian Centrifuge, Shanghai, China). The concentration of MMP-2 in the culture supernatant was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Optical density was measured by an ELISA reader (KC100, Caretium Medical Instruments, Shenzhen, China) at 450 nm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0300060513479875"><title>Flow cytometry analysis of cisplatin-treated cells</title>
<p>Measurement of cell apoptosis assessment was performed by flow cytometry 48 h after transfection with Rac1-shRNA. Transfected cells were treated with 10 µg/ml cisplatin for 24 h followed by incubation with 5 µl annexin V–fluoresceine-isothiocyanate (20 µg/ml) and 5 µl proprium iodide (50 µg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at 37 ℃. Cell apoptosis was measured by a Cytomics FC 500 MPL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). CXP software, version 2.2 (Beckman Coulter) was used to analyse the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0300060513479875"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS® statistical software, version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows®. Data were expressed as mean ± SD. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) experiments (one-way ANOVA, factorial ANOVA and repeated-measures ANOVA), followed by the Student–Newman–Keuls test were performed, with <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0300060513479875" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The success of transfection of HeLa cells with Rac1 shRNA was determined by fluorescence microscopy, which demonstrated that &gt;65% of cells emitted green fluorescence 48 h after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300060513479875">Figure 1A</xref>). RT–PCR analysis showed that at 48 h after transfection, Rac1 was effectively knocked down by sh294, but that sh365, sh320 and sh394 had no obvious effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300060513479875">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300060513479875">C</xref>). Western blot analysis demonstrated that all four shRNA sequences effectively knocked down Rac1, with sh294 having the highest suppression efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300060513479875">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300060513479875">E</xref>). These results confirmed that sh294 effectively interfered with Rac1 production; the effect of Rac1 downregulation on cell proliferation and invasion was, therefore, determined in HeLa cells transfected with the Rac1-sh294 sequence.

<p>The Rho small GTPases family includes Rho, Rac and Cdc42 proteins, which act as molecular switches and control signalling pathways that regulate many cellular functions (such as cell morphology, gene expression, and cell proliferation and survival).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060513479875">15</xref></sup> Rac1 may also mediate distinct actin cytoskeleton changes and produce lamellipodia at the cell border.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060513479875">15</xref></sup> These cellular functions are important in tumourigenesis and cancer progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060513479875">16</xref></sup> Rac1 has been found to be overexpressed in various cancer types, and possesses multiple functions including promotion of pancreatic cancer-cell proliferation via activation of Rac1-dependent superoxide generation;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513479875">17</xref></sup> Rac1 also suppressed apoptosis of epithelial cells in suspension via phosphoinositide 3-kinase, contributing to cell malignant transformation and tumourigenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060513479875">18</xref></sup> One report suggested that Rac1 overexpression could mediate drug resistance via impaired trastuzumab-mediated endocytic downregulation of ErbB2 and enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity, in breast cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513479875">19</xref></sup> Together, these findings indicate that Rac1 is a major mediator of malignant-cell behaviour, although its function in cervical cancer remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>RNA interference is a gene-silencing technique that works at the post-transcriptional level; shRNA mediates sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression. In the present study, we used RNAi technology to construct a Rac1-shRNA expression vector, followed by transfection into the cervical cancer cell line, HeLa. The findings indicated that mRNA and protein levels of Rac1 in HeLa cells post-transcription were significantly downregulated, compared with levels observed in the control groups. Results of MTT analyses revealed that proliferation of HeLa cells in which the <italic>Rac1</italic> gene had been knocked down was decreased, which was in contrast to findings observed in the controls. The present data are consistent with other studies investigating the role of Rac1 in cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513479875">20</xref> –</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060513479875">22</xref></sup> Inhibition of <italic>RAC1</italic> in rat aortic smooth-muscle cells was shown to reduce levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and cellular proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513479875">20</xref></sup> In another report, Rac1 activity was demonstrated to regulate proliferation of aggressive metastatic melanoma, in part, via its effect on NF-κB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300060513479875">21</xref></sup> Research in prostate cancer also showed that signalling through a cSrc or a protein kinase C pathway regulated prostate cancer cell proliferation via <italic>RAC1</italic>, and that <italic>RAC1</italic> inhibition suppressed cell proliferation in all prostate cancer cell lines studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060513479875">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cell invasion experiments conducted as part of the present study indicated that the velocity of cells transfected with Rac1-sh294 to penetrate Matrigel™ was reduced, compared with the two control groups. Accordingly, the concentration of MMP-2 in cells supernatants from the Rac1-sh294 group decreased substantially. <italic>MMP-2</italic> is one of the downstream target genes of Rac1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513479875">13</xref></sup> and the present study, therefore, suggests that Rac1 may promote invasion of cervical cancer, at least in part, by regulating MMP-2 expression. Tumour cell invasion and metastasis comprise two essential processes: migration and proteolysis. Migration is initiated by actin polymerization at the cell's leading edge and at the lamella extension in the direction of motion, both of which are regulated mainly by Rac1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300060513479875">23</xref></sup> MMP-2 (gelatinase-A, type IV collagenase) also plays an important role in tumour invasion via proteolytic degradation of major components of the basement membrane, such as type IV collagen and laminin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0300060513479875">24</xref></sup> Other research has indicated that membrane-type-1 (MT1)-MMP could initiate the activation of MMP-2 in a process that could be inhibited by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2. Strongin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300060513479875">25</xref></sup> proposed that MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 form a receptor complex of MMP-2, potentiating proteolysis of bound MMP-2 by adjacent active MT1-MMP. Rac1 activity facilitates a shift of the balance between MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 towards MT1-MMP expression, thereby increasing type I collagen-induced proteolytic activity of MMP-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513479875">13</xref></sup> Sustained activation or overexpression of Rac1 could promote invasion and metastasis of murine T-lymphoma cells and many epithelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060513479875">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300060513479875">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300060513479875">27</xref></sup> Other research has, however, indicated that activation of Rac1 promoted E-cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion and selectively upregulated TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, thereby inhibiting epithelial cell invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0300060513479875">28</xref></sup> These seemingly opposing effects of Rac1 on migration and invasion may be dependent on the cell substrate used and the cell type studied.</p>
<p>Historically, cisplatin is the most active drug against cervical cancer, with response rates of ∼40% in chemotherapy-naïve patients who have advanced/metastatic or recurrent disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0300060513479875">29</xref></sup> Cisplatin is believed to mediate its cytotoxic properties through preferential binding to nuclear DNA and subsequent interference with normal transcription and/or DNA replication mechanisms, thus leading to apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0300060513479875">30</xref></sup> Increased repair activity of platinum-DNA adducts can contribute to cisplatin resistance, and inhibition of DNA repair can enhance cytotoxicity and induce apoptosis. Research on the effects of Rac1 on the modulation of apoptosis found that transient transfection of dominant-negative N17-Rac1 led to a decrease in DNA repair activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0300060513479875">31</xref></sup> that Rac1 prevented cisplatin-induced apoptosis by suppressing p38 activation in NIH3T3 cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0300060513479875">32</xref></sup> and that constitutively active Rac1 provided a survival signal under various stimuli in fibroblasts and melanoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0300060513479875">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0300060513479875">34</xref></sup> Results from the MTT assay in the present study revealed that downregulation of Rac1 increased chemosensitivity to cisplatin in HeLa cells. Flow cytometric analyses also showed that cisplatin-induced apoptosis was enhanced when Rac1 was inhibited. These results were consistent with previous reports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0300060513479875">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0300060513479875"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0300060513479875"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0300060513479875">34</xref></sup> although other studies have suggested that activation of Rac1 GTPase is involved in apoptosis in fibroblasts and epithelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0300060513479875">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0300060513479875">36</xref></sup> Such discrepancies in the effects of Rac1 on apoptosis may be due to the different cell types studied, or due to the specificity of different extracellular stimuli. Further studies, to determine the function of Rac1 and the exact mechanisms involved in the development of cervical cancer in vivo<italic>,</italic> are warranted.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study showed that shRNA targeting Rac1 significantly downregulated Rac1 mRNA and protein in cervical cancer cells, and inhibited cell proliferation and invasive activity, which may, in part, be related to Rac1-mediated regulation of MMP-2 expression. The results also indicated that downregulation of Rac1 could increase the in vitro chemosensitivity of HeLa cells to cisplatin. Furthermore, the data suggest that Rac1 may play an important role in regulating cervical cancer cell apoptosis, and that cisplatin-induced apoptosis could be enhanced by Rac1 downregulation. Taken together, the findings presented here indicate that Rac 1 may be a potential target for antitumour drugs and provide new insights into the development of gene therapy technology for treating women with cervical cancer.</p>
