<p>There is a marked contrast between the developed world and the developing economies in both access to electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), availability of EEE and all too often even access to electrical power.</p>
<p>In the developed world there are many items of EEE that are discarded even before use, with minimal use, discarded rather than the consumer considering repair, or discarded well before their technical end of life (EoL). Studies in several countries, including Sweden, Denmark and the UK, show that about 20–30% of discarded EEE delivered to household waste and recycling centres (HWRCs) is capable of further extended use.</p>
<p>Although there are many mechanisms in developed economies for the re-utilization of items before they are finally discarded, increasingly because other people (relatives, friends and recipients of household items from voluntary organizations themselves) already have many of these items or prefer to purchase new equipment, the surplus of re-usable EEE cannot be accommodated within the local economy.</p>
<p>Some items can be utilized within the local community, for example, items that have market appeal, such as Dyson vacuum cleaners, flat screen televisions and monitors, and dishwashers. These can be reclaimed from HWRCs and if delivered intact and if the transfer and treatment facilities to which these items are sent are capable of undertaking the sorting, testing and marketing of these items to those consumers who are keen to accept these items then they can have their EoL extended. Indeed there are now not only those consumers who may only be able to purchase these second-hand products but a new breed of greener consumer able to purchase new items of EEE but choosing instead to purchase second-hand, but their numbers are limited compared to the potential supplies of post-consumer cathode ray tubes (CRTs) televisions and monitors, for example.</p>
<p>Many items therefore, such as a TV with a CRT, year old computers and most mobile phones cannot even be donated in most cases. At the same time there is a demand for these types of items in many developing countries as the price of used items can be one-quarter or less than the price of an equivalent new product. Therefore, reclamation of still-functional but slightly obsolete electronic equipment can enable poorer consumers to have access to relatively low-priced consumer products.</p>
<p>In a broader perspective the use of many items of discarded EEE is of continuing value socially within many developing countries – second-hand computers in schools, for example. The argument for passing on mobile phones to people in developing countries appears incontrovertible in that the environmental risks of disposal in those countries is minimal provided that the battery remains contained within the handset.</p>
<p>Therefore, in developing countries mobile telephones, laptops and associated items are now providing the impetus to development where the conventional electrical grid systems are not yet established. In Africa, half of its one billion population have access now to a mobile phone and India adds 15 million mobile phones every month with over a billion subscribers expected to be exceeded in the next few months. Even in the very poorest countries entrepreneurs can make a living by renting mobile phones by the minute, enabling phone renters to maintain family contact and farmers and fishermen to obtain information about the best locations to market their produce.</p>
<p>We are now increasingly faced with calls from environmental groups to stop the exports of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). The International Solid Waste Association would certainly support this but the dividing line between the export of re-usable EEE and WEEE is not clear and the intentions of future use and the packaging of these items will often be critical factors for the regulation authorities in deciding whether to prosecute exporters of non re-usable EEE to developing countries. Transboundary movement of EEE on the pretext of recycling can cause serious issues in developing nations since many industry players misuse this facility to export WEEE to be processed illegally in poor countries.</p>
<p>Increasingly, one of the complicating factors associated with the export of WEEE is that the people managing these exports are nationals from the importing countries where prosecution can easily be evaded by going back home. Thus increasingly we find that there is an element of fraud associated with the export of WEEE or items purportedly being reusable EEE, and the people seeking to export reusable EEE are not concerned whether these items are EEE or WEEE.</p>
<p>Waste trafficking of WEEE is a continuing concern but we should be distinguishing between WEEE and EEE items that are capable of extended use in developing countries. Certainly few would wish to advocate the export of WEEE to developing economies, although some would argue that items of non-hazardous WEEE could be exported because these items could be repaired for further use and the training and employment opportunities are obviously valuable.</p>
<p>Provision of treatment facilities for WEEE is increasingly important in all parts of the World. However, those responsible for environmental protection in both developed and developing countries need to implement programs to provide for the proper (a) processing of imported WEEE in developing economies, irrespective of whether this is EEE re-used from the developed world or purchased new locally, and (b) management of hazardous wastes from WEEE processing. Unfortunately, a large number of developing countries have rudimentary WEEE treatment technologies insufficiently funded or staffed to deal with the high amounts of such wastes. Open air processing of WEEE is widely practised to recover metals, for instance. The informal recycling sector is very active in developing countries where harmful techniques in de-soldering circuit boards and stripping insulation from wires are very common.</p>
<p>Solutions to the WEEE issues in developing countries can only be solved by the transfer of appropriate technologies. Such technologies should incorporate and recognize the role of the dominant informal sector and their linkage with the state-of-the-art formal WEEE recycling sectors. Financing the WEEE collection schemes in developing countries has always been a challenge. Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is widely acknowledged in the developed world as one of the most effective tools to finance WEEE management schemes. Developing countries should, however, design their own EPR schemes based upon their capacity to implement such schemes. This special issue of <italic>Waste Management &amp;Research</italic> focuses on these issues and is intended to raise the awareness of EEE and WEEE issues in both developing and developed countries.</p>
