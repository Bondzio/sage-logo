<p><bold>Background</bold>. Shared decision making (SDM) is often advocated as an ideal for making medical decisions. Until now, however, opinions regarding which treatment situations warrant SDM have not been systematically investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine social norms regarding medical decision making, using a factorial survey design. <bold>Methods</bold>. The factorial survey applied in this study consisted of 7 situational factors (e.g., the reason for consultation), each with 2 to 3 levels (e.g., prevention and severe disease). These factors were turned into various descriptions of treatment situations. A total of 101 physicians, 115 patients, and 113 members of self-help groups participated in the study. Each participant assessed 10 vignettes using a 5-point scale to indicate who they thought should make the decision in each specific situation. <bold>Results</bold>. Most assessments across the 3 groups called for a shared decision (39%). Ordered logistic regression analysis demonstrated that, according to study participants, all 7 situational factors (reason for consultation, time frame of negative outcomes, time pressure, number of therapeutic options, side effects, scientific evidence of efficacy, and desire to participate) significantly affected how decisions regarding treatment should be made. The strongest factor was the patient’s desire to participate in decision making (odds ratio = 1.84; <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001), followed by the reason for consultation (odds ratio = 0.69; <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001). <bold>Conclusions</bold>. This study reveals that there is a general desire for SDM in a variety of treatment situations. Furthermore, based on the responses of our participants, our findings also lay the framework in determining which treatment situations warrant SDM.</p>

<body>
<p>As part of routine medical care, various decisions must be made concerning analysis, prevention, and therapy; sometimes, questions arise regarding what roles the interested parties should play in reaching a decision. The patient-physician relationship can be arranged in myriad forms where such decision making is concerned, and for the purposes of this study, we refer to 3 basic approaches to medical decision making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12458159">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12458159">2</xref></sup>: a decision can be made paternalistically by the physician, shared equally by the patient and physician, or made by an informed patient.</p>
<p>Shared decision making (SDM) is often advocated as the decision-making ideal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12458159">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12458159">4</xref></sup> because it is a way to achieve patient-centeredness in medical care without leaving the patient on his or her own.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12458159">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12458159">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12458159">6</xref></sup> Many studies regarding medical decision making link SDM and SDM-based decision aids to improved clinical outcomes, better quality of life, increased adherence to treatment, greater patient satisfaction, and enhanced knowledge regarding the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12458159">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12458159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12458159">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, SDM may not be suitable for all patients in all circumstances; participation preferences vary based on gender, age, and educational level,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12458159">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12458159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12458159">12</xref></sup> and furthermore, studies show that the desire to participate is influenced by the medical condition itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12458159">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X12458159">14</xref></sup> and that SDM may be more suitable in some treatment situations than in others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12458159">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X12458159">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>From a theoretical, normative point of view, Whitney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12458159">17</xref></sup> has raised the question of whether there should be limits to SDM. To address this question, he developed a model that classifies clinical situations according to both the importance of the medical decision for the patient and the physician’s level of certainty regarding therapeutic efficacy. However, because many additional situational characteristics (here called “factors”) might also affect how medical decisions should be made (e.g., the number of therapeutic options or the severity of the disease), in an earlier published article,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12458159">18</xref></sup> we proposed a multidimensional model of medical decision making as an amplification of the model developed by Whitney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12458159">17</xref></sup> As a first step in identifying situational factors of importance, we conducted qualitative interviews with patients, physicians, and health administration and research professionals in our former study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12458159">18</xref></sup> From those interviews, we were able to identify a number of situational factors that were thought to be common influences in determining the appropriateness of SDM. These factors belong to 3 categories: characteristics of the disease (e.g., “prevention or therapy”), characteristics of the therapeutic options (e.g., “presence or absence of adverse effects”), and characteristics of the patient (e.g., “strong or weak desire to participate”). To clarify the influence of these identified situational factors in a larger quantitative study, we chose a factorial survey design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12458159">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The factorial survey method, which combines the advantages of an experimental design with those of survey research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X12458159">20</xref>
</sup> stems from methods used in the social sciences and allows for investigation of social norms in a systematic manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X12458159">21</xref></sup> In this study, social norms refer to the interviewee’s judgments on how decisions should generally be made in certain situations. These should be distinguished from both philosophical norms, which are based on theoretical analysis, as well as from personal preferences, which would be valid for a single person only.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12458159">18</xref></sup> In factorial survey studies, subjects typically receive a variety of hypothetical vignettes describing specific incidents, for example, consultation situations. Such vignettes are systematically constructed based on factors thought to influence judgment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12458159">22</xref></sup> Subjects are asked to indicate how the decision should be made in each situation by judging the vignettes on a rating scale. The subsequent statistical analysis models how the various levels of the vignette factors and their combinations are weighted for the vignette judgments and aims to show how judgments are affected by these factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12458159">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The factorial survey shares many characteristics with better-known conjoint analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12458159">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X12458159">25</xref></sup> and discrete choice experiments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12458159">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X12458159">27</xref></sup> which were originally developed to assess consumer preference. These study techniques are also based on situational descriptions and have increasingly been used in recent years to study preferences for different treatment options.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272989X12458159">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272989X12458159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X12458159">30</xref></sup> Nevertheless, for our study, we chose a factorial survey design in an effort to focus on the investigation of social norms.</p>
<p>The objective of the factorial survey we present was to analyze from the standpoint of patients and physicians how medical decisions should be made and in which treatment situations the decisions should be shared, made by informed patients, or decided paternalistically by the physician. By doing this, we hope to confirm the results of our preliminary qualitative study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12458159">18</xref></sup> within a larger quantitative design. Our hypothesis was that SDM is seen as the most important decision-making means in the majority of situations. We also expect that in contrast to Whitney’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12458159">17</xref></sup> theoretical model and in accordance with the results of our former qualitative study, additional situational dimensions also influence judgments regarding how medical decisions should be made. Additionally, we will use the responses gathered from our study participants as a framework for defining the situations in which SDM is particularly important. In our previous interviews, participants had difficulty separating social norms from their own preferences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12458159">18</xref></sup>; therefore, we also want to analyze how personal decision-making preferences influence the social norms of medical decision making. An additional aim was to examine whether differences arise on the basis of gender, age, and/or educational level, as have previously been reported with regard to personal decision-making preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12458159">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12458159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12458159">12</xref></sup> Finally, because patients and physicians play different roles in the medical decision-making process, we also want to use this study to investigate differences between these roles regarding social norms on SDM.</p>

<p><bold>Example of a Survey Vignette along with the More Concrete Version Tested in the Pretest</bold></p>
<p><bold>A survey vignette (abstract version):</bold></p>
<p>A patient consults for a severe disease that does not currently cause symptoms but might manifest negative effects in the future. There is no time pressure for the treatment to begin. Generally, the patient wants to participate in medical decisions. There are various therapeutic options. Some possible treatments are well tolerated, and others may have severe side effects. Efficacy of the various treatments has been proven.</p>
<p><bold>More concrete version:</bold></p>
<p>A patient consults his doctor because of mildly elevated blood pressure that does not affect him right now but might manifest negative effects in the future. There is no time pressure for the treatment to begin. Generally, the patient wants to participate in medical decisions. Basically, the available therapeutic options are a pill that could have adverse effects or a change in his lifestyle that is well tolerated. Efficacy of both treatments has been proven.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>At the beginning of the study, we wondered if respondents would have difficulty rating vignettes in such an abstract manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12458159">19</xref></sup>; to address this problem, we conducted a cognitive pretest, which compared the abstract and concrete vignettes. An example of a concrete vignette is also displayed alongside the abstract vignette in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-0272989X12458159">Box 1</xref> (second vignette). Through this pretest, we learned that abstract vignettes were generally well tolerated, and sometimes even preferred, by participants, and because of this, we decided to use only abstract vignettes in the final questionnaire. Despite this finding, we still included possible examples of factor concretions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and cancer as examples of severe diseases) in the instructions of the questionnaire to improve comprehensibility.</p>
<p>The implementation of factorial surveys requires selecting a method of drawing the vignette samples because there are too many possible vignettes for all to be comprehensively evaluated by the respondents. One possibility for selecting vignettes is to draw a random sample; however, this approach runs a risk that dimensions or interactions of dimensions will be strongly correlated with each other and that the impact of the dimensions and possible interactions on the vignette evaluations would thus not be separable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X12458159">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12458159">32</xref></sup> Therefore, it is recommended that systematically drawn samples be used, especially “fractionalized” designs and in particular “D-efficient” designs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12458159">32</xref></sup> These designs are built by a computer algorithm that specifies a sample by optimizing 2 desirable characteristics of experimental designs: a minimal intercorrelation between dimensions (and interaction terms) and, at the same time, a maximal variance of the vignette levels. Estimations based on D-efficient designs are more efficient in a statistical sense than other designs in that there is a higher chance of revealing the true influence of single dimensions. These designs also ensure that single dimensions and interaction terms are not confounded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X12458159">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X12458159">32</xref></sup> We drew a D-efficient sample of 4 sets of 10 vignettes by means of the SAS-macro <italic>MktEx</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X12458159">33</xref></sup> excluding illogical cases (e.g., “one therapeutic option” cannot be combined with “treatments are partially well tolerated, may partially have severe side effects”). The size of D-efficiency refers to the chance of revealing the true influence of a single dimension; of a maximum of 100 (if all vignettes were used without sampling), D-efficiency in this study was 83.</p>
<p>Each participant was randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 sets. Furthermore, the ordering of vignettes was rotated at random within each set to avoid ordering effects. Respondents were asked to rate their vignettes on a 5-point scale adapted from Sutherland and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272989X12458159">34</xref></sup> indicating how the decision should be made in that specific situation. The possibilities presented for judgment were the following: “the doctor should make the decision alone” (judgment 1), “the doctor should make the decision but consider the patient’s opinion” (judgment 2), “the doctor and the patient should make the decision together” (judgment 3), “the patient should make the decision but consider the doctor’s opinion” (judgment 4), and “the patient should make the decision alone” (judgment 5).</p>

<title>Participants and Data Collection</title>
<p>The participants of this study were FPs, patients, and members of self-help groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12458159">19</xref></sup> FPs were chosen because they are consulted by their patients on a broad range of health-related decisions. We included “typical” patients as well as members of self-help groups because patients organized in self-help groups are generally presumed to take a more active part in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>FPs were recruited from the network of research practices led by the Department of Family Practice in Marburg, from quality circles, and at continuing medical education sessions. Patients were recruited from the waiting rooms of 9 primary care practices. Nineteen different self-help groups, including self-help groups for diabetics, people with leukemia, and migraine sufferers, were visited during regular group meetings. The study was first presented at these meetings, and participants who gave informed consent were invited to participate.

<p>First, participants received written information about the study and gave informed consent. Next, they completed the questionnaire one by one in a separate room; a member of the research team was present to personally explain how to work through the questionnaire as well as to respond to any questions from participants. After rating the case vignettes, participants were asked about their personal decision-making preferences in case of illness. To answer this question, a 5-point scale (derived from the vignette rating scale) was used, ranging from “I want the doctor to make the decision alone” to “I want to make the decision alone.” Sociodemographic data such as sex, age, and educational level were collected at the conclusion of the survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272989X12458159">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We used heterogeneous ordered logistic regression models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272989X12458159">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272989X12458159">36</xref></sup> to identify the influences of the factors on the dependent variable by means of Stata software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X12458159">37</xref></sup> We estimated these models because we found heteroskedasticity in our data, such that an ordinal regression model that incorrectly assumes equal error variances for all cases would estimate biased standard errors and coefficients. Heterogeneous ordered logistic models specify the determinants of heteroskedasticity in order to correct for it.</p>
<p>Covariates were dummy-coded for analysis. Because each participant rated multiple vignettes, ratings by the same participant have correlated error terms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12458159">22</xref></sup> resulting in a clustered data structure and, if not considered, in an underestimation of standard errors. For this reason, the models were estimated with clustered standard errors using the respondent identification (ID) as a cluster variable. This approach only assumes the independence of ratings across but not within the clusters.</p>
<p>Variables were introduced in a stepwise process. First, we included the 7 survey factors. Next, we tested the influences of other relevant variables, including the vignette set, the study group, the sociodemographic variables, and the personal decision-making preferences. All variables with significant effects were included in the final model, which we have presented as the first model in the Results section of this article. Further analysis addressed the interactions of the group variable with the 7 survey factors on the vignette judgments in order to analyze group differences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X12458159">38</xref></sup> Results of this analysis are presented in a second model.</p>
<p>Because regression analysis demonstrates effects on the scale from least to greatest patient participation only, we also show additional descriptive statistical analyses for the most important factors in the Results section, indicating the percentage of judgments for patient-based (judgments 4 and 5 grouped together), shared, or physician-based (judgments 1 and 2 grouped together) decisions.</p>

<p>To demonstrate how many situations were judged as requiring a shared, a paternalistic, or a patient-based decision, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X12458159">Figure 1</xref> shows the distribution of the dependent variable “vignette judgment” across the 3 groups. In most situations, a shared decision was considered warranted by members of all 3 groups (39% of all judgments).

<title>Ordered Logistic Regression Analysis</title>
<p>Furthermore, we investigated the influence of the situational factors on the vignette judgments via heterogeneous ordered logistic regression analysis and found all factors to be of significant influence. We also analyzed the influence of other important variables, such as the personal decision-making preference, the study group, and sociodemographic variables, on the vignette judgments. Analysis demonstrated that the influence of “vignette set” was not significant, indicating that results were not systematically influenced by which vignette set participants received. The study group and the personal characteristics of the respondent, such as age, sex, and educational level, also had no significant effect. As such, these variables were not included in the final models, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X12458159">Table 3</xref> (first model). In addition to the situational factors, only the personal decision-making preference was found to be of significant influence and was subsequently included in the model.</p>

<p>The reason for consultation also appeared as a significant influence. In cases of mild (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004) diseases and even more so in severe diseases (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001), a physician’s decision was more strongly advocated than in cases involving preventive care (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272989X12458159">Table 4</xref> for descriptive analysis). The time frame of negative outcomes also significantly influenced the judgments (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001): in situations with long-term negative consequences, patient participation was more frequently considered appropriate than in situations with immediate harm caused by the illness (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272989X12458159">Table 4</xref> for descriptive analysis). The scientific evidence of treatment efficacy was yet another significant influence: in situations with “no evidence of efficacy” (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001) or “good evidence of efficacy of one/some treatment option(s) but no evidence of efficacy of other treatment option(s)” (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008), more participation was called for than when there was “good evidence of efficacy.” Furthermore, the length of time until treatment must start also played an important role (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004): in situations without time pressure, results shifted towards a patient’s decision compared to situations requiring an immediate start to treatment. A shift in the same direction was also observed for those treatments that carried a risk of side effects compared to those treatments that were well tolerated (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001) and for situations with more than one possible therapeutic option compared to situations with only one reasonable option (<italic>P</italic> = 0.023).</p>

<sec id="section9-0272989X12458159">
<title>The Influence of the Personal Decision-Making Preference</title>
<p>Within the first model, the most significant effects resulted from the influence of a participant’s personal decision-making preference on his or her vignette judgments. Participants who wanted to share decisions during their own illnesses (judgment 3) or make decisions primarily on their own (judgments 4 and 5) called for significantly more patient participation in the judgments of the vignettes (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001) than those who preferred physician-based decisions when they were ill (judgments 1 and 2).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272989X12458159">Table 4</xref> shows the relevant descriptive analysis. The more participants wanted to take part in decisions regarding their own illnesses, the more their vignette judgments tended towards patient participation. The Goodman and Kruskal γ also confirms this association (γ = 0.467; asymptotic standard error = 0.024).</p>

<title>Group Differences</title>
<p>The results of the first regression model presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X12458159">Table 3</xref> revealed no significant influence of the study group. To further examine group differences in a second step, we tested the interactions of the group variable with the 7 survey factors. The second model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X12458159">Table 3</xref> shows the 2 significant interaction effects that are described in detail in the following section. A significant effect of the group variable appeared after including these interactions in the model.</p>
<p>There was a significant interaction between the desire of the patient to participate and the research group. It was observed that physicians’ responses differed from those of members of the self-help groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and of patients (<italic>P</italic> = 0.041). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272989X12458159">Figure 2</xref> clarifies this interaction: a patient’s desire to participate in decision making had a stronger effect in the physicians than in the other 2 groups: that is, in situations where the fictitious patient was unwilling to participate, physicians more strongly advocated leaving the decision to health care providers, and they shifted more strongly towards patient involvement in those situations where the patient wanted to participate in decision making. However, the effect of the patient’s desire to participate on the vignette judgments was also significant in the 2 other groups and in the same direction as in the physicians’ group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272989X12458159">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between the time frame of negative outcomes and the research group: again, physicians differed from members of the self-help groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.021) and patients (<italic>P</italic> = 0.046). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0272989X12458159">Figure 3</xref> shows that it made a greater difference to the physicians than to the other groups whether a disease had immediately negative consequences or if those consequences arose in the future. In contrast to the other 2 subject groups, the physicians demanded that decisions be made by the health care provider more often in those cases with immediately negative consequences and shifted more strongly towards patient participation in cases of long-term negative consequences. However, the effect of the time frame of negative outcomes on the vignette judgments was also significant in the 2 other study groups and in the same direction as in the physicians’ group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0272989X12458159">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As indicated in our introduction, much literature regarding SDM and personal preferences for SDM already exists; however, our study is the first to date in the field that systematically, via analysis of social norms, addresses the question of when medical decisions should be shared. This study reveals that SDM was considered by our respondents to be the most appropriate decision-making means in the majority of the presented medical situations. This in turn demonstrates that a general desire for SDM exists not only from a personal standpoint but also from the perspective of the social norms indicated by the study participants. According to the indicated social norms, both physicians and patients should engage in the decision-making process by drawing on personal opinions and knowledge.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these results contribute to our understanding of how patients and physicians value different situational factors with regard to the question of how medical decisions should be made. Our results demonstrate that the considered situational factors are, indeed, judged to be important for medical decision making and confirm our hypothesis that more situational factors influence the judgment of how medical decisions should be made than were considered by Whitney’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12458159">17</xref></sup> original theoretical model.</p>
<p>However, it must be kept in mind that our results are based on abstract hypothetical vignettes and that judgments about real consultation situations might be different. In addition, results are not based on a representative sample; there are some limitations introduced by selecting FPs, patients, and members of self-help groups as study participants.</p>
<p>Our study not only analyzed factors that directly refer to the treatment situation but also analyzed the influence of the patient’s desire to participate in medical decision making. The reason for including this factor was that previous research showed it to be of utmost importance. Correspondingly, in our study, it was seen as fairly important that patients’ preferences are respected, which is in accordance with other studies that have previously recommended that patients should be involved in the medical decision-making process whenever they desire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X12458159">39</xref></sup> To transfer this ethical precept into practice, physicians must ascertain their patients’ participation preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X12458159">39</xref></sup> Because physicians often assess these preferences incorrectly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272989X12458159">40</xref></sup> more research should be undertaken to analyze how participation preferences may be discerned more effectively.</p>
<p>Our study confirms the importance of patient participation in preventive care, which is already assumed by many studies on decision aids within this field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12458159">41</xref></sup> Furthermore, in situations with negative future consequences, such as with most chronic conditions, patient participation was also considered important. This result supports that of our prior interview study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12458159">18</xref></sup> in which participants asserted that there is a greater need for patient participation in cases of chronic disease, such as diabetes and hypertension, because those medical decisions are often linked to quality of life.</p>
<p>Our study also found that missing scientific evidence of treatment efficacy was perceived as a reason for a higher level of patient participation. This result confirms the importance of the factor in Whitney’s model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12458159">17</xref></sup> referring to the physician’s certainty regarding therapeutic efficacy. Decisions in cases of missing evidence are preference-sensitive decisions because in such situations, it is not clear which strategy is the best for the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12458159">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, situations under time pressure, such as emergencies, were seen as necessitating a primarily physician-based decision. This idea echoes positions that define SDM as inappropriate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X12458159">43</xref></sup> or difficult during emergency care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272989X12458159">44</xref></sup> However, in our study, this effect was less strong than expected; one possible explanation is that perhaps the emergency situation was not sufficiently described by the vignettes. Another reason, however, could be that participants genuinely considered SDM important even in emergency situations.</p>
<p>Our results also confirm that the existence of side effects is, normatively speaking, a reason for shifting to patient-based decision making; this was represented by the importance factor in Whitney’s model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12458159">17</xref></sup> This factor is especially relevant because decisions involving potential side effects essentially depend on the patient’s personal value system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12458159">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study found no significant influence of sex, age, or educational level on decision-making norms. This finding suggests that such influences upon participation preferences as identified by other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12458159">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12458159">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272989X12458159">45</xref></sup> may not apply to social norms.</p>
<p>Results also revealed few differences between the judgments of each research group, demonstrating that social norms regarding medical decision making may be widely accepted by various parties. In the physician group, however, the time frame of negative outcomes affected judgments more strongly than in the other 2 groups; in this group, it was seen as more important that the patient participates in decisions regarding diseases with long-term negative consequences. One explanation for this result could be that, in comparison with patients, physicians are more aware of the critical importance of treatment adherence in diseases with future negative consequences that require long-term treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12458159">18</xref></sup> Additionally, when compared to the other groups, physicians called more strongly for patient involvement in situations where the patient wanted to participate in decision making; here, it is important to recall that participating physicians were recruited from family practitioners. Given their philosophy of patient-centered care, the effect of this interaction may be unique to this group and not replicable among specialist practitioners.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that according to the opinions of the various involved parties, multiple situational factors play a role in how medical decisions should be made, as suggested by our preliminary interview study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12458159">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, results suggest that some factors, such as the patient’s desire to participate, may be more important than others. To some extent, our empirical results allow for the definition of situations in which SDM and patient-centered care are especially important. This may be useful because, due to limited resources, SDM has not been broadly implemented in clinical practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272989X12458159">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272989X12458159">47</xref></sup> and cannot be applied in all situations. According to our data, SDM is particularly required when the patient wants to participate in medical decision making. When asking about the kind of disease that requires the application of SDM and patient-centered care, our data point to preventive care and situations with long-term negative consequences, such as chronic conditions. Regarding the therapeutic options, the data indicate that SDM is important in situations without evidence of treatment efficacy, in situations without time pressure for beginning treatment, in situations where treatment has potential side effects, and even more so when multiple therapeutic options exist.</p>
<p>Another important result of this study is that a participant’s personal decision-making preference was more influential than were the situational factors regarding the question of how treatment decisions should be made. This reveals that social norms in the field of medical decision making are highly influenced by personal preferences. Because preferences change over time,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272989X12458159">48</xref></sup> and studies show that SDM becomes more popular the more patients experience it,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272989X12458159">49</xref></sup> SDM may be considered even more important as a normative demand at some point in the future. It is therefore especially important that future research addresses how the practical obstacles that presently exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272989X12458159">50</xref></sup> might be resolved. Until SDM can be widely implemented in clinical practice, however, the identified situational factors may be useful for determining when SDM is indispensable and when decisions by physicians are less problematic or actually required.</p>
<p>Despite the usefulness of the findings of the present study, more research remains necessary to analyze social norms concerning actual treatment situations and to include positions from other stakeholders. Ultimately, measuring social norms cannot replace the ethical debate on this topic.</p>
