<p>Bancroft’s text on human sexuality and its problems is now in its third edition, and very welcome it is too. It is in a bigger format and has more pages than earlier editions, reflecting the growth of clinical and sociological research in the field since the last edition 20 years ago. The book has 16 chapters. The author sets the scene extremely ably in the first two, first dealing with his own journey in the field of psychosexual medicine and then presenting what I think is one of the most intriguing and stimulating chapters on the models of human sexuality and the role of theory. Bancroft provides a scholarly dissection of theories and the context in which people enjoy or deal with sex acts. In subsequent chapters he develops themes of sexual arousal, gender identity, heterosexuality, sexuality and ageing. Development of gender identity and the psychosomatic circle in sexual arousal and response are covered well. Three chapters provide an overview of LGBT sexualities. Clinicians will find the chapters on assessment and treatment and the nature of problematic sexuality extremely helpful in day-to-day work. John Bancroft deserves our thanks and congratulations for this excellent volume, which is bound to become a classic.</p>
