<abstract>
<p>An anthropomorphic, psychometric and dietary variety assessment was employed to uncover the impact of an intervention for children with a feeding problem due to sensory defensiveness. Parents were trained to deliver a contingent reward desensitization procedure to encourage the child to try food. All children gained weight on their population corrected height and weight over the 6-month intervention. The psychometric measures showed that parents reported fewer feeding problems concomitant with increases in dietary variety. Responsiveness to the intervention was variable within the current study, and this was based on the age of the child at the start of the intervention. Before the intervention, dietary variety was directly proportional to the parents’ reporting of their problems controlling mealtimes. In contrast, dietary variety after the intervention was associated with the child’s problem score. In a group of children who primarily have sensory defensiveness, contingent reward alongside a graduated exposure technique, can improve dietary variety.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sensory sensitivity is a relatively recent addition to developmental psychology literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412452132">1</xref></sup> In the first iterations of the proposed concept, 2 definitions have surfaced. The first definition suggests that sensory-sensitive individuals process sensory information more deeply than nonsensitive individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412452132">1</xref></sup> This definition would be indicative of a nonclinical level of sensory sensitivity whereby the individual is able to function within their social environment. Clinical definitions of the same potential phenomena extend this sensitivity hypothesis to suggest that the individual derives insult from the information that others would consider not offensive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412452132">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412452132">3</xref></sup> To differentiate between clinical and nonclinical levels of sensory sensitivity, clinical cases are usually referred to as being defensive rather than sensitive.</p>
<p>In the wider nonclinical population, sensory sensitivity has been related to anxiety, depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412452132">4</xref></sup> parental overprotection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412452132">5</xref></sup> parental competitiveness toward their child’s performance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412452132">6</xref></sup> and dietary variety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412452132">7</xref></sup>—specifically fruit and vegetable consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412452132">8</xref></sup> It has been postulated that the interaction of sensory sensitivity, and defensiveness in particular, is a component of picky eating in children, whereby the child refuses foods based on their sensory properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412452132">9</xref></sup> To support this hypothesis, sensory education has been shown to temporarily increase interaction with novel foods in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412452132">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412452132"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412452132">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical observations of more extreme levels of sensory defensiveness, which lead to feeding problems of clinical significance, are also available within the literature. The vast majority of these articles focus on feeding and sensory sensitivity/defensiveness in autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs; for a review see Cermak et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412452132">13</xref></sup>). Effectively, children with ASD often exhibit sensory defensive behaviors that have been postulated to extend into all of the sensory domains within food acceptance and feeding behavior (ie, visual [narrow tolerance for acceptance of how foods look in terms of shape and color], olfactory [foods with a strong or unique smell are rejected], taste [strong tasting foods are often refused in preference for more “bland” alternatives], touch [narrow repertoire of acceptance for the feel of foods], and oral sensory [sensory defensiveness specific to the texture of food within the mouth and/or objects within the mouth].<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412452132">14</xref></sup> In terms of sensory defensive characteristics in clinical samples that do not have ASD, there is an obvious dearth in the literature. This is surprising as sensory sensitivity has been shown to be independent and unrelated to ASD behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412452132">4</xref></sup> and not all children with ASD have problems with food selectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412452132">13</xref></sup> Information concerning children with feeding problems of clinical significance as a result of sensory defensiveness is available. Two case descriptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412452132">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412452132">16</xref></sup> have been published that show extreme defensiveness specific to one sense can result in significant food refusal problems worthy of clinical attention. To our knowledge, no study has attempted to look at these children from a quantitative perspective. This was one of the primary aims of the current study.</p>
<p>Interventions for feeding problems designed for children with ASD are complicated because of the nature of the disorder. Children with ASD concentrate on detail, often have sensory impairments, and have problems with social compliance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412452132">17</xref></sup> It is the social compliance component to the disorder alongside the pervasive impairments of children with ASD that necessitates clinician-led interventions incorporating strategies such as escape extinction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412452132">18</xref></sup> Such invasive and potentially anxiolytic strategies are arguably not necessary for children that do not have social compliance problems. Additional strategies that are often employed alongside escape extinction are desensitization training (eg, graduated exposure) and contingent reward.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412452132">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412452132"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412452132">21</xref></sup> Indeed contingency management, the umbrella term for offering rewards for desired behaviors—as well as rewarding not expressing undesired behavior—is arguably considered the primary guiding strategy to increasing desired feeding outcomes with children. However, it must be stated that modern interventions for feeding problems encompass a variety of strategies to increase dietary variety.</p>
<p>In published cases where children express high levels of sensory problems, almost exclusively in combination with ASD, it is deemed appropriate that a desensitization protocol is employed to overcome this facet to the child’s feeding problem. Although the term <italic>desensitization</italic> is used in a variety of therapeutic settings, in all instances it refers to a graduated exposure defined by “closeness” to the feared or offending object. “Closeness” may refer to proximity, tolerance, or in the case of food, texture, density (ie, pureed, blended, chopped up, whole).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412452132">22</xref></sup> Often termed <italic>graduated exposure</italic> or <italic>texture fading</italic>, the utility of desensitization protocols appears to be well established in both the typically developing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412452132">23</xref></sup> and clinically relevant feeding problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412452132">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412452132">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412452132">24</xref></sup> children. Contingent reward refers to when the child receives positive reinforcement for completing a desired behavior. The reward can come in a variety of forms with an increasing cognitive–behavioral complexity ranging from simple praise,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412452132">25</xref></sup> offering access to, or removal of, a desired item,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412452132">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941406412452132">27</xref></sup> and token economy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412452132">20</xref></sup> Token economies are arguably the most complex form of positive reward, as it requires the child to understand the value of the token and also be able to comprehend delayed gratification (ie, being able to save the tokens up to receive a higher value reward). It must be noted, however, that token economies have been successfully implemented in interventions for children with developmental delay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412452132">24</xref></sup> Therefore, the level of comprehension and ability to accept delayed gratification is not necessarily an advanced developmental requirement.</p>
<p>The overall aim of the current study was to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of a sensory desensitization protocol coupled with a token economy in a group of clinically relevant children with sensory motor sensitivities. Clinically relevant in this instance was defined by children who had extremely low dietary variety/food selectivity as a result of having sensory defensiveness without any other medical, developmental, phobic, or experiential components to their food refusal. Both desensitization and token economy have been used in a variety of clinical samples with a similar etiology to children with sensory defensiveness. It can therefore be hypothesized that children with sensory defensiveness should respond to these strategies to increase their acceptance of previously refused food items that were rejected on a sensory processing basis.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1941406412452132">
<title>Design</title>
<p>The purpose of this evaluation was to provide a psychometric and dietary quantity evaluation of a contingent reward-based intervention for children with feeding problems of clinical significance and was based within a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service pediatric psychology specialty service within the English National Health Service. The service was situated at a tertiary level within the National Health Service and therefore was not directly accessible to the general public (ie, all families requiring intervention for the feeding services must be referred through another professional group). Children were referred to the service through a number of pathways. These included gastroenterologists, pediatricians, community/hospital dietitians, speech and language therapists, and other psychological services (eg, ASDs) and were for persistent feeding problems with no known medical cause. Based on the assessments made by the various professionals within the referral pathway, the children within the current study did not have any formal diagnosis for any current biological complaint, ASDs, or developmental delay. These potential diagnoses were discounted prior to arrival at the service by the relevant professional within the referral pathway. On referral to the service, the children were assessed for sensory sensitivity and food phobia, as well as for dietary deficiency. Sensory sensitivity and food phobia were measured through a clinical interview and an observation of the child interacting with the objects/food. The clinical interview is outlined in Dovey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941406412452132">28</xref></sup> in the current journal. The experimental component was completed through presenting the child with a variety of stimuli and observing their behavior. Food phobia was defined as a phobic-like response to food being in their environment (ie, not tolerating the food item in their environment for any time and showing increased anxiety (freezing or trying to get away from the food) concomitant with decrease in distance between the item and the child). This was assessed by behavioral coding outlined by Nock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412452132">21</xref></sup> None of the children in this sample had a food phobia. Sensory sensitivity was defined in the current study as the intolerance for items based on sensory characteristics that the majority of people do not find offensive. This was assessed through observing the child engaging in messy play. Children who were resistant or refused to engage with a variety of textures (eg, water, sand, paint, play dough) were considered to be sensory defensive. All the children within the current study were deemed to have a nutritionally deficient diet by the dietitian. Deficiency was defined as not consuming enough calories and/or nutrients to maintain their weight and/or health.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Seventeen families voluntarily took part in the current study. Volunteers (14 male and 3 female) were referred to the service from February 2010 to December 2010. The children, at the start of the intervention, ranged in ages from 28 to 82 months (mean =50.7 ± 14.2 months). Their parents ages ranged from 23 to 39 years at referral (mean = 33.25 ± 4.2) and all were married. Only one parent in the current sample had university-level education with the rest completing high school (GCSEs/A levels). All children stayed in the program for 6 months with the second measurement taken as close to 1 week after completion of the course as possible. The mean age of the children at the end of the intervention was 56.5 ± 14.8 months.</p>
<p>The child-related inclusion criteria for the current study were as follows: the child had no formal medical diagnosis, had not been exposed to a variety of foods in the past—for a suitable period of time and a suitable number of exposures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412452132">23</xref></sup> and did not have a food phobia. The parent-related exclusion criteria were related to their mental health. Parents with a history of pervasive mental health problems or was currently suffering with a mental health problem were offered a clinician-led intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941406412452132">28</xref></sup> This parent-related exclusion criterion was added as the intervention requires a large investment from the parent for maximum chance of success. Parent’s mental health was assessed through clinical case notes, a clinical interview and/or if they volunteered the information at any time during the intervention.</p>
<p>The principal inclusion criteria for the current study was taken from Dahl and Sundelin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941406412452132">29</xref></sup> that the child must have refused to eat on at least one occasion each day for a minimum period of 1 month. Another inclusion criterion for the current study was that the children had high levels of sensory sensitivity. The characteristics included as being sensory sensitive within the</p>
<p>current study were that the children derived observable offence from oral motor, tactile, olfactory, visual, and/or auditory processing that other children either within the service or the general population would not find offensive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412452132">3</xref></sup> This was assessed from a clinical interview and by observing the child during mealtimes. We have previously described the case of a child with olfactory sensitivity elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412452132">16</xref></sup> and other cases of similar sensory-related food refusal have been reported by other groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412452132">15</xref></sup> Potentially 3 different terms have been used to refer to these children in the wider literature. These are nonorganic feeding problem, sensory sensitivity, and selective eaters. We have previously described another group of children with feeding problems that could also be considered as nonorganic feeding problem elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412452132">30</xref></sup> We have not used the term <italic>selective eater</italic> within the current article as this has been used in previous literature with children with ASD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412452132">13</xref></sup> The children within the current study did not have a diagnosis for ASD. The assessment procedure used within the service can be found in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941406412452132">28</xref></sup></p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1941406412452132">
<title>Anthropomorphic measurements</title>
<p>Children’s heights (Leicester Portable Height Measure, Seca, Birmingham, UK) and weights (MPPS 250 Column Scale, Class III, Marsden, Henley-on-Thames, UK) were recorded at the end of the first consultation and at the end of the psychological intervention. These data were collected by the duty nurse situated in the pediatric outpatient consultation area within a general hospital. Prior to the intervention, the children’s anthropomorphic measurements (ranges and sample mean) were as follows: heights (88.0-116.1 cm, mean = 101.2 ± 10.1 cm); weights (12.4-24.2 kg, mean = 16.3 ± 3.8); and body mass indices (BMI; 15.0-18.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, mean = 15.8 ± 0.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Children’s heights, weights, and BMI were transformed into a <italic>z</italic> score based on epidemiological data of Cole et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1941406412452132">31</xref></sup> These <italic>z</italic>-score transformations redefined the children’s height, weight, and BMI based on population norms for age and country. These indicated that the children did not meet the strict <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fourth edition, text revision) weight-related criteria for a feeding disorder (height −1.5 to −0.01, mean = −0.6 ± 0.5; weight −1.1 to 0.5, mean = −0.5 ± 0.5; BMI, −0.5 to 1.2, mean = −0.1 ± 0.5). This was not unexpected as only 8% of cases that present to feeding programs meet the strict <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria for feeding disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1941406412452132">32</xref></sup> which has resulted in large changes to the criteria in the <italic>DMS-V</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section7-1941406412452132">
<title>Behavioral Pediatric Feeding Assessment Scale</title>
<p>The Behavioral Pediatric Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941406412452132">33</xref></sup> is a 35 item standardized and validated questionnaire developed to measure mealtime behaviors in young children (ages 9 months to 7 years) and parent and child behaviors associated with poor nutritional intake. It was used to assess children’s behavioral problems during feeding. The questionnaire also requires the parents to indicate whether the particular behavior was a problem for them. Several individual items from this scale reflect developmental factors (eg, children who require assistance or need to be fed entirely by an adult vs independent eaters).</p>
<p>The questionnaire yields 4r scores: child-behavior frequency, child–behavior problems, parents-feelings/strategies frequency, and parents-feelings/strategies problems.</p>
<p>Frequency scores reflect how often parent and child behaviors occur and problem scores reflect the number of feeding behaviors the parents consider to be a problem. Higher scores suggest maladaptive feeding behaviors as well as problematic parental strategies for managing mealtime behavior. Parents and child scores for each domain were combined to yield a total frequency score and a total problem score in line with the advice of the original developers of the measure.</p>
<p>In addition to these total subscales, the BPFAS also contains 3 additional psychometric subscales related to general food refusal, stallers, and picky eaters.</p>
<p>General food refusal measures the behavioral problems associated with the rejection of the foods offered to the child. These include child strategies to avoid eating and meals. This subscale has been purported to be related to eating predominantly high-fat and carbohydrate snack-type foods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941406412452132">33</xref></sup> The staller subscale is defined by, and is related to, excessive liquid intake and behavioral strategies to avoid swallowing solid food. Picky eaters are defined within this questionnaire as those who have a general reluctance to try new foods and to have a diet that contains a limited selection of acceptable foods. The original authors of the BPFAS report that this subscale relates to a diet characterized by a narrow repertoire of food items, as well as being characterized by deficiency in vitamins and minerals. Lower scores on the picky eating subscale and higher scores on the general and staller subscales are considered to be problematic. The questionnaire has a good test–retest reliability (.85) and high internal consistency (between .78 and .88).</p>
<p>Importantly, the BPFAS can reliably discriminate between normative and clinically relevant samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941406412452132">33</xref></sup> Scores from a nonclinical Canadian population have been reported as 63.9 ± 14.2 for total frequency and 3.0 ± 4.5 for total problem scores. Clinical scores have been reported as 98.4 ± 17.1 for total frequency scores and 15.4 ± 7.8 for total problem scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941406412452132">33</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-1941406412452132">
<title>Dietary variety assessment</title>
<p>Dietary variety was assessed through parental-report food diaries. Diaries were assessed by a registered dietitian for a period of 1 week prior to the first and last session with the clinical psychologist. Within the final session, the clinical psychologist and the parent considered the food items within the dietitian’s initial results. If the parents reported that the child consumed any amount of a particular item on 2 or more occasions within a mealtime it was considered as part of the child’s diet. The creation of the count tables was completed in consultation with the parents to ensure that items added to the list did not include those that were unacceptable, disliked, or only accepted on one occasion. The food items identified were then grouped into generic terms of fruit and vegetables, diary, carbohydrates, meats, and high-energy food groups. Item counts added to the accepted list were the generic terms for each food item. For example, pasta counted as “one” irrespective of the different “types” (eg, fusilli, spaghetti, etc) offered to, and accepted by, the child. Both the method of collection and the grouping strategy followed the edicts of Kristal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1941406412452132">34</xref></sup></p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Following referral from a relevant health professional, the parents were sent the assessment questionnaire (BPFAS) along with instructions on how to complete the measure. The parents also received a cover letter giving a rough indication of what will happen over the coming months, as well as some specific information on the requirements for the first appointment. The family was asked to bring the completed BPFAS and any food item that they would like their child to try within the initial meeting. Each appointment with the outpatient clinic was scheduled to last for 1 hour for each visit. Completion of each session was determined by attendance rather than any formal assessment process.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the psychological intervention was to train the parents to use a contingent reward manipulation to encourage their child to try new foods. To ensure the highest possible success from the intervention the parents were encouraged to view the intervention as a challenge and to take a more objective view of the child’s behavior during mealtimes and in response to food stimuli. It was considered important that the parents were able to record and respond to the child’s difficult mealtime behaviors through a more dispassionate manner. The intervention for the child was not started until week 4. For the first 4 weeks (2 sessions), the parents were of primary interest.</p>
<p>The first 2 sessions, usually 2 weeks apart, were designed to engage the parents in health education, social learning theory, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral principles (eg, praise, modeling, etc). In the first session, the parents covered health education. The primary goals of the session were to understand the impact that the child’s behavior has on family dynamics and to improve the parent’s perceptions of the child’s capabilities. The elimination of entrenched thinking was considered paramount to increasing and maintaining the parent’s willingness to participate in the intervention. Following this session, parents were directed to specific Internet-based information to increase their knowledge about positive psychology and child development. These were Dr Seligman’s <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.authentichappiness.com">www.authentichappiness.com</ext-link> and Dr Myer’s <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com">www.childdevelopmentinfo.com</ext-link>. After reading this information, the parents were encouraged to look for and absorb as much information as they could on this topic. They were also encouraged to share the information they had found with the clinician at the beginning of the second session. This was encouraged to check for consistency and accuracy of the information they had found. A secondary aim for checking what the parents had found was to estimate potential compliance with the intervention.</p>
<p>The second session was focused on behavioral principles and training in techniques to manage problematic behavior. The goal of the session was to ensure that the parents could understand and apply the Antecedence, Behavior, Consequences rules to their child during mealtimes. Through this model, the main outcomes were to ensure that the parents understood that their child will be somewhat predictable and get them to recognize what markers occur prior to the problem behavior. The task for the next 2 weeks was to complete record charts. The goal of the task was to encourage the parents to objectively observe their child’s behavior. This had 2 potential positive consequences: (<italic>a</italic>) The parent was less likely to emotionally respond to the child’s difficult behavior—thus limiting the emotional escalation between the parents and their child. The goal was to alleviate the potential for parental frustration with the expression of perceived difficult behavior. (<italic>b</italic>) The parent was more likely to engage in experimentation with the child as they have an outlet in recording the resultant effect of the attempted change.</p>
<p>Parental training in the use of the record chart was undertaken at the end of the second session. The clinician took the parents through an example taken from the parent’s initial interview, which was also identified as a problem child-related behavior on the BPFAS. This example was taken at a very slow pace to ensure that the parents understood which behaviors were worth recording and which were not. The intention was not to make the parents dutifully record all of the observable behavior; rather it was an attempt to give the parents an objective quantitative-type evidence to see the smaller changes in the child’s problematic behavior over time. The completion of the record charts was the focus at the beginning of the third session.</p>
<p>The third session, usually 2 weeks after the second, was dedicated to training in the specific intervention—in this instance, it was a sensory desensitization to perceived offensive stimuli through contingent reward tasks. Parent’s efforts in the completion of the aforementioned behavioral charts were assessed for accuracy, clarity, and consistency. This was done along with the parents to gain a better understanding of what it was like in each mealtime. Following the discussion of the record charts, the parents were trained in the contingent reward task. During this session a list of foods that the child could not tolerate was drawn up and ranked based on how vehemently the child rejected them. Each item is then given a rank of 1 to 5 with 5 designated as foods that are least favored by the child. Increasing amount of points were then associated with the various categories from 1 to 5. Concurrently, the parents created a list of “treats” for the child to work toward. The point scheme was entirely devised by the parents. Particular rewards that the child really liked were given a higher amount of “points” to encourage the child to take on more difficult food stimuli (ie, increased task difficulty) and to save up their points (ie, increase frequency in doing the tasks). The rewards only included preferred activities that the child enjoyed. No preferred foods or tangible rewards were offered to our children. Examples of the lower value rewards were 15 minutes of playing a specific sport, the completion of a board game, or playing on a game console device together. The very high value rewards were visits to preferred locations such as theme parks and age appropriate activity sites (eg, play centers). To ensure that the reward was not satiated prior to exposure to the target food, parents were informed that whichever tasks they choose had to be delivered in conjunction with the tokens only. The listed activities were made completely contingent on tokens. Parents were warned to not list hobbies or habitual activities (eg, attendance at a club) within the token-based economy to ensure that the child was not socially deprived as a result of the intervention. Point value for a specific item was assigned on an economy-based system. The more a particular food stimulus was chosen the less its reward value became. Delay in the decrease of reward was altered for the age of the children. Intentions behind the slower decrease in reward loss for younger children encouraged more presentations of the disliked stimulus.</p>
<p>The graduated desensitization component to the intervention was incorporated through the parents responding to the child’s behavior and rewarding increased proximity to the offending food item. All the trials were run within the family home during a snack time. Children were not offered the opportunity to earn tokens during mealtimes. The reason for not offering the tokens during mealtimes were that they were a “fake currency” and were employed to increase willingness to try the item. Mealtimes were where the majority of nutrients were consumed and acceptance of the food item in the mealtime was determined as the criteria for generalization in acceptance. It was also deemed important that the child would eat the item in the absence of the reward to ensure that it was not only accepted contingent on the rewards associated with the tokens. Intervention success was determined by the acceptance of the target food within the mealtime context.</p>
<p>For the snack time, the child is rewarded for being close to the item for the first trial. The reward remained the same until the child had tried it for the first time, however the reward was not given until the child had improved on his or her previous trial in terms of their distance to the food item. Thus, the reward was consistent until the child tried it. Once the child had tried the item 4 times, it decreased in value by 1 point. In total, this meant that 20 trials were required before the item fell off of the list entirely and was then presented within the mealtime context.</p>
<p>The children who participated in the current study were not homologous in terms of their defensive characteristics; therefore, the contingent reward task did marginally differ depending on the specificity of the child’s sensitivity. This modification hinged almost entirely around the distance the child was to the stimuli. For example, children that were olfactory defensive were presented with the food at a larger distance compared to those that were specifically tactile-or oral-sensory sensitive. Success of the intervention was determined through increased tolerance to proximity to the disliked food and, eventually, eating it.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The study was analyzed employing tests of relationship and difference between the dietary variety measures and the various subscales within the BPFAS. The tests of difference covered within-subject <italic>t</italic> tests and 2-way analysis of variance. On one occasion, for the 2 × 5 within-subject interaction between before and after the intervention against the 5 food item groupings, a multivariate analysis if variance was employed because of violation in the parametric assumption of homogeneity of covariance (sphericity). All tests of difference were followed up with appropriate planned post hoc tests with an alpha correction for multiple comparisons. Tests for relationship were performed using Pearson correlations.</p>

The unexpected significant difference in the height and weight not translating into a significant difference in BMI can be explained through height and weight increasing disproportionately. This “disproportionality” led to some gains in BMI scores across the sample (<italic>z</italic> score range before −0.5 to 1.2; after −0.5 to 1.4), with all but one participant gaining BMI points. In contrast, every child gained in both height and weight over the course of the 6 months.

Total frequency score of difficult behaviors around mealtimes dropped on average a total of 39 points to 64.2 ± 11.0. This result was marginally higher than the originally reported scores for typically developing children (63.9 ± 14.2). The scores ranged from 87 to 54 after the 6-month intervention, indicating that there was some variation in responsiveness to the intervention. The results indicated that age was a significant correlate with BPFAS frequency scores after, but not before, the intervention: before, <italic>r</italic>(17) = −0.36, <italic>P</italic> = .15; after, <italic>r</italic>(17) = −0.50, <italic>P</italic> = .04. This result indicated that the older children in the cohort responded better to the intervention than the younger children.

<title>Assessment of Dietary Variety</title>
<p>Initial assessment of dietary variety irrespective of the intervention indicated that children had a differential preference for certain food items, <italic>F</italic>(4, 64) = 19.4, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001. Children within this group had an overwhelming preference for carbohydrate dense and dairy food items compared with meat, fruit and vegetables, and high-energy snack-based foods (all <italic>P</italic>s &lt; .03). There was no significant difference in preference for carbohydrate-dense foods over dairy in the sample, <italic>t</italic>(16) = 3.1, <italic>P</italic> = .07, <italic>d</italic> = 0.76; although it could have been considered to be a marginal or borderline result.</p>
<p>The intervention had a highly significant effect on total food items accepted, <italic>F</italic>(1, 16) = 47.4, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001. This showed that children accepted more food items after the intervention than before it, <italic>t</italic>(16) = 6.9, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001. On average, the intervention increased the total amount of food items accepted by 6.1 ± 4.3 items or one item per month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941406412452132">Figure 1</xref>). The amount of food items accepted was not related to age prior to the intervention, <italic>r</italic>(17) = 0.19, <italic>P</italic> = .47, but was after it, <italic>r</italic>(17) = 0.48, <italic>P</italic> = .05; adding further credence to an impact of age on this particular contingent reward intervention. A median split on age (median = 55 months) of the child at the end of the intervention revealed that the increase in items expected were 4.0 ± 4.3 (n = 8, range = 4-10 food item increase) in the younger children compared with 7.6 ± 4.3 (n = 9, range = 7-10 food item increase) in the older children.</p>

<p>Assessment of the dietary variety before and after the contingent reward intervention through a multivariate analysis of variance indicated that there was a significant interaction, <italic>F</italic>(4, 13) = 4.76, <italic>P</italic> = .01). This significant interaction was due to 2 of the 3 groups selectively increasing because of the intervention. Specifically, fruit and vegetables were significantly different from carbohydrate-dense foods before the intervention, <italic>t</italic>(16) = 4.1, <italic>P</italic> = .008, but were not after it, <italic>t</italic>(16) = 2.2, <italic>P</italic> = .44, <italic>d</italic> = 0.53. There was also a significant effect on the carbohydrate-dense food items. Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between dairy and carbohydrate-based food items, <italic>t</italic>(16) = 3.1, <italic>P</italic> = .07, <italic>d</italic> = 0.76, but there was after it, <italic>t</italic>(16) = 3.6, <italic>P</italic> = .03.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study was the first to show that contingent reward (token economy) alongside desensitization improved dietary variety in children with feeding problems of clinical significance. The data indicated that the intervention increased food acceptance by one item per month. This study also showed that the frequency and perception of problematic behaviors around mealtimes decreased to levels resembling typically developing children. However, it must be stressed that the current intervention changes were averages. It appeared that there was a “range of change” within the sample and that this range could be explained by the age of the child. Older children appeared to respond more than younger children (ie, those younger than 55 months compared with those older than 55 months). This may suggest that the nature of the token economy intervention and/or the desensitization procedure within the current study may have a differential impact on the child dependent on their age. This impact could potentially be the acceptance of up to 3 items over a 6-month period.</p>
<p>The therapeutic intervention offered within the current study was not consistent, in terms of dietary variety, across the sample. Although there was a noticeable and significant increase across all 5 food groups following the intervention, the study revealed a specific additional increase within both the fruit/vegetable and carbohydrate groups compared with the other food groups. There are several potential explanations for why this specific increase may have occurred. First, we have already observed a preoccupation among parents to preferentially increase fruit and vegetable consumption following another one of our interventions for children who have a nonorganic determinant of their feeding problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412452132">30</xref></sup> At this time, it cannot be discounted that some implicit instructions are offered by one or more of the individuals within the center that directed parents to preferentially offer fruit and vegetables. Furthermore, it cannot be refuted that the parents influenced what the children chose. A second potential explanation for the disproportionate increase in fruit and vegetables could have been through the parents creating the token economy. Here, they may have influenced the child’s choice by placing a higher value on fruit and vegetables than on other items. The preferential increase in carbohydrate items was probably a function of the child’s preferences prior to the intervention. Therefore, the observed increase may be a result of the inherent preferences and the lower potential threat for other carbohydrate-dense food items that have a similar visual profile (eg, color). More information through detailed quantitative and qualitative investigations would be required to substantiate these interpretations.</p>
<p>The role of contingent reward within interventions for selectivity within a child’s diet is starting to receive mounting supportive evidence in both inpatient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941406412452132">35</xref></sup> and outpatient settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1941406412452132">36</xref></sup> Furthermore, researchers have also indicated the need for desensitization procedures for the children with feeding problems to accept more food items.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1941406412452132">37</xref></sup> Moreover, it has been shown that it is necessary to train parents in these strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1941406412452132">37</xref></sup> There is also some tentative evidence that supports the necessity of combining both contingency rewards with desensitization within an inpatient setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1941406412452132">38</xref></sup> The current study extends on these case studies in 2 significant ways. First, it provides a quantitative expectation of outcome with sensory-defensive children in a combined contingency management and desensitization protocol. And second, the study provides evidence for this intervention strategy when situated within an outpatient setting following a parent training regime.</p>
<p>Interventions into feeding disorders are necessarily complex, multidisciplinary, and based within behavioral theory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1941406412452132">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1941406412452132">39</xref></sup> We have shown within the current study that it is possible to provide effective outpatient treatment for children with sensory defensiveness. In particular, the contingent reward component encourages the child to engage with stimuli that they find aversive or offensive. By gradually altering the reward contingent on increased proximity (ie, from tolerating it in the same room to eventually requiring the child to physically interact with the food item) aids in desensitization and allowed the formation of a preference for its taste. Once the child has sufficiently overcome their sensory sensitivity to the food item(s) offered, then it may be beneficial to move toward a second technique to increase their experience with the item.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412452132">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current study had some notable limitations that must be considered prior to conclusion. The first factor that limited the application of the findings within the current study is that the sample was homologous. To get the strongest outcomes within the quantitative design, it was important that the participants all had a similar etiology. Therefore, the current study can only be applied to children with a feeding problem resulting from sensory sensitivity within feeding-related clinics. To confirm the usefulness of this intervention protocol in other homologous groups (eg, ASD and developmental delay) would be a worthwhile future direction. However, working with these groups would likely require additional strategies, such as escape extinction, to aid in social compliance.</p>
<p>Another issue was that the parents chose the rewards, the targets, and the relative economy (importance) of the targets, which obviously limited the child’s potential choices. Although the curtailment and consistency of the targets and their value may have empirical merit, the necessary individual differences between family lists is required to ensure that the child accepts foods that are part of their family’s habitual diet. Acceptance of a food item that is not usually eaten among family members is arguably of little value to either the child or the parents. These differences may have led to minor variations in outcomes across the sample.</p>
<p>Additional familial characteristics that were not collected as part of the outpatient service may also have merit within the efficacy of the intervention and attention in future research. For example, factors such as social economic status, number of siblings, frequency/adherence of exposure to the snack times, duration of time the parents spend with their children, and the involvement of additional caregivers and the education sector in the child’s mealtimes may improve or better predict the efficacy of the intervention. Thus, the insinuation that the age of the child improves outcome of the intervention in the current study is limited because of the fact that it is a compound variable. An older child in the current study attended mainstream education and therefore had additional influences that their younger counterparts did not have. Future research findings that include these factors may uncover a complex milieu of variables that affect the efficacy of the token reward system for children with feeding problems of clinical significance.</p>
<p>The final limitation was the nature of the paradigm. The study was not a clinical trial. Therefore, beyond anecdotal statements around the consistency of the child’s behaviors prior to referral to the service, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the observed changes were entirely because of the intervention. After all, the children did not present with total food refusal. The fact that the child already accepted some foods meant that it was likely that some of the increased dietary variety observed over the 6-month intervention was because of “natural” increase in dietary variety and food item acceptance. Therefore, it would be remiss to conclude that the intervention actually caused the acceptance of foods that would have never been tolerated; rather it suggested that we accelerated the acceptance of food items that would probably have been “naturally” accepted over a sufficient period of time. In short, the intervention increased the time of, and probability for, acceptance through providing sufficient motivation and control for the child to experience specific food items. A clinical trial would be required to elucidate the exact impact of the intervention. Future investigations may wish to explore the relative merit of a contingent reward and desensitization intervention through comparisons with other treatment strategies. Equally, it would be pertinent to compare this intervention in a parent-led versus a therapist-led intervention to elucidate the additional benefits, if any, of the therapist leading the intervention.</p>
<p>To conclude, feeding problems of clinical significance are difficult to effectively treat. Mixed etiology necessitates a multicomponent intervention complicated by medical, developmental, and behavioral factors. In a group of children who primarily have sensory defensiveness, which prohibited interaction with foods deemed unacceptable/offensive, contingent reward alongside a graduated exposure technique effectively overcame the child’s objections to specific food items. This was a slow process. The children only accepted one additional item per month, which was mediated by the child’s age. Therefore, children that present with no medical or pervasive developmental explanations to their food refusal are likely to respond to an outpatient contingent reward desensitization intervention.</p>
