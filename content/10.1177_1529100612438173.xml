<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1529100612438173">Finkel, Eastwick, Karney, Reis, and Sprecher (2012</xref>, this issue) have provided a remarkably comprehensive, thoughtful, scholarly, and timely monograph. It is also extremely important. As the data they cite show, online dating, particularly in developed countries, already accounts for a substantial proportion of the initiation of romantic relationships—a proportion growing at a rate suggesting it may soon account for the majority of such meetings. Thus, online dating is significant as a major social phenomenon. More crucially, the quality of our close relationships is the single biggest contributor to personal well-being and one of the largest contributors to health and longevity. Thus, understanding a phenomenon that is changing the landscape for the formation of such relationships bears on fundamental issues in human life. (As an aside, this monograph also contributes to the basic science of relationships by offering a wonderfully thorough and up-to-date review of the research literature on key factors in romantic attraction and on the predictors of relationship success.) Frankly, although my original intention was a quick read while waiting for the take off of a plane I was on, I found myself so engaged that by the time I had read it (and often reread sections while making a zillion little notes), the pilot was announcing it was time to prepare for landing.</p>
<p>Several conclusions, all well supported, from their review stand out about online dating as it currently exists. First, it has significant benefits: increased opportunities to meet potential partners, minimally threatening contexts for initiating relationships, and the possibility of “omitting from the dating pool people who are likely to be poor relationship partners in general” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1529100612438173">Finkel et al., 2012</xref>, p. 48). The authors also note some potential downsides, such as the problems that result from being in a shopping mode when evaluating potential partners. Finally, they note a major limitation, which is that the evidence from the relationship research literature suggests that matching of any kind plays only a small role in initial romantic attraction or relationship success.</p>
<p>I would add that the creativity of some of these sites (e.g., looking at individual differences in hormones and neurotransmitters or directly at genes) has introduced scientifically credible ideas from outside the usual focus of relationship research. I am especially hopeful that in spite of the obstacles mentioned in the article to making findings widely available, the massive data sets and substantial resources available, along with the high quality of scientists many of these sites have brought in (e.g., Gian Gonzaga, Helen Fisher), will eventually result in dramatic advances in knowledge.</p>
<p>Perhaps most optimistically, I think that by laying out so clearly where things stand and how they relate to what is known in the research literature, this monograph is likely to be an inspiration both for new directions in research and for valuable new services online dating sites might offer. I will spell out some possibilities that came to mind for me.</p>
<p>Regarding future directions for research, first, as Finkel et al. note, there are considerable obstacles and minimal incentives for online sites to conduct and report strong research. The authors suggest that the public might be well served if government agencies vetted online dating site claims the same way drug claims often are. I certainly think that’s a good idea (and although the authors used the United States for their example, I would be more hopeful for such progress by nations that have been more supportive of relationship science in general, such as Canada). But rather than wait in hope for governments to act in this way and to focus on the stick, maybe a carrot would be possible. Perhaps one of the relevant major scientific organizations (e.g., the Association for Psychological Science, the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, the International Association for Relationship Research) could set up a means to certify such claims. Thus, competing online dating companies might be encouraged to conduct studies that would be strong enough to win such certification and thus give them a competitive edge. Yet another possibility, given the rising importance of online dating sites, is for foundations or government grant agencies explicitly to call for and support such research. Although such research would be most effective if carried out with the cooperation of online dating companies (and perhaps best not actually conducted <italic>by</italic> them), it is possible to conduct such studies to some extent even without their involvement. For example, one could easily recruit and follow up on a fairly large sample (especially if one paid participants’ site fees) for a study in which participants were randomly assigned to one of the several major sites or to one or more control sites that matched/selected on the most general characteristics or on scientifically based alternatives. In addition to this being a kind of <italic>Consumer Reports</italic> comparison in which one could find out which services are most successful, the comparisons to control conditions would tell us if any exclusion or matching algorithms were significantly successful, and possibly they could even provide some clues as to what kinds of matches/exclusions mattered most, based on what sites were most successful at creating lasting, satisfying matches.</p>
<p>Regarding potential opportunities for new services for online sites, there are whole areas of matching that apparently have been minimally considered. A major area is perceived peer/family/network views of potential partners (e.g., one might ask participants what they think their friends or family might say about potential matches, as well as asking participants to have such others rate what they think would be the best partners for the participant). Another area that has been mentioned in the attraction literature, although only minimally studied to date, is idiosyncratic desired characteristics in partners, which may come from parental features recalled from infancy, such as some particular shape of face, way of walking, or tone of voice. A site might ask about characteristics of a person’s previous successful matches or about their favorite parent’s noteworthy characteristics, or even match features of potential partners with photos of such people. Another opportunity is to increase the use of nonobvious measures, such as response time to profiles or memory measures of previous profile details they have reviewed; in fact, just with current technology, one could fairly easily measure evoked potentials or perform other neural or physiological measures online.</p>
<p>Finally, since it seems that online dating is here to stay, I am hopeful that it will expand its services in important ways based on what we in the field already know (let alone what could be learned given the great opportunities here). Initial meetings could be more structured (e.g., using the arousal–attraction effect or focusing eye contact; or encouraging intimacy through specific guidelines and scripted interaction steps). Evaluation of communication skills of the participant (with questionnaires but perhaps also with responses to viewing standardized interaction sequences) or even, for budding relationships, evaluation of the dyadic communication (perhaps recorded by the participant’s webcam and then coded by algorithms that would not require expensive human judges). Offer participants relationship-skills training (perhaps with webinars) with an incentive that successful completion can be added to their profiles, making them potentially more attractive choices. Provide continued lifelong support/contacts as a relationship develops (facilitating friendships with other couples, parenting training, help dealing with life transitions, opportunities for couples to share exciting activities, etc.).</p>
<p>Finkel et al. offer engagingly presented information and practical advice to the general public, and, as I have tried to begin to illustrate, provide a solid foundation for relationship scientists and online entrepreneurs to build on and proceed in amazing new directions.</p>
