<abstract>
<p>The impact of dementia on the self has become the subject of much research over the last few years, mainly due to the implications for support and care for people with dementia. However, there are a number of limitations of this research that make it difficult to integrate the existing evidence and to draw any firm conclusions regarding the persistence of self. This highlights the need for a different approach to studying the self in people with dementia in order to obtain more robust evidence from future studies. This paper attempts to integrate current research using an existing systematic and comprehensive framework of the self, and outlines the advantages and limitations of using such a framework as the basis for future studies.</p>

<p>Over the last two decades much research has been undertaken to investigate how the self is affected by the onset and progression of dementia. This has become the subject of close attention due to the implications for how people experience and cope with the illness, as well as for how other people treat the person with dementia. In addition, there are implications for the types of treatment or interventions that the person with dementia (and/or the carer) may be offered. Researchers have highlighted the importance of considering the self in person-centred care (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211418486">Fazio, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211418486">Kelly, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211418486">Kitwood, 1997</xref>) and already there are several interventions that specifically aim to support self and identity in people with dementia. These include self-maintenance therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1471301211418486">Romero &amp; Wenz, 2001</xref>) and interventions targeting the reinforcement of role-identities in people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211418486">Cohen-Mansfield, Parpura-Gill, &amp; Golander, 2006a</xref>). These interventions have been reported to have some positive impact on the well-being of people with dementia, although currently this evidence is somewhat preliminary. In addition to the practical implications, research into the self in people with dementia is of great theoretical interest, in terms of finding out more about the possible construct of self and how aspects of self might be related to each other and to other factors such as well-being or cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>Research on the self in dementia has been conducted using both qualitative and quantitative methods. However, the construct of self is difficult to define, and researchers have based their studies on a variety of models and concepts. Qualitative studies have been based upon the social constructionist model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211418486">Fazio &amp; Mitchell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211418486">Li &amp; Orleans, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1471301211418486">Sabat, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1471301211418486">Sabat &amp; Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1471301211418486">Sabat &amp; Harre, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1471301211418486">Small, Geldart, Gutman, &amp; Scott, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1471301211418486">Tappen, Williams, Fishman, &amp; Touhy, 1999</xref>), interactionist perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211418486">Fontana &amp; Smith, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211418486">Hubbard, Cook, Tester, &amp; Downs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1471301211418486">Saunders, 1998</xref>) and a narrative model of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211418486">Mills, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1471301211418486">Surr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1471301211418486">Usita, Hyman, &amp; Herman, 1998</xref>). In addition to this some qualitative studies have been conducted using thematic analyses, which investigate the self but are not based upon any particular model of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211418486">Beard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211418486">Clare, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211418486">Clare, Rowlands, &amp; Quin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211418486">Gillies &amp; Johnston, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1471301211418486">Pearce, Clare, &amp; Pistrang, 2002</xref>). These studies provide a rich account of the subjective experience of living with dementia, yet there are questions regarding the impact of dementia on the self that are difficult to address using qualitative methods, such as the associations between the self and other variables of interest. Quantitative studies have attempted to tackle some of these questions, and have tended to investigate specific components of the self, rather than studying self as a unitary construct, as many of the qualitative studies have. Quantitative studies have examined identity as based on autobiographical memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211418486">Addis &amp; Tippet, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211418486">Naylor &amp; Clare, 2008</xref>), role identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211418486">Cohen-Mansfield, Golander &amp; Arnheim, 2000</xref>), self-recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211418486">Biringer &amp; Anderson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211418486">Biringer, Anderson, &amp; Strubel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211418486">Bologna &amp; Camp, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211418486">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211418486">Fazio &amp; Mitchell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211418486">Grewal, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211418486">Mendez, Martin, Smyth, &amp; Whitehouse, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211418486">Gross et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211418486">Hehman, German, &amp; Klein, 2005</xref>) and self-knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211418486">Gil et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211418486">Klein, Cosmides, &amp; Costabile, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1471301211418486">Rankin, Baldwin, Pace-Savitsky, Kramer, &amp; Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1471301211418486">Ruby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1471301211418486">Ruby et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to the models and concepts underlying these qualitative and quantitative studies, researchers have posited further theoretical viewpoints with respect to the self in dementia. For example, it has been argued from a philosophical perspective that the person with dementia should be viewed as a ‘situated embodied agent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211418486">Hughes, 2001</xref>), a viewpoint influenced by the author’s experiences as a clinician working with people with dementia. This work also highlights the relevance and practical implications of this topic to the clinician, as well as the ethical challenges faced in deciding how best to view the self in people with dementia.</p>
<p>A recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211418486">Caddell &amp; Clare, 2010</xref>) found that the vast majority of available evidence in this area points to the persistence of self throughout the course of dementia, at least to some degree, but also highlighted the difficulties created by approaching the subject of self using such a wide range of concepts, models, and methodologies. This disparity in models and methodologies means that the results from these studies are difficult to integrate, making it hard to draw any firm conclusions from the existing body of evidence. In addition to this, it is unclear how some of these aspects of self actually reflect a specific construct of self, since many studies do not outline a clear theoretical framework. For example, studies testing self-recognition in people with dementia may equate this ability to having a sense of self, but there is no underlying framework highlighting the basis for this link. The existing studies also leave a number of questions unanswered. It is currently unclear whether the self is affected as a whole by dementia, or whether different aspects of self are affected independently of each other, since studies have either attempted to measure the self as a unitary construct, or have measured only a single aspect or component of self. There is also little evidence to highlight how a person’s sense of self might be related to his/her cognitive abilities, such as aspects of memory functioning and linguistic abilities, or psychological factors, such as mood and well-being. These limitations highlight the need to try to evaluate and integrate current evidence in some way, and to think carefully about how future studies should be conducted in order to obtain a more thorough and structured view of what happens to the self in people with dementia. In doing so, it would seem important to use a clear, systematic, and comprehensive model of self in future studies. This would enable researchers to work together and integrate findings, which would lead to more robust evidence regarding the persistence or deterioration in aspects of the self in people with dementia, and the relationship between these changes and other variables of interest. Psychological research has led to the development of a number of systematic models of self that may be useful in this regard.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211418486"><title>Models of self</title>
<p>There are a number of systematic models of self that have been influential in other areas of psychological research. One of the earliest distinctions within the self was described by both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211418486">Mead (1934)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211418486">James (1950)</xref>, who described two aspects of the self according to the focus of attention − the self experienced through the ongoing stream of consciousness when attention is directed outwards (‘consciousness’), and the self as an object with traits, characteristics, and preferences when attention is directed inwards (‘self-awareness’). Researchers have since continued to define the self with reference to this distinction (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211418486">Lewis 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1471301211418486">Nelson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1471301211418486">Povinelli, 1995</xref>), and other researchers have elaborated on this distinction to suggest models of self with more than two components. These include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211418486">Brown’s (1976)</xref> four-level model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211418486">Farthing’s (1992)</xref> four-level model, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1471301211418486">Schooler’s (2002)</xref> three-level model of consciousness and the self. Brown’s model consists of two levels of unconsciousness and two levels of consciousness. The first level of unconsciousness is ‘sensorimotor cognition’, which reflects a ‘deep’ level of unconsciousness that a person might experience when in a deep sleep or in a coma. The second is the ‘limbic stage’, which refers to a ‘lighter’ sort of unconsciousness, such as when a person is dreaming. The first level of consciousness is the ‘neocortical level’, which refers to attention directed outwards towards the environment, and the final level is the ‘symbolic level’, where the person experiences self-awareness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211418486">Farthing’s model (1992)</xref> also reflects the initial distinction between consciousness and self-awareness, with the ‘non-conscious mind’ representing a low level of consciousness, where the person is not unconscious, but also is not attending to any sensory inputs. ‘Peripheral consciousness’ represents an intermediate level of consciousness, where mental events are on the borderline of entering full-blown consciousness. ‘Primary consciousness’ represents consciousness in the sense that a person is able to experience and act on perceptual information, and ‘reflective consciousness’ infers the ability to reflect on one’s own experiences and to be self-aware. Schooler’s model (2002) uses the terms ‘non-consciousness’ to signify a lack of consciousness, ‘consciousness’ to imply that a person is able to experience sensations and perceptions, and ‘meta-consciousness’ to describe a person’s ability to reflect on their own experiences, signifying self-awareness. It can be seen therefore that there are a number of different models of the self that use the initial distinction between consciousness and self-awareness described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211418486">Mead (1934)</xref>, but which employ different terms to represent equivalent states or levels of the self (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211418486">Morin, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Further models have been developed which are based on this same initial distinction, but which also incorporate the type and complexity of self-information to which a person has access, on the basis that very basic self-information can be processed at a lower level of consciousness, whereas more complex self-information can be accessed at a higher level of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211418486">Morin, 2006</xref>). The main distinction here is between perceptual information and conceptual information about the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211418486">Legerstee, 1999</xref>). Perceptual information would refer to types of information about oneself that are available directly through the senses, such as information regarding one’s body or one’s environment. Conceptual self-information refers to information about the self which is not immediately available through perceptual experiences and is thus represented mentally at an abstract level. Models based on such types of self-information include those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211418486">Neisser (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1471301211418486">Newen and Vogeley (2003)</xref>. Both models also stress the importance of time in relation to self-awareness, which would allow a person to link his/her current self with his/her past self and possible future self, a factor which many researchers believe to be an important feature of a person’s sense of self (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211418486">Fivush, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211418486">Harter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1471301211418486">Povinelli, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1471301211418486">2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1471301211418486">Newen and Vogeley’s theory (2003)</xref> suggests that there are five levels of complexity with respect to representations about the self and the environment. The first level (‘phenomenal self-acquaintance’) represents the ability to register sensory information in the present and to classify such experiences into properties or states. The second level (‘conceptual self-consciousness’) involves the classification of objects and properties including the ability to represent oneself and one’s mental states. The third level (‘sentential self-consciousness’) represents the ability to categorize complex events and to experience oneself as participating in them, and the forth level (‘meta-representational self-consciousness’) reflects the mental representation of the self and of others whilst also incorporating autobiographical knowledge, moulding these aspects into a coherent framework of the self. The final level (‘iterative meta-representational self-consciousness’) consists of the ability to construct mental models about other people’s models of oneself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211418486">Neisser’s model (1988)</xref> describes five types of ‘self-knowledge’ that are so distinct that they each establish a different ‘self’. The ‘ecological self’ represents the self with respect to the physical environment, and can be determined directly through perceptions. The ‘interpersonal self’ represents the self as engaged in social interaction, and can also be perceived on the basis of objectively existing information which signals that the self is involved in an interaction with another. The ‘extended self’ is the self experienced across time, based on memories of our past self and anticipation of our future self, and is thought to enable a person to experience a sense of continuity. The ‘private self’ consists of conscious experiences that are not available to anyone else, such as aspects of perception and action, as well as thoughts, feelings and dreams. The ‘conceptual self’ refers to the self-concept, and is made up of a number of abstract representations about oneself, such as roles, traits, identity, personal characteristics, and autobiography, and is in effect a drawing together of the other four types of information about the self.</p>
<p>With respect to using an existing model or framework to guide empirical research regarding the self in dementia, the model of self proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211418486">Neisser (1988)</xref> seems particularly useful for several reasons. This model has been hugely influential with respect to thinking about the self across different fields of research, and is widely cited. However, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211418486">Neisser (1988)</xref> has only been briefly considered in the area of dementia, in relation to the impact of dementia on the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211418486">Jenkins &amp; Price, 1996</xref>), the neuroanatomy of the self in dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1471301211418486">Seeley &amp; Miller, 2005</xref>) and person-centred care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211418486">Kyle, 2008</xref>). This model of self has yet to be used as a theoretical framework on which to base empirical research. Whilst consciousness has also been the subject of investigation in people with dementia, and is intrinsically linked to the self, it can be extremely challenging to measure different aspects or levels of consciousness described in the models above, and in fact most studies of consciousness in dementia have focused on changes in consciousness <italic>per se</italic> (particularly in dementia with Lewy bodies) without relating these to the person’s sense of self (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211418486">Ballard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1471301211418486">Walker et al., 1999</xref>). Neisser’s model is primarily based on aspects of self-knowledge, but these aspects can still be related to the main levels of consciousness and self awareness as described by the models outlined above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211418486">Morin, 2006</xref>). The ‘ecological self’ can be seen as equivalent to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1471301211418486">Schooler (2002)</xref> terms ‘consciousness’, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211418486">Brown (1976)</xref> describes as the ‘neocortical level’ and ‘sensorimotor awareness’ or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211418486">Farthing (1992)</xref> terms ‘peripheral’ and ‘primary’ consciousness. The ‘interpersonal’, ‘extended’ and ‘private’ selves from Neisser’s model reflect varying levels of self-awareness also captured by Schooler’s ‘metaconsciousness’, Brown’s ‘symbolic level’, and Farthing’s ‘reflective consciousness’. What Neisser calls the ‘conceptual self’ refers to a higher level of self-awareness and is similar to ‘iterative meta-representational self-consciousness’ as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1471301211418486">Newen &amp; Vogeley (2003)</xref>. Thus Neisser’s five factor model of self incorporates the aspects of consciousness and self-awareness that have been highlighted by other dominant models of consciousness and the self. However, it also offers the advantage of specifying aspects of each component of self that are tangible and can potentially be observed and measured. In addition, it considers the importance of time in experiencing the self, the significance of which has been documented by a number of researchers, as mentioned above. Thus Neisser’s conceptualization of the self incorporates the main features of many of the other salient models of the self, whilst also offering a number of advantages such as the potential for using this model as a basis for empirical studies and applying the results in a real-world context. This model could therefore provide a much-needed clear, systematic and comprehensive theoretical framework that would be helpful for guiding future research regarding the impact of dementia on the self. The next section examines Neisser’s model in more detail in relation to existing research on the self in people with dementia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211418486"><title>Neisser’s model of the self in relation to dementia</title>
<p>As outlined above, Neisser’s model of the self consists of five different components of self. The five selves differ in their origins, their developmental histories, in the pathologies that act upon them, and the ways in which they contribute to the social experience of humans. Neisser explains that these selves are not experienced as being separate and distinct from each other, as there is usually stimulus information which creates the feeling of unity. It is suggested that each of these selves develops early in life and exhibits continuity over time, which contributes to the overall feeling of continuity within the self. This section outlines the five components of Neisser’s model in more detail and will examine how existing research on the self in people with dementia falls into the categories of self proposed by this framework, in order to see how well this research fits with a current, systematic model of self, and to identify the advantages and limitations of this approach. For each of the five components, it is important to consider not only how previous research relates to this component directly, but also to take into account the possibility that the testing procedure itself might require certain components of the self to be intact. This will be discussed in relation to each aspect of self.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211418486"><title>The ‘ecological self’</title>
<p>This represents awareness of the self as perceived with respect to the physical environment, through the processing of visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic stimuli. The continuous flow of optical information through the visual system means that the entity (the ‘ecological self’) is constantly aware of its position, posture and movement with respect to the environment. It is also thought that the ecological self is related to the self as an embodied ‘agent’− that is, it is able to initiate movements and perceive the consequences in order to observe the effects of acting upon the environment. This specifies that the parts of the body which one is able to move and control are parts of oneself, creating a sense of embodiment.</p>
<p>There are a number of studies which appear to investigate aspects of self that might reflect Neisser’s ‘ecological self’. The model most commonly used to investigate the self in dementia is the social constructionist model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211418486">Fazio &amp; Mitchell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211418486">Li &amp; Orleans, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1471301211418486">Sabat, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1471301211418486">Sabat &amp; Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1471301211418486">Sabat &amp; Harre, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1471301211418486">Small et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1471301211418486">Tappen et al., 1999</xref>). This model posits that language is of fundamental importance in the creation of social reality, and also that the way in which we acquire and use language skills can influence the organization of thought and experience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211418486">Gergen, 1985</xref>). The social constructionist model as applied to dementia consists of two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1471301211418486">Sabat &amp; Harre, 1992</xref>) or three types of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1471301211418486">Sabat &amp; Collins, 1999</xref>), depending on which version of the model is used, but only one type of self is relevant here. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1471301211418486">Sabat and Harre (1992)</xref> suggest that there is an individual self consisting of personal identity (Self 1), which may be expressed through the use of personal pronouns, and through which we are able to take responsibility for our actions and experience feelings as our own. It is difficult to judge whether this type of self belongs to the category of ‘ecological self’, as it is unclear exactly how the use of personal pronouns might be linked to having a sense of self. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1471301211418486">Sabat and Harre (1992)</xref> acknowledge that personal pronouns might be used simply out of habit, rather than as a direct reflection of ownership of one’s thoughts and actions. However, the use of personal pronouns could arguably suggest an ownership of one’s feelings and bodily actions, and a sense of agency through which one initiates such actions, which does suggest that some features of the ‘ecological self’ may be indicated here.</p>
<p>One study has used the framework of embodied selfhood to examine the persistence of self in dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211418486">Kontos, 2004</xref>). This theoretical framework (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211418486">Kontos, 2003</xref>) has been used to challenge the assumption in some cultures that cognition and memory alone are equated with selfhood, implying a loss of selfhood in people with dementia. Embodied selfhood suggests that the body itself is an important source of selfhood, which does not arise from a cognitive source of knowledge or information. This framework of the self reflects the ‘ecological self’ of Neisser’s model as it examines the phenomenon of being in a particular place or situation and being in control of one’s body, and being able to move parts of the body to interact with the environment with purpose.</p>
<p>In order to be able to interact with the researcher and materials as necessary, many types of research rely upon participants having at least a basic concept of their position and relationship to the environment, as well as being aware of their embodiment, and control over the initiation of actions and ability to perceive the consequences of these actions. Of course, there will be exceptions to this, such as studies that are purely observational, and make no particular demands of participants or attempt to elicit any actions or responses from them (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211418486">Fontana &amp; Smith, 1989</xref>). It should also be noted that a number of studies have involved people in the very severe stages of dementia, and have successfully recorded aspects of sensory and perceptual awareness, which might reflect underlying aspects of self (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211418486">Clare, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211418486"><title>The ‘interpersonal self’</title>
<p>The ‘interpersonal self’ is the self as engaged in social interaction with another person, and can be directly perceived through objectively existing kinetic information. This information would come into existence where the nature, direction, and timing of one person’s actions coincide with those of the other person/people. This ‘intersubjectivity’ can be perceived by onlookers and the people who are involved in the interaction, who are able to see (or hear or feel) the interactive responses of the other person/people in relation to his/her own activity. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211418486">Neisser (1988)</xref>, the ‘interpersonal self’ would be simultaneously accompanied by an intact ‘ecological self’.</p>
<p>Several studies have used interactionist models to study the self in people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211418486">Fontana &amp; Smith, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1471301211418486">Saunders, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211418486">Hubbard et al., 2002</xref>), which might be said to reflect Neisser’s ‘interpersonal self’. Interactionist models rest on the theory that the self is based on social constructs rooted in interactions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211418486">Mead, 1934</xref>). Whilst one study takes a broad interactionist perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211418486">Fontana &amp; Smith, 1989</xref>), other studies specify their approach more precisely. One study approaches the question of identity from an interactional sociolinguistic framework (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211418486">Gumperz, 1982</xref>), and focuses specifically on capturing conversation in naturalistic settings in order to understand the different ways in which the self is socially constructed in everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1471301211418486">Saunders, 1998</xref>). Another related approach is the symbolic interactionist perspective (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211418486">Blumer, 1969</xref>), which has been employed to interpret how non-verbal behaviour is used and defined by people with dementia in social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211418486">Hubbard et al., 2002</xref>). It is clear that these studies capture the ‘interpersonal self’ to some degree since the emphasis is on a person’s interactions with others.</p>
<p>In addition to Self 1 (see above), the social constructionist model as applied to dementia also outlines the ‘selves’ (Self 3) that are presented publicly in everyday interactions with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1471301211418486">Sabat, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1471301211418486">Sabat &amp; Collins, 1999</xref>). A person may exhibit many selves depending upon the particular context, such as a caring relative, a dedicated doctor, or a reliable friend, but these selves rely upon the social cooperation of other people. Therefore, evidence for Self 3 tends to be exhibited through interactions with other people, thus reflecting the ‘interpersonal’ aspect of self from Neisser’s model.</p>
<p>The capacity to interact with others is often important for participants in psychological research − without the ability to interact, many methodologies would be rendered impossible. Thus, as was the case with the ‘ecological self’, many studies will involve participants exhibiting this aspect of self, even if this is not what is being explicitly tested. Again, the exception here might be purely observational studies, where there is no requirement for the participants to engage in interaction with the researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211418486"><title>The ‘extended self’</title>
<p>The ‘extended self’ is the self as it was in the past, according to the memories that we have access to, and as we anticipate that it will be in the future. This might involve episodic memories (a unique and specific past event; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1471301211418486">Tulving, 1972</xref>) or general event representations/scripts (where a repeated and familiar routine are remembered; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1471301211418486">Nelson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1471301211418486">Schank &amp; Abelson, 1977</xref>), both of which contribute to the extended self.</p>
<p>A number of studies have examined the autobiographical memories of people with dementia, which might thus be said to represent the ‘extended self’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211418486">Addis and Tippet (2004)</xref> suggest that identity is primarily based on autobiographical memory alone, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211418486">Naylor and Clare (2008)</xref> also examine the relationship between autobiographical memory and the self, but using a social cognitive approach, where the self is viewed as a multidimensional construct, consisting of beliefs, attitudes and information concerning the self (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211418486">Gergen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211418486">Greenwald &amp; Pratkanis, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211418486">Markus &amp; Wurf, 1987</xref>). Both studies use a structured interview to assess autobiographical memory (Autobiographical Memory Interview; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211418486">Kopelman, Wilson, &amp; Baddeley, 1990</xref>), which directly tests a person’s ability to remember personal experiences (as well as semantic information) across the life span, thus reflecting the notion of the ‘extended self’ as in Neisser’s model.</p>
<p>Similarly, some studies have used a narrative approach as a basis for the study of self in dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211418486">Mills, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1471301211418486">Usita et al., 1998</xref>). It has been suggested that self is, or depends on, the ability of a person to construct and communicate a narrative (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211418486">Bruner, 1987</xref>). The justification for this is that such narratives enable people to define or update their sense of self, thus allowing a sense of coherence and continuity to develop through the integration of life experiences. A socio-biographical approach to self has been used in a single study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1471301211418486">Surr, 2006</xref>), and represents a combination of social constructionist and biographical, or narrative, perspectives. This theory contends that both relationships and interactions with others, the wider social context, and narrative and storytelling all play a crucial role in the maintenance or undermining of self. These studies rely on the person being able to talk about their memories and life stories/narratives in different ways, which clearly requires the abilities attributed to Neisser’s ‘extended self’. However, the studies described here go beyond the ‘minimum’ criteria for the extended self, which just requires the recognition that one has a past which one can remember, and an anticipated future. These studies also demonstrate how this information can be developed into a narrative, life story, or autobiography, and are therefore also relevant to the ‘conceptual self’ (see below).</p>
<p>Roles, identities, attributes, and preferences have been viewed as components of self-identity in three studies, which have studied roles with which people with dementia identify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211418486">Cohen-Mansfield, Golander, &amp; Arnheim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211418486">Cohen-Mansfield, Marx, Thein, &amp; Dakheel-Ali, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211418486">Cohen-Mansfield, Parpura-Gill, &amp; Golander, 2006b</xref>). These studies focus on four role-identities in particular (occupational, family, leisure activities and attributes), and aim to determine how strong these identities were before and after the onset of dementia. Although these studies may more directly reflect the ‘conceptual self’, the measure used (Self-Identity in Dementia questionnaire; Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2000) requires the person to answer questions about his/her past roles as well as his/her present roles in life. This requires the person to have an awareness of his/her self in the past as well as in the present moment, which relies on a person’s episodic memory, and therefore his/her sense of the ‘extended self’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211418486"><title>The ‘private self’</title>
<p>The ‘private self’ refers to our conscious experiences (such as thoughts, feelings, intentions) that are not available to other people, and includes both aspects of perception and action and also phenomena which are not related to a person’s present circumstances, such as dreams. These experiences can be independent of the ‘ecological’ and ‘interpersonal’ selves. The ‘private self’ is difficult to assess, because of its inherent inaccessibility to others. The only way that we can examine the ‘private self’ is through the person in question communicating aspects of his/her ‘private self' to researchers. Studies which use a thematic analysis might focus on asking people about certain experiences such as their thoughts and feelings about themselves. A number of studies concerning the self in people with dementia have attempted this type of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211418486">Beard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211418486">Clare, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211418486">Clare, Rowlands, &amp; Quin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211418486">Gillies &amp; Johnston, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211418486">Li &amp; Orleans, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1471301211418486">Pearce, Clare, &amp; Pistrang, 2002</xref>). Such studies might provide the best insight into a person’s inner world, but might involve a degree of interpretation by the researcher in order to make sense of this experience, and might thus provide a somewhat indirect representation.</p>
<p>It seems likely that many studies examining the self in dementia rely on the ability of the person to either report his/her internal experiences to us or act upon them in order to complete a measure or task, whether they are thoughts, feelings, or other kinds of experiences. Studies that ask the participant to respond in some way, by talking to the researcher, answering questions in written format, completing practical tasks, etc., all require some underlying conscious processes. Thus even by interacting with a person through research one is likely to elicit aspects of the ‘private self’, but directly testing these aspects is an extremely challenging issue. Thus it is likely that most studies with people with dementia will require the participant to have a ‘private self’ that is intact at least to some degree, whether he/she is specifically being asked to report it or whether it is being used to complete tasks which do not directly involve reflecting on the ‘private self’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211418486"><title>The ‘conceptual self’</title>
<p>The ‘conceptual self’ represents a tying together of the other four components of self, and reflects the way in which each person has a particular concept of him/herself. It is made up of abstract representations of oneself, such as roles, traits, identity, personal characteristics and autobiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211418486">Morin, 2006</xref>). This aspect of self is based on what one has been told about oneself as a human being in general, and as a person in particular, as well as on what one notices about oneself. There are a number of sub-theories that make up the conceptual self. The first is ‘role theories’, which reflect our beliefs about how we fit into society. ‘Internal models’ reflect our beliefs about our bodies and minds, and ‘trait attributions’ are theories about the self that may be acquired from our beliefs about our roles and our internal models. These self-theories are distinguishable from the other four kinds of self because they tend to be based on socially established and verbally communicated ideas. Other kinds of experience are also likely to be taken into account, such as our perceptions of our bodies, our interpersonal communication, memories of what we have done in the past, and the meanings of our thoughts and feelings. Thus each of the other four kinds of self are also represented in the ‘conceptual self’. As a result of this, a number of studies mentioned below have already been outlined in a previous section of the article, but will be noted again here.</p>
<p>A wide range of studies have tackled aspects of the self that appear to reflect Neisser’s notion of the ‘conceptual self’. Several studies have focused on self-knowledge of personality traits in people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211418486">Klein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1471301211418486">Rankin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1471301211418486">Ruby et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1471301211418486">Ruby et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211418486">Klein et al. (2003)</xref> suggest that knowledge of one’s own personality traits relies on episodic and semantic memory, which implies that the memory difficulties experienced by people with dementia would affect their ability to accurately rate their personality traits. Studies based on self-knowledge of personality traits usually rely on the calculation of a discrepancy score between the participant and an informant as a measure of how accurately a person is rating his/her own traits. These beliefs about oneself are likely to be based on internal models and roles, as well as what one has been told by others, thus reflecting some sort of self-concept in line with Neisser’s ‘conceptual self’.</p>
<p>A number of studies have attempted to examine self-recognition in people with dementia, some specifically with the aim of ascertaining whether self persists in dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211418486">Biringer &amp; Anderson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211418486">Biringer et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211418486">Bologna &amp; Camp, 1995</xref>, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211418486">Fazio &amp; Mitchell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211418486">Grewal, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211418486">Gross et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211418486">Hehman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211418486">Mendez et al., 1992</xref>). These studies usually involve testing participants to see whether they are able to self-recognize using mirrors, photographs, or videotapes. There has been some debate as to which abilities are required for a person (or animal) to be able to recognize him/herself in a mirror. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211418486">Mitchell (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211418486">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211418486">2002</xref>) has argued that all that is needed for an animal to self-recognize in the mirror is an internal representation of what it looks like, which can then be matched to the image in the mirror. This might only require access to the ‘ecological self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211418486">Morin, 2006</xref>). However, others argue that in order to self-recognize, one must have access to one’s mental states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211418486">Gallup, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211418486">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211418486">Gallup, Anderson, &amp; Shillito, 2002</xref>) which would indicate the presence of the ‘private self’. It seems likely that some aspect of the ‘private self’ would be involved in self-recognition, given that one would have to make the connection between what one is seeing in the mirror and how that relates to oneself, thus requiring certain thought processes and internal events. One might also expect that a person would require some sort of concept of what they look like in order to relate the person in the mirror to oneself. The self-recognition studies have therefore been considered as a reflection of the ‘conceptual self’ for the purposes of this article.</p>
<p>The social constructionist model also appears to be relevant to the conceptual self. As mentioned earlier, the multiple social personae (Self 3), are the ‘selves’ that are presented publicly in everyday interactions with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1471301211418486">Sabat, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1471301211418486">Sabat &amp; Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1471301211418486">Sabat &amp; Harre, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1471301211418486">Small et al., 1998</xref>; ). These personae might be likened to ‘roles’ that a person adopts over the lifespan, which could represent the ‘role theories’ that Neisser mentions as being a part of the ‘conceptual self’. The third type of self was introduced to the original social constructionist model being used to investigate the self in people with dementia after the original distinction between ‘Self 1’ and ‘Self 3’ was made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1471301211418486">Sabat &amp; Collins, 1999</xref>). This type of self (Self 2) refers to a person’s past and present beliefs and attributes, such as one’s traits and abilities. These studies look for evidence of a person’s awareness of their physical and mental attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211418486">Fazio &amp; Mitchell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1471301211418486">Sabat 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1471301211418486">Sabat &amp; Collins, 1999</xref>). Certainly, one’s mental attributes cannot be perceived directly which suggests that a representation of these must be based on other internal models and trait attributions as described in the ‘conceptual self’ of Neisser’s model.</p>
<p>There are a number of other studies that have been outlined in previous sections that also appear to reflect the ‘conceptual self’. These include studies that take an autobiographical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211418486">Addis and Tippet, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211418486">Naylor and Clare, 2008</xref>) or narrative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211418486">Mills, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1471301211418486">Usita et al.,1998</xref>) to studying the self in people with dementia, as well as studies that have focused on the types of roles people adopt across the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211418486">Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211418486">Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2006b</xref>). These roles are likely to be based on the numerous representations that people hold of themselves, and thus clearly reflect the presence of the ‘conceptual self’. It is also possible that evidence for the ‘conceptual self’ (in addition to the ‘private self’) will be elicited through the studies using thematic analyses, depending upon the focus of the interview questions and how the participant chooses to respond to them. A number of studies have used this approach to research the topic of the self in dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211418486">Beard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211418486">Clare, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211418486">Clare et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211418486">Gillies &amp; Johnston, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1471301211418486">Pearce, Clare, &amp; Pistrang, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In one sense, as the conceptual self is made up of components of the other four kinds of self-knowledge, there may be aspects of the conceptual self in all studies which have been mentioned. The five types of self are intrinsically linked, with aspects of one influencing aspects of the other types of self. For example, autobiographical memory and narrative stories might influence the conceptual self, but might also be influenced <italic>by</italic> the conceptual self, as information could be fed back and might influence one’s narrative or life story, which are constantly being extended and/or adjusted. Thus it is very difficult to tease apart the effects of the different types of self-knowledge when doing research with people who come as a ‘whole’, rather than as people with five different selves which are exhibited separately.</p>

<p>It appears that all existing studies discussed in this article can be categorized into one or more of the categories of the self as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211418486">Neisser (1988)</xref>. Most, if not all, studies actually fall into more than one category, mainly because the majority of this research has been dependent upon some sort of interaction between the participant and the researcher, which automatically fulfils the criteria for the ‘ecological’ and ‘interpersonal’ selves. Similarly, most studies rely upon participants’ words, actions, and thoughts, which suggest that the ‘private self’ must be functional in these people. It appears that the majority of studies fall into the category of Neisser’s ‘conceptual self’, as they tend to examine more complex types of self-knowledge that are acquired through interactions, which enable a person to engage with socially established and verbally communicated ideas. These studies have steered away from studying consciousness <italic>per se</italic>, and concentrated more on complex constructs such as roles and identities. In one sense, this reflects a limitation of using this sort of approach to studying the self, since it is difficult to study each component of self independently without also tapping into the other components of self. This issue will be discussed further below.</p>
<p>Using Neisser’s model to try to integrate current research has highlighted a number of difficulties surrounding approaches that have been used to study the self in dementia. It is important to define what is meant by ‘the self’ when it is referred to as the subject of research studies. Some existing studies do not offer a particular definition of self for the purposes of the research, so it is unclear what is being observed or measured, or what are considered to be components of the self. This is evident where studies attempt to measure or investigate ‘the self’ as a unitary construct. These studies may actually be using the same term to describe aspects of self that are quite different and dependent upon on a variety of abilities. For example, studies based on interactionist perspectives and studies based on narrative approaches refer to ‘the self’ as a unitary construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211418486">Fontana &amp; Smith, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211418486">Hubbard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1471301211418486">Surr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1471301211418486">Usita et al., 1998</xref>) but according to Neisser’s model, these two approaches may actually be focusing on quite different aspects of the self, specifically the ‘interpersonal self’ and the ‘extended self’ or the ‘conceptual self’ respectively. Issues of this sort make it difficult to integrate existing research as these studies may be measuring quite different abilities and aspects of the self, despite sharing the common term of ‘the self’. A related issue is the fact that many studies lack a clear theoretical framework, such that aspects of the self that have been the focus of research may be ambiguous with respect to how they are linked to having a sense of self. For example, there is little agreement on the aspects of self required for recognizing oneself in a mirror, such that even where there is consistency in terms of methodology, there is confusion with respect to how the results should be interpreted and how this relates to having a sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211418486">Gallup, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211418486">Gallup et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211418486">Mitchell, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211418486">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211418486">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211418486">Morin, 2006</xref>). This suggests the need for more clarity in future research with respect to what is being measured and how this relates to the self. This might reduce the disparity in concepts and research methods which currently make it extremely difficult to compare results across studies and therefore to draw firm conclusions from the existing research in this area.</p>
<p>Thus there are a number of advantages and also some limitations to using a theoretical framework such as Neisser’s to clarify exactly what is being researched and discussed. This sort of model provides a way of organizing research that ties it to a conceptual framework of self. This in turn allows one to link whatever is being tested to a particular construct of self, and avoids the issue with some previous research where the component of self being tested (or the ability which is thought to be related to possessing a sense of self) has no obvious link to a specific model or framework of the self. This issue is partly to blame for the difficulty in interpreting findings from previous studies, both from the perspective of the single study, and also when trying to integrate findings from different studies. Another advantage of having a multi-component model of self is that it enables one to test different aspects or specific components of self within the same population, in an effort to establish whether the self is affected as a whole by dementia, or whether components of self are affected independently of each other. To date, there is little evidence to support either conclusion, since researchers typically only tackle a single component of self at any one time, or treat the self as a unitary construct. If a systematic model was employed, it could allow researchers to observe relationships between different components of the self, or even within components of the self. The possibility of investigating the self as a number of separate components or processes has also been noted by Klein &amp; Gangi (2010), who suggest that there is no single entity to measure, and that therefore it would be beneficial to break the problem into a number of smaller parts which could be explored separately (see also Klein, 2010). In this way one could obtain evidence regarding separate components of the self, and then focus on the ways in which these components might interact to produce the experience of a unified self. However, Neisser’s model might be limited in this respect since the components are not completely independent of each other, and also because testing procedures typically require abilities relating to certain aspects of self (particularly the ‘ecological’ and ‘interpersonal’ selves) in order to be feasible. This makes it challenging to classify most of the existing studies on the self into just a single category of Neisser’s model. However, this issue would appear to be inherent in researching the self, and is therefore not specific to this framework. Whichever model is used, it is likely that the participants would have to be exhibiting some degree of consciousness or self-awareness to be able to take part in the study. As mentioned earlier, the exceptions here are studies based on observational techniques. In addition, most models of the self require a lower or more basic sense of self, consciousness or self-awareness, to be able to experience and exhibit the more complex levels of self, consciousness or self-awareness. This really represents part of a larger issue in isolating the different components of the self so that they can be tested separately. As the self is generally experienced as a single entity, it is not an easy task to reduce its content to distinct components of self which are independent of each other. However, it might be possible to consider such models of self as being hierarchical to some extent, since the ‘higher’ levels of self (such as Neisser’s ‘conceptual self’) appear to subsume the ‘lower’ levels of self (such as Neisser’s ‘ecological self’ and ‘interpersonal self’). It might then be possible to investigate the self systematically using this approach, whereby one might conclude that the ‘lower’ levels of self are likely to be intact if the ‘higher’ levels of self can be detected and measured. Thus this issue should not necessarily be seen as a barrier to using such comprehensive models of self, given that the benefits of this approach are still numerous. Even where it is difficult to separate out the components of self so that there is no overlap between them, there is still much to be gained by defining what is meant by ‘the self’ in order to bring more clarity to what is being researched or discussed. Moreover, undertaking research with people who have impairments in the more complex levels of the self could provide valuable information about how these levels are structured and the nature of the relationships between them.</p>
<p>It is interesting that it is possible to broadly categorize all of the empirical studies that have been undertaken with people with dementia regarding the self. This could be because the framework suggested by Neisser is based on the origin and developmental histories of the different aspects of self, as well as taking into account the pathologies of the self, thus also giving the model a biological basis to some degree. In addition, the way in which each aspect of self contributes to the social experiences of humans has been taken into consideration in the development of the framework. All of these factors taken together have resulted in a model of self that appears true to human experience, and which it is therefore possible to relate to in terms of everyday experiences, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211418486">Kyle (2008)</xref>, who highlighted the potential for each of the components of self to be recognized and understood in terms of everyday observations and interactions. In turn, this has outlined aspects of self in a way that is accessible to researchers, and these aspects of self may be more amenable to measurement than some of the constructs outlined in other models. This is also advantageous in terms of being able understand how dementia might impact upon the self, and to apply results in a practical way to offer understanding, help and support for people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211418486">Jenkins &amp; Price, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211418486">Kyle, 2008</xref>). If research is able to focus on aspects of the self that are closely related to what people experience on a day-to-day basis, the results are more likely to offer an opportunity to develop interventions that are effective and that can be applied in the context of real-world situations.</p>
<p>The self is a very challenging topic to investigate. Although a lot of research is being conducted with the aim of finding out how the self is affected by the onset and progression of dementia, it is difficult to make sense of it due to the disparity in the concepts, models and methodologies being employed. This difficulty is exacerbated by the lack of theoretical framework in some studies, making it difficult to clarify exactly what is being tested and how this relates to the self. This paper has highlighted the value in taking a different approach to address this topic, which makes use of a clear, systematic framework of the self. There are both advantages and limitations of using such an approach. It would allow researchers to address the topic of the self in a more systematic way, which might enable researchers to integrate findings across studies and to relate findings to a theoretical construct of self. It is also important to consider the value of conducting research using a model of self that can be related to everyday experiences, given the implications of this sort of research for the care and support offered to people with dementia. Although this way of studying the self is not free from some difficulties that appear to be inherent in any attempt to measure the self, it would address a number of significant limitations of existing research and enables researchers to think about how best to conduct future research to maximise its impact in terms of theoretical and practical implications.</p>
