<p>In 1992, the French publisher Editions Syllepse posthumously published a slim volume by the Marxian theorist Henri Lefebvre, <italic>Éléments de rythmanalyse</italic>. Less than a 100 pages in length, the book collected together a series of essays around the theme of rhythm and modern life. Not one to wrap his arguments in a cloak of intellectual modesty, Lefebvre explained in the introduction to <italic>Éléments</italic> that his aim was, “nothing less than to found a new science, a new field of knowledge” (p. 3). This new science was to be ‘the analysis of rhythms.’ Leaving aside the absurdity of a single writer wanting in a single slim book to invent a whole new branch of science, there was something to Lefebvre’s argument. If one stops and takes the time to look around, a plethora of rhythms make themselves apparent. There are the everyday rhythms of organisational life, those of traffic and public transport, the rhythms of eating and sleeping. There are also the rhythms of the seasons, of night and day, of ageing, of growing up, of economic boom and bust. And it is not just that the world is infused with all kinds of rhythms. These rhythms layer into each other. Organisational rhythms weave into the daily rhythms of work and rest, into the rhythms of traffic and movement, and these merge into the annual rhythms of holidays and festivals. What are we to make of all these rhythms? And how should we go about analysing them?</p>
<p>Inspired by Lefebvre, Tim Edensor’s edited collection <italic>Geographies of Rhythm: Nature, Place, Mobilities and Bodies</italic> presents a series of case studies of how human geographers might approach the question of rhythm. It asks how we might take Lefebvre at his word and begin to formulate a geographically inflected rhythmanalysis. Well the first answer to this question appears to be, ‘make sure you’ve read Lefebvre closely!’. Following the cue of the editor’s introduction, each of the 14 substantive chapters offer a distinctive riff on the idea of rhythmanalysis. These chapters are dizzyingly diverse—perhaps to prove the contention that rhythms really are everywhere. They range from meditations on the corporeal training of early 20th-century women aviators, through to discussion of the aesthetics of everyday urban life, an analysis of the disciplinary techniques of self-help productivity books and a study of the disrupted lives of asylum-seekers in the Irish Republic.</p>
<p>Some of these chapters present forceful arguments for the usefulness of attending to rhythm. Owain Jones offers readers a carefully textured reflection on how diurnal tidal rhythms weave into the everyday livelihoods of those who live by and with the sea. Richard Hornsley tells a compelling history of London traffic-planners’ attempts in the 1920s and 1930s to control the jaunty rhythms of pedestrians, threatening as these were to the regulated rhythms of motorised traffic. And, Justin Spinney’s chapter on the distinctive rhythms of cyclists commuting into central London is wonderfully suggestive. Yet taken as a whole there is something not quite convincing about the forms of rhythmanalysis presented in <italic>Geographies of Rhythm</italic>.</p>
<p>So what is missing? Well two things. First, by cleaving so closely to Lefebvre and his blueprint for rhythmanalysis, <italic>Geographies of Rhythm</italic> ends up cutting itself off from a whole series of literatures that have much of interest to say about social and natural rhythms. Time geography, for example, gets a number of mentions, yet is seen as little more than a precursor to the ever so much more theoretically sophisticated theorising of Lefebvre. This is despite the fact that the writing of Hägerstrand and other pioneering time geographers are imbued with a remarkable nuance and conceptual sophistication. And it is not just time geography that gets short shrift. The masses of social history concerned with the formation of contemporary patterns of temporality are passed over. It is as if writers like Edward Thompson, Wolfgang Schivelbusch, Stephen Kerns, Lynda Nead or Vanessa Schwartz—to name just a few examples—have nothing to tell us about rhythm (even as their writing hums with it!). And this is to say nothing of the urban historian Lewis Mumford who argued that it was the transformative rhythm of the church clock that underpinned the rise of the medieval and early modern European city. I could go on. What of the work of social anthropologists, of sociologists, of transport engineers even? If geographers want to forge a robust and intellectually compelling rhythmanalysis, then surely we need to connect to these diverse traditions? And surely we need to work more imaginatively (and more generously) with those older geographical literatures that have considered rhythm?</p>
<p>The second element missing is method. Many of the chapters are thinking hard about <italic>how</italic> rhythms might be studied. Spinney’s contribution uses video material to good effect. Filipa Mato Wunderlich employs a wonderfully evocative style of time-lapse photography in her chapter. Paola Jiron uses a technique that could best be described as a kind of ‘journey along’ in his piece on mass transit users in Santiago. However, there is not nearly enough discussion on how difficult it is actually to sense the range of rhythms that rhythmanalysis is meant to be concerned with. How do we actually go about showing up and accounting for all the various different rhythms that play into entities such as a street, a neighbourhood or a city? How should we go about describing them, mapping them, diagraming them? There are profound limitations to the model of the lone rhythmanalyst conjured up by Lefebvre in <italic>Éléments</italic>, heroically taking the beat of a society with the help of nothing more than her senses (aided only by a notebook and perhaps a camera). How can one person possibly attend at once to such detail and such variation? The answer, of course, is that they cannot. And a more methodologically convincing rhythmanalysis would need to be much more open to a range of techniques and sources that usually lie outside the purview of cultural geography—surveys statistical and otherwise, cartography, GIS, computational social science even. That would really be a rhythmanalysis with a beat!</p>
