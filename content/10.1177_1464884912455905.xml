<abstract>
<p>Robert Merton’s theory of cumulative advantage posits that the initial status advantages one acquires can successively lead to greater opportunities in career advancement. This study examines the cumulative effect of individual and institutional factors on the likelihood of one’s success in international reporting, an area commonly considered as the mark of an ultra-elite in journalistic stratification. Analyzing a sample of 814 Pulitzer winners whose life courses and career progressions are reconstructed using various archival data, our study shows that international reporting winners, compared with local reporting awardees, are more likely to be male, foreign born, cosmopolites, and Ivy League graduates. These initial advantages, however, mainly improve their chances of joining top news organizations in the first place. Being selected by those news organizations boosts disproportionally their successive probability of winning the Pulitzers. The process of advantage accumulation in journalism accentuates the social stratification in society at large.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Journalism as an occupational system is highly contested and stratified. Journalists compete for resources, positions, and status recognition by accumulating and utilizing their cultural and social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912455905">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>). Similar to other fields of cultural production, professional awards constitute an important form of status recognition in journalism. Major journalism awards, such as the Pulitzer Prize, generate a select group of elite news workers who become symbols of professional excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912455905">Beam et al., 1986</xref>). However, not every journalist has an equal chance of winning. Journalists from different backgrounds may have unequal chances of producing significant works. The works of journalists from different organizations may gain more or less recognition from award judges. The award system, in other words, creates an uneven opportunity structure that allows <italic>some</italic> journalists to take advantage of their credentials and resources to win against their cohort and elevate themselves to the rank of the journalistic elite.</p>
<p>Moreover, not all award categories carry the same symbolic value. Winners in the most valued categories can be further boosted to the top of the stratification hierarchy and become what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912455905">Zuckerman (1977)</xref> would call ‘an ultra-elite’. In the field of journalism, foreign news reporters are generally considered as ‘elite professionals’, ‘a special class-apart’ from other reporters and ‘the nobility of American journalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912455905">Erickson and Hamilton, 2006</xref>: 35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884912455905">Gross and Kopper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884912455905">Hamilton, 2009</xref>: 219). Surveys have consistently shown that foreign correspondents are more likely to be older, have attended a highly selective college, have earned a graduate degree, receive higher salary, and have a higher degree of job satisfaction than other reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912455905">Bogart, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884912455905">Hamilton and Jenner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912455905">Hess, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455905">Hohenberg, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884912455905">Wilhelm, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884912455905">Willnat and Weaver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884912455905">Wu and Hamilton, 2004</xref>). They often work for high-ranking publications, hold power and influence, enjoy glamorous lifestyles and considerable work autonomy, and receive high honors within and beyond the field of journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884912455905">Hamilton, 2009</xref>: 219–224). Personality-wise, foreign news reporters have been mystified as ‘dreamers and misfits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884912455905">Rand, 1995</xref>: 21), ‘prima donnas and workaholics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912455905">Brittain, 2002</xref>), and ‘a happy, crappy, crazy, intellectual, foolish, endangered band of brothers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884912455905">Geyer, 1983</xref>: 370). If winning a Pulitzer brings one into the circle of the journalistic elite, then winning in the category of international reporting may imply a place among the ultra-elite.</p>
<p>Yet opportunities for winning the international reporting awards, just like opportunities for winning the Pulitzer Prize in general, are likely to be unevenly distributed. This study thus asks the following questions: What does it take to become a member of the ultra-elite in journalism? Concretely, what are the major personal characteristics and dominant patterns of career progressions of international reporting award winners compared to winners of other categories? Are there specific types of cultural and social capital that enhance a journalist’s chances of winning the international reporting award?</p>
<p>Conceptually, we borrow the notion of ‘cumulative advantage’ originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884912455905">Merton (1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884912455905">1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884912455905">1988</xref>) to establish a framework concerning how journalists’ personal background and institutional contexts shape their chances of winning the Pulitzer Prize in international reporting. The analysis will help us identify and understand the structural inequalities existing in the competition for professional recognition in the field of journalism. It will also illustrate how stratification in journalism is fundamentally linked to stratification in society at large.</p>
<p>The next section further explicates the theoretical arguments underlying this study. A cumulative advantage model for winning the Pulitzer Prize in international reporting is proposed and examined based on a sample of 814 Pulitzer winners whose life courses and career progressions are reconstructed using various archival data.</p>

<title>Cumulative advantage and the path towards elite status in journalism</title>
<sec id="section3-1464884912455905">
<title>Cumulative advantage</title>
<p>In a merit-oriented society, career advancement is largely achieved, not inherited. Yet the upward mobility in an occupational system unavoidably involves a process of ‘accumulation of differential advantages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884912455905">Merton, 1957</xref>) that ‘contributes to elite formation and ultimately produces sharply graded systems of stratification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912455905">Zuckerman, 1977</xref>: 59). More precisely, the concept of cumulative advantage (or sometimes dubbed ‘accumulative advantage’) captures ‘the ways in which initial comparative advantages of trained capacity, structural location, and available resources make for successive increments of advantage such that the gaps between the haves and have-nots . . . widen until dampened by countervailing processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884912455905">Merton, 1988</xref>: 606).</p>
<p>In other words, once an individual obtains an initial advantage, no matter whether it is the result of the person’s ability, hard work, affiliation, background, or sheer luck, such an advantage is likely to allow the person to gain additional advantages. Hence the advantages accumulate and multiply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884912455905">Merton, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912455905">Zuckerman, 1977</xref>). In this process, even very small initial differences may be magnified over time, making it difficult for those who are behind to catch up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912455905">Rosenbaum, 1979</xref>). Defined this way, cumulative advantage can help explain differences in career advancement between individuals belonging to the same social group or between people from different social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455905">DiPrete and Eirich, 2006</xref>). In the latter case, cumulative advantage becomes a mechanism through which social stratification is maintained, reproduced, and sometimes enlarged.</p>
<p>The theory of cumulative advantage was originally applied mainly in the work of sociologists seeking to explain stratification in scientific careers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884912455905">Allison and Stewart, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912455905">Cole and Cole, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912455905">Hagstrom, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884912455905">Long and Fox, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912455905">Zuckerman, 1977</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912455905">Zuckerman (1977)</xref>, for example, found that most Nobel Prize winners between 1901 and 1972 came from professional families, were disproportionally from Jewish and Protestant backgrounds, attended the most prestigious universities, and trained with older Nobel laureates – a process of accumulative advantage that creates the narrow circle of the scientific elite.</p>
<p>In recent years, the theory has been further developed in various fields in the social sciences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455905">DiPrete and Eirich, 2006</xref>), producing new concepts such as first mover advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884912455905">Kerin et al., 1992</xref>), path-dependent increasing returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884912455905">Arthur and Arrow, 1994</xref>), halo effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912455905">Greenwald and Banaji, 1995</xref>), and reputational effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912455905">Gould, 2002</xref>), among others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884912455905">Xie and Shauman, 2004</xref>). This body of literature confirms the existence of an inequality-generating process that creates a stratified distribution of chances among individuals in a broad spectrum of occupations, institutions, and other social domains.</p>
<p>For the present study, the concept of cumulative advantage is useful for capturing the possibility that the ‘end result’ of winning a Pulitzer Prize in international reporting is linked to certain ‘initial advantages’ enjoyed by specific groups of journalists. The following section develops a cumulative advantage model linking together personal characteristics, institutional resources, and award outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1464884912455905">
<title>Factors behind award winning: Institutional resources and personal background</title>
<p>The social composition and stratification in the journalistic workforce has been a major topic in journalism studies. Numerous surveys have been conducted to investigate the background characteristics and career paths of journalists (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884912455905">Johnstone et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884912455905">Weaver and Wilhoit, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884912455905">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884912455905">Weaver et al., 2007</xref>). One of the underlying concerns of those surveys is to identify inequalities in career opportunities. Yet little is known of the mechanisms through which career mobility takes place or of the degree of inequality imposed by the opportunity structure of the journalistic field. Some anecdotal studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884912455905">Shaw, 2006</xref>) suggest that working for top newspapers may constitute a career advantage, but the cumulative effect in the structure of journalistic careers has not been systematically examined and confirmed. This study, therefore, seeks evidence of the presence of cumulative advantage in journalism by examining the career progressions of Pulitzer Prize winners. We are particularly interested in what constitute career advantages for the winning international news reporters, commonly considered the most elite and exclusive club in journalistic stratification.</p>
<p>In journalism, as in science, access to institutional resources can be a crucial factor in career performance. Institutional resources for journalists include sufficient staff support and financial resources for ambitious, time-consuming projects. The importance of institutional resources for quality journalism partly explains why Pulitzer awards tend to go to major national newspapers such as the <italic>New York Times, Washington Post</italic> and <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>. These newspapers ‘have means of developing the best stories, or the best written and best backgrounded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884912455905">Shaw, 2006</xref>). This is especially true for overseas reporting, which requires significant investment in personnel, facilities, and operating budget.</p>
<p>More subtle – but equally important – institutional resources also include what Bourdieu calls social capital, or a network of ‘institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition’, which provides members in a group with ‘the backing of the collectively-owned capital, a credential which entitles them to credit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912455905">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>: 51). Journalists working for prestigious newspapers tend to have better access to official and expert sources. And it is no secret that they are also more likely to get recognized by award judges since the newspaper’s reputation can carry it over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912455905">Hatcher, 2007</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912455905">Fischer (1986</xref>: lxvii) noticed that the <italic>New York Times</italic> has held a commanding lead in the list of Pulitzer Prize winners because ‘hardly any other paper strives more intensely for the honors because of their prestige’. To maintain its elite status the <italic>New York Times</italic> would make the best effort in preparing its entries with skillfully supported arguments and excellent presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912455905">Fischer, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>The above considerations point to the importance of institutional factors for career advancement in journalism. Specifically for the present study, we expect that journalists working for top news organizations would be ‘privileged’ in the sense that winners of the international reporting awards, presumably the category with the highest symbolic value, would come disproportionately from such news organizations.</p>
<p>Following the cumulative advantage argument, we further posit certain personal characteristics as initial advantages or disadvantages influencing the chances for a journalist to be employed by top news organizations. Specifically, the following analysis examines the impact of geographic origin and education. Geographic origin refers to whether a journalist was raised in a big city or a foreign country, which is indicative of a range of cultural and social capital that a journalist may have acquired through upbringing. Journalists who were raised in bigger cities or foreign countries may be (perceived as) more cosmopolitan, adventurous, and more competent in exploring out-group cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912455905">Almquist and Angrist, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884912455905">Hannerz, 2007</xref>). They are therefore more likely to be hired by international or major national news organizations as well as to excel in international news reporting.</p>
<p>Similarly, education, as an important form of cultural capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912455905">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>: 47), may shape the chances for a journalist to be hired by top news organizations, and/or the chances for a journalist to be assigned to work on foreign news reporting. A stratified education system can transfer inequality to the labor market and lead to unequal starting positions in a given occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884912455905">Merton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884912455905">Sekowski and Siekanska, 2008</xref>). People with better educational backgrounds may have their ability more readily and promptly recognized, and are hence more likely to receive their first job in top news organizations or find their way quickly to such newsrooms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1464884912455905">
<title>The cumulative advantage model</title>
<p>Summarizing the above arguments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464884912455905">Figure 1</xref> presents the cumulative advantage model to be examined. Education and geographic origin (urban or foreign born) are expected to influence the chances for journalists to be employed by major news organizations. Employer characteristics indicate the institutional resources that journalists have and that are expected to affect the chances for journalists to win in the international award category. Institutional resources, in other words, are posited as ‘mediators’ of the influence of personal characteristics on winning international reporting awards. Nevertheless, it is also possible for personal characteristics to directly impinge upon the chances for a journalist to win an international reporting award. A direct linkage, therefore, is also included in the figure.</p>

</fig>
<p>Other personal characteristics such as gender and age will also be included in the analysis. They are not presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464884912455905">Figure 1</xref>, however, since they are not posited as initial advantages leading to award outcomes. Three types of education-related variables are included in the analysis: overall educational attainment, professional education in journalism, and graduation from prestigious universities.</p>
<p>For employer characteristics, this study focuses on the market reach of the news organizations. International and major national news organizations are more likely to have a foreign desk and to win in the international reporting category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912455905">Fischer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884912455905">Shaw, 2006</xref>). It is difficult for small papers to outmuscle the prestigious and powerful national newspapers in competing for the Pulitzers, especially when international reporting is concerned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912455905">Coulson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912455905">Gladney, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912455905">Hatcher, 2007</xref>). The analysis also pays special attention to New York media. As the most important metropolitan ‘global city’ of the USA, New York houses two of the three national newspapers in the country – the <italic>New York Times</italic> (NYT) and the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> (WSJ). The metropolitan environment and the presence of major national media may lead New York media in general to make more efforts on international news. Also, the fact that the Pulitzer Prize is housed by Columbia University in New York might be indicative of its closer relationship with, and possible favoritism toward, the New York newspapers. Hence it is possible that even the smaller New York media organizations may be more likely to win the international reporting awards.</p>
<p>Finally, the ‘dependent variable’ in the model is whether the winning journalist has won in the category of international reporting. Due to the nature of the data utilized, the following analysis is not concerned with whether and how personal characteristics and institutional resources affect the chances for journalists to win a Pulitzer Prize. Rather, the analysis compares the profiles of the Pulitzer Prize winners in different award categories and examines if the presumably more prestigious awards were indeed won disproportionately by people with the ‘right types’ of initial advantages and institutional resources.</p>

<sec id="section6-1464884912455905" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method and data</title>
<p>The data set analyzed below, which contains the personal information of all the winners of the Pulitzer Prize in Journalism between 1917 and 2010, was constructed using archival sources. The list of winners and their winning categories came from the official website of the Pulitzer Prizes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pulitzer.org">www.pulitzer.org</ext-link>). The biographical data of the winners came from a number of print and electronic and print sources: (1) dictionaries and reference books such as <italic>Who’s Who of Pulitzer Prize Winners</italic> (1917–1998) and <italic>The Pulitzer Prize Archive, Volume 1–Volume 14</italic>, among many others; (2) obituaries; (3) the winners’ biographies, autobiographies, personal or social-networking websites; (4) newspaper reports and interviews; and (5) secondary sources such as Bates’ <italic>The Pulitzer Prize</italic>, Rothmyer’s <italic>Winning Pulitzers</italic>, and Hohenberg’s <italic>Pulitzer Prizes: A History of the Awards in Books, Drama, Music and Journalism</italic>.</p>
<p>A total of 814 winners of the Prize are in the data set. Although a wide range of sources was used, a certain amount of ‘missing information’ is inevitable, especially for the winners in the early years. Therefore, the actual sample size varies from one specific analysis to another. Despite the imperfections in the data set, the amount of information should be sufficient for us to draw substantive conclusions. There are no obvious reasons why the missing data would contribute to substantial or systematic biases in the results.</p>

<title>Profiling the international reporting award winners</title>
<p>Before examining the cumulative advantage model, it would be useful to first compare the profiles of the Pulitzer Prize winners in different categories. Such a discussion will also help explicate the operationalization of the key variables involved in the latter analysis.</p>
<p>The Pulitzer Prize has offered numerous award categories, and there have been adjustments in the categories over the years. For more than a decade after the award’s establishment, there was no separate category for international news reporting. Herbert Bayard Swope’s articles on Germany won a Pulitzer in 1917, but only in the general category of ‘reporting’. In 1929, Pulitzer established the first ‘primarily international-oriented award category’ called ‘correspondence’, and in 1942 a separate category for ‘telegraphic reporting – international’ was created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884912455905">Fischer and Fischer, 2003</xref>: 67). The two categories were then combined into the single category of ‘international reporting’ in 1948, and it has not been changed since. This analysis combines the winners in these three categories from 1929 to 2010 into one category of ‘international news reporting’ awards. In other words, whether a journalist has won an international news reporting award was based on the actual award category given by the Pulitzer instead of the contents of the award-winning work. Operationalized as such, there are totally 105 winners in international news reporting, constituting 12.9 percent of the 814 winners.</p>
<p>To simplify the analysis, we compared the profiles of the international news reporting winners to the profiles of local reporting winners, ‘other reporting award’ winners, and non-reporting award winners. We single out ‘local reporting’ because it is the opposite of international reporting in terms of geographical demarcation. Local reporting awards include a number of more specific categories that have changed over time, such as ‘local general or spot news reporting’ (1964–1984), ‘beat reporting’ (1991–2006), and ‘local reporting’ (1948–1952, 2007–present). A total of 162 of the 814 winners in the data set (19.9%) were winners of a local reporting award.</p>
<p>Several other categories including national reporting, in-depth journalism, and the unspecified ‘reporting’ award between 1917 and 1947 were grouped together into ‘other reporting awards’ with 187 winners. Finally, the remaining 360 winners were grouped together as non-reporting award winners. These include awards in categories such as photography, editorial writing, and commentary.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884912455905">Table 1</xref> summarizes the gender, age, and birthplace distributions of the four groups of winners. From the first row of the table it can be seen that in all categories women are under-represented but the proportion of women winners is particularly small in the category of international news reporting. In contrast, the proportion of women winners is relatively higher among the local reporting award winners. In other words, there has been a general difficulty for female journalists to gain professional recognition through winning the Pulitzer Prize, but females faced additional difficulties in winning in the prestigious category of international reporting.</p>

<p>There are also significant differences among the mean ages of the winners in the four groups, but mainly between local reporting and non-reporting award winners, with the former being particularly young and the latter being particularly senior. There is no difference in mean age between international reporting winners and all others grouped together. However, when age group distribution is examined, the difference between international reporting winners and all other winners approaches statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>&lt;.10). International reporting award winners were more likely to be concentrated into the ‘middle-age’ category of 40–49: 46.6 percent of the international reporting award winners fall into this category compared to only 33.1 percent of all other winners.</p>
<p>The bottom of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884912455905">Table 1</xref> presents the geographic origins of the winners. Not surprisingly, winners of international news reporting awards were particularly likely to be born in foreign countries. When the foreign-born journalists are excluded, international reporting award winners also seem more likely to have been born in big cities (operationally defined as the most populous 25 cities in the USA according to census data from the time periods in which each of the Pulitzer Prize winners lived). The difference between international reporting winners and all other winners approaches but fails to achieve statistical significance. International reporting award winners also do not differ from other winners in terms of their geographical region of birth.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884912455905">Table 2</xref> summarizes the educational background of the four groups of Pulitzer winners. The first half of the table shows that local reporting winners are most likely to have majored in journalism either at the undergraduate or at the graduate level, followed by other reporting award winners. By contrast, only 14.3 percent of the international reporting award winners majored in journalism in college. A possible explanation is that a journalism degree might be more desirable for a person working locally, but expertise in subjects such as political science or area studies might be more valued in candidates who are seeking international reporting positions. However, when international reporting award winners were compared to all other winners grouped together, as the bottom half of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884912455905">Table 2</xref> shows, there are no significant differences in terms of college major and journalistic experiences at school.</p>

<p>Pulitzer winners, in all four categories, were more likely to hold a graduate degree than the average American journalist. In the four categories, between 15 percent and 23 percent of the Pulitzer winners had a graduate degree, but only 8.1 percent to 11.4 percent of all American journalists from 1971 to 1992 could say the same (Weaver, 2007). Winners of local and other reporting awards were slightly more likely to have had a graduate education than winners of international reporting, but the difference just falls short of reaching the conventional level of statistical significance. Differences in where the winners earned their degrees, however, are quite significant: 23.8 percent of international reporting winners graduated from an Ivy League university compared to only 12.5 percent to 16.0 percent of winners in other categories. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884912455905">Table 2</xref> thus shows that, although the international reporting winners do not necessarily tend to have had more education or professional training, they often had the symbolic capital of having graduated from a prestigious university.</p>
<p>We now turn to examine the relationship between news organizations and the type of awards being won. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884912455905">Table 3</xref> shows, not surprisingly, the international reporting winners were more likely to have been employed by wire services when compared to other winners.</p>

<p>More importantly, the international reporting awards feature winners from international and national news organizations disproportionally. Among the international reporting winners, 42.3 percent were employed by a national news organization – operationally defined as WSJ, NYT, and the <italic>Washington Post</italic> (WP) only. About one-sixth of the international reporting award winners (17.3%) were employed by international wire services, and none were employed by local newspapers. By contrast, among local reporting winners, 5.6 percent were employed by local newspapers and as many as 75.3 percent by regional newspapers. Only 16.7 percent were employed by national newspapers and 2.5 percent by international news organizations. The figures for other reporting award winners and non-reporting award winners were largely similar to those for local reporting winners.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884912455905">Table 3</xref> also shows the results regarding whether employees of New York media are more likely than others to have won international reporting awards. NYT and WSJ are grouped separately because they both target the national market. ‘Other New York media’ thus include all New York news organizations other than NYT and WSJ. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884912455905">Table 3</xref> shows that ‘other New York media’ are indeed more likely than ‘non-New York media’ to have won in the international reporting category. Among all awards won by other New York media, 23.0 percent were international reporting awards, and only 14.8 percent were local reporting awards. In contrast, among all awards won by non-New York news organizations, only 9.4 percent were international reporting awards, and 21.0 percent were local.</p>

<title>Analyzing the cumulative advantage model</title>
<p>The previous section showed that there are indeed some differences in personal and organizational characteristics between winners of different types of awards. International reporting winners were more likely to be Ivy League graduates and they were more likely to be employees of international or major national news organizations. However, the cumulative advantage model suggests that organizational affiliation may situate between the personal factors and winning of the international reporting awards. Technically speaking, the cumulative advantage model is basically a path model in statistical analysis. Hence, examining the accumulative effect involves conducting two sets of multivariate analyses. The first set of multivariate analyses examines the relationship between personal factors and organizational affiliation, and the second set of multivariate analyses examines the predictors of winning international reporting awards.</p>
<p>To examine the predictors of organizational affiliation, multinomial logit regressions were conducted because the dependent variables – whether the winners were employees of international, national, or regional/local news organizations, and whether the winners were employees of national New York media, other New York media, or non-NewYork media – are categorical and have more than two values. We first examine the predictors of whether a journalist is employed by an international, national or local/regional news organization. The independent variables include gender, age, square of age (to examine a possible non-linear effect of age), a dichotomous variable of born in a foreign country or not, a dichotomous variable of born in a big city or not, and the four dichotomous education-related variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884912455905">Table 2</xref>.

<p>Local or regional news organization is used as the reference category when calculating the coefficients. The results indicate that winners who were employees of international news organizations were younger and more likely to be foreign born than winners who were employees of local or regional organizations. Meanwhile, winners from national news organizations compared to winners from local or regional news organizations were older, more likely to be foreign born, more likely to have been born in a big city, more likely to have had journalistic experiences at school, and more likely to have graduated from an Ivy League school.</p>
<p>The results here, when combined with the results in the previous tables, suggest that being hired by a national news organization may indeed ‘mediate’ the influence of having graduated from an Ivy League school and being born in a foreign country or a big city on winning an international award. While the previous section has shown that international reporting winners were more likely to have been born in a foreign country or a big city, and also more likely to have graduated from an Ivy League school, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884912455905">Table 4</xref> suggests that these factors may matter because they can enhance the chance of a journalist to be hired by a national news organization in the first place.</p>
<p>The right hand side of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884912455905">Table 4</xref> shows the results when being employed by New York vs. non-New York media was the dependent variable. Since NYT and WSJ are simply two of the three ‘national news organizations’ in the data set, the findings in the third column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884912455905">Table 4</xref> are actually similar to the findings in the second column. Meanwhile, the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884912455905">Table 4</xref> shows that there is very little difference in the personal background of award-winning journalists at other New York media when compared to award winners from non-New York media.</p>
<p>Finally, we can turn to examine the influence of personal characteristics and organizational affiliations on the probability of a journalist winning an international reporting award. To simplify the analysis, the dependent variable was turned into a dichotomous one with international reporting award = 1 and all other awards = 0. The independent variables were added into the regression in two blocks. The first block contains the personal characteristics included in the analysis in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884912455905">Table 4</xref>. The second block contains three dichotomous variables related to organizational affiliations: (1) international media organizations vs. others; (2) national media organizations vs. others; and (3) ‘Other New York’ media vs. others. The ‘NYT/WSJ vs. other’ variable is not included in the analysis because it largely overlaps with the ‘national news organizations vs. others’ variable.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1464884912455905">Table 5</xref> summarizes the results of the analysis. The first column shows that four of the personal characteristics are significantly related to the dependent variable. Among the Pulitzer winners, those who were born in a foreign country or a big city, and those graduated from an Ivy League school were significantly more likely to have won in the international reporting category. These findings replicate those already shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884912455905">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884912455905">Table 2</xref>. There is no linear relationship between age and the dependent variable, but there is a significant relationship between the non-linear term for age and the dependent variable. The positive coefficient of the ‘main effect’ term of age, combined with the negative coefficient of the non-linear term, means that the relationship between age and the dependent variable is a non-linear one in the shape of an inverted U. In other words, the probability of a Pulitzer winner being awarded in the international reporting category is higher in the middle-age categories. This, again, corresponds to the findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884912455905">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The second column shows the results after the three organizational affiliation variables were added into the model. The findings show that all three organizational affiliation variables are highly significantly related to the dependent variable. The pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> value for the regression model jumps from 7.1 percent to 17.0 percent after adding the three factors. Regarding the personal characteristics variables, the influence of being born in a foreign country, being born in a big city, and graduating from an Ivy League school all diminish. In fact, being born in a big city or not and being an Ivy League graduate or not become statistically insignificant. In other words, the relationship between winning an international reporting award and being born in a big city, and that between winning an international reporting award and being an Ivy League graduate, are completely ‘mediated’ by organizational affiliation. Ivy League graduates and journalists born in big cities were more likely to have won in the international reporting category simply because they had the initial differential advantage of being hired by national media organizations.</p>
<p>These findings are not surprising and corroborate the general belief that the most prestigious media organizations have historically preferred Ivy League graduates who received a general liberal arts education to those journalism majors at less prestigious universities. The NYT, for example, instituted a system of ‘news clerkship’ in the 1950s to hire fresh graduates from Ivy League schools to train them for reporting political and international affairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912455905">Diamond, 1994</xref>: 250). In a more recent interview, Bill Keller, executive editor of NYT from 2003 to 2011, voiced a similar perspective when giving advice to aspiring journalists: ‘There are many, many paths to journalism, and they are not by any means limited to studying journalism as an academic subject . . . A good, rounded liberal arts education is a fine launching pad into a journalism life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884912455905"><italic>New York Times</italic>, 2009</xref>). Among the 80 NYT reporters who won a Pulitzer, 37.5 percent received their education from one of the eight Ivy League schools and many of the rest also came from elite schools such as Williams College, University of Notre Dame, and University of Chicago. Among the 25 NYT winners in the category of international reporting, as high as 44 percent were Ivy League graduates.</p>
<p>At the same time, part, but not all, of the relationship between winning an international reporting award and being born in a foreign country is also mediated by organizational affiliation. Journalists born in foreign countries were more likely to be hired by international and national news organizations, which enhanced their chances of winning an international reporting award. But even keeping organizational affiliation constant, being born in foreign countries remains associated with a higher likelihood of winning an international reporting award. A plausible reason is that, no matter in what media organizations, people born in foreign countries are relatively more likely to find themselves in the ‘beat’ of foreign news reporting. They may also enjoy various advantages when working on foreign news, such as having better network resources and a better understanding of the culture of the place one covers.</p>
<p>Other than being born in foreign countries, the only relationship between personal characteristics and international reporting award winning is the non-linear ‘effect’ of age. Winners of the international reporting awards were more concentrated into the middle-age categories, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884912455905">Table 1</xref> has already shown at the bivariate level. This finding suggests that, compared to winning the other types of awards, winning the international reporting awards takes more time and requires more substantial life and professional experiences. Hence reporters are not likely to win the international reporting award when they are young. On the other hand, international reporting is a physically demanding job requiring a high level of dynamism and mobility on the part of the journalists. As a result, not many senior journalists may stay in the field for a very long period of time.</p>

<title>Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>This study aims to explore the mechanisms of the stratification system in journalism and to identify the differential opportunity structures for career achievement in different journalistic areas. We are particularly interested in the pathways towards Pulitzer international reporting awards, an area that is considered as the mark of an ultra-elite in the field. Our analysis shows that winners of different categories of the Pulitzers do differ systematically in their personal backgrounds and organizational affiliations. While winners of the local reporting awards tend to be female, younger and have majored in journalism, winners of the international reporting awards are more likely to be born in a foreign country or in a cosmopolitan environment, have graduated from an Ivy League university, and work for a national or international news organization. The latter findings are consistent with the generally held image of international news reporters being an elite group in the field. Without dismissing the achievement of the Pulitzer-winning journalists, this study also suggests that the playing field of journalism is not completely level. Journalists of different backgrounds and from different organizations do not have equal chances of winning specific types of awards.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the personal differences among journalists specializing in different reporting types highlight the dynamic view of the career choice as being shaped at the intersection between the resourcefulness of individuals and the opportunities provided by the occupational structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884912455905">Hodkinson and Sparkes, 1997</xref>). On the one hand, individuals choose certain types of journalism in order to exploit and maximize his or her capital resources such as gender, social class, and educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884912455905">Douglas and Shepherd, 2002</xref>). The career choice, on the other hand, is conditioned by the social selection of the media institution, which defines the relevance of various capital resources to the performance in different areas of journalism. In other words, self-selection and institutional social selection interact to shape the likely location of individual journalists in the field.</p>
<p>Our analysis further shows that, if the international reporting winners represent an ultra-elite among the already elite group of the Pulitzer winners, it is because being born in a cosmopolitan environment and being a graduate from prestigious universities constitute initial advantages boosting their chances of joining national or international news organizations in the first place. As their careers progress, these journalists are given even greater opportunities for further achievement and rewards. By showing the career progressions of these exceptional international news reporters and how their early positions in top news organizations lead to subsequent success, our findings confirm the applicability of the logic of cumulative advantage in the field of journalism. This study, therefore, extends the original literature of cumulative advantage beyond careers in science. It suggests that differential advantages are likely to accumulate in a wider array of human institutions.</p>
<p>More importantly, our findings suggest that the stratification within the society at large is linked to the stratification within the particular field of journalism. Having an Ivy League education and being a cosmopolite not only carry a cachet and privilege in American society as a whole, but also constitute an advantage that spills over to the journalistic industry. Individuals with these ‘functionally relevant resources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912455905">Zuckerman, 1977</xref>) have better prospects of entering the prestigious field of international reporting at top news organizations. This, in turn, helps normalize the selective process and maintain the prestige system in journalism, which then further reinforces social stratification within society in general.</p>
<p>We hope this study will open a new line of inquiry in journalism studies. As discussed in the theoretical section, the concept of cumulative advantage can be examined in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455905">DiPrete and Eirich, 2006</xref>). The pathway examined in this study – from upbringing and educational background to employer characteristics to winning of international reporting awards – is only one of many possible pathways of cumulative advantage in the field. For example, foreign experiences in early adulthood, such as fighting in the Second World War or the Vietnam War or joining the Peace Corps, might also constitute an advantage for a successful career in international reporting. Moreover, the pathway identified in this study is also a ‘truncated pathway’, in that winning a Pulitzer Prize, in reality, is not the end of a career but one major step in the process of advantage accumulation. Future studies, therefore, can explore whether winning a Pulitzer Prize actually advances a career and how the logic of cumulative advantage might be manifested in other types of successful career paths in journalism. We should also note that cumulative advantage is just one mechanism in the process of social stratification within journalism, and further research can examine the ‘countervailing forces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884912455905">Merton, 1988</xref>) that may help an originally disadvantaged social group to catch up.</p>
<p>Besides the concept of cumulative advantage itself, our study may provide new insights into the production of international news in the US media. It shows that, historically, award-winning international news was produced primarily by journalists with cosmopolitan backgrounds working at cosmopolitan news organizations. On the one hand, the pathway illustrated in our analysis might be viewed as a means to ensure the quality of the international news. On the other hand, it could also be viewed negatively as a system that perpetuates narrow, elite perspectives in the reporting of international news. Although the metropolitan cities are indeed more closely and directly connected to and affected by the world at large, world affairs may also have their impact on people living in small towns or rural areas. Having more journalists from a wider range of backgrounds might help to broaden the perspectives found and issues addressed in international news.</p>
<p>Lastly, the possibility of historical specificity of the findings presented in this study should be acknowledged. Our analysis treats all 814 Pulitzer winners as a single sample and all the years between 1917 and 2010 as a single time period. The findings show that there are indeed some dominant patterns in the probabilities of winning certain types of Pulitzer awards over the past century, but further analysis could address the question of possible historical variations. More broadly, our analysis is premised on the argument that international reporting constitutes the most prestigious type of journalistic work in the USA. While our findings confirm the usefulness of the presumption, its validity may need to be probed in the light of current changes in journalistic practices, including fewer foreign correspondents and emerging new modes of international reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884912455905">Hannerz, 2007</xref>). These considerations suggest that while the logic of cumulative advantage may continue to play a role in shaping journalists’ careers and the process of social stratification within the journalistic profession, what constitutes ‘advantages’ and what constitutes preferred career paths may change over time.</p>
