<abstract>
<p>The present study examines the production outcomes of late second language (L2) learners in order to determine if the mechanisms that allow the creation of phonetic categories remains available during the lifespan, as the Speech Language Model (SLM) claims. In addition, the study focuses on the type of interaction that exists between the first language (L1) and L2 phonological subsystems. Given the participants’ proficiency level, L1 influence on the L2 is expected, while a bidirectional L1–L2 interaction is unlikely. The main tool used to examine language interaction and category development is VOT (voice onset time) production in monolingual and code-switched (CS) sentences. Participants, then, serve as their own control against which production in CS sentences is compared. The results confirm the availability of L2 phonetic category formation for late L2 learners, while different patterns of L1–L2 uni- and bidirectional interaction indicate that different places of articulation may pose various levels of difficulty in terms of ease and pace of acquisition.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>A considerable amount of phonetic and phonological research argues that the ability to perceive and create new phonetic categories<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0267658312439821">1</xref></sup> remains accessible at all times during life. This is one of the main postulates of the Speech Language Model (SLM), proposed and developed by Flege and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267658312439821">Flege, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267658312439821">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267658312439821">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267658312439821">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267658312439821">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267658312439821">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267658312439821">2003</xref>). The SLM focuses on the interaction between the first language (L1), i.e. native, phonetic system and the second language (L2) phonetic system, and how that interaction influences the attainment of accurate, native-like L2 pronunciation. A vast number of studies, however, show that the acquisition of the L1 phonological system may hinder the acquisition of L2 phonetic categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267658312439821">Flege, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0267658312439821">Guion et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658312439821">Iverson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0267658312439821">McClelland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658312439821">Pallier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658312439821">Sebastián-Gallés and Soto-Faraco, 1999</xref>). Thus, the present study investigates the development of L2 phonetic categories in adult L2 learners by examining word-initial voiceless stop production in L2 Spanish and L1 English.</p>
<p>The acquisition and further development of new phonetic categories requires the L2 learner to perceive the phonetic differences that exist between any given L1 phonetic category and the new L2 phonetic category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267658312439821">Best and Strange, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267658312439821">Flege, 1995</xref>, and subsequent). The perceptual ability to differentiate finely grained phonetic details between L1 and L2 sounds may be constrained by the time of exposure to the L2. As established in the SLM and corroborated in several studies (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658312439821">Baker and Trofimovich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267658312439821">Baker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267658312439821">Flege et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312439821">Guion, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312439821">Oh et al., 2011</xref>), the ability to create L2 phonetic categories may be inversely proportional to the time of first exposure to the L2. It is hypothesized that L1 phonetic categories become more defined with age; therefore, adult L1 phonetic categories are more likely to assimilate or attract L2 categories than children or adolescents’ L1 categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267658312439821">Best, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267658312439821">Flege, 1992</xref> and subsequent). Thus, early bilinguals and L2 learners are more likely to create new phonetic categories for all the L2 sounds than late bilinguals and L2 learners, who may create categories only for new L2 sounds that are perceptually very different from L1 sounds (but not for L2 sounds that are perceived as similar to L1 sounds). Consequently, different degrees of accuracy in L2 production are expected depending on age of L2 exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267658312439821">Fathman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267658312439821">Flege et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267658312439821">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0267658312439821">Patkowski, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0267658312439821">Tahta et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0267658312439821">Yeni-Komshian et al., 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, a significant amount of research has shown that both early and late bilinguals as well as proficient L2 learners are able to create separate phonetic categories in each of their component languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267658312439821">Flege, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658312439821">Flege and Eefting, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267658312439821">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267658312439821">Flege et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0267658312439821">Major, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658312439821">Schmidt and Flege, 1995</xref>). In fact, the Language Mode Hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312439821">Grosjean, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267658312439821">1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267658312439821">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312439821">2001</xref>) determines that bilinguals may operate in a monolingual language mode, or in a bilingual mode, which reflects some degree of flexibility in bilinguals’ and L2 learners’ production. Thus, in monolingual mode bilinguals deactivate (never fully) one language, while in bilingual mode the bilingual speaker chooses a base or matrix language, while the other language (guest or embedded language) is also active and manifests itself in code-switching (CS) and borrowings. Therefore, it is when bilinguals are in a bilingual mode with both their languages active that their linguistic systems are more likely to interact and influence each other.</p>
<p>Some of the ways in which the L1 and L2 interact are described in the SLM, which proposes two principal mechanisms that influence perception and production processes. When L2 category formation does not obtain, the SLM claims that category assimilation takes place. This mechanism operates when there is a similar phonetic category in the L1, which may cause the learner to assimilate the phonetic properties of the L2 sound to the L1 phonetic category, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267658312439821">Flege and Hillenbrand (1984)</xref>. The result is a merged L1 phonetic category that displays phonetic properties of both the L1 and L2 sounds, hence rendering pronunciation outcomes that differ from those of monolinguals in both the L1 and the L2 (akin to Grosjean’s Language Mode Hypothesis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312439821">Grosjean, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267658312439821">1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267658312439821">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312439821">2001</xref>). On the other hand, when new L2 phonetic categories have been created, the SLM argues that there is category dissimilation, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658312439821">Flege and Eefting’s (1987)</xref> results. In this case, the formation of new categories causes the phonetic properties of both the L1 and the L2 to restructure so as to keep sufficient phonetic contrast between both systems. Thus, as hypothesized first in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0267658312439821">Weinreich (1953)</xref> and later demonstrated by Flege and his associates in numerous studies, the L1 and L2 phonetic systems are in contact as subsystems of a common phonological space and may influence each other’s segmental perception and production.</p>
<p>The SLM includes the Interference Hypothesis (IH), which focuses on the interaction between the L1 and the L2 phonetic subsystems and how age of first exposure affects the L1–L2 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267658312439821">Baker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267658312439821">Flege,1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267658312439821">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0267658312439821">Flege et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0267658312439821">Walley and Flege, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0267658312439821">Yeni-Komshian et al., 2000</xref>). The IH predicts that the outcome of frequent CS results in bidirectional L1–L2 influences, as stated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0267658312439821">Yeni-Komshian et al. (2000)</xref>. Consequently, the production outcomes that result from L1–L2 interference in bilinguals differ from those of monolinguals. This has been corroborated in several studies (for both early and late bilinguals, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267658312439821">Flege, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312439821">Guion, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267658312439821">Leeuw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0267658312439821">Yeni-Komshian et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0267658312439821">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0267658312439821">Zampini and Green, 2001</xref>; for early bilinguals only, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658312439821">Baker and Trofimovich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312439821">Oh et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Code-switching, then, offers an opportunity to study L2 production and L1–L2 interaction while both languages are being accessed by the perception and production systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312439821">Grosjean, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0267658312439821">Treffers-Daller, 2009</xref>). The simultaneous L1–L2 access is key to observe the interaction of the L1 and the L2 and any possible effects of either language on the other. Thus, CS provides insights into bilinguals’ ability to manage their different linguistic production systems. At the same time, bilinguals’ CS productions may reflect small but significant changes relative to the production observed in monolingual utterances that may further illustrate the L1–L2 interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0267658312439821">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to the hypotheses and postulates just reviewed, late L2 learners (especially not fully proficient ones) may show production outcomes that differ from those of native L1 and L2 monolinguals. In addition, it is quite likely that late L2 learners have not created new phonetic categories for those L2 phones that resemble already existing L1 phones. We pursue these issues in the present study by examining word-initial voiceless stop production in monolingual Spanish and English structures and CS structures.</p>
<p>Spanish stop consonants can be divided in three different groups according to place and manner of articulation. Thus, there are bilabial, dental, and velar stops with regards to place, and, depending on manner, stops can be prevoiced (when voicing precedes the release of obstruction) or voiceless (when voicing follows the release of obstruction). A similar classification can be found in English. Stop consonants in this language can be bilabial, alveolar, or velar, and either voiced or voiceless. Even though both the Spanish and English phonological systems include voiceless stops, there is an important difference between the two languages that may cause L2 learners to experience perception and production difficulties, as will be seen shortly. The first study that investigated cross-linguistic differences among stop consonants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658312439821">Lisker and Abramson, 1964</xref>) established a three-way distinction in terms of when the glottal signal (i.e. the onset of voicing) happens relative to the time when the articulatory organs release the obstruction. This time is measured in milliseconds (ms) and it is known as voice onset time or VOT (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0267658312439821">Lisker et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0267658312439821">MacKay, 1987</xref>). As mentioned above, Spanish establishes a two-way distinction between prevoiced and voiceless consonants, while English distinguishes between voiced and voiceless. Prevoiced consonants, like Spanish /b, d, g/ are produced with voice lead (i.e. voicing starts before the release of the obstruction) and are measured with negative values. Voiced (like English /b, d, g/ and voiceless consonants (like Spanish and English /p, t, k/) are measured with positive values because the onset of voicing happens after the release of the obstruction. Since the present study focuses on the production of voiceless stops as a way to measure L2 phonetic learning and L1–L2 interaction, prevoiced and voiced stops will not be discussed any further.</p>
<p>There is an extensive body of research on English and Spanish voiceless stops (for English, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312439821">Docherty, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0267658312439821">Keating et al., 1983</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658312439821">Lisker and Abramson, 1964</xref>; for Spanish, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658312439821">Flege and Eefting, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267658312439821">Flege and Hammond, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658312439821">Lisker and Abramson, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0267658312439821">Zampini and Green, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0267658312439821">Zampini et al., 1999</xref>). The majority of studies agrees that Spanish voiceless stops can be classified as short-lag VOTs (produced within the traditional range of 0–30 ms, depending on the place of articulation, henceforth PoA) and perceived as unaspirated. English VOTs, on the other hand, have traditionally long-lag VOTs (produced within the range of 60–120 ms) and are perceived as aspirated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267658312439821">Benki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267658312439821">Cho and Ladefoged, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312439821">Docherty, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267658312439821">Flege and Eefting, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658312439821">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267658312439821">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267658312439821">Flege et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0267658312439821">Keating, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658312439821">Lisker and Abramson, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0267658312439821">Williams, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0267658312439821">Zampini and Green, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0267658312439821">Zampini et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0267658312439821">Williams (1977)</xref>, however, reports VOT values for Spanish /p/ within the range of 0–60 ms, but only a few tokens displayed values greater than 30 ms, most of the voiceless stops measured between 10 and 20 ms.

<p>The majority of VOT acquisition studies has focused on the performance of proficient bilinguals (both early and late). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267658312439821">Flege (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267658312439821">Flege and Hillenbrand (1984)</xref>, for instance, studied the production of French VOTs by English speakers. Their findings show that none of the English speakers (not even the most experienced ones) were able to produce French /t/ authentically (i.e. with a short-lag VOT like a monolingual native speaker of French). Similar results were observed for the production of English /p, t, k/ by late Spanish–English childhood sequential bilinguals in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658312439821">Flege and Eefting (1987)</xref>. The participants produced a mean VOT of 57 ms, an intermediate or ‘compromise’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0267658312439821">Williams, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0267658312439821">1980</xref>) value relative to the mean VOT for Spanish and English monolingual speakers (26 ms, and 87 ms respectively). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267658312439821">Flege (1991)</xref> conducted an experiment that focused on the production of Spanish and English /t/ in utterance-medial and absolute initial positions. The results are in accordance with previous experiments; Spanish monolinguals produced English /t/ with shorter VOT values than English monolinguals. Late L2 learners, on the other hand, produced English /t/ with compromised values (intermediate relative to the production of Spanish and English monolinguals), while early learners displayed values that were similar to the VOTs produced by English monolinguals. The results from these experiments indicate that early bilinguals and L2 learners are able to establish separate phonetic categories for the L1 and the L2 sound systems. Late L2 learners, however, tend to show compromised values observed typically in assimilated or merged phonetic categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267658312439821">Caramazza et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267658312439821">Flege, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658312439821">Flege and Eefting, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0267658312439821">Sancier and Fowler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658312439821">Schmidt and Flege, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0267658312439821">Williams, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0267658312439821">1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0267658312439821">Zampini, 1998</xref>).

<p>VOT values for voiceless stops vary in terms of PoA: the further back in the mouth the PoA and the more extended the contact area, the higher and longer the VOT values.

This has relevant implications for L2 learners; for instance, native speakers of long-lag VOT languages (like English) may experience different degrees of difficulty acquiring voiceless stops from short-lag VOT languages (like Spanish). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0267658312439821">Major (1987)</xref> studied the pronunciation of five native American English individuals who lived in Brazil for 12–35 years and found that acquiring the Portuguese short-lag /p/ was easier than acquiring /k/. Major hypothesizes that this is due to English having the shortest lag in the bilabial stop /p/, and the longest in the velar stop /k/. The same finding should extend to the acquisition of L2 Spanish VOTs.</p>
<p>This study seeks to further examine the results from previous studies, suggesting that bilinguals’ and highly proficient L2 learners’ component languages are not invariable, discrete systems. On the contrary, bilinguals and highly proficient L2 learners show flexibility in the production of not only their L2 (less dominant) language, as would be expected, but also of their native (more dominant) language (see, amongst others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267658312439821">Baker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267658312439821">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267658312439821">Flege, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267658312439821">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312439821">Grosjean, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312439821">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0267658312439821">Khattab, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0267658312439821">Toribio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0267658312439821">Weinreich, 1953</xref>). The present investigation, then, examines the production outcomes of intermediate L2 learners of Spanish. Thus, VOT values are measured in monolingual and CS sentences with the purpose of observing within-language differences that may reflect different phonetic categories for the L1 and L2 phonological subsystems. In fact, according to some of the studies reviewed earlier (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267658312439821">Flege, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0267658312439821">Zampini, 1998</xref>) it is expected that intermediate L2 learners show compromised or merged VOT values that differ from the L1 and L2 values as produced by monolingual native speakers. In addition, VOT production in monolingual vs. CS sentences is used to determine if intermediate speakers show L1–L2 bidirectional interaction.</p>
<p>If no category formation has taken place, L2 /p, t, k/ production will show no statistically significant differences between Spanish and English monolingual and bilingual sentences. If, on the other hand, new phonetic categories have been created (or are in the process of emerging), then there should be significantly different VOT values in Spanish and English. In this case, a bidirectional L1–L2 influence is hypothesized to occur. A difference among the PoAs is also expected as Spanish /p/ should be easier to acquire than /t/ or /k/. Thus, another option includes category formation for just /p/ (or /p/ and /t/) but not for /t/ or /k/ (or only /k/ if /p/ and /t/ have already been created).</p>

<title>II Design and methodology</title>
<sec id="section3-0267658312439821">
<title>1 Participants</title>
<p>The participants in this research project are 16 students in their 3rd or 4th year of college whose native language is English and who are majoring or minoring in Spanish. At the time of recruiting, the students’ ages ranged between 19–23 (mean = 21). The students averaged the onset of first time exposure to L2 Spanish at 13.1 years old (range 10–16). Crucially, all participants had the same type of L2 experience: formal classroom training 2 or 3 days per week for about 50 minutes each day. All participants had participated in a study abroad program in a Spanish speaking country that lasted between 1–4 months. All participants reported using both English and Spanish on a daily basis with friends, classmates, and faculty members who were both native and non-native speakers of Spanish. The participants’ L2 proficiency was determined following the guidelines established by The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (Henceforth ACTFL) applied to formal and informal coursework and personal interviews, and Standards-based Measurement of Proficiency (henceforth STAMP) results when available. For those cases in which ACTFL and STAMP data was available, results from both tests confirmed proficiency level within the intermediate range.</p>

<sec id="section4-0267658312439821">
<title>2 Stimuli</title>
<p>As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267658312439821">Bullock et al. (2006)</xref>, all participants were asked to read a total of 288 sentences (including target structures and fillers) that were presented on a computer screen. Within these 288 sentences, there were 36 monolingual English sentences, but only 12 of these 36 sentences were target structures (the rest were fillers). Each of these 12 target sentences contained one instance of carefully counterbalanced word-initial /p/, /t/, and /k/. Thus, each one of the 16 participants produced a total of 12 × /p/, 12 × /t/ and 12 × /k/ = 36 tokens per participant in monolingual English (likewise in Spanish). The following examples illustrate the monolingual sentences used in the experiment:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(1) a. Monolingual Spanish (<italic>n</italic> = 12)</p>
<p>    ¿<bold>/p/</bold>ara <bold>/k/</bold>ién es la <bold>/t/</bold>orta?</p>
<p>    ‘For whom is the cake?’</p>
<p>  b. Monolingual English (<italic>n</italic> = 12)</p>
<p>    Who <bold>/t/</bold>ook the <bold>/k/</bold>ap for my <bold>/p/</bold>en?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The remaining 216 sentences were bilingual structures grouped as followed: 36 target Spanish–English sentences, and 36 target English–Spanish sentences (all the target sentences were instances of grammatical CS); the rest were fillers. The target structures included 3 carefully counterbalanced voiceless stops (i.e. exactly the same number of each /p/, /t/, and /k/ was included in all of the target CS sentences).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0267658312439821">4</xref></sup> Each one of the 16 participants, then, produced 36 instances of carefully counterbalanced word-initial /p/, /t/, and /k/ respectively in Spanish and English, with a variation of the switch site (pre-switch, switch, and post-switch). This renders the following formula: (36 sentences × 3 sites × 3 PoA) × 2 languages = 648 tokens per participant in CS sentences. Some examples follow:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(2) a. Spanish → English CS</p>
<p>    Pre-switch /t/ Switch /t/ Post-switch /k/</p>
<p>    <bold>/t/</bold>odos mis amigos | <bold>/t/</bold>alked Spanish as <bold>/k/</bold>ids.</p>
<p>    ‘All my friends talked Spanish as kids.’</p>
<p>  b. English → Spanish CS</p>
<p>    Pre-switch /t/ Switch /t/ Post-switch /p/</p>
<p>    The <bold>/t/</bold>yphoon damaged |  <bold>/t/</bold>echos y <bold>/p/</bold>aredes.</p>
<p>    ‘The typhoon damaged ceilings and walls.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Crucially, all target sounds were separated by more or less the same number of syllables in each target sentence in both monolingual and bilingual Spanish and English. The experiment, then, contained 3 factors:</p>

<title>3 Procedure</title>
<p>All participants were subject to the same experimental procedures and testing conditions. All the stimuli were presented to the participants on a computer screen in randomized blocks. The recordings were conducted using a Marantz PDM 660 with a 44 Hz, 16-bit quantization, and a head-mounted Shure A10 microphone.</p>
<p>First, all the oral exchanges between participants and investigator during the introductory portion of the experiment were conducted in English only. Thus, participants were welcomed and informed about the tasks to be conducted in English to ensure the activation of a monolingual English mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312439821">Grosjean, 2001</xref>). Then, participants read the set of English sentences followed by a brief 10-minute break. After that, participants completed a language history questionnaire. In order to make sure that the L2 would be active for the next portion of the experiment, the investigator asked the questions in Spanish and participants were instructed to answer the questions using only Spanish. After the language questionnaire was completed, participants read the set of Spanish sentences. Following a brief 10-minute break, participants completed a language attitude questionnaire about CS. The investigator asked the questions switching languages, and even though participants had not been instructed to do so, most of them answered the questions mixing Spanish and English mostly in the form of borrowings. Some of them switched inter-sententially, and almost none of them switched intra-sententially.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0267658312439821">5</xref></sup> Finally, participants read the set of Spanish–English sentences followed by the set of English–Spanish sentences.</p>
<p>The measurements were analysed via Praat<sup>®</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267658312439821">Boersma and Weenink, 2006</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658312439821">Lisker and Abramson (1964)</xref>, VOT was measured as the interval between the beginning of the release burst and the onset of the glottal signal reflected in F1 in the following vowel. The analysis involved a split panel that showed a spectrogram and a waveform on separate halves of the screen. Durational measurements were conducted using a manually controlled cursor. About a 10% of the data were selected randomly and re-measured for reliability purposes; accuracy was over 95%. The statistical analysis consisted of a three-way (2 languages × 4 sites × 3 PoA) repeated-measures ANOVA.</p>

<title>III Results</title>
<p>The results from the three-way ANOVA show significant main effects for language <italic>F</italic>(50.449, 1), <italic>p</italic> = .001, site <italic>F</italic>(3.693, 3), <italic>p</italic> = .019, and PoA <italic>F</italic>(18.516, 2), <italic>p</italic> = .001. Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity has been violated for the main effects of the interactions between language and PoA <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> (2) = 6.497, <italic>p</italic> = .039, site and PoA <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> (20) = 42.799, <italic>p</italic> = .003, and language, site, and PoA <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> (20) = 34.034, <italic>p</italic> = .030. Therefore, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity as follows: language and PoA ϵ = .718, site and PoA ϵ = .543, and language, site, and PoA ϵ = .519. Regarding the interactions among the factors, the results indicate that the interaction between language and site was significant <italic>F</italic>(2.675, 3), <italic>p</italic> = .059, the interaction between language and PoA was also significant <italic>F</italic>(12.597, 2), <italic>p</italic> = .001, and so was the interaction between site and PoA <italic>F</italic>(7.357, 6), <italic>p</italic> = .001, and among language, site, and PoA <italic>F</italic>(2.898, 6), <italic>p</italic> = .044.</p>
<p>The estimates for language indicate that the mean VOT for Spanish (all PoAs combined) is 34 ms (SD = .003) and 55 ms for English (SD = .002). The pairwise comparisons for the main effects of language, corrected using a Bonferroni adjustment, indicate significant differences between the languages (all values were <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The estimates for the interaction between language, site, and PoA render the VOT values illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267658312439821">Table 2</xref> for monolingual Spanish and English. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267658312439821">Figure 1</xref>, the VOT values are consistent with previous experiments that reported a gradual increase of VOT value as the PoA moves from the front to the back of the mouth.</p>

<p>Since the results show significant differences among the PoAs, individual ANOVAs were conducted for each voiceless stop. Thus, the results from these ANOVAs reveal significant differences between the VOT values produced in each language: <italic>F</italic>(65.522, 1), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 for /p/, <italic>F</italic>(55.483, 1), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 for /t/, and <italic>F</italic>(30.590, 1), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 for /k/.

<p>The results for VOT production in bilingual sentences, illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267658312439821">Table 3</xref>, show different patterns for English and Spanish. Thus, the results of the interaction among language, site, and PoA indicate a significant main effect reflected in the differing VOT values between monolingual and bilingual sentences in each language, and also among the VOT values produced in the different bilingual sites in both Spanish and English. In addition, the duration of each VOT varies depending on the site in which it was produced in both Spanish and English, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267658312439821">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the results of the individual ANOVAs show different patterns for each voiceless stop, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267658312439821">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0267658312439821">4</xref> for Spanish and English respectively. First, regarding the bilabial voiceless stop /p/, Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity has been violated for the main effects of site in Spanish <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> (5) = 27.948, <italic>p</italic> = .001 and in English <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> (5) = 31.962, <italic>p</italic> = .001. Therefore, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity as follows: Spanish site ϵ = .485, English site ϵ = .441. The results show differences between Spanish and English; while the differences among sites was significant in Spanish <italic>F</italic>(8.846, 3), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, the main effects for sites in English was not significant <italic>F</italic>(2.852, 3), <italic>p</italic> = .096. Nevertheless, pairwise comparisons in both languages display some significant differences in some cases. In Spanish, there are significant differences between the VOT values of monolingual /p/ and /p/ produced at the pre-switch site before switching from Spanish to English (<italic>p</italic> = .034). Likewise, the VOT values of /p/ in monolingual Spanish sentences are significantly different from /p/ produced at the switch site in English–Spanish sentences (<italic>p</italic> = .046). Similarly, there are significant differences between /p/ produced at the pre-switch site in Spanish–English sentences and /p/ produced at the post-switch site in English–Spanish sentences (<italic>p</italic> = .007). Finally, the VOT values of /p/ produced at the switch site in English–Spanish sentences is significantly different from the VOT values of /p/ at the post-switch site in English–Spanish sentences also (<italic>p</italic> = .012). There are no significant differences between English monolingual /p/ and post-switch /p/ (<italic>p</italic> = 1.000), which suggests that a similar VOT value was used to produce both. Likewise, the VOT value of /p/ produced at the pre-switch site and at the switch site shows no significant differences (<italic>p</italic> = 1.000), which might be an indication that the same (or a similar) value was used in their production. English pairwise comparisons show significant differences between the VOT values of /p/ produced in monolingual sentences and the VOT value of /p/ at the pre-switch site (<italic>p</italic> = .005) in English–Spanish CS sentences. There are also significant differences between the VOT values of pre-switch /p/ and switch and post-switch /p/ respectively (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .034). The rest of the comparisons show no significant differences among the different sites (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .268).</p>

First, degrees of freedom had to be corrected using Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity because Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity has been violated for the main effects of site in Spanish, <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> (5) = 14.088, <italic>p</italic> = .015, and in English, <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> (5) = 11.928, <italic>p</italic> = .036. The degrees of freedom were corrected as follows: ϵ = .614 for Spanish, and ϵ = .633 for English. The results of the ANOVA indicate that the main effect of site was significant in Spanish, <italic>F</italic>(7.863, 3), <italic>p</italic> = .001, but not in English, <italic>F</italic>(239, 3), <italic>p</italic> = .778. The pairwise comparisons reveal significant differences among the VOT values of monolingual /t/ and some of the bilingual sites, but not all. Specifically, there are significant differences between Spanish monolingual /t/ and /t/ at the switch site in English–Spanish sentences (<italic>p</italic> = .006), and between monolingual /t/ and /t/ at the post-switch site in English–Spanish sentences also (<italic>p</italic> = .050). The rest of the comparisons showed no significant main effects (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .106). The production of English /t/, on the other hand, is stable across the board as there are no significant main effects (<italic>p</italic> = 1.000 for all).</p>
<p>Finally, the velar voiceless stop /k/ also presents some important differences with respect to the other voiceless stops both in English and in Spanish. Crucially, it is also the only voiceless stop that displays similar patters in English and Spanish. First, Mauchly’s test of sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity has been violated for the main effects of site in English, <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> (5) = 11.657, <italic>p</italic> = .040. Therefore, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity as follows: site ϵ = .655. The results of the ANOVA indicate a significant main effect of site in both languages: <italic>F</italic>(6.592, 3), <italic>p</italic> = .001 for Spanish, and <italic>F</italic>(15.141, 3), <italic>p</italic> = .001 for English. Crucially, the pairwise comparisons show significant differences between monolingual and bilingual values, which indicate a potential L1–L2 interaction. Thus, Spanish /k/ displayed different values in monolingual sentences as compared to the pre-switch site in Spanish–English sentences (<italic>p</italic> = .015); different values are also found between pre-switch and post-switch /k/ (<italic>p</italic> = .021). The comparisons among the rest of the sites rendered no significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .263). The VOT values of the English velar stop show significant differences between the production of /k/ in monolingual sentences, and all of the bilingual sites (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 for monolingual vs. pre-switch and switch/k/, and <italic>p</italic> &lt; .002 for monolingual vs. post-switch /k/). The different values found among the bilingual sites were not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .152).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0267658312439821">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>IV Discussion</title>
<p>One of the main goals of the present study is to determine if late L2 learners have created separate phonetic categories in their L2 Spanish. As discussed in the introduction, the results from a wide variety of studies suggest that the ability to create an L2 phonological subsystem with its own phonetic categories distinct from those of the L1 remains active and available during the lifespan. Nevertheless, several other experiments have shown that late L2 learners often produce compromised or merged phones in the L2 that are located in an intermediate position relative to the monolingual L1 and L2 categories.</p>
<p>The results obtained in this experiment show clear differences among the VOT values observed in the production of L2 Spanish and L1 English voiceless stops. The VOT values of L1 English voiceless stops are within the range of VOTs typical of native monolingual speakers; on the other hand, the VOT values of L2 Spanish voiceless stops are significantly shorter than those produced in English (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267658312439821">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267658312439821">2</xref>). Thus, the data lend further support to the claim that the mechanisms that enable the creation of new phonetic categories are available throughout life. In addition, when compared with their own monolingual production of English voiceless stops (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267658312439821">Table 2</xref>), late L2 learners produced compromised values for Spanish /p/ and /t/, but not for /k/. Even though the mean VOT values for Spanish /k/ were close to the traditional values reported for English, they were still within the Spanish range of 15–55 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658312439821">Lisker and Abramson, 1964</xref>). There are several factors that help explain the difference between /p/ and /t/, on the one hand, and /k/ on the other. Since /k/ is the only voiceless stop whose range overlaps in Spanish and English (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267658312439821">Table 1</xref>), it is quite possible that L2 learners reserve the overlapping area for the production of L2 Spanish /k/ until the L2 phonetic category develops more fully. As pointed out in, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267658312439821">Cho and Ladefoged (1999)</xref>, due to the size and configuration of the supraglottal cavity and the articulators involved, learners may have more difficulty controlling the production of L2 phones in the velar area than in the alveolar, dental, or bilabial areas. However, the results obtained here indicate the opposite: late L2 learners appear to produce the L2 velar voiceless stop more accurately than the bilabial or dental counterparts. Nevertheless, the fact that the Spanish and English VOT values for /k/ overlap makes it difficult to determine the exact nature of the L2 VOT value produced as a typical Spanish voiceless stop or as a merged phonetic category. Thus, there is the possibility that L2 learners are in fact producing compromised values for the three L2 voiceless stops. Finally, it is important to point out that the VOT values of L2 merged phones obtained in the present study are not located in an intermediate position relative to the monolingual values observed for such phones, as opposed to the results reported in previous experiments. On the contrary, the VOT values produced by late L2 learners are closer to the typical range of values reported for monolingual native speakers of Spanish. All in all, the results obtained here show patterns consistent with category dissimilation in which the phonetic properties of the L1 and L2 phonological subsystems are being restructured so as to keep maximal contrast between the two languages.</p>
<p>A second main focus of this study is to examine the L1–L2 interaction in participants with emerging L2 phonological systems. As discussed earlier, the results from several studies that tested early and late bilinguals show that the coexistence of the L1 and the L2 in the same phonological space is conducive to a bidirectional influence. It was hypothesized here that less fluent L2 learners might manifest only a unidirectional influence of the L1 on the L2. As expected, the results show a clear influence of the L1 on the production of the L2 phones. Nevertheless, a bidirectional L1–L2 influence as described by the IH was also observed in some cases. In addition, intermediate L2 learners’ production outcomes in CS sentences (i.e. bilingual mode) differ from monolingual production, as hypothesized also by the IH.</p>
<p>Influence of the L1 native language can be observed in the production of all three L2 voiceless stops, albeit with different patterns. The bilabial stop appears to be the L2 phone whose production more closely resembles that of highly proficient L2 learners and bilinguals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267658312439821">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>). First, the stop produced at the pre-switch site in Spanish–English sentences is significantly longer than the stop produced in monolingual sentences, which suggests L1 influence on the L2 in anticipation of the switch. The direction of the switch, however, does not appear to play a crucial role since the same L1 influence can be observed in English–Spanish sentences: the results show that the L2 bilabial stop produced at the switch site in English–Spanish sentences is also significantly longer than the stop produced in monolingual sentences. Finally, the L2 bilabial stop produced at the post-switch site (i.e. a few syllables after the switch from English to Spanish took place) is significantly shorter than the stop produced at the switch site, right when the switch from English to Spanish happened, and at the pre-switch site before switching from Spanish to English. This suggests, on the one hand, that the influence of CS on L2 production is only momentary since the same L2 VOT values produced in monolingual sentences are recovered a few syllables after the switch from English to Spanish happened. On the other hand, the recovery of the L2 values displayed in monolingual mode may also show that intermediate L2 learners are able to control the production of the finely grained articulatory differences that exist between some of the L1 and L2 phones.</p>
<p>The production of the L2 dental stop /t/ shows a different pattern of L1 influence. In this case, there are important differences between Spanish–English CS and English–Spanish CS. In fact, the results indicate a lack of L1 influence on L2 production in Spanish–English sentences since there are no significant differences between the stop produced in monolingual sentences and the stop produced at the pre-switch site in Spanish–English constructions. In English–Spanish sentences, on the other hand, the dental stop produced at the switch site is significantly longer than the L2 Spanish monolingual /t/ and the pre-switch /t/, which suggests an influence of L1 English after the switch from English to Spanish occurred. The VOT values of the L2 dental stop produced at the post-switch site, a few syllables after switching from English to Spanish, is also significantly longer than the monolingual and pre-switch stops. It appears that the influence of the L1 lasts throughout the bilingual utterance, unlike before in the case of /p/. This might indicate a lack of control over the articulatory organs as the L2 category is still forming. On the other hand, the fact that there are no significant differences among the dental VOT values produced in bilingual sentences may be consistent with the hypothesis of a bilingual mode in which learners’ production may reflect a compromised or merged phonetic value that displays characteristics of both the L1 and the L2 sounds.</p>
<p>Finally, the production of the L2 velar stop /k/ differs from the production of the L2 stops discussed above because there is no clear indication of an L1 influence on the L2. The results indicate a lack of significant differences between the velar stop produced in monolingual sentences and the velar stop produced at the switch and post-switch sites in English–Spanish sentences. In fact, the only significant difference can be found between the monolingual stop and the velar stop produced at the pre-switch site in Spanish–English sentences. The VOT values observed in the production of L2/k/ before switching to English is, in fact, significantly shorter than the values for /k/ in other sites, as if participants were enhancing the difference between English and Spanish.</p>
<p>In general, the results of the pronunciation outcomes of L2 voiceless stops in conjunction with the patterns of L1 influence observed here suggest that the point and manner of articulation may have a direct influence on the speaker’s articulatory control, as pointed out in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267658312439821">Cho and Ladefoged (1999)</xref>. In addition, the observed L1–L2 overlapping areas that some phones display should be given special attention since they might lead to erroneous assumptions or the formulation of erroneous expectations, as pointed out earlier. Finally, the various patterns of L1 influence on the production of the L2 may be a reflection of how intermediate adult L2 learners behave in a bilingual mode. All in all, there appears to be a direct correlation between PoA and the ability to control production of emerging L2 categories in a context in which both the L1 and the L2 phonological subsystems are maximally active.</p>
<p>The influence of the L2 on the L1, on the other hand, can be observed in the production of the L1 bilabial and velar stops, but not in the production of the alveolar stop, possibly due to the different place of articulation that this phone has, as it is dental, not alveolar, in Spanish. The L1 bilabial stop shows influence of the L2 in English–Spanish sentences. The results indicate that the VOT values of pre-switch /p/ are significantly shorter than the VOT values of the stop produced in monolingual English sentences. It is possible that participants, in anticipation of the switch to Spanish, prepare their articulatory apparatus to produce their less dominant language and, as a consequence, their native language shows compromised VOT values that resemble those of the L2. This is the only instance in which significantly different VOT values were found between the monolingual and bilingual production of the bilabial stop.</p>
<p>The production of the L1 alveolar stop /t/ is stable across the board. It appears that the same values are used in monolingual and bilingual sentences because there are no significant differences among the different sites. As mentioned, it is quite possible that the difference in point of articulation may play an important role in terms of L1–L2 interaction and in how intermediate adult L2 learners may behave in a bilingual mode.</p>
<p>Finally, the production outcomes of the L1 velar stop display a pattern similar to the one observed for the L2. As opposed to /p/, an influence of the L2 on L1 /k/is observed in both English–Spanish and Spanish–English sentences. The results show significantly shorter VOT values for L1 /k/ produced at the pre-switch site relative to the values observed for /k/ in monolingual sentences. As before, it is hypothesized here that the anticipation of the switch to Spanish may be causing participants to focus on the production of their less dominant language, which results in shorter L1 VOT values. In Spanish–English sentences, the VOT values of the velar stop produced when switching from Spanish to English as well as the VOT values of the stop produced at the post-switch site (a few syllables after the switch took place) are significantly shorter than those of monolingual /k/. This suggests a possible effect of the matrix language (Spanish) on the embedded or guest language (English) that lasts throughout the whole utterance. As suggested earlier, the fact that there are no significant differences among the voiceless stops produced in bilingual sentences may be the manifestation of a bilingual mode in which a bidirectional influence results in the production of compromised values of both the L1 and the L2 relative to the values observed in monolingual sentences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0267658312439821">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Various studies point out that the different PoAs should pose differing levels of difficulty for late L2 learners. The results obtained here partially confirm that hypothesis. Even though the participants in this study have developed L2 phonetic categories for all voiceless stops, the patterns of L1–L2 interaction observed may reflect different stages of development in the creation of L2 categories. For instance, the production outcomes of the bilabial stop resemble those found among highly proficient learners and bilinguals. However, the results of the dental and the velar stops might indicate a less developed L2 category that can possibly undergo further changes so as to resemble more closely the pronunciation of monolingual native speakers. In addition, the fact that the point of articulation differs in the production of Spanish and English /t/ can pose an additional difficulty that may delay its development, as suggested by the results obtained in this study.</p>
<p>In sum, the results from this study support the claim that the mechanisms responsible for the creation of new phonetic categories remain active and available during the lifespan. It also shows the emergence of L1–L2 bidirectional interactions at an intermediate level in a stage in which L2 categories are in the process of being formed. This finding is particularly important as it suggests that emerging or developing categories that are acquired relatively late in life are able to influence the L1 phonological system. Consequently, L1 restructuring may start happening while the L2 phonological system is still in its incipient stages. Finally, the different VOT values observed in the production of voiceless stops in monolingual and bilingual sentences can be partially explained in terms of different degrees of acquisition difficulty depending on the place of articulation. Thus, the present study offers crucial information on the various stages that L2 phones may go through in their development and the different factors that can affect their production outcomes.</p>

<p>As illustrated in (2), not each sentence included one instance of each place of articulation. Some sentences included two instances of /t/ (or /p/, or /k/), one at the pre-switch site and one at the switch site, for example. Careful attention was paid during the design stages so that the three places of articulation were included in each switch site in an equal number of cases.</p>

<p>A reviewer suggests that the apparent randomness observed in some of the statistical results may be caused by phrasing effects. For instance, the monolingual VOT value for Spanish /p/ is significantly different from the VOT value of /p/ produced in bilinguals Spanish–English sentences before the switch to English occurs. On the other hand, the monolingual VOT value for Spanish /t/ does not differ from the VOT value of /t/ produced before switching to English in Spanish–English sentences. Thus, following the reviewer’s advice, further statistical testing was conducted with the data rearranged in the following manner: pre-switch voiceless stops were compared exclusively with monolingual stops extracted from the beginning of the sentence, switch stops were compared with monolingual stops extracted from the middle of the sentence, and post-switch stops were compared with monolingual stops extracted toward the end of the sentence. This additional testing renders the same results as those obtained in the main analysis, hence disproving any effects of phrasing in this case.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0267658312439821">
<label>7.</label>
<p>One reviewer points out that phrasing and prosodic strengthening may cause the VOT differences among switch sites in CS sentences. In fact, it has been shown in various studies focusing on different languages that consonant duration tends to increase in stressed syllables and at the beginning of large prosodic units (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267658312439821">Cho and MacQueen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267658312439821">Fougeron, 1999</xref>, and references cited therein). Taking into account that the beginning of a switch in a bilingual sentence could be taken as the beginning of a large prosodic unit, this would imply that the VOT values of a voiceless stop produced at the switch site should be significantly longer than the VOT values of voiceless stops produced at the post-switch site. This, however, does not seem to be the case here because there are instances in which the VOT values of voiceless stops produced at the post-switch site are significantly longer than those produced at the switch site (e.g. Spanish or English velar stop). Additional statistical testing confirms the lack of effect of phrasing and/or prosodic strengthening, as pointed out in note 6.</p>
