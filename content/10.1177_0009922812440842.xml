<p>Chest pain is a relatively frequent complaint in pediatrics, accounting for 6 in every 1000 emergency department (ED) or clinic visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812440842">1</xref></sup> Among 2071 cardiology consultations in a tertiary care pediatric hospital over a 12-month period, chest pain accounted for 5.2% of consultations, 13% of all ED evaluations, and 19% of ED consultations for new patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812440842">2</xref></sup> Chest pain is a symptom that can cause significant distress and have life-altering effects: approximately 50% of children with chest pain report they have missed school because of this complaint, and 69% of adolescents with chest pain had restricted their own activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812440842">3</xref></sup> Whereas chest pain has ominous connotations in adults, in children it is usually benign. From the literature, the proportion of chest pain attributable to a cardiac etiology is consistently low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812440842">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812440842"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812440842">6</xref></sup> In a recent review of all 406 patients evaluated for chest pain in a pediatric cardiology clinic over a 1-year period, only 1.2% were found to have a cardiac etiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812440842">7</xref></sup> The authors of this study suggest that exercise testing should be eliminated as part of the evaluation of chest pain in children.</p>
<p>Although children and adolescents with chest pain are frequently referred to pediatric cardiologists, there is as yet no standard protocol for evaluation. The specific etiologies to exclude via cardiac evaluation are previously undiagnosed structural abnormalities associated with ischemic pain, acquired myopericardial or coronary disease, and arryhthmias with palpitations and/or tachycardia described as pain by the child. Among children found to have significant coronary abnormalities, a history of exertional chest pain has been reported as an important identifying feature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812440842">8</xref></sup> A history of exertional chest pain or exercise-associated symptoms such as palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope often leads to evaluation with exercise testing. Given the potential underlying cardiac conditions, the yield of positive diagnostic results might be expected to be higher in this group of patients but previous reports suggest that this is not the case. To evaluate this further, we reviewed the results of exercise testing in a consecutive series of children referred for evaluation of chest pain to a pediatric cardiology clinic.</p>
<sec id="section1-0009922812440842" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>After institutional review board approval, we conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients 6 to 18 years old seen in the outpatient cardiology clinics between January 1, 2003 and July 31, 2007 in the Children’s National Medical Center system with the chief complaint of chest pain who received an exercise stress test as part of their evaluation. Subjects were identified by searching for the ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) code for “Chest Pain” in the cardiology billing database and cross-indexing this list with the exercise lab log. Patients were excluded from review if they were found to have hemodynamically significant heart disease or an inadequate effort on exercise testing defined as maximal heart rate &lt;90% of predicted maximum for age/sex or RQ (respiratory quotient) &lt; 1.1.</p>
<p>The investigators reviewed the patient’s electronic patient record from the initial visit and for associated results. The following information was collected from all patients:</p>

<title>Exercise Test Procedure</title>
<p>Treadmill exercise testing was performed according to the standard Bruce protocol with automatic increase in speed and grade at 3-minute intervals. Baseline vital signs, height (Perspective Enterprises, Portage, MI), weight (Scale-Tronix, Carol Stream, IL), body mass index, and body surface area were recorded. Blood pressure was monitored throughout exercise and recovery. Standard electrocardiography was performed at baseline with leads II, V<sub>5</sub>, and AVF monitored continuously throughout exercise and recovery with a General Electric Case Stress Test (GE Healthcare Worldwide,Waukesha,WI) system.</p>
<p>Pulmonary function testing (PFT), spirometry, and metabolic measurements (Medgraphics Pulmonary Exercise System CPX/D; Medical Graphics Corporation, St. Paul, MN) were performed if requested by the cardiologist ordering the exercise test. On spirometry, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and maximal midexpiratory flow (FEF<sub>25-75</sub>) were recorded. Metabolic measurements were obtained in the mixing chamber mode with an appropriately sized, low dead space, minimal-resistance facemask. Measurements included inspired/expired gas concentrations and expired flow rate with calculation of ventilatory equivalent, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and respiratory quotient (RQ [RER] respiratory exchange ratio = carbon dioxide output [VCO2]/oxygen uptake [VO2]). The patient’s anthropometric measurements were used to determine predicted values for exercise endurance time and maximum heart rate for age and sex.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 118 unique patients met eligibility criteria for review. Mean age was 13.3 years with a range of 6 to 18 years; 64% were male. Descriptive chest pain findings by history on all subjects are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812440842">Table 1</xref>. Eighty-eight percent of subjects (104/118) complained of exertional chest pain, and 8% (10/118) reported an episode of syncope with chest pain. A total of 20% of patients (24/118) reported the sensation of palpitations with chest pain.</p>

<p>All patients received a 12-lead electrocardiogram during their initial evaluation. One patient had a significantly prolonged QT interval and is now under the care of an electrophysiologist on beta-blocker therapy. One patient had electrocardiography (ECG) findings suggestive of Wolff Parkinson White, with QRS normalization during exercise and no manifest tachyarrhythmia. Ninety-six percent of patients (113/118) had echocardiograms performed as part of their initial evaluation, and 102/113 (90%) echocardiograms were interpreted as normal. Eleven had minor, hemodynamically insignificant abnormalities identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812440842">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>All subjects completed exercise testing with a normal heart rate and blood pressure response. Twenty-five percent of patients (30/118) experienced chest pain during the exercise test; in 28, the ECG remained normal. In 2 of these patients, the ECG had ST-T wave changes suggestive of ischemia, whereas a third patient had ST-T changes without chest pain. In 115 subjects, electrocardiograms were normal throughout. Of the 3 patients (2.5%) who exhibited electrocardiographic ST segment changes suggestive of ischemia during treadmill testing, all were adolescents, 13 to 15 years old. All had normal baseline electrocardiograms and echo/Doppler studies. Each underwent subsequent myocardial perfusion imaging with normal results. None had subsequent evidence of ischemic cardiac pathology, and exercise ECG results were ultimately considered to be false positives.</p>
<p>Seventy-eight of 118 patients successfully completed PFT as part of the exercise test. Of these, 28% (22/78) were abnormal, indicating reactive airway disease and/or exercise-induced asthma as defined by a baseline resting FEV<sub>1</sub> or FEF<sub>25-75</sub> ≤ 80% of predicted, or a reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub> and/or FEF<sub>25-75</sub> after exercise testing by ≥12% to 15%. Seventeen patients had abnormal PFTs at baseline, 7 patients had an abnormal decrease in PFTs postexercise, and 2 patients had both pre- and postexercise PFT abnormalities. Seventeen of 22 patients (77%) had no previous history of reactive airway disease or asthma. All patients with abnormal PFTs had a normal cardiac response on exercise testing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of this study support the reports of others that most children with chest pain who undergo exercise testing will have a normal cardiac result. In this consecutive series, no patient was found to have any evidence of cardiac pathology. Eighty-eight percent of the group had reported exertional chest pain and 28% reported associated palpitations or syncope. Although these historical features have been traditionally considered symptoms concerning for cardiac pathology, our evaluation did not demonstrate this.</p>
<p>The results may be interpreted as suggesting that exercise testing has minimal utility in the work-up of pediatric chest pain. However, in nearly 30% of children who completed exercise PFT, results were abnormal, indicative of reactive airway disease or exercise-induced asthma. Reactive airway disease has a well-established association with chest pain complaints in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812440842">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812440842">10</xref></sup> In concert with these reports, our findings suggest that PFT should be obtained routinely when exercise testing is performed for the evaluation of chest pain. The majority of the children in this series with positive PFT had no previous history of reactive airway disease and could potentially benefit from bronchodilator therapy if results are confirmed on full pulmonary function evaluation. In almost a third of our patients, episodes of chest pain had been present for more than 6 months. The exercise PFT results suggest that PFT should particularly be considered as part of the initial evaluation of children with chronic, recurrent chest pain.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study include its retrospective design and relatively small sample size. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that routine PFT as part of exercise evaluation in this setting is a valuable addition. They raise the possibility that PFT rather than cardiology referral should be considered as initial evaluation in children with chronic chest pain. A prospective study with a larger sample size is necessary to confirm these findings.</p>
