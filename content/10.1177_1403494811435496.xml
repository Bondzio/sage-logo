<p><italic>Background</italic>: Prevention of unintended pregnancies is a public health objective; however, the profiles of male partners of women who choose to abort are relatively unexplored. <italic>Objective</italic>: To investigate risk factors among men who have repeated experience of being the partner of a woman electing an induced abortion. <italic>Methods</italic>: A questionnaire was used to collect information from 590 men recruited through their pregnant partner who applied for an abortion in Sweden during 2009.

Univariate analysis indicated these men were older, had a lower educational level and less emotional support, and were more often tobacco users than men for whom it was the first experience of a partner choosing to abort. Independent risk factors were being a victim of physical, psychological, or sexual violence or abuse over the past year (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.36–5.08), unemployment or sick leave (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.57–4.25), and having children (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.22–3.28).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sweden has the highest abortion rate among the Nordic countries and approximately 50% of all Swedish women go through at least one induced abortion during their lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435496">1</xref>]. In 2009, 39% of all women having an induced abortion had a history of at least one previous abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435496">1</xref>]. No data is collected on the men who are partners of women who choose an induced abortion, although the Swedish overarching public health objective states health care should be provided on equal terms regardless of gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435496">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Liberal laws in societies allowing legal and safe abortions have reduced maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435496">3</xref>]. In Sweden, free abortion is an integral female human right and not debated. Yet, there are still individual, cultural, and ethical concerns within society about abortions as a solution to a problematic situation, due to the inviolability of life.</p>
<p>Repeat abortions are commonly considered problematic for several reasons. Most women express a wish for avoiding abortions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435496">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435496">5</xref>], and reducing the abortion rate could reallocate human and economic resources to other priority areas within obstetrics and gynaecological care. Research among women requesting abortions suggests a correlation between repeat abortion and socioeconomic gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435496">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435496">7</xref>]; thus, women who have repeated abortions may be socioeconomically disadvantaged and in need of specialised or tailored information and services to help them avoid subsequent unintended pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435496">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435496">9</xref>]. However, some level of repeat abortion is unavoidable, as fecund, sexually active women, even those who use effective methods of contraception, may experience multiple unintended pregnancies and choose not to carry them to term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435496">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Conception cannot occur without semen from a man; consequently, there is potential for men to share the responsibility with their female partners for preventing unintended pregnancies. However, there is limited research focusing on men in relation to unintended pregnancies, especially those who repeatedly experience their female partner unintentionally becoming pregnant and electing to abort. A Swedish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435496">10</xref>] indicates 18-year-old men whose partner experiences an unintended pregnancy have more risk-taking lifestyles than similar-aged men without a history of unintended pregnancy in a female partner. Among this group, there is more tobacco use, a greater extent of sexually transmitted infections than in peers without a history of unintended pregnancy, and more reported use of anabolic steroids and experience of sexual abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435496">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate risk factors among men who have repeated experience of being the partner of a woman electing an induced abortion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494811435496" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A cross-sectional survey among Swedish men, whose female partner had an unintended pregnancy that resulted in an induced abortion, was conducted. The men were contacted through their pregnant partner who requested an abortion during the period January–August 2009 in one of 13 clinics in Sweden, and represented both rural and urban areas from the middle part of Sweden, which covers about a third of the area of the country.</p>
<p>Questionnaire packages (<italic>n</italic>=1580) were consecutively distributed to Swedish-speaking women. Half of the women (<italic>n</italic>=798) returned their questionnaire and 590 questionnaires were received from men who had been invited to participate by their partner. The results from the women’s study will be reported elsewhere, but the female participants were mainly Scandinavian in origin (7% were born outside Scandinavia and 12% had one or both parents born outside Scandinavia). The internal non-response rate was generally low and varied between 0 and 4% for different questions.</p>
<p>A questionnaire with 37 multiple-choice and two open-ended questions was used for the men. The majority of the questions were study specific and constructed specifically for this survey in collaboration with experts and with abortion-seeking women to strengthen the validity. A pilot test was conducted in two clinics to validate the questions and to test the procedure. The final questionnaire was then revised and some questions with a low response rate were removed. The questionnaire included:</p>
<list id="list1-1403494811435496" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>eleven background questions, including age, residence, country of birth (Sweden, another Scandinavian country, Europe, or outside of Europe), parents’ country of birth (Sweden, another Scandinavian country, Europe, or outside of Europe), education level, occupation, relationship with the pregnant woman, children, and involvement in previous induced abortions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>seven questions about lifestyle, including smoking or/and use of oral tobacco, physical, psychological, or sexual violence or abuse over the past 12 months, mental wellbeing before the pregnancy and after the abortion (5-point Likert scale from “fully disagree” to “fully agree”), and emotional support;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>nineteen questions about the respondents’ participation in the abortion decision process and about their experience of care related to the abortion (5-point Likert scale from “fully disagree” to “fully agree”) (this data will be presented elsewhere).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>two open-ended questions concerning whether any societal action or support could have prevented the current abortion and an option for the respondents to give free comments.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The respondents were invited to participate in the study through the pregnant women. When the women attended a medical appointment and examination, oral and written information about the study was provided, including that it was voluntary and anonymous to participate. The only exclusion criterion was if the women were unable to understand Swedish. The women were also asked to provide a similar questionnaire to the man who was involved in the unintended pregnancy. Two pre-stamped envelopes were provided to enable both men and women to return their questionnaires separately within 4 weeks after the abortion.</p>
<p>To determine differences between men involved in repeat abortions and those involved in their first abortion, cross tabulations were used (Pearson’s Chi-squared tests) to analyse the quantitative variables. The significance level was set at &lt;0.05.</p>
<p>The risk factors associated with the dependant variable repeat abortion were assessed with a binary logistic regression model: the associations are presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). As explanatory variables, the independent variables (age group, children, occupation, education, and violence or abuse over the past year) with a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05 from the univariate analysis were included. For all analyses, Predictive Analytics Soft Ware statistics 18.0 was used. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435496">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The open-ended questions were analysed by content analysis, as described by Graneheim and Lundman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811435496">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Regional Medical Ethics Committee in Uppsala, Sweden.</p>

<p>The background characteristics of the male partners of the women who requested an induced abortion are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494811435496">Table II</xref>. Median age was 28 years (range 16–63 years). The majority of men were born in Scandinavia, representing 88% (<italic>n</italic>=522) of all responders. For repeated experience of abortion, no differences between men born in or outside of Scandinavia, or between those with parents born in or outside of Scandinavia, were identified. About 90% of the men lived in a stable relationship with the pregnant women. The proportion of men with children was higher among men with previous experience of their female partner electing to abort (56%) than for men with first-time experience of their female partner electing to abort (38%). Men with repeated experience of abortion in a female partner had lower educational level and were more frequently unemployed or on sick leave than those without previous experience of abortion in a female partner. Furthermore, more men with previous abortion experience were tobacco users (57%) than men with no previous experience of their female partner electing to abort (47%).</p>

<p>Fewer men with previous experience of a female partner electing to abort (12%) had someone close with whom they could share their innermost thoughts and feelings than men with first-time experience (22%). Over the previous 12 months, 12% of men with previous experience of being the male partner of a woman who elected to abort had been a victim of physical, psychological, or sexual violence or abuse, compared to 6% of men without previous abortion experience. Physical violence dominated over psychological or sexual violence or abuse. Mental wellbeing before the woman became pregnant was “good” or “very good”, on a five-point scale for 78% of respondents. Regardless of the estimated mental wellbeing before the pregnancy, 27% of the respondents had lower mental wellbeing after the abortion.</p>

<title>Factors associated with previous experience of being the male partner of a woman requesting an induced abortion</title>
<p>No correlation between “parents’ country of birth” and previous experience of abortion were found; therefore, the variable was not used in the binary logistic regression model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494811435496">Table III</xref>). High correlations (&gt;0.7) were found between tobacco use and low education, and between emotional support and low education. To reduce the risk of multicollinearity making the final models unstable, tobacco use and emotional support were not included as independent variables. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494811435496">Table III</xref> indicated that some risk factors were associated with repeated experience of being the male partner of a woman who elected to abort. The risk factors were being a victim of physical, psychological, and/or sexual violence or abuse over the past 12 months (OR 2.62), being unemployed or on sick-leave (OR 2.58), already having children (OR 2.0), and being older than 19 years (OR from 2.67 to 3.72 for different age ranges). Low educational level did not reach statistical significance in the model (<italic>p</italic>=0.05).</p>

<title>Preventive actions</title>
<p>One open-ended question investigated whether the men considered structural actions within society could have prevented the abortion. Two themes, “preventing unintended pregnancies” and “factors that would have enabled them to proceed with the pregnancy” were identified. In the first theme, “preventing unintended pregnancies”, the respondents suggested increased access to high-quality contraception counselling and contraception, including condoms, female sterilisation, and vasectomy. The respondents also proposed increased and/or qualitative sex and relationship education in school. The second theme, “factors that would have enabled them to proceed with the pregnancy”, suggested increased work opportunities and economic support for parents with children were factors that would have enabled them to proceed with the pregnancy instead of having an abortion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Thirty-two per cent of the men in this study had previous experience of being the male partner of a woman who elected to abort. This suggests men, whose partner becomes unintentionally pregnancy and chooses to abort, run the risk for subsequent experience of unintended pregnancies and abortions in their female partners: this has also been determined for women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811435496">13</xref>]. Furthermore, differences between men with first-time experience of their female partner requesting an abortion and those with previous experience of abortion in their female partner could be identified in several background variables. A higher proportion of men with previous experience of their female partner requesting an abortion were smokers than men with first-time experience: similar results among women have been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435496">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435496">9</xref>]. Unemployment and sick leave were overrepresented among men with previous experience of a partner’s abortion, compared to men without such experience. In Sweden 2009, the proportion of unemployment in men (20–64 years) was 8% and about 5% were outside the labour market due to sickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494811435496">14</xref>].</p>
<p>This study had limitations. The sample was not randomised and the design did not include a control group of men without experience of being the male partner of a woman who elected an abortion; therefore, the results cannot be generalised to the general population. The response rate could not be determined as it is unknown how many women actually gave the questionnaire to their male partners. The majority of the men responding in this study (90%) lived in an ongoing relationship, and women in a stable relationship were more likely to deliver the questionnaire to their partner than women without a stable relationship. Also, the bias introduced because men with previous experience of being the partner of a woman who chose an abortion might be more willing to participate in the study, or unwilling as they viewed the experience of repeat of abortion as a personal failure, cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>There was no difference in experience of repeat abortion between men who were born outside Scandinavia and those born in Scandinavia, as has been found in previous studies among women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435496">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435496">7</xref>], but this result should be interpreted with caution. Due to limited resources and procedural challenges, only women understanding Swedish were asked to participate, which resulted in a high proportion of Scandinavian-born men (88%) in the study. In 2009, 18% of men and 19% of women aged 20–64 years living in Sweden were born outside of Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494811435496">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Even though there was a higher proportion of tobacco users among men with previous experience of a female partner choosing to abort (57%) than among those without this experience (47%), tobacco use was high in both groups. This contrasted to results from an annual population survey among Swedish men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811435496">16</xref>], where tobacco use was 29% in the 16–29 age range and 28% in the 30–44 age range. Earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435496">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435496">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494811435496">17</xref>] confirm an association between unemployment and low educational levels with tobacco use, low emotional support, mental disorder, and violence exposure. Socioeconomic circumstances such as unemployment or sick leave and being a victim of violence or abuse over the past 12 months increased the risk of repeat experience of an induced abortion in a female partner. Some men who experience being the male partner of a woman choosing an abortion will probably go through the same experience in the future, which implies that group differences were slightly underestimated. Age was not considered as a true risk factor; as the older a man was, there were more years to experience all kinds of reproductive health problems. However, the highest OR associated with previous experience of abortion was in the age range 25–29 (OR 3.72, 95% CI 1.59–8.71).</p>
<p>In the open-ended question, the respondents reported that social action in the society, such as more work opportunities and economic support, might have prevented the abortion and enabled the couple to proceed with the pregnancy. A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435496">5</xref>] among Swedish women requesting abortion confirms socioeconomic factors are reasons for choosing an abortion. Occupation appears crucial for mental wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811435496">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435496">18</xref>]. In this study, a higher proportion of men who were unemployed and on sick leave reported “bad” or “very bad” mental wellbeing, both before the pregnancy and after the abortion, than those who were employed or students. Thus, reducing the number of abortions could be a question of labour policy. An increase in youth unemployment is likely to worsen health inequalities; therefore, getting people into employment is an important strategy for improving health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435496">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435496">18</xref>]. If unemployment in men is a reason for women to choose an abortion instead of continuing the pregnancy, as was implied by the men in the current study, more job opportunities might be one way of reducing the number of abortions.</p>
<p>Holmberg and Berg-Kelly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435496">10</xref>] conclude men are largely ignored in issues related to unintended pregnancies and abortions. Current preventive work in Sweden, such as subsidised hormonal contraceptives, emergency contraceptive pills over the counter, and contraceptive counselling in women-friendly health clinics and youth health clinics mainly targets women. These efforts appear insufficient and may convey the message fertility regulation is a woman’s issue. Men are marginalised in preventive work and there is little focus on men’s needs and responsibilities in relation to unintended pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435496">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435496">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435496">21</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The independent risk factors associated with repeated experience of being the male partner of a woman who elects to abort were victim of violence or abuse, unemployment or sick leave, and having children. These results present a picture of vulnerability among this group of men, which should be recognised in public health work aimed at preventing unintended pregnancies. Increased work opportunities might be an important intervention to reduce the number of abortions.</p>
