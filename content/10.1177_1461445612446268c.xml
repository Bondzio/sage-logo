<p>From 2007 to 2008, I was involved in a research project that analysed the discourse of sexual and reproductive health consultations. A striking feature of these consultations was the doctors’ intention to ensure clients were informed and active partners in any decisions made about procedures or treatment. This intention was strategically supported by questioning that explored what clients already knew, enabled them to tell their stories and moved between common sense and technical knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612446268">Slade et al., 2009</xref>). This experience, and many years teaching professional immigrants in workplaces, sparked an interest to read <italic>Why Do You Ask? The Function of Questions in Institutional Discourse</italic>.</p>
<p>The book claims to be the first to make questions in institutional settings explicit and it certainly provides rich analyses in its 15 chapters, exploring questions in a range of discourse settings such as medicine, education, the law, workplace meetings and the mass media, which have received analytical attention in the past. However, some chapters venture into new, less analysed territory to look at questions in call-centre interactions, counselling sessions and on a helpline.</p>
<p>In the first chapter, Ehrlich and Freed define questions, from the work of the contributors, as utterances that ‘solicit (and/or are treated by the recipient as soliciting) information, confirmation or action’ (Hultgren and Cameron, p. 328) and that ‘are delivered in such a way as to create a slot for the recipient to produce a responsive turn’ (Ford, p. 214). The subsequent chapters are not grouped according to institutional setting and, while all the chapters contribute to our understanding of the role of questions in different institutional settings, I will focus on some related chapters, particularly those concerned with law and order, counselling contexts and the <italic>new</italic> workplaces. I found the analyses in these chapters especially interesting as they investigate generally unexplored contexts and provide new insights into the nature and purpose of questions and the roles adopted by interactants through questions and answers, insights that could be carried into research into other institutional and non-institutional discourse.</p>
<p>Two chapters examine questioning in law and order contexts. In Chapter 2, Sidnell analyses questions in Canadian public inquiry testimonies and is particularly interested in those utterances that occur in third position following a question–answer sequence. Because there is a ‘certain ambiguity to such positioning’ (p. 39), these utterances are frequently objected to on the grounds that they are comment or assertion. Chapter 6 leads off with the intriguing title, ‘Asking Ostensibly Silly Questions in Police-Suspect Interrogations’, and Stokoe and Edwards examine questions that occur after the suspect has admitted to the offence and towards the end of the interrogation, and appear to function to have the answer repeated ‘for the record’ (p. 127).</p>
<p>In Chapter 7, Speer bridges the medical and counselling spheres through the investigation of hypothetical questions in psychiatric assessments of transsexual patients seeking surgery. These hypothetical questions present negative scenarios and are used to test commitment to treatment by forcing ‘patients to consider in an explicit way what they are prepared to sacrifice, what they will settle for and what they will risk’ (p. 153).</p>
<p>Hepburn and Potter (Chapter 4) analyse some uses of tag questions in another highly complex and fraught counselling context – a child-protection helpline in the UK. In this environment callers ‘are often reporting disturbing worries about friends, relatives or neighbours’ and ‘the nature and severity of what is reported’ (p. 69) varies. The chapter is entitled ‘Interrogating Tears’, and the authors see the use of tag questions by child protection officers as a way of building affiliation when callers are showing extreme distress (p. 83), as they have ‘a weak response requirement’ which does not make the ‘caller’s failure to participate a strongly accountable matter’ (p. 71).</p>
<p>The final two chapters in the book take us into two types of call centres. Freed (Chapter 14) analyses company-initiated telemarketing calls from a telecommunications company. She sees this analysis as ‘expanding our understanding of institutional discourses’ because it reveals divergent use of questions and answers and the ‘unanticipated presence . . . of personal talk’ (p. 297). Unexpectedly, she found herself developing ‘a degree of admiration for the telephone company representatives, their patience and the consideration that they regularly displayed towards their customers’ (p. 316). Hultgren and Cameron (Chapter 15) focus on incoming calls to a telephone service centre and find that the ‘unusually highly regimented’ call centre regime standardizes the way the human service providers can interact with customers (p. 322). Although interactions are commenced with the question, ‘How may I help you?’, the call centre regime places restrictions on what the customer services personnel can actually do, and the questions which are meant to serve the dual purposes of efficiency and customer care can lead to conflicting priorities between the interactants.</p>
<p>Questioning is ‘a pattern of behaviour’ (Sidnell, p. 20) which makes interaction possible and in the act of questioning the speaker assigns a role to the listener (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612446268">Halliday, 1994</xref>). This volume provides very valuable insights into the roles which questioning enables speakers and listeners to adopt within a broad range of institutional discourse. It contributes significantly to our understanding of how questioning occurs and how interactants can and do use questions for their own ends or to achieve institutional goals. This book, through close analyses of institutional interactions, helps us to broaden our understanding of the ‘almost ineffable, indefinable character’ (Sidnell, p. 20) of questioning and is essential reading for workplace teachers, researchers and indeed employees seeking to understand their institutional workplace.</p>
