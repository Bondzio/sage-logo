<abstract>
<p>Untreated maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) leads to encephalopathy in neonates and causes abnormalities on the electroencephalogram (EEG). A case is presented of MSUD with unique features consisting of a comb-like rhythm before the therapy and its disappearance with therapy is presented. This case illustrates the potential use of the EEG in the identification of this specific cause of a neonatal encephalopathy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>MSUD was first described by Menkes et al in 1954.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059411429521">1</xref></sup> It is a disorder of branched-chain keto acid metabolism that results in elevated plasma concentrations of the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine and allo-isoleucine. It is characterized phenotypically by a strong maple syrup odor in the urine, which is often a diagnostic sign before biochemical confirmation. In untreated neonates, an elevated leucine level leads to a progressive neonatal encephalopathy that develops within the first several days of life. The presenting symptoms are nonspecific, including lethargy, vomiting, posturing, and seizures. If untreated, the clinical state progresses to coma and central respiratory failure by 7 to 10 days of age. Therefore, early diagnosis and early therapy are crucial in preventing long-term neurologic morbidity.</p>
<p>An early clinical diagnosis may be difficult due to the nonspecific symptoms and, even when suspected clinically, the results of screening and confirmatory laboratory testing may not be immediately available. Although an EEG is part of the standard evaluation of a newborn with seizures, in general, it rarely reveals a specific diagnostic pattern. However, MSUD has historically been associated with the characteristic EEG finding of a 7- to 10-Hz rolandic comb-like rhythm. This was first described by Trottier et al in 1975 and later confirmed by several other investigators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059411429521">2</xref></sup> This finding is typically seen in patients less than 2 months old with modestly elevated BCAAs, which according to several investigators are highly specific for MSUD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059411429521">3</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>We report a newborn with this classic EEG pattern for MSUD in whom a repeat EEG after 9 days of hemodialysis and dietary therapy demonstrated an improvement. This case demonstrates the important role that EEG may play in the early diagnosis of MSUD.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>This 6 pound, 11 ounce Hispanic male baby was born by vaginal delivery following an uncomplicated term pregnancy. There were no immediate complications and he was discharged on the second day of life. On day 6, he exhibited periods of inconsolable crying with opisthotonic posturing. He was evaluated by the primary care practicioner (PCP), and the formula was changed to “help with digestion.” Due to worsening irritability and lethargy, he returned to the PCP on day 8 of life and his first newborn screen was reported as abnormal for leucine and isoleucine. He was therefore transported to Texas Children’s Hospital for further evaluation. The newborn screen leucine value was 739 umol/L (cutoff 362 umol/L) and valine was 317 umol/L (cutoff 311 umol/L). Initial evaluation in the emergency department revealed a lethargic, hypotonic, and hypothermic neonate with hypotension and a blood sugar of 23 mg/dL, which required treatment with a dextrose and normal saline bolus followed by initiation of a 10% dextrose infusion. The patient was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A 3-generation pedigree revealed that the patient was born to nonconsanguineous parents with no family history of mental retardation, seizures, metabolic disorders, or known congenital anomalies.</p>
<p>The neurologic examination revealed a lethargic infant with a weak, high-pitched cry, opisthotonic posturing, and intermittent bicycling movements of the lower extremities. Cranial nerve examination was normal except for a poor suck reflex. The infant had little spontaneous motor activity at rest, marked hypotonia, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. Dietary therapy with Ketonex-1 was initiated, and he subsequently underwent continuous venovenous hemofiltration with normalization of the plasma leucine within 24 hours and significant clinical improvement observed 14 days following the onset of therapy (day 22 of life).</p>
<p>Two EEGs were obtained during this hospitalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1550059411429521">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059411429521">2</xref>). One was recorded before the initiation of dietary therapy and hemodialysis (on day 8 of life), and the subsequent EEG was 9 days after the onset of therapy (on day 17 of life). Although, both EEGs were abnormal, there was a significant difference. In the first, the background was abnormal with faster background rhythms, as well as multifocal epileptiform activity, particularly in the temporal regions. A central theta rhythm was the unique feature of the first EEG. This activity occurred in 2- to 4-second bursts with occasional runs lasting up to 8 seconds. This activity consisted of a monophasic negative waveform, resembling the mu rhythm of older children and adults and occasionally with spindle morphology. In the initial tracing (day 8 of life), the bursts had maximal voltage in the bilateral frontocentral regions. There was virtually continuous 5 to 7 Hz activity in the central and central–parasagittal regions, with bursts of the comb-like rhythm superimposed on the more continuous theta activity. The activity was present in all stages of sleep and during wakefulness. During slow-wave quiet sleep (QS), nonrapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, the bursts recurred every 6 to 8 seconds and were almost continuous with a waxing and waning amplitude. The intervening background activity in the central regions consisted of a lower amplitude theta that had an identical voltage field as the bursts but lacked the monophasic morphology. Well-developed bursts lasted 1 to 4 seconds, the longest occurring during the trace alternant portion of QS. The theta rhythm in the high-voltage bursts occasionally started at 5 Hz and then was admixed with 7 Hz activity leading to various harmonic patterns. Rarely, independent theta bursts occurred at the C4 electrode and during an arousal, in the right temporal–occipital area. Nine days after hemofiltration and dietary therapy, the spindle bursts were rarely present. The child was last seen at 19 months of age and was doing well clinically with normal muscle strength and reflexes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>EEG may play an important role in the diagnosis of some inborn errors of metabolism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059411429521">4</xref>
</sup> Fast rolandic rhythms have been described as occurring infrequently in other neonatal metabolic disorders, including methylmalonic aciduria, isovaleric aciduria, and hyperleucinosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059411429521">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Trottier et al described bursts of 7 to 9 Hz spindle-like sharp waves of moderate amplitude in the central region of 4 patients with MSUD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059411429521">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059411429521">6</xref>
</sup> They termed this unique activity a “comb-like rhythm” because of the relatively monophasic waveform morphology which resembled the mu rhythm of older children and adults. The pattern disappeared by 5 to 6 weeks of age following dietary therapy. Subsequent reports of this rhythm have emphasized its tendency to occur during the first month of life, in bursts often reaching 150 mV, lasting several seconds in duration; this rhythm can occur when awake and asleep.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059411429521">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059411429521">7</xref>
</sup> Similar findings were subsequently described by Clow et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059411429521">5</xref>
</sup> and Tharp.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059411429521">8</xref>
</sup> Korein et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059411429521">3</xref>
</sup> described EEG patterns ranging from normal to abnormal, with spikes, polyspikes, spike–wave complexes, triphasic waves, severe slowing, and bursts of periodic suppression in patients with MSUD. Korein et al also described rolandic sharp waves (comb-like rhythm) in 7 of 15 patients less than 2 months of age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059411429521">3</xref>
</sup> Mises et al also reported periodic large sharp wave complexes admixed with periods of decreased activity in 2 of 13 cases with MSUD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059411429521">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our patient manifested an increase in the abundance, persistence, and spread of the central rhythm during the initial presentation on day 8<sup> </sup>of life and a virtual absence of this rhythm in the EEG obtained on day 17 of life (9 days after the institution of aggressive hemodialysis and dietary therapy). This rapid improvement in the EEG likely confirms that aggressive therapy for MSUD with a reduction in leucine levels may improve the clinical and EEG change. This case demonstrates a unique, central, comb-like pattern on EEG that is very suggestive of MSUD when it occurs in the appropriate clinical setting. However, since this pattern may occur in other metabolic disorders, the ultimate diagnosis is made with biochemical confirmation.</p>
