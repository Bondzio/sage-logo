<p>Penetration of hazardous liquids through waste containment barriers exerts contamination and considerable alterations in geotechnical properties of clay liners. In general, these changes are attributed to the variation of the dielectric constant and the chemistry of the pore fluids which cause changes in soil structure. In the present study, a series of laboratory tests were performed on natural and contaminated clay soil permeated with different hazardous liquids: ethylene glycol and toluene which are generally found in petroleum-contaminated sites, possessing intermediate and low dielectric constants. Toluene was used in its pure form and ethylene glycol was used at various percentages of 0, 20, 40 and 60% by the volume of distilled water. In addition, natural sea water was also utilized as an inorganic fluid for permeation and salinization of the clay soil. The overall test results indicated that plasticity, sedimentation time, unconfined compressive strength, swell and compressibility generally decreased with increasing organic fluid/water concentration, while a slight increase in the permeability values was observed. Pure toluene resulted in diminution of plasticity and considerable flocculation of the particles which caused the soil to become granular. Sea water also caused particle flocculation and reduction in plasticity, swell potential and unconfined compressive strength, although it was noted that compressibility properties remained unchanged compared to distilled water. Finally, the correlation between the electrical resistivity and plasticity index values suggested that the electrical resistivity measurements can be used as a detecting technique for subsurface soil and waste barrier contamination.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Clay soils are the major material used for waste containment barriers due to possessing very low permeability, to protect the environment by avoiding the migration of hazardous leachate permeants. Such barriers are usually in the form of landfill liners and covers, lagoon liners, slurry walls and soil dams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12467395">Moavenian and Yasrobi, 2008</xref>). The percolation of oil, organic and inorganic fluid leachates through the subsurface soils and groundwater cause contamination, several types of damage and changes in the geotechnical properties of soils. Permeation of surface water and ground water flow disperse these toxic chemicals, not just to the vicinity of the surrounding area, but also to further parts of pollution sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12467395">Meegoda and Ratnaweera, 2006</xref>). The interaction of soil pollutant is dependent on various factors such as nature and chemical composition of soil, dielectric constant of pore fluid and organic matter, etc. (Sunil and Shrihari, 2003). Due to shortage of land for residential and industrial developments, there is a strong need to develop polluted land. In this regard, it is important to examine the impact of hazardous waste leachate on performance of compacted clay as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>The effects of pore fluids on the behaviour of clay soils have been conducted by many researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12467395">Bowders et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12467395">Kaya and Fang, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12467395">Khamehchian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12467395">Moavenian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12467395">Moavenian and Yasrobi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12467395">Olgun and Yildiz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12467395">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12467395">Sridharan and Rao, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X12467395">1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X12467395">1979</xref>). The effects of the sea water on the consistency and compressibility of different types of clays were also investigated by few researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12467395">Aksoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12467395">Arasan and Yetimoglu, 2008</xref>). In addition, some researchers have studied the influence of chemical contaminants on shear strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12467395">Meegoda and Ratnaweera, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12467395">Moore and Mitchell, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X12467395">Sunil et al., 2009</xref>). The literature review indicates that there has been limited research done on the effect of pore fluid on the volume change behaviour of the contaminated soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12467395">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12467395">Di Maio et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12467395">Meegoda and Ratnaweera, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12467395">Olgun and Yildiz, 2010</xref>). The review of the literature also indicated that the findings of permeability studies of the contaminated soils are widely varied and require further investigation. Some researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12467395">Singh and Prasad, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12467395">Yilmaz et al., 2008</xref>), observed a decrease in the permeability of clays with higher concentration of organic liquids or salts in water whereas other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12467395">Anandarajah, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12467395">Anderson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12467395">Brown and Thomas, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12467395">Fernandez and Quigley, 1985</xref>) observed an increase in the permeability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12467395">Park et al. (2006)</xref>, after performing an experimental study on low plasticity kaolinite clay, concluded that the hydraulic conductivity was slightly decreased due to pore clogging and the high viscosity of the surfactants. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12467395">Nayak and Shrihari (2007)</xref> stated that the structure of the contaminated soil became aggregated and this structure increased the effective pore space, thus resulted in an increase in the permeability of the soil.</p>
<p>Polluted soil property is a fundamental issue in geo-environmental engineering. How to evaluate this quantitatively has become increasingly important for contaminated site remediation. As a new detecting technique, the electrical resistivity method appears to be an effective predictor of soil hydraulic properties including water content, degree of saturation and permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12467395">Abu-Hassanein et al., 1996</xref>). Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12467395">Acar and Oliveri, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12467395">Mc Cater, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12467395">Mitchell and Arulanandan, 1968</xref>) indicate that electrical resistivity of compacted clay, is sensitive to compaction conditions and soil composition. For this reason, electrical resistivity measurements could be used as a new detecting technique for soil contamination. The review of the literature indicates that there has been limited research done on the effect of pore fluid on the electrical resistivity and volume change behaviour of the contaminated soils. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of hazardous leachate on the physical and index properties of the artificially contaminated soils and to understand the changes in permeability, swell potential, compressibility and unconfined compressive strength of the soils permeated with different pore fluids. Electrical resistivity measurements were made to investigate the effects of different pore fluids on the electrical resistivity variations within the contaminated soils. Furthermore it represents an attempt to determine if a relationship exists between the electrical resistivity and the plasticity index values of the soils contaminated with different pore fluids.</p>

<title>Pore liquids</title>
<p>The physical and chemical properties of the different experimental organic liquids used in this study are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12467395">Table 2</xref>. The tests were first performed on the natural soil mixed with distilled water, and then two organic liquids with low and intermediate dielectric constants were mixed into the soil by using a mechanical mixer and a series of tests were performed on the artificially contaminated soils. At the end of the mixing process, the specimens were tested for their moisture contents to be assured of the mixture. In accordance with the GouyâChapman theory of the diffuse double layer (DDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12467395">Mitchell, 1993</xref>), liquids with different dielectric constants cause alterations in the DDL thickness, which leads to several changes in the geotechnical properties of the soils. The DDL occurs at the interface between the clay surface and the pore fluid. Depression of the DDL produces a flocculated structure, whereas an increase in the DDL produces a dispersed structure. These changes in the soil structure cause several changes in the engineering properties of the soils such as settlement, permeability, shear strength, and swell properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12467395">Meegoda and Ratnaweera, 1994</xref>).</p>

<p>Ethylene glycol is an odourless, colourless and toxic liquid which is frequently found at oil and petrol collection facilities. The miscible organics may undergo dilution by water in a field situation; therefore in this study ethylene glycol was mixed with different percentages of 0, 20, 40, 60 and 100% by the volume of distilled water and used in experimental tests. Toluene, known as methylbenzene, was also utilized in this study. This aromatic hydrocarbon is a toxic water-insoluble liquid which is found in crude oil producing areas and petroleum products.</p>
<p>It is known that soil salination has become a worldwide problem which mostly results in soil desertification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12467395">Diamantis and Voudrias, 2008</xref>). The salinity of pore fluid increases in coastal plain regions especially in the Mediterranean countries. In this regard, natural sea water was also selected as an inorganic permeant liquid to investigate the effect of this fluid on the physical and engineering properties of the soil obtained from Famagusta, North Cyprus. The sea water had the salinity value of 45 parts per thousand.</p>

<sec id="section5-0734242X12467395">
<title>Test methods</title>
<p>The clay sample was first oven-dried at 50 Â°C temperature and then pulverized in a mechanical grinder. After mixing with the desired liquid, the specimens were kept in plastic bags to avoid any changes in their moisture content for nearly 24 h. Sedimentation (hydrometer) tests were conducted according to British standard BS 1377. The hydrometer was calibrated for all the fluids used in the study. A sample of air-dried soil weighing 50 g was covered with 100 mL of sodium hexametaphosphate solution. This test was also done by using pure sea water, ethylene glycol and toluene. For this purpose, the specimens were contaminated with 100 mL of the relevant liquids instead of sodium hexametaphosphate solution and the rest of the test was performed in the same way as the British standard test. Liquid and plastic limit tests were performed in accordance with ASTM D4318-05, and the linear shrinkage limit according to BS 1377 Part 1. In these tests, the test specimens were prepared by mixing the soil with distilled water, ethylene glycol, toluene and the sea water. Specimens were compacted by using a standard Proctor compaction effort following ASTM D 698-07, method A. For swell and consolidation tests, the test specimens were prepared at optimum water content obtained from the standard Proctor compaction test with dimensions of 15 mm in height and 75 mm in diameter. The specimens were placed in moulds and inundated with distilled water, pure ethylene, 20, 40, 60% concentrations of ethylene glycol, pure toluene and the sea water. The specimens were loaded to a specific vertical stress of 7 kPa for measuring one-dimensional wetting induced swell. Throughout the study, each point in the figures represents the average of three tests.</p>
<p>After completion of the swell tests, one-dimensional consolidation tests were conducted by applying the ASTM D 2435-04 test standard which lasted for approximately 10 days. The permeability values of the soil were computed by an indirect method from the results of consolidation tests performed by using different pore fluids. In order to determine the unconfined compressive strength of the soil subjected to different pore fluids, the unconfined compression tests were performed in accordance with ASTM D 2166-06. Test specimens were prepared in moulds with dimensions of 38 mm in diameter and 76 mm long. The specimens were compacted at optimum water content by using different pore fluids.</p>
<p>In the present study, laboratory electrical resistivity apparatus offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12467395">Abu-Hassanein et al. (1996)</xref> was studied and the same procedure was applied to measure the vertical electrical resistivity of the compacted soil contaminated with different pore fluids. The apparatus used for measuring electrical resistivity consisted of a cylinder constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), with the same size as the compaction mould in ASTM D 698 (<italic>D</italic> = 10 cm, <italic>L</italic> = 11.4 cm).</p>
<p>A power supply was used to apply alternating current (AC) having an electrical potential of 35 V and a constant frequency of 60 Hz. AC was used in this study since the application of direct current (DC) results in electrokinetic phenomena that can cause several changes in water content, soil structure, and pore fluid chemistry. A potential difference Î<italic>V</italic> was measured using a voltmeter between two copper rod electrodes. Current <italic>I</italic> was measured indirectly by measuring the voltage drop in a 2 kÎ© resistor. The electrical resistance, <italic>R</italic> was computed using Ohmâs law assuming that the electric field is one dimensional. The vertical electrical resistivity, Ï is then computed from electrical resistance via Equation (1):</p>

<p>The results showed a decrease in sedimentation time of the solid particles with the reduction in the dielectric constant of the pore fluids. The uppermost curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12467395">Figure 1</xref> corresponds to sea water and toluene, and the lowest one corresponds to sodium hexamataphosphate. Sodium hexametaphosphate, which is known as a deflocculating agent, caused the soil particles to disperse and dissolve in the solution and resulted in the highest sedimentation time. The presence of ethylene glycol with medium dielectric constant of 37.7 (at 20 Â°C) and toluene with lower dielectric constant of 2.4 (at 20 Â°C) resulted in a decrease in the DDL thickness as a result of which the clay particles coagulated and resulted in a granular texture. Thus, the sedimentation time required for the soils treated with ethylene glycol and toluene shortened compared to the soil treated with sodium hexametaphosphate. Sea water also caused flocculation and aggregation of the soil particles and resulted in a reduction in the sedimentation time of the clay particles in less than 1 h. This can be further explained due to shrinkage and contraction of the DDL which leads to faster settlements of the soil particles in suspension.</p>

<p>The results of Atterberg limit tests are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12467395">Table 3</xref>. The results indicated that The highest liquid and plastic limit values were obtained for the soil mixed with distilled water. The plasticity index value obtained for this soil was 31.4%. Test results revealed that there was a decrease in the plasticity index of the soils when the soils were contaminated with ethylene glycol and toluene. Sea water also caused a significant decrease in the plasticity index value. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12467395">Table 3</xref> also gives the linear shrinkage values obtained for the soil contaminated with different fluids. Test results also indicated a decrease in the linear shrinkage limit values of the soils contaminated with ethylene glycol and toluene. This decrease was expected to be due to the reduction in the plasticity of the same soils. Test results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12467395">Table 3</xref> also indicated that when the soil was contaminated with pure toluene and ethylene glycol, Atterberg limit values could not be measured, because the soil became non-plastic. Therefore, the rolling of the specimen for the plastic limit and completion of the liquid limit test became impossible.</p>

<p>An increase in the concentration of the fluids caused an alteration in the texture and the plasticity of the soils. That can be explained due to the collapse of the DDL. Decrease in the DDL thickness leads to a net increase in the attractive forces and brings the clay particles to coagulation. The elimination of the electrical repulsive forces between soil particles results in a decrease in the plasticity and the linear shrinkage limit of the soils.</p>

<p>According to the GouyâChapman DDL theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12467395">Mitchell, 1993</xref>), the thickness of the DDL decreased with an increase in the pore fluid concentration. Swelling is usually attributed to rebound of bent particles or swelling of DDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12467395">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12467395">Moavenian and Yasrobi, 2008</xref>). Test results indicated that when water was replaced by a liquid of lower dielectric constant, the swell potential decreased due to the depression of the DDL. Low dielectric constants of pure ethylene glycol and toluene caused more collapse of the DDL thickness. This occurs particularly in toluene with the lowest dielectric constant which results in the collapsing of the soil. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12467395">Figure 3</xref> indicates that the depression of the DDL changed the texture of the soil and the soil became coarse and granular and consequently, no swelling of the soil was observed.</p>

The shapes of the consolidation curves show flattening which indicate a decrease in the compressibility of the soils permeated with toluene and higher percentages of ethylene glycol. An increase in the ethylene glycol concentration as permeant leachate, resulted in a decrease in the DDL thickness and reduction in the compressibility of the soils. Similarly, the low dielectric constant of toluene caused more collapse of the DDL thickness, hence, the lowest compressibility was observed for soil permeated with toluene. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12467395">Table 4</xref> reports the average time required for completing 90% consolidation of the clay (<italic>t</italic>

This behaviour can be explained due to the depression of the DDL as a result of an increase in the pore fluid concentration which resulted in the flocculation and aggregation of the soil particles.

<title>Permeability test</title>
<p>The permeability values of the soils inundated with different pore fluids at three different stress ranges of 0â200, 200â800 and 800â1600 kPa are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X12467395">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X12467395">8</xref>. The average permeability of the clay soil compacted at the standard Proctor compaction energy was found to be 1.36 Eâ08 cm s<sup>â1</sup>. In the determination of this value, distilled water was used as a permeant liquid. Test results indicated that with the permeation of different pore fluids, the permeability increased slightly in almost all cases, with the exception of sea water. A slight increase in the permeability of the soils can be explained due to the flocculation and aggregation of the soil particles as the concentration of the pore fluid increased. The lower dielectric constant of ethylene glycol (37.7) and toluene (2.40) caused the soil particles to flocculate and form aggregates due to loss of repulsive forces between particles. Adecrease in dielectric constant results in reduction in DDL and thus the soil structure tends to flocculate and aggregate. The flocculated structure increases the effective pore space and effective flow area causes the permeability to increase. The results are in good agreement with the results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12467395">Nayak et al.

As discussed earlier, the increase in the ethylene glycol concentration decreased the dielectric constant of the pore fluid and resulted in more DDL depression and particle flocculation. This flocculation and coagulation of the soil particles yields to create a soil with a porous structure which might reduce the interparticle shearing resistance and enable the sliding of the soil particles. As a result, a decrease in the unconfined compressive strength was obtained. The unconfined compressive strength of the soil contaminated with pure toluene and ethylene glycol could not be measured because of the changes in the texture of the soils. The granular and non-plastic texture did not enable the soil to be compacted in the Proctor mould and tested.</p>

<title>Electrical resistivity of the soil contaminated with different pore fluids</title>
<p>In recent years, electrical resistivity measurement has become applicable for monitoring the contaminants of the subsurface soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12467395">Songyu et al., 2008</xref>). As the contaminants are often electrolytes or organic compounds, such as organic carbons and heavy metals, it is possible to distinguish between contaminated and uncontaminated soils from electrical resistivity variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12467395">Songyu et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Soil properties such as soil type, porosity, water content, degree of saturation, composition of the particles, salinity of the pore water, particle shape and orientation, grain size distribution and pore structure can strongly affect the electrical resistivity of the soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12467395">Abu-Hassanein et al., 1996</xref>).

<p>Electrical resistivity is highly sensitive to moulding water content, especially when the water content of the soil is less or near optimum water content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12467395">Abu-Hassanein et al., 1996</xref>). When soil is contaminated with higher percentages of ethylene glycol, many of the pores become filled with ethylene glycol and as ethylene glycol is not a good electrical conductor, the electrical conductivity of the soil decreased and thus, an increase in the electrical resistivity value is obtained. In the present study, the previous findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X12467395">Figure 7</xref>) indicated that the permeability of the soil contaminated with different percentages of ethylene glycol increased due to the particle flocculation and aggregation. That is also in good agreement with the increase in the electrical resistivity values. Increase in the pore space (i.e. increase in the porosity) of the soil resulted in a decrease in the electrical conductivity of the soil and thus, an increase in the electrical resistivity values was obtained.</p>
<p>Test results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X12467395">Table 5</xref> indicated that a decrease in the electrical resistivity of the soil was obtained when the soil was contaminated with sea water. A decrease in the electrical resistivity value indicates that salty water enhanced the electrical conductivity of the soil. In the other words, high salt concentration and ionic movement in sea water improved the surface conductance of the soil and resulted in lower electrical resistivity.</p>
<p>The correlation between the electrical resistivity and plasticity index values of the soil contaminated with different percentages of ethylene glycol is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0734242X12467395">Figure 11</xref>, which indicates that there was a good correlation between the electrical resistivity and the plasticity index values of the ethylene glycol-contaminated soils. It can also be seen that an increase in the electrical resistivity of the soils was observed as the plasticity index of the soil decreased due to an increase in the pore fluid concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0734242X12467395">Figure 11</xref>). An increase in the ethylene glycol concentration brings the soil into non-plastic and granular texture. Generally, soils with more fines and greater plasticity contain a greater percentage of conductive clay particles and a higher specific surface area, which improves surface conductance and decreases electrical resistivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12467395">Abu-Hassanein et al., 1996</xref>). The electrical resistivity of the soil appears to be sensitive to the quantity of fines, and thus the plasticity of the soil. Test results suggest that electrical resistivity measurements seem to be a good detecting technique for subsurface soil contamination.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>An extensive laboratory testing programme was carried out to study the impact of hazardous waste leachate on performance and engineering behaviour of clay soils. The following conclusions can be made based on this research.</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12467395" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Changing the pore fluid of the soil from water to ethylene glycol, toluene and the sea water caused considerable changes in the engineering properties of the clay soil.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Changes in the pore fluid of the clay were attributed to changes in sedimentation time of the particles in the hydrometer test. Flocculation and aggregation of the soil particles occurred due to a decrease in the dielectric constant of the pore fluid resulting in faster sedimentation of the soil particles. The change in the concentration of the pore fluid resulted in a non-plastic granular texture of the soil. Plasticity of the soil contaminated with different percentages of the pore fluids decreased and resulted in a decrease in the swelling of the soils. The compressibility and swell potential of the soil decreased considerably when the soil was permeated with different percentages of ethylene glycol. Low dielectric constants of pure ethylene glycol and toluene caused more collapse of the DDL thickness, hence, no swelling was observed for soil permeated with toluene. The obtained data also indicated that the sea water had little effect on the compressibility characteristics of the compacted soil.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Test results indicated that there was a slight increase in the permeability of the soil contaminated with different pore fluids. Toluene with a lower dielectric constant (2.4) caused more depression of DDL thickness, which resulted in a more porous structure and an increase in the permeability of the soil. The permeability of the soil contaminated with sea water remained almost unchanged. The miscible organics may undergo dilution by water in a field situation, whereas the water immiscible solvents such as toluene would not be diluted by leachate, therefore it may reach a clay liner at near full strength.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The results showed a decrease in the unconfined compressive strength of the soils contaminated with different pore fluids. Contamination of the soil generated a soil with highly porous structure which reduced the interparticle shearing resistance and enabled sliding of the soil particles. Thus, a decrease in the unconfined compressive strength was obtained.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Test results indicated that there is a good correlation between the electrical resistivity and the plasticity of the soil contaminated with different percentages of ethylene glycol. An increase in the ethylene glycol concentration reduced the plasticity of the soils and resulted in an increase in the electrical resistivity of the contaminated soils. Test results suggested that electrical resistivity measurement could be one of the techniques for monitoring and detecting heavy metal-contaminated soils and clay liners due to permeation of hazardous waste leachate.</p></list-item>
