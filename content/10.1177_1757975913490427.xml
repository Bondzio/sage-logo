<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Ottawa Charter is undeniably of strategic importance in the history of ideas associated with the establishment of health promotion. There is much to applaud in a charter which responds to the need to take action on the social and economic determinants of health and which seeks to empower communities to be at the centre of this. In amongst the accolades generally attributed to the Ottawa Charter there have however been some occasional rumblings of discontent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975913490427">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757975913490427">2</xref>). In this paper we seek to avoid further hubris. We take up a postcolonial stance in which the silences and assumptions apparent in the development of the Charter are examined using critical discourse analysis (CDA). We argue that such an exercise is crucial to a more reflexive health promotion practice able to recognize and challenge its own colonial underpinnings.</p>
<sec id="section6-1757975913490427">
<title>The Ottawa Conference and the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion</title>
<p>The first WHO International Conference on Health Promotion was held in Ottawa on 21 November 1986, as a concrete step toward Health For All 2000 and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757975913490427">3</xref>). This conference saw the endorsement of the Ottawa Charter becoming the key establishing document of health promotion as a field of public health practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757975913490427">4</xref>). Since then, the Ottawa Charter has taken on a ‘Holy Grail’ status. Religious metaphor has become common in emphasizing the significance of the Ottawa Charter, with references to it as a ‘mantra for health promotion workers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757975913490427">5</xref>) and ‘the new public health bible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757975913490427">6</xref>). Such reverence, though, can also serve to deflect the possibility for critique. Positioned as the first international conference on health promotion in the service of ‘Health For All’ are grand claims of universality and inclusivity. We question here the foundations of these claims. While the Charter itself commends strong principles of collaboration, advocacy and empowerment, it is not entirely clear that these ideals were reflected in the context of its production. We argue that the Ottawa Charter cannot be fully interpreted outside of the context of its production; hence, it is imperative that we question its assumptions and critically reflect on that moment in history.</p>

<sec id="section7-1757975913490427">
<title>Postcolonial standpoint</title>
<p>We take up an explicitly postcolonial standpoint in this paper. Postcolonialism provides a framework that endeavours to destabilize dominant Western discourse and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757975913490427">7</xref>). One of the central features of postcolonial theory is an examination of the impact and continuing legacy of European conquest, colonization and domination of non-European lands, peoples and cultures. It recognizes that colonial assumptions have widespread consequences for inequality and, as a form of anti-racist research, understands ‘colonial’ as being imposed and dominating, not simply foreign and alien (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757975913490427">8</xref>). As such, central to postcolonialism is an analysis of ideas of and belief in Western superiority over non-Western peoples and cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757975913490427">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757975913490427">10</xref>). It also draws attention to the assumptions held by Westerners about the colonized and marginalized, including developing nations and Indigenous peoples. This involves critically analysing the assumptions of colonizers regarding the colonized, and the damaging effects of such ideas on the colonized.</p>
<p>Using CDA as a tool we seek to critically (re)consider the discourse associated with the initial development of the Ottawa Charter. This makes it possible to examine the hegemonic viewpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757975913490427">11</xref>) – a particularly useful aspect given the language used in health has meaning and significance beyond its literal content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757975913490427">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757975913490427"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757975913490427">14</xref>), and that the ‘new health promotion movement’ generated an associated new critical domain of knowledge and discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757975913490427">15</xref>). Thus, a postcolonial standpoint is critical for considering the way in which a particular neo-colonial vision of global health was mobilized by the Ottawa Conference. Furthermore, a postcolonial standpoint enables attention to the possibility of colonization as part of health promotion practice, with an emphasis upon creating a decolonized way forward into the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757975913490427">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975913490427">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757975913490427">17</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<title>Critical discourse methodology</title>
<p>Methodologically this paper draws from CDA to emphasize ‘the role of discourse in the (re)production and challenge of dominance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975913490427">18</xref>). A crucial element of this approach is to identify the enactment of power within the production of discourse. Here, the power to exclude or limit certain voices in order to privilege others is central to discourse as a segregating structure. Following Van Dijk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975913490427">18</xref>) we understand this exercise of power to involve both the power to control the context of discourse production (such as through the exclusion of some participants from communication events) as well as the discursive strategies themselves which ‘naturalize’ the social order of inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757975913490427">19</xref>). Thus we take up the task of CDA here as involving both commentary on the control of the production of the Ottawa Charter discourse as well as discursive structures evident within the background papers of the Ottawa Charter. We argue that our concern with placing the Ottawa Charter within a broader context of its own production puts into practice a generalized principle of CDA to recursively move between text and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975913490427">20</xref>). Without this acknowledgement of context we fear that much of what has been said about the Ottawa Charter ‘discourse’ takes the Charter as an isolated piece of text. In this vein it is not surprising that the Charter is regularly idealized even within CDA literature, thus exemplifying ‘participatory democracy’, emphasizing people as ‘diverse and complex’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757975913490427">21</xref>). Therefore, rather than focus on the text of the Charter itself we have focused on the context of its production. This was achieved firstly through a critical examination of the organization of the Ottawa Conference, including an official list of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975913490427">22</xref>) apparently designed by the Conference organizing committee, and secondly via an analysis of the background papers prepared to inform the Ottawa Charter.</p>
<p>In terms of providing an analysis of the discursive strategies evident in the development of the Ottawa Charter, we examined the background papers for the five sub-themes of the Ottawa Conference, dated October 1986 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975913490427">23</xref>), comprising six papers:</p>

With an interest in how a Western-centric worldview operated within the background papers to inform the ‘new health promotion movement’, a coding scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757975913490427">25</xref>) was then developed comprising two major features: i) normalization of a Western view of health; and ii) exclusionary tactics regarding non-Western views. This schema was refined and adjusted in an initial testing process with particular attention to power structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757975913490427">26</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-1757975913490427">
<title>The colonial context of the Ottawa Conference</title>
<p>As has already been noted, the Ottawa Charter is regularly referred to as a key global contribution to health promotion. Yet its own self-positioning is somewhat ambiguous. Consider the Charter’s following statement:<disp-quote>
<p>The conference was primarily a response to growing expectations for a new public health movement around the world. Discussions focused on the needs of industrialized countries, but took into account similar concerns in all other regions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757975913490427">3</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is very difficult not to see a colonial imagination at work in a charter which is concerned with a global agenda, but based on the needs of (wealthy/Western) ‘industrialized’ countries. Moreover, the invisibility of Indigenous people within ‘industrialized’ countries within the background papers ignores history and belies the health inequality now faced by Indigenous people. The Ottawa Charter was positioned as building on an agenda established at Alma Ata by a much broader cross-section of both rich and poor countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757975913490427">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757975913490427">28</xref>), which emerged in a new political context including the presence of a decolonizing Africa and the influence of a global anti-imperialist and leftist movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757975913490427">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1757975913490427">30</xref>). Thus, establishing the Ottawa Conference as taking forward this agenda in the interests of the global health but based on unmet needs in the West is an unlikely way to begin a shared global dialogue.</p>
<p>The Charter has been critiqued for its top-down and WHO-dominated process of development, and for almost entirely focusing on industrialized countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757975913490427">2</xref>). This sort of privileging was in part facilitated by the hierarchical processes of the Conference. For example, the Charter was withheld from Conference participants until the last day. Delegates were given time over lunch on the last day to provide feedback on the draft – with some participants apparently expressing ‘intense dissatisfaction’ with this very limited process of collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975913490427">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757975913490427">2</xref>). Moreover, participation at the Ottawa Conference was by invitation only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975913490427">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975913490427">22</xref>). It is alarming that in the development phase of an international movement led by the WHO and in the wake of the Alma Ata Declaration, a primarily privileged ‘club’ of 38 predominantly wealthy nations was fashioned to create a movement for addressing health inequality. A colonizer’s imagination was clearly at work here, though this has remained unacknowledged in the history of health promotion. In terms of Indigenous representation, there were but two: an Indigenous consultant from the First Nations Confederacy, in her capacity as an educator; and a participant from Research and Development in Health and Welfare Canada who referenced Indigeneity in their professional background<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1757975913490427">i</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975913490427">22</xref>). In this way, the process did not reflect the ideals of the Charter itself, reflecting instead the established global order of inequality.</p>
<p>Although each conference participant no doubt brought with them their own ideas regarding health promotion, ‘…those ideas and the subsequent discussions in Ottawa would also be shaped by the reading material that greeted them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757975913490427">31</xref>). This is particularly significant given the power of language about health to position and create relationships among individuals, environments and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757975913490427">21</xref>). Indeed, there was reportedly a feeling amongst conference participants that they were ‘…being managed by WHO to some extent, to produce the kinds of statements which WHO had already decided on’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975913490427">1</xref>). Indeed the background papers clearly established such a strong premise for the Charter that it is somewhat unclear the extent to which the conference itself functioned as a forum for further dialogue which might influence the Charter<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1757975913490427">ii</xref></sup>. Personal histories, educational experiences, and scholarly training can shape interpretations, and it is recognized that Eurocentric academies have a history of failing to inform learners of the complete history of ideas and events that have shaped and continue to shape human growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757975913490427">8</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1757975913490427">
<title>Normalization of a Western view of health</title>
<p>When examining the discursive strategies within the background papers, initially key categories, themes and terms were located, including recurrent or significant themes, to organize the data and bring a systematic order to the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757975913490427">32</xref>). Immediately evident throughout the papers was a striking use of language claiming a collective view of humanity and health. Frequently, terminology such as ‘<italic>our</italic> ultimate health hazard’ (paper 1), ‘<italic>our</italic> health establishments’ (paper 1), ‘…<italic>we</italic> have moved… to feeling superior and dominating nature’ (paper 2), ‘…<italic>we</italic> rejoin humankind in past epochs and other cultures’ (paper 5), and ‘<italic>us all</italic>, especially the disadvantaged’ (paper 6) (italics authors) was utilized. Paper 2 provided a salient example of how the entire history of humanity is connected as one to the <italic>Homo habilis</italic>, ‘the oldest known member of the genus Homo’. Such an all-encompassing reference depicts a global, homogenous population and implies underlying inclusion, respect, empathy, commonality and goodwill in its audience.</p>
<p>By further sifting, comparing and contrasting the ways themes emerged, ‘interpretive repertoires’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757975913490427">32</xref>) operating in the background papers could also be considered. This process revealed an inherent centrality of individualism, a key characteristic of Western culture in its tendency to separate human nature (e.g. body and mind) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1757975913490427">33</xref>). For instance, the first paper assumed the dominance of individuality when claiming that WHO’s journey towards positive health would be ‘no simple matter… given the individualistic starting point’ based around  ‘individual pathologies’. The second paper by Hancock also demonstrated an individualist world view in its placement of the individual in the influential Mandala of Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1757975913490427">34</xref>) as ‘…the central focus of our efforts’. This is in contrast to other models of health and wellbeing not referenced, such as Aboriginal models (for example from the National Aboriginal Health Strategy [NAHS] Working Party [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1757975913490427">35</xref>]), or other Indigenous models (for example, the Kwaio concept of wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1757975913490427">36</xref>]). Thus, by way of excluding other health models and world views, the background papers worked to normalize Western individualistic neo-liberal assumptions and in so doing created a conceptualization of health promotion implicitly Western and neo-liberal in nature.</p>
<p>Emotion and social identity categories also play an important role for constructing social actors, such as political authorities and, in this case, those who would contribute to the ‘evidence-based’ conceptualization of health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757975913490427">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1757975913490427">37</xref>). The use of membership categories that united Western nations in the health promotion movement created a homogenous identity of the future, moving carefully between all-inclusive categories such as ‘global’, to categories distinguishing between developing and industrialized countries. These patterns of variation opened up moments of a multicultural possibility – albeit situated within a Western framework. For example, when arguing for equity in health, paper 6 drew emotionally laden contrasts between society members: ‘…an infant of an immigrant… a family of nationals…a black male pensioner… a white woman retiree… an unemployed single mother… a securely employed father’. Notably, even this example of diversity in social actors was situated within an assumption of a wealthy welfare state economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1757975913490427">38</xref>). Regardless, such a focus on difference can work to reconcile conflicting ideas, manage contradiction or uncertainty, and offer counter alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757975913490427">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1757975913490427">39</xref>) – a useful tool for maintaining the positive frame of health promotion. Compared with the invoking of injustice, inequality and victim blaming, health promotion was thus positioned as a way to address inequalities and differing experiences of ill health, while still vested within a Western neo-liberal framework.</p>
<p>The ‘representations of otherness’ evident in the papers worked to create a hybrid space that transformed particular peoples into a ‘subject’ upon which surveillance could be exercised, where the marginalized became a necessity for ‘worthy’ health promotion practice, while at the same time excluded as possible sources of wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1757975913490427">40</xref>). For example, Western knowledge was prioritized in paper 1 by predominantly utilizing Western examples to demonstrate proactive responses to health issues: UK’s Community Health Councils; a support group in Edinburgh; protesting housewives in South Wales; the Stuttgart community study and Heartbeat Wales; and the British National Health Service. Bhabha has discussed the valorization of spaces of mixing – spaces where truth and authenticity move aside for ambiguity. Such ‘hybridity’ is significant for knowledge production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1757975913490427">41</xref>). Thus, just as the background papers implied there to be the homogenous Western ‘we’ and non-Western ‘other’, dominant and marginalized knowledge sets were inherently poised as binary opposites – and in doing so, their existence as homogenous entities perpetuated. Consequently, through the hybrid embrace and exclusion, health promotion became embedded with Western assumptions about what ‘we’ do for the ‘other’, who does not do for themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1757975913490427">
<title>Exclusionary tactics regarding non-Western views</title>
<p>Despite the tone of collectivity mentioned above, the implicit assumption was clearly that the stories that mattered most were those from wealthy nations. Indeed, all six authors were from wealthy industrialized nations, drawing their examples from this privileged context in framing positive health-promoting action. A case in point is paper 6, which included references to: Sweden’s Intersectoral Health Council; Australia’s National Health Forum; Germany’s National Committee for Health Education; Japan’s compulsory health insurance; and Ireland’s pre-planning for a multi-sectoral health policy. The exclusion of developing country and Indigenous voices may be associated with the way the privileged often ignore the role that they play in perpetuating inequality in health promotion practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1757975913490427">42</xref>). Further, through the essentialist power of this homogenous collectivity, normalized assumptions of the identity of ‘we’ were deployed strategically to discursively superimpose aspirations of an inclusive shared project, while at the same time camouflaging the hierarchical global order of power at work.</p>
<p>The ‘positive’ positioning of health promotion also seemed to normalize professional intervention onto the weak or powerless ‘other’: the ‘wavering population… refusing to choose and change a number of everyday behaviours’ (paper 3), communities of developing nations requiring outside help to be ‘…awaken[ed]… against the oppression from which they suffered and its causes’ (paper 1), ‘the lower classes’ (paper 3) and so on. Such language was couched within a discourse of ‘enablement and empowerment’, global awareness and community involvement. In doing so, health promotion was established as a movement that ‘transcends traditional boundaries’, siding with the powerless by calling on ‘the need to revise the fundamental assumptions, concepts and attitudes of the health services’ (paper 5). However, it was also this very language that perpetuated an ambivalent marginalization of non-Western views.</p>
<p>Such ambivalence implies colonial ‘mimicry’; that is, the partial recognition/representation of the colonial object, acting as a camouflage of difference by only partly resembling the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1757975913490427">43</xref>). Through this ambivalence, the ‘other’ is both desired – as a symbolic space required for a ‘worthy’ health promotion project – and yet excluded as a source of knowledge. For example, paper 1 included only one Indigenous reference regarding the struggle of ‘Amerindians’ to improve their health after dispossession, but did not elaborate on this. Further, the paper’s sole developing country example framed the Khonds at Gram Vikas in India as powerless and in need of an outside health team. This positioning of health promotion as a form of external intervention and a noble enterprise, was woven throughout the background papers. Health promotion professionals were seen to be ‘…in the business of “doing good”’ (paper 1), working hard to address problems of the day as they ‘…wonder[ed] what devices should be used to meet these challenges’ (paper 3). Parallels can be drawn to the way missionaries, general practitioners, teachers and government workers wrote in the early colonial periods in, for example, India, Australia, America, Africa and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1757975913490427">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1757975913490427">45</xref>). The process of implementing the background papers marginalized non-Western voices and created a space that gave strength and identity to health promotion as the ‘solution’. Perhaps so engrained was this ambivalence that the attitude remained evident even 20 years on, in the reflections of Ottawa Conference participants, who claimed ‘…if you did not [join the health promotion movement] yet, for your own health you better join…’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1757975913490427">46</xref>).</p>
<p>Silences are of particular importance from a postcolonial standpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757975913490427">32</xref>). In reference to this, the papers were analysed with a ‘split’ approach by reading along with the meaning authors were creating, while simultaneously reading against the text’s intended flow to search out gaps and silences. As already alluded to, the silencing of the voices of developing nations and Indigenous peoples was manifest and their exclusion foreshadowed the continuance of a public health practice that narratively positioned marginalized recipient communities as needy and without agency or intellectual contributions. Indeed, the effect of this is evident where health promotion is at times practised as a neo-colonial enterprise that reframes Indigenous health in accordance with a Western, linear epistemology that excludes and conflicts with Indigenous knowledge systems and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1757975913490427">47</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In order to work collaboratively and respectfully, health promotion practitioners must turn their gaze from the ‘other’ onto themselves, to reflect critically on their own positions of privilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1757975913490427">48</xref>). By taking a postcolonial stance, this paper has used CDA to question the grand narrative of the first International Conference on Health Promotion, by way of examination of its own production. A range of strategies were identified, revealing that the discourse informing the development of the Ottawa Charter masked underpinning power imbalances and Western-centric worldviews, while also silencing non-Western voices. We do not conclude that health promotion cannot be used for addressing health inequality, and indeed we are aware of the many emancipatory examples of community-based health promotion around the globe. However, we argue that a reflexive practice is crucial to this enterprise, including a preparedness for health promotion to more critically acknowledge its own history. Without this, health promotion becomes yet another form of neo-colonial practice. Thus, this paper calls for further consideration and action as to how the principles and values of health promotion may be practised upon itself, in an effort to realize the original vision of health promotion for <italic>all</italic> people.</p>
