<p>Synthetic vessel grafts have been used as vascular substitutes for cardiovascular bypass procedures. In this study, we developed a novel tubular double-layered poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-ϵ-caprolactone) scaffold that did not require pretreatment with cell seeding by promoting autologous tissue regeneration by inducing the proliferation and differentiation of endothelial and smooth muscle progenitor cells after implantation. The patency and mechanical properties were maintained for one year after implantation, although 95% of the poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-ϵ-caprolactone) scaffolds had degraded. After this period, there was a lining of endothelial cells, an accumulation of collagen and elastin, and the development of neovascularization inside the poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-ϵ-caprolactone).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiovascular system diseases are a major cause of mortality and morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911513477750">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911513477750"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911513477750"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911513477750"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911513477750">5</xref></sup> Due to an aging population, combined with obesity, the presence of diabetes mellitus, and high blood lipid levels, the number of mortalities is predicted to be about 23 million a year by 2030.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911513477750">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911513477750">7</xref></sup> Cardiac bypass surgery is preferentially performed using autologous arteries or veins; however, its procedures limit the treatment due to a shortage of donors and the high cost of coronary artery bypass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911513477750">8</xref></sup> Synthetic vascular prostheses, such as Dacron fabric grafts and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), have been developed to supplement the limited supply of native graft materials. However, despite their prevalence, these grafts offer low patency due to their thrombogenic surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911513477750">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911513477750"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911513477750"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911513477750">12</xref></sup> Early thrombosis, the major cause of graft occlusion, is the principal cause of cardiovascular graft failures. Various strategies have been used to inhibit these processes and prolong the graft patency, including coating the grafts with various anticoagulants, antiplatelet factors, and antiproliferation agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911513477750">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911513477750">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911513477750"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911513477750"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911513477750">16</xref></sup> These materials were not completely endothelialized after implantation, and pre-seeding them with endothelial cells (ECs) had limited success and did not improve the patency of the grafts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911513477750">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911513477750">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Compliance mismatch between a native artery and an artificial graft is known to cause a graft failure during a prolonged implantation of an artificial graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911513477750">18</xref></sup> In a previous study, a poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-ϵ-caprolactone) (PLCL) scaffold had similar compliance to a native artery than PTFE did.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911513477750">19</xref></sup> PLCL copolymers have been applied as a biomaterial for vascular graft applications due to their high elasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911513477750">20</xref>

<p>An in situ tissue engineering approach is clinically more attractive, which involves the implantation of a cell-free scaffold. Avoiding all the in vitro aspects typical of the classical tissue engineering approach, in situ tissue engineering allows for the minimization of risks and costs associated with cell and tissue cultures while providing “off-the-shelf” availability. Once in situ, the scaffold is designed to guide and control cell recruitment, cell fate, and tissue formation using the body’s natural regenerative potential as a bioreactor. Therefore, the scaffold plays a central role in this approach by replacing principal tissue functions immediately upon implantation. After implantation, the scaffold is able to withstand physiological stresses and strains and to degrade while it is colonized with cells to form tissue. The use of biodegradable polymer scaffolds, on which layers of cells are grown, is an alternate tissue engineering approach for the development of functional vascular grafts. As the scaffold degrades, it is replaced and remodeled by the extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by the cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911513477750">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The endothelium constitutes an effective cellular layer that inhibits the adhesion and activation of platelets, blocks the coagulation process, and mediates clot dissolution. The endothelium serves as a physical barrier, which separates circulating blood from thrombogenic tissue components within the vascular wall. More importantly, the endothelium also plays a multifaceted role in hemostasis and actively regulates thrombotic events. Developments in nonthrombogenic cardiovascular tissue engineering have largely focused on achieving EC coverage and/or mimicry of specific antithrombotic elements inherent to ECs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911513477750">26</xref></sup> However, in vitro endothelialization requires a considerable amount of time and expertise to extract and culture the cells, making the process costly and limited to specialty centers. The source of the cells is also an issue that complicates their use in clinical settings.</p>
<p>In this study, the in vivo remodeling biodegradable scaffolds without any seeded cells, using a dog model, were evaluated. These constructs were shown to be mechanically suitable for the circulation system. In addition, the vascular graft induced autologous tissue regeneration by the proliferation and differentiation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells after implantation. The aim of this study was to investigate the biological performance and biochemical characteristics of this graft for one full year.</p>

<title>Tubular PLCL scaffold fabrication</title>
<p>The PLCL scaffold was fabricated by using a gel spin and inner coating method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883911513477750">27</xref></sup> PLCL was dissolved in chloroform (7.5%, w/v). The solution was injected through a nozzle at a constant speed (4 mL/min) with a syringe pump into a PLCL insoluble methanol bath to form gel fibers. The PLCL fibers were spun in the gel state onto a rotating cylindrical shaft that was dip-coated into a mixture of the PLCL solution and NaCl particles (~20 µm). The weight ratio of NaCl to PLCL was 1:2, and the concentration of the PLCL solution was 7.5% w/v. The shaft was driven by a gel-spinning device, and the as-spun PLCL fibers were formed into a tubular scaffold. The produced scaffolds were separated from the shaft and then soaked in a fresh methanol solution to remove any remaining chloroform. The scaffolds were air-dried for 24 h and then vacuum-dried for 72 h. The salts were leached from the scaffold in distilled water and freeze-dried. Scaffolds were sterilized with 70% ethanol, treated with 25 µg/mL bovine plasma fibronectin (FN, 0.1%; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) solution for 4 h and then 0.1% collagen type I for 4 h to form an outer coating on the scaffold. These treatments were required to achieve the bioactive effects.</p>

<title>Implantation of the tubular PLCL scaffold</title>
<p>Male mongrel dogs weighing ~25 kg were anesthetized with propofol (6 mg/kg; DongKook Pharm, Korea) and maintained with norcuron (1 mL/10 kg; N. V. Organon, Holland). Through a median laparotomy, the aorta was gently exposed from the renal artery to the iliac bifurcation. After an intravenous injection of heparin 50 U/kg, two vascular clamps were placed on the aorta just below the renal artery and just above the iliac bifurcation. A 3-cm segment of the aorta was resected and replaced with a 5-cm length of tubular PLCL scaffold (6 mm diameter). The anastomoses at both ends were made by running a suture with 6-0 polypropylene; after which, the clamps were removed, and the circulation was restored. After the hemostasis was secured, the abdomen was closed. Cefazolin (20 mg/kg; Chong Kun Dang, Korea) was injected intramuscularly (i.m.) twice daily for 5 days postoperatively.</p>

<title>Morphologic examination</title>
<p>The explanted grafts were incised longitudinally and flattened with their luminal side facing upward. The lumens were photographed using a detailed cross-examination procedure. To prepare the middle portions of the specimens for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the explanted vascular grafts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immersed for fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 12 h at room temperature. The samples were washed with phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in a phosphate buffer and then dehydrated in successively increasing concentrations of ethyl alcohol. The dehydrated grafts were washed with propylene oxide and placed in EPOK 812 embedding media. Semi-thin sections (~90 µm thick) and ultrathin sections (~70 nm thick) were cut with a glass knife on a LKB-Nova (Ultrotome NOVA, LKB, Bromma, Sweden) ultramicrotome. The semi-thin sections were stained with methylene blue and examined with a light microscope (Nikon, Optiphot, Tokyo, Japan). The ultrathin sections were collected on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then examined with a TEM H-7100 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<title>Ultrasonography and angiography</title>
<p>The dogs were anesthetized at 4, 8, and 24 weeks and one year after scaffold implantation. The blood flow was measured with an ultrasonograph (ATL, WA, USA) of the abdomen. Then, after exposure of the femoral artery, contrast dye (Ultravist370; Schering, Seoul, Korea) was injected into the femoral artery, and angiograms were obtained.</p>

<sec id="section7-0883911513477750">
<title>Histological analysis</title>
<p>All animals were sacrificed, and the scaffolds were explanted at 4 and 8 weeks and at 6 and 12 months after implantation. The explanted scaffolds and adjacent native aorta tissue were evaluated histologically. A portion of the specimen was fixed with 4% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Each sample was sectioned by microtome (Leica, Germany) and stained with the following: hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), Masson trichrome (MT) stain for collagen detection, and elastic van Gieson (EVG) stain for elastin. The antibodies used for immunohistochemistry included monoclonal antibodies for α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and polyclonal antibodies for von Willebrand factor (vWF). Additional sections of the scaffolds were stained with anti-vWF and α-SMA for immunohistochemical analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0883911513477750">
<title>Biomechanical analysis</title>
<p>The tensile strength, strain at the break, and E-modulus of the scaffolds were determined in accordance with section 8.3 of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 7198:1998/2001 with a Unidirectional Tensile Machine (UTM) (Instron Model 5567, Instron Corp.). Unidirectional stress was applied to determine the longitudinal and circumferential tensile stresses of the grafts. Rectangular-shaped samples, 13 × 5 mm × 0.43–0.79 mm, were used to determine strength. The edges of the samples were sandwiched between sandpaper and fixed to the tensile instrument using grips and then measured with a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min. The results were analyzed using Bluehill software. The E-modulus was calculated by the slopes of the initial values of the stress–strain curves (0%–20% strain) using the original software.</p>

<p>The mechanical properties were analyzed using two factors: the tensile strain and tensile stress. These factors are important for assessing the mechanical properties in a native environment in which blood pressure exists. The tensile stress of a native vessel was 3.06 ± 0.63 MPa at a strain of 111% ± 37%. Moreover, the tensile stress of the vascular grafts was 2.75 ± 0.13 MPa (6 months) and 2.1 ± 0.75 MPa (one year) at a strain of 48.6% ± 5.7% and 31.4% ± 14.3%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911513477750">Figure 7</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The PLCL vascular grafts (without cell seeding) implanted into mongrel dogs in situ were patent with no thrombosis and occlusion over a one-year period. Among the many factors determining the patency of artificial grafts, compliance mismatch between native arteries and artificial grafts is a major factor of graft failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911513477750">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883911513477750">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883911513477750">29</xref></sup> In a previous study, we confirmed that a PLCL scaffold has similar compliance to native arteries that of its PTFE counterpart. A synthetic graft that has the potential to promote autologous tissue regeneration without any seeding is more practical than a seeded graft since the manufacturing and pretreatment processes of seeded grafts are complicated, invasive, and time-consuming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911513477750">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>In vascular surgery, expanded PTFE or Dacron is usually used clinically; however, these synthetic materials do not degrade in the body. The concept of tissue engineering using biodegradable materials, such as poly(lactic acid), poly(caprolactone), and poly(glycolic acid) and their copolymers, has been proposed for regenerative vascular grafts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911513477750">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911513477750">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911513477750">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883911513477750">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883911513477750">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883911513477750"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883911513477750"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0883911513477750"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0883911513477750">35</xref></sup> The aim of a biodegradable vascular graft is to combine the practical advantages of a synthetic graft for clinical use with better biological performance of the regenerated natural tissues over the long term. Therefore, to achieve long-term success with biodegradable vascular grafts, proper regeneration of the vessel wall must occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911513477750">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0883911513477750">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0883911513477750">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The vascular grafts degraded appropriately so as to maintain the blood pressure and induce regeneration over time as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883911513477750">Table 1</xref>. The original thickness of the graft wall was 1200 ± 70 µm. Over time, the graft wall thickness decreased to 1100 ± 120 µm at 4 weeks, 520 ± 80 µm at 8 weeks, 330 ± 782 µm at 6 months, and 110 ± 36 µm at one year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883911513477750">Table 1</xref>). While the vascular grafts had degraded &gt;90% at one year, the tensile stress decreased from 3.8 ± 1.6 MPa to 2.1 ± 0.75 MPa (one year) due to the formation of the tissue. The decrease in tensile stress was less than wall thickness of vascular grafts. The vascular grafts had degraded and were replaced by the ECM secreted by the cells. Regeneration of natural tissues on the vascular grafts was confirmed by H&amp;E, MT, and EVG staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911513477750">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513477750">4</xref>). The regenerated tissue covering the surface of the vascular grafts consisted of collagen, elastin, and vWF ECs. Some important elements of the regeneration were stably embedded with autologous vascular cells in the vascular grafts, self-producing ECM, and an appropriable stable vascularization of neotissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911513477750">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911513477750">13</xref></sup> Neovascular tissue formation was verified as a tubular-shaped EC lining and smooth cell lining using the TEM, vWF staining, and α-SMA staining, respectively, in the regenerated tissue, one year after implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0883911513477750">Figure 6</xref>).

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Based on the in vivo results obtained with a vascular graft of a biodegradable tubular scaffold without cell seeding, the patency of the vascular was improved. This improvement was associated with enhanced endothelial coverage and a reduction in thrombosis. The vascular grafts maintained adequate tensile stress to withstand systemic circulation while being degraded over time. In addition, regeneration of natural tissue on the vascular grafts occurred by neovascularization.</p>
