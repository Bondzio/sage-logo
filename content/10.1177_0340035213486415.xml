<title>IFLA Policies IFLA Professional Statement on UBC</title>
<p>
<italic>A statement reaffirming IFLA's commitment to Universal Bibliographic Control has been endorsed by the Professional Committee. The statement was initiated by the Bibliography Section and has been endorsed by the Cataloging Section and the Classification and Indexing Section:</italic>
</p>
<p>During the 1970s IFLA established an office for Universal Bibliographic Control following several years of discussion about the importance of international sharing of bibliographic data to help reduce costs and to encourage greater cooperation worldwide. That office became known as UBCIM (Universal Bibliographic Control and International MARC). At that time the philosophy was that each national bibliographic agency would catalog the works published in its own country and establish the names of its authors, and that data would be shared and re-used around the world.<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>However, in the 1990s it was recognized that having data in a language and script users can understand is extremely important, so respecting the cultural diversity of users around the world should be addressed as well. These are not necessarily mutually exclusive conditions, as has been demonstrated in the subsequent Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) initiative. Web technologies offer new possibilities of sharing data at a global scale and beyond the library domain, but also show a need for authoritative and trusted data. Thus, the concept of UBC is still valid and worth IFLA's continued support and promotion. </p>
<sec id="section3-0340035213486415">
<title>IFLA therefore reaffirms the following principles:</title>
<p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>A national bibliographic agency (NBA) has the responsibility for providing the authoritative bibliographic data for publications of its own country and for making that data available to other NBAs, libraries, and other communities (for instance archives and museums) through appropriate and timely services with the goal of increasing open access to the bibliographic data;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>NBAs, as a part of the creation of authoritative bibliographic data, also have the responsibility for documenting authorized access points for persons, families, corporate bodies, names of places, and authoritative citations for works related to its own country and for making that authority data available to other NBAs, libraries, and other communities (for instance archives and museums); </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>IFLA has the responsibility for maintaining and promoting the Statement of International Cataloguing Principles (ICP), published in 2009, as the foundation for the sharing of bibliographic data;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>IFLA has, through the work of its relevant professional units and advisory committees, the responsibility for creating, maintaining and promoting bibliographic standards and guidelines to facilitate this sharing of bibliographic and authority data (e.g., ISBD, the FRBR family of conceptual models, etc.); </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>IFLA works collaboratively with other international organizations (e.g., ISO, ICA, ICOM, etc.) in the creation and maintenance of other standards in order to ensure that library standards developments, including compatible data models, are coordinated with those of the wider community.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>In 2003 the UBCIM core activity was closed and the coordination of bibliographic standardization was moved to the IFLA-CDNL Alliance for Bibliographic Standards (ICABS), which was later changed to the IFLA-CDNL Alliance for Digital Strategies (ICADS). In 2011 it was decided to discontinue ICADS. During the 2011 WLIC conference the idea arose of revitalizing UBC and the Bibliography Section took on this task.
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Readers interested in the UBC history are directed to the following resources: Dorothy Anderson, “Universal Bibliographic Control : a long term policy, a plan for action” Pullach/Muenchen: Verlag Dokumentation, 1974. 87 p. There is also a report from IFLA for the UNESCO Intergovernmental Conference of 1974 that includes a chapter more briefly describing UBC (p. 10–12: “IFLA and the role of libraries” published by IFLA in 1974. 38 p. </p>

<title>Statement of Principles on Global Cross Sectoral Digitisation Initiatives</title>
<p>The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), the International Council on Archives (ICA), the Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations (CCAAA), the International Council of Museums (ICOM), the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and the International Council for Scientific and Technical Information (ICSTI) share a common mission of collecting, recording, organising, storing, preserving in perpetuity, and providing access to the world's cultural patrimony and intellectual output in documentary form. </p>
<p>Together they support and follow the long-term vision as formulated by the CDNL (Conference of Directors of National Libraries) in 2008, on the development of a global distributed digital collection – comprehensive, open, seamlessly-connected, and universally accessible on the Internet – giving ready access to digital materials in the collections of all the cultural heritage institutions of the world and in private collections, in the interests of scholarly research, education and lifelong learning, innovation and economic development, and the promotion of international understanding; in this way complying with the wish to strengthen the strategic collaboration with other stakeholders such as cultural heritage professionals, cultural heritage institutions, scientific institutions, national and international government organisations, other NGOs, publishers and information providers, and other private sector organisations. </p>
<sec id="section5-0340035213486415">

<title>Background to the Principles</title>
<p>In 2008 the Conference of Directors of National Libraries (CDNL) developed a long term vision on the development of a global digital library. The international NGO's on cultural heritage regularly meet to discuss issues of mutual interest and to share experiences on common practices in an informal gathering called the LAMMS Coordinating Council. At one of these occasions they took up this Vision Statement to adjust it and make it suitable for adoption by all NGO's within LAMMS. After a long review process in which various subsequent versions were discussed thoroughly, the representatives of IFLA, ICA, CCAAA, ICOM, ICOMOS and ICSTI at their 6th LAMMS Coordinating Council meeting in December 2011 decided to adhere to this Statement of Principles on Global Cross Sectoral Digitisation Initiatives and to promote this within their membership.</p>
<p>
<italic>The Principles were prepared by: </italic>
</p>
<p>The LAMMS Coordinating Council (2012): Ingrid Parent (IFLA President, chair of LAMMS Coordinating Council 2009–2011); David Leitch (ICA Secretary General); Bénédicte Selfslagh (ICOMOS Secretary General 2008–2011); Kurt Deggeller (CCAAA Convener till 2012); Julien Anfruns (ICOM Director General); France Desmarais (ICOM), Herbert Gruttemeier (ICSTI past President), Ingeborg Verheul (IFLA, LAMMS Coordinating Council Secretariat). </p>

<title>The IFLA Position on Internet Governance (2013)</title>
<p>
<italic>IFLA issued a Position on Internet Governance in 2005 in connection with the second phase of WSIS in Tunisia. As WSIS enters a review period in the run up to its assessment by the UN General Assembly in 2015, the IFLA Governing Board endorsed a revised statement in January 2013 to ensure that IFLA's thinking on Internet governance reflects current thinking and issues:</italic>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>As the foremost international professional association concerned with information and library services, IFLA represents associations and institutions worldwide that endeavour to provide access to all publicly available information today and in the future, whether factual or fictional, and regardless of media or format. The Internet is a critically important platform for the information services delivered by libraries, and in many countries public and educational libraries are the major or only agencies that provide the general population with free or affordable access to these resources. In doing so, they make a huge contribution to cultural, social and economic development. IFLA therefore has a direct interest in the future governance of the Internet, and in contributing to the debates, mechanisms and processes shaping its future.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>IFLA opposes any measures which would lead to control of information access and freedom of expression by commercial, governmental or sectoral interests, or hinder the development of the Internet as an enabler of human rights. Measures which may be necessary to ensure the reliable operation of the Internet, ensure its security, and enable individuals to protect their privacy must not be used to limit the rights expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially those in Article 19. IFLA therefore endorses the free flow of information on the Internet, rejects any discrimination by network operators between different types of services, content and applications transmitted by their networks/infrastructure, and supports balanced copyright frameworks that facilitate the widest possible public access to digital information resources. </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>IFLA supports the development of the Internet as a reliable multilingual system which will be available to all and will facilitate unrestricted access to information by all peoples in their languages and scripts of choice.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In regard to the governance of the Internet and related public policy issues, IFLA supports a multistakeholder approach which involves governments, civil society, business, academia and the technical community and which offers an opportunity for increasing participation by those interests in all countries as the capacity to participate develops. IFLA consequently endorses the principle and spirit of the multistakeholder approach under the UN aegis and supports the process of enhanced co-operation in relation to critical Internet resources. In this context, IFLA emphasizes the need for effective representation of all stakeholder interests and the broader involvement and participation of stakeholders from developing countries in particular. </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>As a voice for more than one billion registered library users across the world and an United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) accredited international professional organisation, IFLA is resolved to contribute to the development of effective multistakeholder models for Internet governance. IFLA therefore encourages the participation of library and information professionals in Internet governance at all levels.</p>

<title>From IFLA Headquarters New webpages on IFLA and the Information Society</title>
<p>IFLA is pleased to launch a new set of resources relating to the role libraries play in the information society and the way they can contribute to Internet governance. The new webpages look at the different forums of the information society, such as the World Summit of the Information Society (WSIS), and the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and highlight why the involvement of libraries is important. In addition to these resources, a 2013 revised version of the IFLA Position on Internet Governance stresses our view of the multistakeholder approach to Internet governance issues, and the pages also provide information on how you can get involved with the issues at national and international levels.</p>
<p>It is our intention to build these resources over time. We would welcome feedback about the pages.</p>

<title>Impact Report 2012: Building Strong Library Associations programme</title>
<p>Library associations are key institutions in the library and information sector around the world. Library associations are advocates for equitable access to information, and help to build strong, sustainable library communities by improving services for library users, and supporting development of the profession. The IFLA Building Strong Library Associations Programme, launched in 2010, offers a strategic and coordinated approach to capacity building and sustainability of library associations. This report highlights the first six country projects undertaken between 2010 and 2012.</p>
<p>Strong library associations support and enrich society and the library and information profession. They unite a country’s library community around a common platform for advocacy and development of the profession.</p>
<sec id="section13-0340035213486415">
<title>Building Strong Library Associations Impact Report 2012</title>
<p>BSLA builds capacity by facilitating experience sharing within regions, strengthening library leaders in-country, and developing locally relevant solutions. Through cascade workshops and outreach, the programme has had an impact across countries and regions.</p>
<p>Programme activities include training and mentoring which helps associations to form partnerships, strengthen governance and member services, and to become better advocates for their library community. Training and activities are customised to the objectives of library associations, and for different cultural, political, technological and social conditions.</p>
<p>IFLA measures the difference its programmes make using impact evaluation. This methodology considers the change that the programme has effected on individuals, associations and library communities. The impact evaluation process involves the clear identification of the goals and objectives for each programme, with evidence collected to measure the extent to which those goals and objectives are achieved.</p>
<p>This report presents preliminary programme impact following the conclusion of project activities and in-country evaluation meetings and interviews in mid-2012.</p>

<title>IFLA launches principles, research and advice for eLending in Libraries</title>
<p>IFLA is pleased to launch a new set of resources relating to eBooks and libraries. Providing access to eBooks is one of the most pressing issues facing libraries right now. Public libraries, in particular, are dealing with implications of rapidly changing business and access models. IFLA has previously issued a background paper on eLending during 2012, and is now building on this paper to launch a new official policy document ‘IFLA Principles for Library eLending’ which was endorsed by the Governing Board in February 2013.</p>
<p>In addition, the new webpages contain links to the background paper, and a commissioned thinkpiece on eBooks in libraries, both of which are intended to further the debate around the subject and provide interested colleagues with further information. There are links to existing campaigns on eBooks, and further details on how to get involved in IFLA's work on the issue.</p>
<p>The plan is to build on these resources during 2013 and expand the amount of information available. The Principles will be discussed at the MLAS Seminar on eBooks in Libraries on February 21st 2013 in London.</p>

<bold>Ambassadors of the book: competences and training for heritage librarians. </bold>Edited by: Raphaële Mouren, Berlin/Munich: De Gruyter Saur, 2012. ISBN 978-3-11-030127-4. (IFLA Publications; Nr 160) Euro 99,95 / for USA, Canada, Mexico US$ 140.00. Special price for IFLA members Euro 79,95 / for USA, Canada, Mexico US$ 112.00.</p>
<p>What competences are needed for heritage librarians, and how can they be taught? The management of heritage collections requires a unique mix of knowledge and skills, including expertise in preservation and conservation; heritage policies; acquisitions and collection management; bibliographic description; the materiality of books and other collection objects; and the history of libraries. Librarians must also understand the need for open access, the importance of marketing, and the challenges posed by digitization.</p>

<bold>Guidelines for Subject Access in National Bibliographies.</bold> Edited by Yvonne Jahns. Berlin/Munich: De Gruyter Saur, 2012. ISBN 978-3-11-028089-0. (IFLA Series on Bibliographic Control; Nr 45)Euro 59.95 / for USA, Canada, Mexico US$ 84.00. Special price for IFLA members Euro 49.95 / for USA, Canada, Mexico US$ 70.00</p>
<p>In a networked and globalized world of information the form of national bibliographies may have changed, however their major function remains unchanged: to inform about a country’s publication landscape, its cultural and intellectual heritage. Subject access offers a major route into this landscape providing information about the dispersion of publications in specific fields of knowledge and topics contained in a particular national publishing output. The Guidelines for Subject Access in National Bibliographies give graded recommendations concerning subject indexing policies for national bibliographic agencies and illustrating various policies by providing best practice examples.</p>
