<abstract>
<p>Though the effectiveness of social marketing has been proven in various areas, it has captured scant research attention of tourism scholars. This article analyzes the social marketing characteristics of a number of tourism-related projects that have been funded by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Vietnam. The importance of NGOs in Vietnam’s development process is highlighted. A search strategy is described where some terms and phrases are combined to identify tourism-related development projects. Forty-five projects were found and assessed against a set of six social marketing benchmarks. Twenty-one projects match all the criteria, where different evaluation measures are noted. Significantly, no project labeled itself in terms of social marketing attributes. The social marketing label is thus not necessarily effective in identifying social marketing interventions in tourism-related projects. Despite some caveats, the article indicates that social marketing may be effective in promoting behavior change for sustainable tourism development and poverty alleviation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the term <italic>social marketing</italic> was first coined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1524500413484452">Kotler &amp; Zaltman, 1971</xref>), it has been applied in various fields such as public health, family planning, driver safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500413484452">Fox &amp; Kotler, 1980</xref>; MacFadyen, Stead, &amp; Zaltman, 1999), smoking prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524500413484452">Gordon, McDermott, Stead, &amp; Angus, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1524500413484452">MacKintosh, MacFadyen, &amp; Hastings, 1999</xref>), waste recycling, and environmental protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1524500413484452">Kassirer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1524500413484452">Tabanico &amp; Schultz, 2007</xref>). Yet, relatively little research attention is paid to the potential of social marketing in the field of tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500413484452">Chhabra, Andereck, Yamanoi, &amp; Plunkett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500413484452">Dinan &amp; Sargeant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524500413484452">Kaczynski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524500413484452">Kim, Borges, &amp; Chon, 2006</xref>). This is despite widespread attention being given to the importance of changing the behaviors of both tourists and tourism businesses, especially with respect to the development of sustainable tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524500413484452">Gössling, Hall, Lane, &amp; Weaver, 2008</xref>). Although some researchers have explicitly noted the potential role of social marketing in improving the sustainability of tourism practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500413484452">Dinan &amp; Sargeant, 2000</xref>), especially with respect to ethical consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524500413484452">Hall &amp; Gössling, 2013</xref>) and emissions reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1524500413484452">Peeters, Gössling, &amp; Lane, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1524500413484452">Scott, Gössling, &amp; Hall, 2012b</xref>). The general situation is well summed up by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1524500413484452">Lane (2009</xref>, p. 26) “the whole area of Social Marketing, of how to promote behavioural change, seems to be a blank for sustainable tourism researchers.”</p>
<p>Tourism is the short-term (usually less than 12 months) voluntary movement of people away from their home environment. Although often identified with leisure travel, tourism includes a wide range of short-term travel behavior for reasons including business, visiting friends and relations, religion, health, and education. Tourism is one of the largest global economic sectors and a significant contributor to many national and regional economies. From 1950 to 2010, international arrivals increased by an average of over 6% per year, from an estimated 25 million in 1950 to 940 million in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1524500413484452">United Nations World Tourism Organization [UNWTO], 2010</xref>). Importantly, international tourism trips are estimated to represent only 15% of all tourist trips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1524500413484452">Scott et al., 2012a</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1524500413484452">UNWTO (2011)</xref> forecasts that international tourism will exceed 1.8 billion arrivals by 2030. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1524500413484452">World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (2012</xref>), an international association of tourism-related corporations, globally tourism’s direct contribution to gross domestic product in 2011 was US$2 trillion and the industry generated 98 million jobs.</p>
<p>The scale of tourism-related movement has a range of impacts that may potentially be ameliorated by social marketing. Tourism is a significant contributor to global environmental change and contributes to changes in land cover and land use; energy use; biotic exchange and extinction of wild species; exchange and dispersion of diseases; and the production of pollution and carbon emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524500413484452">Hall, 2011</xref>). Changes in travel behavior have been identified as a means to reduce emissions, for example, by adopting different modes of transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1524500413484452">Scott et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1524500413484452">2012b</xref>), and in reducing introductions of diseases and pests, for example, by making tourists aware of prohibited plant and animal products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1524500413484452">Hall &amp; James, 2011</xref>). In addition, there have been concerted efforts by governments and the UNWTO to encourage the adoption of more environmentally friendly behaviors of tourism businesses with respect to lowering levels of energy use, emissions, and water use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1524500413484452">Scott et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1524500413484452">2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>Tourism is also associated with more positive impacts. Tourism is a significant source of foreign exchange earnings in the majority of the least developed countries and is promoted by the UNWTO, WTTC, and international development agencies as a means of poverty reduction and contributing to U.N. millennium development goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524500413484452">Gössling, Hall, &amp; Scott, 2009</xref>). However, in order to achieve such ambitions without unwanted sociocultural effects, long-term changes in visitor behavior at sites of cultural and heritage significance, as well as improvements in the mutual understanding between hosts and guests, may be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1524500413484452">Zapata, Hall, Lindo, &amp; Vanderschaeghen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the growing interest in the relevance of social marketing to tourism, it is therefore appropriate to examine its potential effectiveness in promoting behavior change for more sustainable tourism development and, in the case of the present study, for poverty alleviation in particular. Before examining social marketing in the context of NGO poverty alleviation projects in Vietnam as an exemplar of social marketing’s role in tourism-related economic and social development projects, this article will briefly discuss the main focus on existing tourism literature that explicitly recognizes the role of social marketing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1524500413484452">
<title>Social Marketing in Tourism</title>
<p>The exploration of social marketing in the tourism field began with Bright’s (2000) article published in the <italic>Journal of Leisure Research</italic>, which argued that the use of social marketing to communicate the multifaceted benefits of recreation and tourism activities to the public would help improve individual and societal quality of life. Bright also claimed that social marketing is consistent with the social welfare philosophy that drives the work of public recreation professionals, implying that there is a natural fit between tourism and social marketing, given that tourism is one form of recreation.</p>
<p>In the same year, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500413484452">Dinan and Sargeant (2000</xref>) argued that tourism development in a region could produce substantial unwanted economic and environmental impacts on local communities if it attracted a “wrong” type of tourist with behavior that was incongruent with the local context. Dinan and Sargeant proposed two strategies for sustainable tourism development. The first concentrated on attracting the segment of sustainable tourists who are attracted primarily by the natural beauty and historical values of the destinations. The second strategy, in contrast, focused on the least sustainable tourists where a social marketing mix could be used to influence their behavior and encourage them to adopt a visitors’ code of conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500413484452">Dinan &amp; Sargeant, 2000</xref>). Although not explicitly labeled social marketing, such codes of conduct are now widespread in the tourism industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524500413484452">Hall, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequent research has also focused on behavior change in potential tourists. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500413484452">Beeton (2001</xref>) introduced the concept of demarketing which entails the temporary or permanent discouragement of general customers or a specific segment of customers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500413484452">Beeton and Pinge (2003</xref>) proposed to move Australians from involvement in gambling behavior to spending money on domestic holidays. This process consists of two steps. First, demarketing is adopted to discourage gambling behavior. Second, remarketing is utilized to encourage holiday-taking behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500413484452">Beeton and Benfield (2002</xref>) argued that demarketing could also be used as a form of demand control for environmentally sensitive areas. An approach was also suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1524500413484452">Wearing, Archer, and Beeton (2007</xref>) for developing a greater focus on more targeted audiences and ecological messages in national park (NP) marketing.</p>
<p>The potential contribution of social marketing to the development of more environmentally friendly consumption behaviors is an increasingly significant theme in the tourism literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524500413484452">Gössling, Hultman, Haglund, Källgren, &amp; Revahl, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1524500413484452">Peeters et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1524500413484452">Scott et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1524500413484452">2012b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524500413484452">Kim, Borges, and Chon (2006</xref>) examined the psychological constructs of visitors attending the International Festival of Environmental Film and Video held in Brazil and proposed social marketing as means of improving participants’ environmental awareness. They indicated that the highly proenvironmental group of visitors was more likely to attend the festival given its thematic relevance to their existing psychological constructs. Kim et al. suggested that by adopting social marketing approaches, the balance between the host community’s long-term environmental interests, sociocultural constructs, and customers’ expectations could be maintained. However, the behavioral impacts of the psychological constructs were not examined. In addition, other factors influencing the target visitors’ choice of behavior (e.g., peer influence, contextual factors) were ignored.</p>
<p>Social marketing research has also targeted behavior change in tourism operations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1524500413484452">Shang, Basil, and Wymer (2010</xref>) note that some hotels have adopted social marketing methods to encourage their customers to reuse towels and linen so as to help hotels reduce resource use (while also lowering operating costs and improving their image). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524500413484452">George and Frey (2010</xref>) explored the possibility of developing social marketing strategies to encourage tour business owners in Cape Town to adopt positive attitudes and behaviors toward responsible tourism practices, while government-sponsored promotion of positive environmental behaviors to the accommodation and hospitality industries has been identified as a potentially significant mechanism to improve resource efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524500413484452">Gössling, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Social marketing has also been applied to tourism advertising. Sirakaya and Sonmez (2000) suggested that women in tourism advertisements are often depicted in a stereotypical fashion as being submissive, subordinate, and dependent on men and noted the potential for social marketing approaches to change the behaviors of tourism marketing organizations toward promoting gender equity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500413484452">Chhabra, Andereck, Yamanoi, and Plunkett (2011</xref>) indicated that tourism marketing organizations can adopt social marketing to dispel gender-biased images in their advertising with the generation of two main benefits. First, tourism organizations can better attract women as a lucrative target segment. Second, their members and customers’ awareness about marketing ethics can be improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500413484452">Chhabra et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Direct tourism-related research on social marketing is still very limited. A majority of tourism research exploring the potential contribution of social marketing is conceptual with discussions of social marketing and its departures from cognate concepts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500413484452">Beeton &amp; Pinge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500413484452">Bright, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524500413484452">Kaczynski, 2008</xref>). However, studies that are theoretically and methodologically informed are gaining prominence, with growing use of surveys, focus groups, and observational techniques (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500413484452">Chhabra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500413484452">Dinan &amp; Sargeant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524500413484452">George &amp; Frey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524500413484452">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1524500413484452">Shang, Basil, &amp; Wymer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1524500413484452">Sirakaya &amp; Somez, 2000</xref>). In general, empirical studies connecting social marketing with tourism are lacking. Nevertheless, the overall interest in academic and nongovernmental tourism research on behavioral change, especially in relation to sustainability, raises the question as to whether some tourism development initiatives may use the social marketing concept but may not actually label themselves as social marketing projects. It is thus necessary to devise appropriate social marketing criteria against which tourism projects can be assessed. This would then help demonstrate the effectiveness of social marketing as a possible means to encourage sustainable tourism as well as to add to the evidence base of social marketing itself. Therefore, the remainder of the article examines the social marketing characteristics of tourism-related projects funded by foreign NGOs in Vietnam, a nation where the government has regarded tourism as a spearhead sector in the national economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1524500413484452">Truong, 2013</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1524500413484452">
<title>The Roles of Foreign NGOs in Vietnam</title>
<p>Prior to examining the social marketing characteristics of tourism-related projects in Vietnam, the roles of foreign NGOs in these projects are discussed as well as their importance in the development of the country overall. In this research, NGOs are defined as private organizations that are established to meet some social objectives, are nonprofit focused, and independent of formal state systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500413484452">Dang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500413484452">Gray, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>After the American War (known as the <italic>Vietnam War</italic> in the West), Vietnam did not recognize civil society organizations, including NGOs, as independent entities until the 1986 renewal process. In the 1990s, foreign NGOs formally started to operate in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500413484452">Dang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500413484452">Gray, 2003</xref>) and were considered as important actors in the development arena for several reasons. First, the country was seeking rural development initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500413484452">Gray, 2003</xref>). Second, the country needed foreign aid and funding for industrialization and modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500413484452">Dang, 2009</xref>). Third, the collapse of the former Soviet Union resulted in less financial support for the country while it was still subject to U.S. economic sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500413484452">Dang, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the late 1990s, more foreign NGOs have commenced operations in Vietnam, gradually shifting from providing relief aid to alleviating poverty and sponsoring or implementing development projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500413484452">Dang, 2009</xref>). In the poverty alleviation field, foreign NGOs have contributed significantly to strengthening capacity for other civil society organizations, redefining poverty, and making it a policy priority. They are among the first to introduce the notion of public participation in governance in Vietnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1524500413484452">Nguyen, 2006</xref>), thereby creating opportunities for various publics to voice their opinions on policies and decision making. The success of foreign NGOs can be attributed to their independence from state structures, wide community outreach, and ability to work creatively and negotiate with the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1524500413484452">Nguyen, 2006</xref>). As of 2009, over 500 foreign NGOs were operating in Vietnam, representing over 28 countries and territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500413484452">Dang, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In tourism, foreign NGOs have primarily played the roles of sponsors and consultants in development projects. Initially, the primary focus was on tourism’s role as an economic justification for biodiversity conservation. In the early 1990s, NGOs introduced and funded a number of Integrated Conservation and Development projects (ICDPs) in protected areas (PAs) such as NPs and nature reserves (NRs) (Sage &amp; Nguyen, 2001). In the following years, the scope of NGO activity has broadened, especially with respect to a focus on poverty alleviation and sustainable tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500413484452">Dang, 2009</xref>). The German Technical Cooperation (GIZ, formerly GTZ), the Netherlands Development Organization (SNV), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Fauna and Flora International (FFI), often in conjunction with the Global Environment Facility (GEF), are among the most active in providing funding and technical assistance for many tourism-related projects countrywide. However, no comparative systematic assessment of these NGO projects has been conducted, with most assessments instead focused on individual projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500413484452">Choegyal &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500413484452">Dickinson &amp; Hoang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524500413484452">Frontier Vietnam, 2003</xref>). Therefore, to analyze the contents of these projects, a systematic search for project documents was made.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524500413484452">
<title>Search Strategy</title>
<p>To identify relevant projects and project documents, a search was made of relevant terms and phrases via electronic databases, which included Google, Google Scholar, the Mekong Tourism Coordinating Office website, Mekong Info Portal, and the library portals of major funding/consulting agencies (UNDP, GEF, FFI, and SNV). Personal correspondences with local tourism scholars and project organizations were also made to obtain project documents that were not otherwise available. Forty-five projects were found with sufficient relevant factsheets, baseline study reports, midterm, and/or final evaluation reports for analysis, while other projects with too little data were excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524500413484452">
<title>Social Marketing Benchmarks</title>
<p>Determining whether tourism-related projects can be considered in social marketing terms is difficult. This is because a widely accepted and easily applied definition of social marketing is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1524500413484452">McDermott, Stead, &amp; Hastings, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1524500413484452">Stead, Gordon, Angus, &amp; McDermott, 2007</xref>), although more than 45 academic definitions of social marketing have been suggested as of 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500413484452">Dann, 2010</xref>). One way to overcome this difficulty is to select project interventions that are labeled social marketing in their factsheets and/or final evaluation reports. However, prior research suggests that this is not an effective approach, given that a number of project interventions that appear to utilize the social marketing concept are excluded, whereas those that are more about advertising are included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1524500413484452">McDermott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1524500413484452">Stead et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, tourism scholars and practitioners have paid limited explicit attention to the role of social marketing as discussed earlier. Consequently, results obtained from a search strategy that is simplistically based on the social marketing label are most likely to be insufficient and even flawed. Thus, a more helpful solution is to identify what essential elements constitute a social marketing intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500413484452">Andreasen (2002</xref>) proposes a set of six benchmarks for labeling and evaluating social marketing interventions: voluntary behavior change, audience research, audience segmentation, use of social marketing mix, exchanges, and competition. These benchmarks have been applied by scholars and have proven useful in identifying the social marketing components of program interventions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1524500413484452">McDermott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1524500413484452">Stead et al., 2007</xref>). The present study therefore applies these benchmark criteria to the field of tourism.</p>
<p>However, a sole focus on individuals (<italic>downstream level</italic>) would limit social marketing’s effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500413484452">Buchanan, Reddy, &amp; Hossain, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1524500413484452">Smith &amp; Strand, 2008</xref>) because, in some cases, institutional arrangements and structures affect individual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524500413484452">Hastings, MacFadyen, &amp; Anderson, 2000</xref>). The notion of targeting the “upstream level” is thus suggested as a constituent of social marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500413484452">Donovan &amp; Henley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500413484452">Goldberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524500413484452">Hastings et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524500413484452">Kotler &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>), which will be included in this research. In addition, given their close relationship, the criteria of audience research and audience segmentation are combined. Hence, the six social marketing benchmarks used in this research include behavior change goal, audience research and segmentation, use of social marketing mix, exchanges, upstream targeting, and competition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524500413484452">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Project final evaluation reports were used for analysis given that they provided comparable information on project background, rationale, objectives, time frame, activities, and achieved results. Project factsheets, baseline studies, and mid-term reports were also referred to where relevant or where information was otherwise missing. They were assessed against the criteria outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524500413484452">Table 1</xref>. Twenty-one projects were judged to pass the six social marketing benchmarks. This means they had to:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Have a behavior change goal. This goal included preventing or mitigating illegal logging, hunting, forest burning; promoting the conservation of natural resources in tourist destinations; encouraging environmentally and socially responsible/sustainable tourism; motivating local people to actively participate in tourism; improving cooperation among various stakeholders; and motivating local authorities to establish and enforce conservation laws and regulations.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Have used audience research and segmentation. Projects demonstrated the implementation of community needs assessment, training assessment, interviews, focus groups, or piloting of project interventions. Segmentation typically included activities tailored to specific ethnic minority groups, communities, or villages.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Have used more than one element of the social marketing mix. This mix included product, price, place, and promotion and might also include people and policy.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Have considered what motivates people to change their behavior (exchange). Such exchanges might be tangible (new farming techniques, new rice varieties) or intangible (community pride).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Have targeted upstream level. This included the participation of local authorities, PA management boards and staff in project activities, and the use of advocacy activities for policy formulation and enforcement.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Have considered barriers to behavior change and adopted measures to minimize or eliminate these barriers (competition). The barriers might be internal and/or external. Measures might thus be taken to minimize these barriers.</p>

<sec id="section7-1524500413484452">
<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The projects differ considerably by location, objectives, duration, and funding sources. Fourteen projects were based in PAs. The other seven projects were focused on popular tourist destinations (e.g., Sapa, Ha Giang, Hue, Quang Tri, Quang Nam) and traditional villages (e.g., Duong Lam, Phuoc Tich, Duong Huong Hoa). While the 14 PA projects were primarily targeted at mitigating local residents’ dependence on forest resources for food and income, the other seven projects were aimed at promoting residents’ participation in tourism, enhancing stakeholder partnerships, motivating responsible tourism practices, and encouraging tourism stakeholders to reduce their resource consumption. All 21 projects followed on from the success of ICDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1524500413484452">Sage &amp; Nguyen, 2001</xref>) by targeting poor ethnic minorities residing within PAs and tourist destinations; and by adopting a participatory approach to project design, implementation, and evaluation. The most popular competing factors identified were local people’s poor perception of conservation needs and traditional dependence on forest resources (internal), stakeholder conflicts, and weak policy enforcement mechanisms (external). Socioeconomic baseline studies were widely used to gain insights into the living conditions of the target audience.</p>
<p>With respect to the exchange element, most projects used tangible incentives such as tourism benefits and alternative livelihoods (e.g., sustainable farming techniques, quality rice varieties) to motivate behavior change in the target audience. Only three projects used intangible factors (community pride and empowerment) in exchange for the proposed behavior (Bidup Nui Ba NP project, Cultural Conservation and Poverty Alleviation project, Support to Sustainable Tourism in Sapa project). While the offering of physical incentives seemed to have behavior impacts on the target audience, intangible benefits might lead to cognitive effectiveness on a broader (community-wide) scale. For example, the Cultural Conservation and Poverty Alleviation project provided new incomes for only 58 local households. Yet, the promotion of community pride through cultural vitalization resulted in the local community’s increased belief in the positive effects of tourism. It also gave local people more pride in their own community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1524500413484452">Netherlands Development Organisation [SNV], 2007</xref>). These effects contributed to improving the local community’s awareness of sustainability issues in relation to tourism development and hence reducing their dependence on natural resources.</p>
<p>Social marketing is not a theory in itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1524500413484452">Kotler &amp; Zaltman, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1524500413484452">MacFadyen et al., 1999</xref>). It instead combines several theories and models to motivate behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500413484452">Donovan &amp; Henley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1524500413484452">Kotler &amp; Zaltman, 1971</xref>). Some projects were underpinned by theories of community organization and participation that have also been influential in tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524500413484452">Hall, 2008</xref>). Community activities organized by these projects included drawing competitions, community consultations, community meetings, and community training (e.g., projects in Bai Tu Long NP, Kien Giang Biosphere Reserve, Pu Luong NR, Promoting Self-sustaining Community Development project, Cultural Conservation, and Poverty Alleviation project). A wide range of community members was encouraged to participate, including local men and women, village chiefs, teachers, and schoolchildren. Considerable attention was paid to the role of local Women Unions and, to a lesser extent, Youth Unions, in community organization (e.g., projects in Cat Ba NP, Kien Giang NR, and Sapa).</p>
<p>Social learning theory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500413484452">Donovan &amp; Henley, 2003</xref>) also appeared to be utilized. Examples of this include the offering of financial rewards to encourage local people to stop hunting and logging, and the organization of domestic and/or foreign study tours (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524500413484452">Table 3</xref>). The creation of community groups and clubs (e.g., Protected Areas for Resource Conservation (PARC) project, Responsible Travel Pilot project, Kien Giang Biosphere Reserve project) not only made local people, ex-hunters, and ex-loggers more responsible for conserving tourism resources, but also allowed them to learn from practical experience and act as role models. In addition, the formation of these groups suggests the importance of establishing community partnerships in promoting resource conservation as well as responsible pro-poor tourism practices. While these theories can be more or less focused on motivational, behavioral, or cognitive change, they all contribute to achieving the ultimate goal of behavior change in the target audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500413484452">Donovan &amp; Henley, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, research suggests that in some cases local people’s participation is more “relational” than “participatory” since no power is delegated to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1524500413484452">Liu, 2003</xref>). Given that most local people residing in the above project locations are poor and lack formal education, participation without distribution of power may turn out to be challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500413484452">Arnstein, 1969</xref>). To this end, tourism projects using a social marketing approach may benefit from Arnstein’s (1969) model of citizen participation, where participation is classified into eight levels and is arranged in a ladder pattern. The bottom rungs of the ladder are “manipulation” and “therapy,” which represent the “nonparticipation” level where local people are not enabled to participate in planning and implementing programs, but are “educated” or “trained” by power holders. The “tokenism” level, which consists of “informing,” “consultation,” and “placation,” allows opinions to be voiced by local people, who, however, are unable to make decisions affecting their lives. The highest level of participation includes “partnership,” “delegated power,” and “citizen control,” where local people are given full power in decision-making and management processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500413484452">Arnstein, 1969</xref>). Nevertheless, other scholars, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500413484452">Choguill (1996</xref>), argued that Arnstein’s model lacks applicability in developing countries, where power or control is not enough to guarantee community participation. Given the substantial interest in community-based tourism models and participatory development and community-based conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500413484452">Campbell &amp; Vainio-Mattila, 2003</xref>), further empirical research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of community participation models in the context of developing countries such as Vietnam.</p>
<p>Mass media and advocacy activities were utilized in 5 of the 21 projects, particularly when policy and regulation adjustments were required. For example, local radio and TV channels were used in the Ngoc Son Ngo Luong project because the local legal framework was not fully developed. Similar media channels were employed in the Bai Tu Long Bay project where poor mechanisms for conservation enforcement were identified. A number of TV documentaries and radio broadcasts were used in the Pu Luong project due to the local authorities’ weak capacity in making and enforcing conservation policies.</p>
<p>The use of evaluation methods varies among projects. Behavior change results were reported in five projects (Kien Giang Biosphere Reserve, Cat Tien NP and Chu Mom Ray NR, PARC project, Hoang Lien Son ecosystem, and Green Corridor project). These results were measured by the decrease in the number of violating behaviors (e.g., illegal hunting, logging, forest burning) after interventions were made. Seven of these projects measured their impacts in terms of increased environmental/conservation awareness (Bai Tu Long, Ngoc Son Ngo Luong, Tam Dao, Phong Nha–Ke Bang, Cat Ba, Van Long). Self-completion questionnaires were administered in the Sapa Integrated Environmental Education project where environmental awareness scores were used to measure the target audience’s change before and after interventions. The measure of increased participants adopting proposed behaviors was employed by six projects (Nam Dong, Tam Dao, Pu Luong, Responsible Travel Pilot, Van Long, and Support to Sustainable Tourism project in Sapa). Results are not available in five projects (Self-sustaining Community Development project, Bidup Nui Ba project, Ha Giang project, Environmentally and Socially Responsible Tourism project, and Bac Kan project) as they are still in progress. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1524500413484452">Table 4</xref> describes the areas and methods of evaluation used in these projects and their results. It indicates that some projects combined more than one area in their evaluations. Most projects were assessed by preevaluation and postevaluation in the form of surveys conducted on the same target audience. No project compared changes in attitude, awareness, or behavior of the target audience with those of the nontarget audience. In addition, almost all project evaluations were activity based, that is, they were made in accordance with the activities outlined in project time logs.</p>

<p>Socioeconomic baseline surveys were conducted to gain insights into the target audience’s lived conditions, needs, and wants (audience research) as noted earlier. Surveys were also administered to identify barriers facing the target audience in adopting the proposed behaviors (competition) as well as forces that might motivate them to adopt and maintain such behaviors (exchange). In addition, surveys were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of project interventions. The evidence suggests that surveys are among the most widely used methods in social marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1524500413484452">Redmond &amp; Griffith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1524500413484452">Tabanico &amp; Schultz, 2007</xref>). The use of surveys to measure the change in knowledge, attitude, awareness, and behavior of the target audience was also consistent with the incorporation of various theories and models aimed to conceptualize behavioral influences as discussed above.</p>
<p>The 21 projects were judged to have adopted social marketing principles in their design and implementation, that is, they attempted to achieve behavior change objectives, conducted surveys, and/or other methods to understand their target audience’s needs and wants. They also divided their target audience into different segments on which interventions were made and considered factors that motivated awareness and behavior change in the target audience (exchange). In addition, they demonstrated the use of different elements of the social marketing mix and addressed various barriers to behavior change (competition). Finally, they attached importance to the upstream level that included tourism stakeholders, local authorities, professional organizations, and government bodies.</p>
<p>Some projects did not have “specific” behavior change objectives (e.g., projects in Cat Ba NP, Cat Tien NP, Chu Mom Ray NR). However, evidence that they actually attempted to address behavior change could be found in project factsheets and evaluation reports (e.g., project indicators). Some projects only considered behavior change as one of a number of core objectives (e.g., Sustainable Tourism project in Sapa), while other projects identified specific barriers to and enablers of behavior change (e.g., Kien Giang Reserve project; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1524500413484452">Sebastian, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, behavior change was not always an explicitly stated project objective. Behavior change outcomes were often combined with other results or reported by the improved awareness in or increased involvement of the target audience as noted above. Although behavior change outcomes were not always clearly reported, changes in the target audience’s awareness, cognition, or perception of value might to a greater or lesser extent influence their choice of behavior in the long term.</p>
<p>This article aims neither to evaluate the effectiveness of social marketing in tourism-related projects in Vietnam nor to compare social marketing with other approaches. It instead seeks to identify the social marketing components in these projects and add to the evidence base of social marketing itself. The article shows that although some tourism-related projects used all elements of the social marketing concept, they did not refer explicitly to the field. No project labeled itself social marketing. Hence, the social marketing label was not useful in the search for project documents. This is also consistent with public health–related projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1524500413484452">Stead et al., 2007</xref>). The reported positive results suggest projects that are developed using social marketing principles may be effective. Although most projects were conducted over several years, their effects were assessed immediately after they finished. Often long-term effects were not reported. Many of these projects seemed to have had major influences on the upstream level, as evidenced by increased public participation and the use of mass media for advocacy activities.</p>
<p>These projects should be considered in light of some limitations. As noted, some projects did not consider behavior change as a specific objective. Their outcomes were thus reported by qualitative indicators such as increased awareness and/or participation. Quantitative indicators were untypical. The absence of a solid monitoring and evaluation system was a weakness in many projects (D. Hainsworth, former SNV Vietnam Tourism Advisor, personal communication, October 2011). Another important issue is quality of implementation. There were cases where the “exchange” element was not properly applied. For example, the PARC project conducted in Ba Be NP offered financial incentives for every hunting gun exchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1524500413484452">United Nations Development Programme, 2004</xref>). Yet, local people perceived the incentives as low and felt that they were forced to exchange their guns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1524500413484452">Zingerli, 2005</xref>). This highlights three issues. First, the perceived cost of exchanging guns was higher than the perceived benefit of incentives. Second, the exchange was not voluntary. Third, the evidence might indicate the power imbalance between the project organization and local people, where the former had financial and technical resources and support from the local authorities while the later was mostly poor people. These issues actually limited the project’s effectiveness, as demonstrated by the worsened relationships between the local authorities and communities. Local people instead turned to sell their guns in nearby markets for higher prices, where they might be repurchased and used for hunting again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1524500413484452">Zingerli, 2005</xref>). Another example is the Sustainable Tourism project in Sapa that offered benefit sharing in exchange for the active participation/support of local people. Leakage and corruption was reported in the local tourism fee collecting system (SNV, 2004) and might reduce the benefits that the locals were entitled to, increase skepticisms among them, and discourage them from supporting and participating in tourism.</p>
<p>Despite these caveats, this research may offer some suggestions for funding and consulting agencies. First, voluntary behavior change should be adhered to as the bottom line, that is, an explicit project objective and outcome. The change should be voluntary. To do this, the target audience need to be offered something they really need so that they volitionally adopt the proposed behavior. Second, the article supports the importance of audience research and segmentation in understanding the perceptions, needs, and wants of the target audience, as well as the barriers they face in adopting the proposed behavior. This suggestion thus confirms the importance of identifying and eliminating the “competition” element. Projects are regarded as social marketing if they demonstrate consideration of the competing behaviors or forces that prevent the target audience from adopting the proposed behavior. These may be internal or external or both. The competition to the termination of hunting, logging, and forest burning may be the local people’s poor understanding, their traditional dependence on natural resources for food and livelihood (internal), or the weak management capacity of the local authorities (external). To eliminate external barriers, the advocacy of policy makers, authorities, and professional organizations (upstream level) is very important. Overall, the findings suggest that the explicit adoption of social marketing may be a promising approach to addressing social issues in tourism development such as resource conservation and poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>Finally, it is noted that to label and evaluate social marketing interventions largely depends on the applicable criteria. This is a challenge for two reasons. First, a widely accepted definition of social marketing is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1524500413484452">McDermott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1524500413484452">Stead et al., 2007</xref>). Second, relatively little attention has been paid to the labeling and evaluation of social marketing interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500413484452">Andreasen, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500413484452">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500413484452">Doner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500413484452">Forthorfer, 1999</xref>). Further research, including tourism research, into this issue is thus much needed.</p>
