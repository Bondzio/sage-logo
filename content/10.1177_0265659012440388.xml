<p>This is a resource book targeting the inference and narrative skills of young people with communication difficulties. As well as a wide range of photocopiable pages for direct work with individuals or small groups, the book offers some brief theory on why inference is a key skill for comprehension. Practical pages divided into chapters follow on from the introduction with two chapters on inference, a chapter on narrative and a final chapter on sequencing.</p>
<p>A collection of simple but attractive line drawings that are age appropriate for secondary aged pupils form the basis of this resource. These illustrate a range of situations increasing in difficulty from single character portrayals to more complex composite pictures and sequences. Facial expressions are in the main quite simply portrayed, and students with particular difficulties in reading non-verbal cues may need additional modelling or exaggeration of the signals from their tutors to fully understand.</p>
<p>The ‘making an inference from a single picture’ section poses four basic inference questions to each picture. As in the later chapters, these could be further extended quite easily with ‘why’ and ‘how do you know that’ prompts to include verbal reasoning if required and appropriate. Materials in Chapter 2 develop the themes of inference further over the course of a sequence of interrelated events portrayed in a four-picture sequence, while Chapter 3 presents more complex scenarios involving multiple characters and motivations. The sequences in Chapter 4 are quite basic but relate well to experiences that secondary aged students may have encountered.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 also includes helpful narrative sheets at two different levels, which could equally be applied to picture sequences in Chapter 2 as an extension activity. For some students even further breaking down of the narrative sequence may be appropriate, possibly with visual support or with sentence starters to prompt. It may be interesting with some students to develop narratives created from any of the chapters into role plays, which may extend the application of the materials even further.</p>
<p>This is a good value resource that will be a useful addition to a practitioner toolkit for the development of that essential skill of inference. Whilst there is brief guidance on how to use the book – including a useful (and noted) suggestion for students to rank their ‘guesses’ on what may be happening from 1–10 on a plausibility scale – practitioners who are less experienced working with young people may have liked and benefited more from further suggestions on how to use the picture material more flexibly. More experienced teachers, speech and language therapists and other adults looking to help young people with communication difficulties could certainly bring their own ideas to extend the scope of the useful materials in various and imaginative ways.</p>
