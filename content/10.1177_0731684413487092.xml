<abstract>
<p>This paper experimentally investigates the flexural behaviour of circular steel rebar-coconut fibre reinforced concrete and flax fibre reinforced polymer tube-confined coconut fibre reinforced concrete composite beams. Conventional steel reinforced concrete beam and flax fibre reinforced polymer tube-confined plain concrete were considered as reference. A total of 18 beams were tested under 4-point bending. For flax fibre reinforced polymer-confined concrete specimens, two different tube thicknesses were used, i.e. 2-layers and 4-layers fabric. The effect of coconut fibre inclusion on the flexural behaviour of steel rebar-coconut fibre reinforced concrete and flax fibre reinforced polymer tube confined coconut fibre reinforced concrete beams were evaluated. In addition, the performance of flax fibre reinforced polymer tube-confined plain concrete and flax fibre reinforced polymer tube-confined coconut fibre reinforced concrete composite beams were compared with steel reinforced concrete and steel rebar-coconut fibre reinforced concrete beams. The test results indicate that coir inclusion slightly increased the load-carrying capacity but significantly enhanced the energy absorption of the steel rebar-coconut fibre reinforced concrete beam, compared to the steel reinforced concrete beam. For both flax fibre reinforced polymer-confined plain concrete and coconut fibre reinforced concrete, an increase in tube thickness provides a larger ultimate load, deflection and ductility of the beams. In comparison with the brittle failure of flax fibre reinforced polymer tube-confined plain concrete, coconut fibre inclusion modified the failure modes of flax fibre reinforced polymer tube-confined coconut fibre reinforced concrete to be ductile. The comparative study showed that 4-layer flax fibre reinforced polymer plain concrete and flax fibre reinforced polymer tube-confined coconut fibre reinforced concrete beams experienced lower deflection, higher ultimate load and higher energy absorption than the steel reinforced concrete beam.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684413487092" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>To date, reinforced concrete (RC) is still the most widely used construction and building material. Unfortunately, RC has a high permeability that allows water and other aggressive elements to penetrate, leading to carbonation and chloride ion attack resulting in corrosion problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413487092">1</xref></sup> As a matter of fact, the corrosion of steel rebar in concrete is the main reason for civil engineering infrastructure deterioration. In the United States, the upgrading of infrastructure has been estimated as $20 trillion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413487092">2</xref></sup> Ferreira mentioned that 40% of the 600,000 bridges in the US were affected by corrosion problems and estimated in 50 billion dollars for the repairing operations cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413487092">3</xref></sup> In the European Union, nearly 84,000 reinforced and pre-stressed concrete bridges require maintenance, repair and strengthening with an annual budget of £215 million, excluding the traffic management cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413487092">2</xref></sup> Gjorv conducted a study on Norway Ordinary Portland Cement bridges indicating that 25% of those bridges built after 1970 presented corrosion problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413487092">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials (with their high stiffness and strength-to-mass ratios, design flexibility and corrosion resistance performance) have been widely applied in civil engineering to strengthen or retrofit concrete structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413487092">5</xref></sup> The use of FRP is an innovative solution to the corrosion problem. One attractive application of glass or carbon FRP (GFRP or CFRP) composites is in the form of wrapped-jacket and tube to confine concrete columns and thus may enhance compressive strength and structural ductility remarkably.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413487092">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concrete-filled G/CFRP tube is an efficient structural building member exhibiting several advantages over conventional RC elements. In this new construction system, the FRP tubes were normally manufactured using a filament-winding technique or hand lay-up process. These pre-fabricated tubes, acting as stay-in-place structural formwork for fresh concrete, can also protect the encased concrete from the potential aggressive environment, e.g. de-icing salts and other chemicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413487092">7</xref></sup> The laminate structure of FRP tube can generally be engineered to offer the desired strength and stiffness in a specific direction by controlling the numbers of layers and angles at which layers of fibres are oriented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413487092">7</xref></sup> Therefore, FRP tubes can effectively replace steel reinforcement to increase concrete compressive strength and ductility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413487092">8</xref></sup> The application of GFRP or CFRP composites as an alternative of steel reinforcement for concrete structures provides a potential for increasing service life and environmental benefits for a variety of structural engineering applications, such as bridge piers, marine fender piles and poles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413487092">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Today, steel reinforcement is still very expensive that comes from a non-renewable resource with high energy consumption. Normally, each cubic meter of concrete structure requires an average of 200 kg of steel rebar.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413487092">10</xref></sup> It is reported that in Europe, the construction and building industries are responsible for the depletion of large amounts of non-renewable resources and for 30% of carbon dioxide gas emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684413487092">11</xref></sup> This calls for the development of new material to replace steel rebar as reinforcement of concrete to achieve a sustainable construction. Thus, natural flax fibre reinforced polymer tube-encased coconut fibre reinforced concrete (FFRP-CFRC) composite structure, as a new kind of concrete-filled FRP tube systems, was developed by the authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413487092">12</xref></sup> Coconut fibre is used in concrete because it has the highest toughness among natural fibres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413487092">13</xref></sup> Flax fibre is considered as the reinforcement for fibre reinforced polymer composite due to its comparable tensile properties to those of glass fibres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684413487092">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of cost-effective natural fibres (i.e. flax and coconut fibres) as building materials is a good step to achieve a sustainable construction because resources and energy consumption can be reduced remarkably and good energy efficiency without causing health and damaging eco-systems can be provided.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the flexural behaviour of circular coconut fibre reinforced concrete having steel rebar (SCFRC) and the FFRP-CFRC beams. The flexural performance of FFRP-CFRC composite beam is compared with conventional steel reinforced concrete (SRC) and the SCFRC beams. The effects of coconut fibre inclusion, FFRP tube thickness on the flexural behaviour (i.e. load carrying capacity, deflection behaviour and ductility) of SCFRC and/or FFRP-CFRC are evaluated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0731684413487092"><title>Experimental</title>
<p>In this study, 18 circular specimens having different composite materials were tested under 4-point bending to evaluate and compare the flexural behaviour of the specimens. The test matrix of the specimens is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684413487092">Table 1</xref>. These specimens are categorised into six different types: (1) steel reinforced concrete beam, termed as SRC, (2) coconut fibre reinforced concrete having steel rebar, termed as SCFRC, (3) 2-layers FFRP tube-confined plain concrete, termed as 2-layers FFRP-PC, (4) 4-layers FFRP tube-confined plain concrete, termed as 4-layers FFRP-PC, (4) two-layers FFRP tube-confined coconut fibre reinforced concrete, termed as 2-layers FFRP-CFRC and (6) 4-layers FFRP tube-confined coconut fibre reinforced concrete, termed as 4-layers FFRP-CFRC. For each specimen, the diameter of the concrete is 100 mm and the length of the specimen is 520 mm, respectively.

<p>FFRP tubes with 2 different layers (2 and 4 layers) but the same inner diameter (100 mm) were fabricated. Bidirectional woven flax fabric (550 g/m<sup>2</sup>) was used as the reinforcement of the tube.

<sec id="sec4-0731684413487092"><title>Steel reinforcement</title>
<p>Two different steel bar diameters were used for controlled SRC and SCFRC beams (Figure 2). Deformed steel rebars No. 8 (8 mm normal diameter) were used as the longitudinal reinforcement with a yielding tensile strength of 400 MPa and mild steel bars of 3.5 mm diameter were used as the transverse reinforcement with a yielding tensile strength of 500 MPa. In each beam, four No. 8M bars and four 3.5 mm bars were used. This corresponds to the beam with a high steel reinforcement ratio of 2.56%. The gap between the 2 adjacent transverse rebar was 100 mm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0731684413487092"><title>Concrete</title>
<p>Two concrete batches were cast, i.e. PC and CFRC. Both concrete batches were designed as PC with a 28-days compressive strength of 25 MPa. The concrete mix design followed the ACI Standard 211.1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413487092">17</xref></sup> The mix ratio by weight was 1: 0.68: 3.77: 2.96 for cement: water: gravel: sand, respectively. For CFRC batch, coconut fibre was added during mixing. The measure compressive strength of PC and CFRC at 28-days is 26.0 and 27.1 MPa, respectively.</p>
<p>To have CFRC with a proper workability, some actions were taken before and during the mixing. Before concrete mixing, the constituents of the concrete and coconut fibres were carefully placed in the mixer pan in order to have a relatively good homogeneous distribution of these constituents and the fibres. In the mixer pan, a layer of coconut fibres was spread at the bottom of the pan very slowly and carefully, followed by the spreading of aggregates, cement and sand. The first layer of the fibres was hidden under the dry concrete materials with the help of a spade. Then, another layer of the coconut fibres was placed and followed by the spread of the layers of aggregates, sand and cement. This process was repeated until the rest materials were put into the mixer pan. During mixing, a carefully mixing procedure was selected to make the homogeneous dispersion of the coir fibres into the cement matrix. Initially, about 50% of the water was added to concrete materials and the mixer was rotated for 4 min. Then, the mixer pan was switched off and a spade was manually controlled to mix the cement matrix material to have a more homogeneous dispersion of the materials. After that, the pan was switched on to mix and the remaining 50% of the water was added with two times into the mixer and the mixer was rotated for 3 min to get CFRC well mix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413487092">18</xref></sup> In this study, the workability of the CFRC was good because a relatively high water/cement ratio of 0.68 was used for the concrete mix design. This high water/cement ratio made the CFRC workable and allowed the proper compaction of the CFRC. Slump test was performed on the fresh concrete. The measured plain concrete had a slump of 75 mm and that of the CFRC decreased to 45 mm as a result of fibre inclusion. The CFRC was workable inspite of this low slump. The decrease in the workability of CFRC is due to the hydrophilic nature of the coconut fibres.</p>
<p>For each confined specimen, one end of the FFRP tube was capped with a wooden plate to generate as a formwork for the fresh concrete. Then concrete was poured, compacted and cured in a standard curing water tank for 28 days. Indeed, the compaction is not the same for PC and CFRC. Since coconut fibre inclusion caused less workability compared to the PC one, this may result in a slight growth of porosity for CFRC. Therefore, the compaction for PC and CFRC may be different.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0731684413487092"><title>Coconut fibres</title>
<p>The considered coir fibre weight content was 1% of the mass of the cement. Coir fibres were soaked in tap water for 24 h to soften the fibres and to remove the dust and a certain amount of the impurities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413487092">13</xref></sup> Next, the fibres were washed with fresh water to remove the remaining contaminants and soaked again for 2 h. These washing and soaking process were repeated three times. Then, fibres were straightened manually and combed with a steel comb and placed in an Elecfurn oven at 50℃ for 24 h to remove the moisture of the fibres. After this, the fibres were combed again and finally cut into the required length with a guillotine. The pre-treated coir fibres were cut into a length of 50 mm. The measured average tensile modulus, tensile strength and tensile strain at breaks of the coir fibres are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413487092">Table 3</xref>. The mechanical properties of single coir fibres were determined using a universal MTS-type tensile testing machine equipped with a 10 N capacity load cell. The considered gauge length was 10 mm. Before testing, the fibre was glued on a paper frame. Then, the frame was clamped on the MTS machine. The cross-head displacement applied was 1 mm/min. The test was repeated 5 times and the average values were reported.

<p>For SRC beams, diagonal cracks were observed in the shear span, crushing and spalling of the compression concrete was observed and vertical cracks were observed in the constant-moment region. The diagonal cracks in the shear span were pointed to the 2 concentrated load points due to the shear-flexure forces. With respect to SCFRC specimen, two major vertical cracks were observed in the constant-moment region. The specimen failed with the cracks of the concrete at the compressive zone between the 2 concentrated loads with considerable amount of permanent deformation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413487092">Figure 5</xref> shows the crack pattern of an SCFRC beam. The vertical cracks were thought to be the result of pure bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413487092">Figure 5(a)</xref>). Unlike the fully crushing and spalling of the compression concrete in the SRC beam, the coir fibre in the compression concrete held the cracks of the adjacent surfaces for the SCFRC beam, as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413487092">Figure 5(b)</xref>.

<p>Regarding 2-layers FFRP-PC and FFRP-CFRC specimens, in flexure, their failure started by the tensile rupture of the FFRP outer shell at the lowest point in the bottom section of the beam; the tensile crack began on the bottom section and progressed towards the upper section resulting in the propagation of a major crack in the tube. This main crack was almost perpendicular to the axis of the tube, as a result of the fibre orientation in the FFRP tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413487092">Figure 6</xref>). For 4-layers FFRP-PC and FFRP-CFRC specimens, their failure also initiated by the tensile rupture of the tube but the major crack in the tube was not really perpendicular to the axis of the tube, as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413487092">Figure 6</xref>. However, in the case of 2-layers and 4-layers FFRP-PC specimens, the major crack went through the entire tube and the composite member was suddenly broken into two halves, but in 2-layers and 4-layers FFRP-CFRC beams, the halves were not separated and held by the coconut fibres. The crack patterns of the concrete core were evaluated with the removal of the outer FFRP shell. It was observed that in the PC core, there were large amounts of vertical cracks and diagonal cracks in the concrete blocks. A major crack with small cracks was observed in the constant-moment region, but no diagonal cracks were observed in the shear span for the CFRC core. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413487092">Figure 7</xref> gives a close-up of coconut fibre bridging for the CFRC core. Obviously, the coconut fibres bridged the adjacent surfaces of the major crack.

<p>The experimental load carrying capacities of the specimens tested from 4-point bending are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684413487092">Table 4</xref>. It is clear that the 4-layers FFRP-CFRC beams have the largest ultimate load among all the types of the specimens. Coconut fibre inclusion slightly increases the lateral load of the SCFRC beam compared to the SRC beam, with the increase of 12.2% from 27.1 to 30.4 kN. Thus, coconut fibre inclusion is good for conventional SRC beams to have a higher load-carrying capacity. In other words, the use of coir fibre may be beneficial for reducing steel reinforcement which can reduce the use of non-renewable resource and energy consumption.

<p>In comparison with the FFRP-confined PC beams, the increase in the ultimate load of specimens due to coir fibre inclusion for 2-layers and 4-layers tube confinement are 9.2% (from 27.2 to 29.7 kN) and 7.4% (from 78.9 to 84.7 kN), respectively. The increase in tube thickness, from 2-layers to 4-layers, leads to the 190% and 185% enhancement in the ultimate loads for FFRP-PC and FFRP-CFRC beams, respectively. This data indicates that the increase in the flexural strength of the composite beam is mainly attributed to the contribution of the increase in the tube thickness in the tension side of the beams. Indeed, a larger tube thickness leads to a larger stiffness of the composite beam and thus a larger flexural strength. As displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684413487092">Table 2</xref>, the measured flexural modulus of 2-layers and 4-layers FFRP composites are 6.0 and 8.7 GPa, respectively. And the flexural strength of the 2-layers and 4-layers FFRP composites are 109 and 144 MPa, respectively. Therefore, an increase in FFRP leads to a larger increase in flexural strength of the FFRP-PC and FFRP-CFRC beams under 4-point bending. However, the increases in the thickness at the compression side of the beam are attributed to increase in compressive strengths of the beams, respectively. This was evident as crushing of concrete did not occur for all the tube-confined beams compared to the crushing of concrete in the SRC and SCFRC specimens. Obviously, the ultimate loads of 2-layers FFRP-PC and FFRP-CFRC are comparable to those of the SRC and SCFRC specimens. The ultimate load for 4-layer FFRP-PC and FFRP-CFRC are 191% (78.9 kN vs. 27.1 kN) and 179% (30.4 kN and 84.7 kN) larger than the corresponding SRC and SCFRC beams. This data indicates that in comparison with SRC beam, the FFRP-PC and FFRP-CFRC composite beams can be designed to have much larger lateral load-carrying capacity, thus a reduced cross-section size of the beam can be achieved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0731684413487092"><title>Deflection behaviour</title>
<p>In general, the SRC, SCFRC, FFRP-PC and FFRP-CFRC beams exhibit different load–deflection responses. The comparison of the ultimate deflections of the tested beams is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684413487092">Table 4</xref>. Typical load versus deflection responses of SRC and SCFRC, 2-layers and 4-layers FFRP-PC, and 2-layers and 4-layers FFRP-CFRC beams are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684413487092">Figure 8</xref>, respectively. For SRC and SCFRC beams, the load-deflection responses show a ductile post-peak response as a result of the use of the longitudinal and transversal steel reinforcement. It should be pointed out that the post-peak response of the SCFRC beam indicates a non-linear plateau where a slight decrease in load but a considerable amount of deflection is observed. The deflection of SCFRC (36.3 mm) is 77.9% higher than that of the SRC beam (20.4 mm). The small increase (12%) in deflection of 2-layers FFRP-CFRC due to coir fibre inclusion can be explained by the fact that in this case the deflection of the FFRP-CFRC composite beam is mainly dominated by the behaviour of the outer flax fibre reinforced polymer (FFRP) tube. In the 2-layers FFRP-CFRC beam, the resistance of the deformation of the beam is controlled by the FFRP tube, if the rupture of FFRP tube from the tension side occurs, the beam fails quickly. In this case, the coir fibre crack bridging effect is obviously in the concrete at the constant bending moment zone (see the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413487092">Figure 7</xref> of close-up of coir fibre bridging for tube-encased CFRC core), but it has slight effect on the concrete at other locations since no cracks was observed for the CFRC core at other locations. Hence, the contribution of coir fibre bridging effect on energy absorption of the specimen is relatively small and eventually leads to a small increase in deflection due to coir fibre effect. However, in the case of CFRC beam with steel rebar, the coir fibre bridging effect is not only displayed at the cracks at tension zone it also exists at the compressive zone of the concrete, and this can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413487092">Figure 5</xref> of close-up of cracks for SCFRC beam. Coir fibres bridge the macro-cracks in the concrete and provide an effective secondary reinforcement for crack width control. Also, the fibres prevent the crack propagation and transfer stresses across the cracked section, providing to concrete a residual strength. Therefore, much more cracks were bridged by the coir fibres which correspond to a larger energy dissipated of the beam; this eventually leads to a larger deflection of the beam, since we know the area under the load-deflection curve is the absorbed energy. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684413487092">Table 4</xref> also shows that the SRC and SCFRC beams have ultimate deflections much larger than all the tube-confined concrete beams, i.e. the deflection of SCFRC beam is 216.1% that of the 4-layers FFRP-CFRC beam (16.8 mm), which has the largest deflection among all the confined beams. For 2-layers and 4-layers FFRP-PC beams, the increase in tube thickness leads to an increase in deflection. Both FFRP-PC specimens show a typical brittle failure as that of the typical structural behaviour for FRP materials themselves, which exhibit non-yielding characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413487092">7</xref></sup> Unlike the FFRP-PC specimens, both 2-layers and 4-layers FFRP-CFRC beams exhibit somehow a ductile manner with coconut fibre addition as a result of coconut fibre bridging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413487092">Figure 6</xref>). Once the cracks initiated in the fibre RC, the fibres bear the applied loads. The fibres prevent the crack propagation and transfer stresses across the cracked section, providing to concrete a residual strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413487092">20</xref></sup> If these applied stresses exceed the fibre-matrix bond strength, fibre pullout and/or breakage of fibres occur, which absorbs large amount of energy. Thus, this leads to the ductile behaviour of CFRC core compared to the PC core.

<sec id="sec12-0731684413487092"><title>Energy absorption behaviour</title>
<p>As discussed above, the tested beams exhibited distinct ductility. The ductility of the beams as measured by energy absorption is listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413487092">Figure 9</xref>. Energy absorption is one of the important deformational characteristics of concrete structure to determine the ductility of the structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413487092">21</xref></sup> In this study, the energy absorption was determined as the area under the load–displacement curve. The integration of the load–displacement curve was performed numerically from the experimental data of the load-displacement along the whole load history. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413487092">Figure 9</xref>, it can be seen that the SCFRC beam has the largest energy absorption (856.4 kN·mm), which is slightly larger than that of the 4-layers FFRP-CFRC beam (793.6 kN·mm). The 2-layer FFRP-PC has the smallest energy absorption. However, the energy absorption of both 4-layers FFRP-PC (625.3 kN·mm) and FFRP-CFRC (793.6 kN·mm) are significantly larger than that of SRC beam (347.5 kN·mm). The data here indicates that the influence of coir fibre inclusion on energy absorption of conventional RC beam is significantly larger than that on ductility for tube-confined concrete structure. For the confined specimens, with an increase in tube thickness from 2-layers to 4-layers, the energy absorption of both FFRP-PC and FFRP-CFRC beams increases several timely, i.e. the increase of energy absorption is 411.3% (from 122.3 to 625.3 kN·mm) and 330.8% (from 184.2 to 793.6 kN·mm), respectively. This indicates that in the case of FFRP-confined concrete, the rupture of FFRP tube contributes to the majority of the energy absorption, as clearly displayed in Figure 8. Overall, the 4-layers FFRP-PC and FFRP-CFRC beams are superior to the SRC beam in energy dissipation and are very close to that of SCFRC. Regarding the SCFRC beam, the high-energy absorption is believed attributed to the large deformation of the steel (with a high reinforcement ratio of 2.56%) and the fibre pull-out and breakage which dissipated large amount of energy.

<p>This paper experimentally investigated the flexural behaviour of four different circular concrete beams, i.e. conventional SRC, coconut fibre reinforced concrete having steel rebar (SCFRC), flax fibre reinforced polymer tube (FFRP)-confined plain concrete (FFRP-PC) and FFRP tube-confined coconut fibre reinforced concrete composite (FFRP-CFRC) beams. The effect of coir fibre inclusion on the flexural behaviour of SCFRC beams and the effect of FFRP tube thickness and coir fibre inclusion on the flexural behaviour of FFRP-CFRC beams were evaluated. The flexural behaviour of FFRP-PC and FFRP-CFRC beams were compared to those of SRC and SCFRC beams. This study reveals:
<list id="list1-0731684413487092" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In comparison with SRC beam, adding coconut fibre is effectively to increase the ultimate load (increase of 12.2%), deflection (77.9%) and ductility (146.4%) of the SCFRC beam remarkably. This indicates that the addition of coconut fibre can be used to reduce the steel reinforcement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compared to the FFRP-PC beams with the same tube thickness, coconut fibre inclusion increases the ultimate load, deflection and ductility of the FFRP-CFRC beam. Remarkably, the coconut fibre inclusion modifies the brittle failure of FFRP-PC beam to be ductile as a result of the coconut fibre bridging.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For confined concrete beam, the FFRP tube confinement provides a larger load and energy absorption of the beams. The increase in load and energy absorption is highly dependent on the tube thickness of the confined beam. The influence of FFRP tube thickness on the improvement of energy absorption of the beam is more significant than that of coconut fibre on the energy absorption of the beam.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>SRC beams failed with diagonal cracks in the shear span, crushing of compression concrete and vertical cracks in the constant-moment region. SCFRC beams failed with two major vertical cracks in the constant-moment region and cracks of the compression concrete. All the FFRP tube-confined concrete beams tested failed in flexure with the tensile rupture of FFRP tube.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The test results indicated that FFRP-CFRC beams exhibited less deflection, higher ultimate load and ductility compared to the conventional SRC beams. The load and energy absorption of SRC beam, with a high steel ratio of 2.56%, are 34.3% and 53.9% for 4-layer FFRP-PC and 32.0% and 43.8% for 4-layer FFRP-CFRC beams, respectively.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compared to the SCFRC beams, the 4-layers FFRP-CFRC beams had comparable energy absorption capacity, but the ultimate loads are 178.6% larger than that of the SCFRC beams.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In general, the FFRP-CFRC beam has flexural performance superior to that of the conventional steel RC beam. More studies on coconut fibre reinforced concrete having steel rebar beam should be considered in order to partially replace the steel reinforcement for RC design.</p>
