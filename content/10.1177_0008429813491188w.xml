<p>The study of Islam within the context of Religious Studies is often critiqued both for its failure to take into account the methodological considerations of the larger discipline and for its failure to contribute meaningful data to the overall enterprise. Marilyn Waldman’s posthumous work – left in a partially edited form when she died in July 1996 – demonstrates the potential that Islamic studies has to both learn from and add to broader conversations about the study of the religion.</p>
<p>An investigation of the idea of “comparison” consumes the first quarter of the book. It has often been observed that it is a human trait to assemble data from the world around us and then classify those facts according to similarities and differences as they appear to us. In doing so, we engage in acts of comparison and generalization. In the creation of the categories for comparison we structure the world around us, reflecting our own understandings through those classifications. For Waldman, the notion of prophecy, a key classificatory term in the study of religion, is messy and confusing with the outcome of any study of the phenomenon driven by the data selected and the definition imposed, and dictated by the “anticipated outcomes and the constructed contexts” (p. 12). Five strategies are identified from previous studies that illustrate this point. Some start with a certain definition of prophecy and/or prophets from within a given religious tradition (usually Judaism and Christianity) and then “compare” that with other religions; others focus on typological generalizations based on social roles that may be observed from assembled data. Waldman enunciates an approach which she feels “combines the strengths and resists the limitations of these five strategies” (p. 28). The goal is to move beyond “common sense” and conventional wisdom and undertake comparison through a study of cross-cultural “privileging communication.” This category – deemed a “conversational space” – imposes no immediate definition of a “religious” activity but rather leaves the distinction between religious (“extra-human”) and non-religious communication open for investigation. What we end up comparing are different systems, without supposing that they align in their constituent elements. The opposition to the person claiming privileging communication within his or her historical and cultural situation then becomes fundamental to understanding how the category is created within its own context.</p>
<p>The more detailed investigation of Islam starts in chapter 2 with attention to the way in which the Qur’an uses comparison to explain the role of Muhammad as <italic>nabi </italic>and <italic>rasul </italic>(“prophet” and “messenger”). The observation is made that Muhammad’s prophetic role does not fit the popular and scholarly image of the place of prophecy because “the English word ‘prophet’ rarely coincides with the role of ‘leader’” (p. 48), as is understood to be the case with Muhammad. This is, of course, a point of contention with a long legacy when it comes to Islam; yet it is a central point of the Qur’an, Waldman suggests, in that it uses comparison to assert Muhammad’s role as uniquely involving privileging communication, opposition and leadership. The comparisons were embedded in narratives about those people of the past who performed similar tasks (i.e. the so-called “past prophets”). Muhammad claimed “to be like previous prophets and messengers, like Moses and Jesus, but to be categorically different than figures like sorcerers, poets and soothsayers” (p. 50). It is in this way that the identity and person of Muhammad emerge in the text; both through his similarity to those of the past from the point of view of God and through his difference from those same people in the eyes of his detractors does Muhammad as the social actor emerge. Such an observation speaks to the nature of comparison itself: “… the comparative enterprise does not deal with phenomena in their totality; rather it selects certain aspects to examine closely. These comparisons are never self-evident – they are always strategic choices made to deal with specific questions” (p. 78). Waldman also notes the absence of predictive ability and eccentricity in the portrayal of Muhammad, attributes commonly associated with the category conveyed by the English word “prophet.” From there, Waldman extends her study in chapter 3, to look at Muhammad as “exemplar and foil” – that is, the way in which his figure acts as a position of comparison in later Islamic civilization. A reshaping of the messenger figure took place across communal boundaries through the Muslim emphasis on the notion of the “seal of the prophets.” Both the biography of Muhammad and the prophet’s own words as embedded in the <italic>sunna</italic> convey this aspect. Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian perspectives are examined for what they reveal about the arguments that went back and forth with Muslims, especially concerning notions of authority.</p>
<p>The final chapter of the book is “An experiment in comparison: Muhammad and Alinesitoué,” written with Robert Baum and published in a previous version in 1992. Both “prophetic” figures are described as using privileging communication from an extra-human source to oppose the status quo of their societies. Alinesitoué was a 20th century Diola woman from the region of Senegal, whose visions led her to establish a shrine to the life-producing power, Emitai, who is closely linked to the occurrence of rain. The comparison of the two figures focuses on “innovation through renovation” (p. 154) and the social remapping that such a process produces.</p>
<p>This is a remarkable book that provides significant material for extended reflection; it will prove profitable to all those who feel that religious studies really is about “comparative religion” and who thus wish to think about what that really means and how best to go about the task. The work is complemented by two very appreciative essays on Marilyn Waldman and a bibliography of her works.</p>
