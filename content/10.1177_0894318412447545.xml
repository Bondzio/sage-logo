      <p>I am once again honored to have the opportunity to share my thoughts with readers of the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary issues of <italic>Nursing Science Quarterly</italic>. In my first essay, I shared thoughts about nursing science and nursing sciencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447545">Fawcett, 2012b</xref>). In my second essay, I shared thoughts about evidence-based nursing practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447545">Fawcett, 2012a</xref>). In this essay, I share thoughts about concept analysis.</p>
      <p>A concept is a label, expressed as a word or phrase, that summarizes the essence of a phenomenon. A concept may be relatively abstract or relatively concrete. Conceptual model concepts are relatively abstract whereas middle-range theory concepts are relatively concrete. For example, the conceptual model concept of adaptation is quite abstract, whereas the middle-range theory concept of adjustment, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447545">DeSanto-Madeya and Fawcett (2009)</xref> selected to represent adaptation, is more concrete.</p>
      <p>Concept analysis is a technique used to identify the attributes, properties, or dimensions of a concept. A concept analysis is conducted to enhance understanding of the meaning of a concept beyond a simple dictionary definition.</p>
      <p>I maintain that the <italic>first step</italic> of a concept analysis should be to select a conceptual model that will provide the frame of reference or context for the concept analysis. My position is consistent with the post-positivist perspective that phenomena are theory-laden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447545">Paley, 1996</xref>). The <italic>second step</italic> is to select a concept of the conceptual model. The concept serves as the guide to the <italic>third step</italic>, which is to select a middle-range theory concept that represents the conceptual model concept. For example, a concept analyst might select the Roy adaptation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447545">Roy, 2009</xref>) as the frame of reference for the concept analysis and then select the role function mode of adaptation as the conceptual model concept of interest. A middle-range theory concept that represents the role function mode of adaptation could be functional status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447545">Tulman &amp; Fawcett, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>When selecting the middle-range theory concept, it is imperative that the concept, per se, is not confused with an application of the concept to a particular population. For example, fatigue is a concept, whereas postpartum fatigue, shift worker fatigue, radiation-related fatigue, and chemotherapy-related fatigue are examples of application of the concept of fatigue to specific patient populations. If the concept analyst thinks that a concept differs across populations, then he or she must consider whether a different label for the concept is needed. For example, if a concept analyst thinks that the fatigue experienced by women following childbirth is different from fatigue experienced by other people, then postpartum fatigue is the correct label for the concept; it is not an application of the concept of fatigue. Inasmuch as my reviews of published concept analyses indicate that concept analysts and peer reviewers frequently confuse a concept with its application, this point is especially important.</p>
      <p>
         <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447545">Walker and Avant (2011)</xref> described different approaches to understanding concepts, including concept derivation, concept synthesis, and concept analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447545">Rodgers and Knafl (2000)</xref> included several approaches to concept analysis in their book, such as the Wilson method of concept analysis, which is similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447545">Walker and Avant’s (2011)</xref> approach, evolutionary concept analysis, the hybrid method of concept analysis, the Norris method of concept clarification, simultaneous concept analysis, a multiphase approach, and dimensional concept analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447545">Parse (1997)</xref> offered an approach she called concept inventing, which she described as “a multidimensional all-at-once process of analyzing-synthesizing, bringing to life novel unitary concepts” (p. 63).</p>
      <p>
         <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447545">Risjord (2009)</xref> identified three types of concept analysis. A <italic>theoretical</italic> concept analysis involves retrieval and analysis of theoretical and empirical literature. In contrast, a <italic>colloquial</italic> concept analysis involves collection and analysis of data from human beings and retrieval and analysis of the meanings of the concept from an unabridged dictionary. The <italic>mixed method</italic> type of concept analysis involves integration of results of theoretical and colloquial concept analyses.</p>
      <p>If the concept analyst adheres to my position of starting with a conceptual model as the frame of reference for the concept analysis, all data from the literature, dictionaries, and human beings have to be collected within the context of that conceptual model. For example, use of the Roy adaptation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447545">Roy, 2009</xref>) as the context for a concept analysis of the middle-range theory concept of functional status guides the analyst to collect data that are about functional status as adaptation to environmental stimuli.</p>
      <p>Other well-known steps of concept analysis, which vary with the approach to concept analysis used, are analysis and integration of the data; identification of the attributes, properties, or dimensions of the concept; identification of the antecedents and consequences of the concept; statement of the definition of the concept; identification of one or more empirical indicators that can be used to measure the concept; and preparation of a written report of the concept analysis. When the conceptual model concept, middle-range theory concept, and an empirical indictor have been specified, a conceptual-theoretical-empirical structure is created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447545">Fawcett &amp; Garity, 2009</xref>). An example is illustrated in the figure.</p>
      <fig id="fig1-0894318412447545" position="float">
         <label>Figure 1.</label>
         <caption>
            <p>An example of a conceptual-theoretical-empirical structure for a concept analysis of functional status.</p>
         </caption>
         <graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0894318412447545-fig1.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Some concept analysis approaches include construction of model, contrary, related, borderline, and invented cases. Cases are examples of what the concept is and what the concept is not. A model case is an example of what the concept absolutely is. A contrary case is an example of what the concept absolutely is not. A related case is an example of the concept and another very similar concept. A borderline case is an example of what the concept might or might not be. An invented case is used when the concept cannot be clarified from the available literature. The final report of the concept analysis may or may not include one or more cases.</p>
      <p>I regard the results of the concept analysis as a middle-range descriptive or explanatory theory, which should be linked explicitly with the conceptual model that guided the concept analysis. A middle-range descriptive theory is a theory that includes just one concept and its definition. For example, a Roy adaptation model-guided concept analysis of functional status might reveal that the definition of functional status is performance of basic, instrumental, and advanced activities of daily living. A middle-range explanatory theory includes two or more concepts that are related. An explanatory theory would be made up of the concept, defined as a set of attributes, properties, or dimensions, and the concepts that make up the antecedents and the consequences. For example, a Roy adaptation model-guided concept analysis of functional status might reveal that functional ability is an antecedent to functional status, and adjustment is a consequence of functional status.</p>
      <p>Risjord (2007) pointed out that gaps between data and result are evident in many reports of concept analysis. Avoidance of such gaps, which is crucial to comprehensive understanding of the concept, can be accomplished if the concept analyst provides theoretical and empirical justification for selection of the attributes, properties, or dimensions, as well as the antecedents and consequences. In addition, the concept analyst should account for various theoretical and colloquial uses of the concept within the context of the conceptual model used to guide the concept analysis.</p>
      <p>My thoughts about concept analysis continue to be shaped by my commitment to development of distinctive middle-range nursing theories within the context of nursing conceptual models and by my conviction that the results of diverse modes of inquiry are middle-range theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447545">Fawcett, 2012a</xref>). I encourage you to share your thoughts about concept analysis in the pages of another 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary issue of <italic>Nursing Science Quarterly</italic> and in the pages of issues of future years.</p>
