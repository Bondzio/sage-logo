<abstract>
<p>This study examines the Korean <italic>ondol</italic>, the major residential heating method in Korea, and its related house features, particularly the rich symbolic meanings and associated lifestyles. By doing so, this study strives to understand the social aspects of Korean life that are embedded in the structure of Korean residential buildings. The study collected data from (a) scholarly articles on the ondol, (b) popular media, and (c) 30 interviews with elderly Koreans. Qualitative content analysis of these data reveals several contested meanings associated with the Korean ondol: thermal contrast, social dynamics, incubation, practice of everyday life, rootedness, healing/well-being, ethnic identity, modernization, and labor. While the narratives from the interviewees were firmly anchored in real-life situations, the narratives of popular media and scholarly articles showed departures from everyday experiences when discussing the ondol, often romanticizing and associating this building feature with Korean ethnic identity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Korean heated floor, the <italic>ondol</italic>, is a residential heating method widely used in Korea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1206331212460166">1</xref></sup> Although it is one of many heating options available in Korea, the ondol is more than a simple heating method: It is an essential part of the Korean house structure and the domestic life that takes place within it. In traditional Korean houses in particular, the ondol dictated how different rooms were structurally joined together and constructed, influencing the overall configuration of the house (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1206331212460166">Figure 1</xref>). It also dictated, along with the Confucian ethical order that emphasized women’s subordinate positions within a family, the familial relations in Korean homes by prescribing who managed the fire and who remained on a warm spot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1206331212460166">2</xref></sup> The physical structure of the traditional ondol was so integrated with the familial relations and daily practices of life that trained eyes could easily guess the daily routines of the occupants, including activities such as cooking, eating, and sleeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1206331212460166">Shin, 2012</xref>). Recent technological innovations in radiant heating methods and building technologies, along with a reduced emphasis on Confucian teaching in Korean society overall, have gradually disintegrated this close relationship, granting more freedom for day-to-day activities in Korean homes.</p>

<p>Because of its centrality in the Korean house structure and the close relationship to family life in it, the traditional ondol oftentimes conjured up a stereotypical image of Korean domestic life. Similar to the meanings and experiences of “home” identified by Euro-American literature, firsthand experience of the Korean ondol reveals a phenomenological sense of home as heaven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1206331212460166">Bachelard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1206331212460166">Buttimer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1206331212460166">McDowell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1206331212460166">Munro &amp; Madigan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1206331212460166">Relph, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1206331212460166">Seamon, 1979</xref>), home as a place of marginalization and oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1206331212460166">Ahrentzen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1206331212460166">Dowling &amp; Pratt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1206331212460166">McDowell, 1999</xref>), home as a place of everyday practice and therefore a representation of social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1206331212460166">Bahloul, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1206331212460166">Bourdieu, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331212460166">Pader, 1993</xref>), and home as a place with multiple identities and voices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1206331212460166">Massey, 1997</xref>). In this sense, talking about the traditional ondol is similar to talking about traditional Korean homes and their associated social structures.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the recent recognition that the ondol is uniquely Korean has created new, distinctive meanings. The long history of the ondol that goes back to prehistoric times<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1206331212460166">3</xref></sup> and the fact that the traditional Korean lifestyle was deeply rooted in the ondol structure allowed Koreans to see it as a representation of Korean culture. Because of recent commercialism and antimodernist discourse in the Korean building industry, which sees modern buildings as a root problem of current ailments such as asthma, and backed up by the traditional healing techniques based on Ying/Yang theory, the healing effects of the traditional warm floor on physical discomfort has gained renewed recognition.</p>
<p>The multiple meanings associated with the Korean ondol help us see that the Korean ondol is not just a simple heating method; It is an integral part of the Korean house structure that actively interacts with the human behaviors in it, both symbolically and practically. This study examines this interaction by exploring the following questions: (a) What place experiences, and environmental meanings in particular, are associated with the ondol’s material structure?; (b) How are these meanings related Korean family lifestyles, cultural values, and attitudes about family members?; and, finally, (c) How are these meanings and associated practices of everyday life differently constructed by various social groups, depending on age and gender?</p>
<p>These questions were explored based on a theoretical proposition that the meanings of place arise from the everyday practices that take place within a structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1206331212460166">Bourdieu, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331212460166">Cieraad, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1206331212460166">Cohen, 1986</xref>). As people within a given place have different roles, and therefore different everyday practices and routines, place acquires multiple meanings and identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1206331212460166">Massey, 1997</xref>). One may enjoy the phenomenological sense of home as a heaven, a refuge from the harsh world outside, or a mother’s love, while others may experience the sample place as a locus of oppression and isolation. This close link between the meaning of place and everyday practice leads to the next proposition that, as everyday practice changes, so do the meanings of place, even if the material structure of the place remains the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331212460166">Cieraad, 1999</xref>, p. 5). Place is not an entity in a frozen scene, but a continuing process anchored in a specific history and geographic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1206331212460166">Cresswell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1206331212460166">Massey, 1997</xref>). Therefore, once everyday practice is separated from the place, the meaning deforms or disappears. In the case of the old Korean ondol, the meanings it had were romanticized, glorified, understated, or eliminated as the heating system developed along with technological advancements in Korea.</p>
<p>To explore these theoretical propositions, research data are gathered from various sources: (a) scholarly articles on various aspects of the ondol, (b) popular media, and (c) interviews with Korean American seniors. During the initial analysis stage, important themes associated with the ondol are extracted from all three data sources using qualitative content analysis. Comparing the outcomes from scholarly articles and popular media and that of the interviews revealed substantial differences in terms of identified meanings. The different voices identified in the study demonstrate that the meanings and experiences of the ondol and related Korean domestic life are multidimensional, contested, and continue to evolve in response to changing social contexts in contemporary Korea.</p>
<sec id="section2-1206331212460166">
<title>Historical Background: Development of the Ondol</title>
<p>The ondol has a long history in Korea. While the origin of the system still remains controversial, the primitive forms of the ondol first appeared between the 4th century <sc>bce</sc> and the 1st century <sc>bce</sc>. Before this time period, Korean residences, like many European residences until the 12th century, had an open fire hearth that emptied through the roof or a high window. From around the 4th century <sc>bce</sc>, Koreans began to partially enclose the fire hearth with materials with high thermal capacity, such as earth or stone. They also started to extend the chimney horizontally so that the residents could use the top surface to warm their bodies. After the 11th century, the fire hearth moved outside the home, and the warm air passage expanded to the whole floor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1206331212460166">N. Kim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1206331212460166">Yeo, Yang, &amp; Kim, 2003</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1206331212460166">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The ondol changed its physical structure once again in the middle of the 20th century, following the industrialization and urbanization in Korea. Urbanization brought an increase in population and residential real estate, which created an exorbitant need for timber as fuel. As a result, significant deforestation became widespread, and it became harder to get quality wood for fuel. For this reason, the traditional ondol was no longer sustainable as a popular heating system for urban dwellers. After the Korean War in the 1950s, the fuel for the ondol was gradually replaced by anthracite briquettes in an effort to preserve the fast disappearing forests, particularly in South Korea. Though one piece of pressed charcoal could keep the whole family warm for several hours, the carbon monoxide that leaked into rooms silently killed hundreds of people in winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1206331212460166">N. Kim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1206331212460166">Lankov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1206331212460166">Yeo et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>After brief use of this rather dangerous system, the ondol underwent another major transformation in late 1970s in South Korea. Boilers replaced furnaces, water pipes replaced hot air passages, and hot water replaced hot air. The boiler system also replaced the partially open furnace that was also used for cooking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1206331212460166">N. Kim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1206331212460166">Lankov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1206331212460166">Yeo et al., 2003</xref>). From this point on, kitchens and heating have been separated, and the ondol became used solely for room heating.</p>
<p>The evolution of the ondol had several implications to Korean family life. First, as the thermal characteristics of the floor changed, the nature of family activities changed. In old houses, strong temperature gradation on the floor, which was often freezing cold on one side and sizzling hot on the other, dictated how spaces were allocated both to individual family members and for a variety of collective domestic activities, such as sleeping, dining, and family entertainment. Changes in temperature distribution in modern building systems has erased these restrictions, granting family activities much more flexibility in terms of where, when, and how they take place. Second, along with the Confucian ethical order that emphasized women’s subordinate positions within families, the ondol dictated women’s daily routines, prescribing what, how, and when various housekeeping activities should be carried out. Keeping and maintaining the fire was exclusively the women’s job because the fire hearth of the ondol was located in the kitchen, where the fire was used not only for heating rooms but also for cooking. The late arrival of boiler systems and separate sets of stoves for cooking in modern buildings changed women’s lives, granting more flexibility and freedom. Third, the long historical evolution of the ondol structure throughout Korean history enabled Koreans to recognize it as essentially Korean. Although the technical details of the system have dramatically changed, especially since the beginning of the 20th century, Koreans embraced the warm floor as the origin of a traditional Korean lifestyle and a source of authentic “Koreanness” as the search for cultural identity and distinctiveness became a major issue in the era of globalization.</p>

<title>Research Design and Data Collection</title>
<p>This study employed a qualitative content analysis, using three distinctive data sources: scholarly articles on the ondol published in peer-reviewed journals in Korea, popular media, and, finally, in-depth interviews with Korean American seniors. The first stage employed a meta-analysis of the existing Korean literature on the Korean ondol. Physical and thermal characteristics of the ondol were synthesized and reconstructed using this literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1206331212460166">4</xref></sup> The second stage employed an interpretive analysis of the Korean ondol as expressed by popular media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1206331212460166">5</xref></sup> In the third stage, interviews were conducted with aged Korean immigrants, using a semistructured, in-depth interview protocol with open-ended questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1206331212460166">6</xref></sup> The reason behind this age selection criteria was that people in their 50s or older were believed to have experience with the full spectrum of the Korean ondol, from traditionally built ones to the modern system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1206331212460166">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Korean American seniors were chosen primarily because of their proximity to the author’s research institution. The fact that the interviewees were immigrants to America, where they do not have access to the Korean ondol, created interesting dynamics during the interview. Unlike their Korean counterparts who take for granted having warm floors in their residences, the interviewees were well aware of the difference between having and not having a warm floor in their everyday lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1206331212460166">8</xref></sup> Most of the interviewees deeply appreciated the warm floors they used to have back in Korea and tried to imitate the same effect in their American residences by using electric mats or blankets on the floors. While one may argue that their narratives are based on past memory, which is clearly a reconstruction of the past rather than an accurate record, the author proceeded with the assumption that all self-reported interviews or surveys are essentially recollections of the past, and this recollection is important because it is this reconstruction of the past that informs the decisions that people make in everyday practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1206331212460166" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The themes identified from the three data sources created two overall patterns. First, most of the narratives concentrated on the old ondol system where thermal gradation and the hard labor that went into the system created visceral experiences in everyday lives. Whenever probing questions were posed to elicit any experiences in relation to newer ondol systems, interviewees simply remarked that they were very convenient or there was nothing much to do to maintain them. Narratives from popular media showed a similar tendency. Second, the result of the three different data sources yielded interesting overlaps, as well as differences. This helped in identifying the multiple meanings constructed by the various groups. Interviewees who were very old talked more about the significance of the ondol in everyday life, whereas interviewees in their 60s or younger, and the authors of the popular media, nostalgically recalled the ondol as part of their childhood memories from Korea. The scholarly articles on the physical components of the ondol provided rather neutralized information on the historical development of the ondol system, against which the narratives from both the interviews and popular media were verified. A small group of scholarly articles showed clearly nationalistic stances, arguing that the ondol is a uniquely Korean asset with which Koreans can represent their cultural identity. Nine themes were identified from these sources: thermal contrast, social dynamics, practice of everyday life, incubation, rootedness, healing and well-being, ethnic identity, development and modernization, and labor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1206331212460166">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1206331212460166">2</xref>).

<title>Content Analysis Theme by Theme</title>
<sec id="section6-1206331212460166">
<title>Thermal contrast</title>
<p>Three different types of thermal contrast shaped the family life formed on the old ondol system. Both the interviewees and narratives in popular media constantly mentioned the contrast between the cold outdoor and warm indoor, the contrast between cold indoor air and the warm floor, and the contrast between the colder side of the floor and the warmer side of the floor.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The room was always warm. There was always a blanket to keep it warm in the winter. As soon as someone came in from the cold outside, the first thing they’d do was to slide their hands under the blanket. (Interviewee #1, male)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Whenever the interviewees described the floor warmth, the scene contained an outside environment of a harsh, cold winter and snow. In popular media, this thermal contrast is metaphorically used to describe the merciless contemporary world where severe competition and unemployment are prevalent, and the warmth of the floor as a refuge to which Koreans can return. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1206331212460166">McDowell’s (1999)</xref> critical description of the 19th-century British social construction of home as a “protected sphere from the harsh competitive world of capitalism” (p. 75), the mid 20th-century construction of the Korean warm floor gained the notion of “heaven.”</p>
<p>The heated floor also had the meaning of waiting. Almost all the female interviewees mentioned that the ondol was a place where they waited for their husbands, fathers, and brothers, who were often late coming home from their jobs. The women buried rice bowls under layers of thick blankets on top of the warmest part of the heated floor until their tardy family members came in from the cold weather, and the women then served them.</p>
<p>The interviewees and the narratives in popular media often recalled thermal contrast between the cold indoor air and the warm floor. Lower levels of insulation back in the 1940s and 1950s led people to layer thick blankets on the warm side of the floor to keep it warm. Whenever they recalled the ondol, the scene contained thick blankets and families who gathered with their feet under the blankets. The coldness they felt with their upper bodies reinforced the contrasting warmth they felt under the blanket.</p>
<p>The third type of thermal contrast was between the warmer and colder side of the floor. Both the interviewees and the popular media used a specific word for the warmer side of the floor—<italic>araetmok</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1206331212460166">9</xref></sup>—rather than “ondol,” which refers to the whole floor system. The warm spot was often referred to as the best spot in the house and was therefore reserved for privileged people such as fathers, mothers-in-law, newborns, and, sometimes, people with illness. The colder side of the floor, called <italic>uitmok</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1206331212460166">9</xref></sup> which was often cold enough to freeze water in a bowl, was used to place all sorts of bulky furniture pieces. The terms <italic>araetmok</italic> and <italic>uitmok</italic> were always used in relative terms. Therefore, the middle ground between the warmest spot and the coldest spot was often referred to as <italic>uitmok</italic>. This spot was often reserved for less-privileged family members within the traditional family system, such as daughters or daughters-in-law.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1206331212460166">
<title>Social dynamics</title>
<p>The social dynamics created by the ondol are closely related to thermal contrast in the sense that the limited warm spot created by the strong thermal contrast gathered all the family members in one place. The spot worked as a strong family focus. As one of the interviewees describes, intimate relationships with parents, brothers, and sisters were formed on this spot:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the winter, my young children all gathered on the <italic>araetmok</italic> and talked about everything they did during the day and stayed there until at last they fell asleep. (Interviewee #2, female)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ondol was the place where parenthood was practiced. The various writers of literature and the interviewees, both male and female, frequently compared the spot to a mother’s or grandmother’s love. A narrative from a personal essay states,
<disp-quote>
<p>My mother laid her baby on the warm <italic>araetmok</italic>, breastfed, and helped him as she slept while she turned her back against the cold door. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1206331212460166">C. Kim, n.d</xref>.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hospitality was also expressed on the spot. The warm spot often served family guests, poor people, and people with illnesses.</p>
<p>Hierarchical relations among family members were also expressed through their spatial arrangement as related to the floor temperature. Once all the family members were gathered in one room, as was often the case in the evenings, the warm spots were reserved for people of higher social status: upper generations as opposed to younger generations, men as opposed to women. A quote from a popular media analysis describes it:
<disp-quote>
<p>My granny sat on the <italic>araetmok</italic>, mom next to her, sister-in-law in the kitchen doorway, sisters in doorways and on the <italic>uitmok</italic>, and children squeezed here and there in between them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1206331212460166">C. Kim, n.d</xref>.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This arrangement became less strict as the ondol evolved and its thermal environment became more uniform in modern buildings. Changes in Korean domestic occupants, from an extended family to a nuclear family, also contributed to the trend, making spatial expressions of social hierarchy less obvious.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1206331212460166">
<title>Practice of everyday life</title>
<p>Being unique to interviews, this theme portrays how the spatial arrangement of the ondol was interconnected with people’s daily living habits. The first subtheme is fluid room assignment. Room assignment in old houses was not rigid, but rather depended on the situation. Frequent visits from extended family members to a house with a limited availability of warm spots made room assignments very fluid. Depending on the visitors’ familial hierarchy, even the room for heads of household was given up. Children in particular moved from room to room looking for available warm spots for sleeping. Sometimes portrayed as an inconvenience, but more often portrayed as family fun, this fluid room assignment was one aspect of living in the traditional ondol house.</p>
<p>The second subtheme is the connection between food preparation and heating patterns. Because the ondol basically used heat from the cooking fire, the temperature of the ondol room largely depended on cooking patterns in the kitchen. Extensive cooking for special occasions, such as birthday parties or marriage ceremonies was directly connected to a warm ondol room. Because of this, people blocked the connection between the kitchen and the ondol room in the summer. They also occasionally built a temporary fireplace in their courtyard for extensive cooking. Along with the stones and clay of the ondol structure that had high thermal capacity, this separation also kept the house cool during the summer. Most of the interviewees mentioned that they, their mothers, or their wives made a fire twice a day for breakfast and dinner, two major meals in Korea during the early 20th century. They set aside lunch portions from breakfast, stored them in a bowl with a lid, and buried them under a blanket on a warm spot. Most of these activities gradually disappeared with the introduction of hydronic heating systems and the electric rice cooker.</p>
<p>The third subtheme is related to sleeping orientation. Because of limited availability in warm zones, many of the interviewees slept so that their feet were placed on the warm spot and their head placed toward a cold spot. In other cases, sleeping positions were connected to familial hierarchy. For example, in a family with a strong patriarchal tradition, fathers slept on the warmest spot at night while other family members slept next to the fathers on less warm spots. In a family with a less strict patriarchal tradition, or with a devoted family man, women or children slept in the warmest spots while fathers slept on the periphery of the warm spot. Yet as one of the interviewees noted, in some other families, family members equally shared the limited warmth:
<disp-quote>
<p>We placed our feet on the <italic>araetmok</italic> and our heads on the opposite side. Everyone felt equally warm. (Interviewee #23, female. Thirteen other interviewees similarly noted as well)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1206331212460166">
<title>Incubation</title>
<p>The theme of incubation was unique to the narratives from popular media. A matching theme from the interview analysis was the theme of “practice of everyday life” as described in the previous section. The warm spot provided a good place for food fermentation, sleep, human birth, and growth. While interviewees frequently described similar activities, such as sleeping and food fermentation in real-life situations, popular media described them rather metaphorically, adding mysticism and romance to the experiences of human activities, particularly human birth and growth. What clearly distinguishes this theme from the theme of “practice of everyday life” is the poetic expression of the constant warm temperature that was suitable for growth, whether it was that of a human or a microorganism used for food fermentation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1206331212460166">
<title>Rootedness</title>
<p>Connectedness to nature, nostalgia, and a feeling of emptiness at its loss was found to be associated with the warm floor. Compared with other themes, this theme was the least frequently mentioned. The earth and fire, the main components of the traditional heated floor, sometimes connected people with nature. Connectedness, elicited through childhood memories, was recalled and missed in the popular media narratives but to a lesser degree than by the elderly people interviewed. Several interviewees said that without a heated floor, they felt a strong emptiness after they moved to the States. Most of the interviewees mentioned that they still use various ways of emulating the traditional ondol in the United States. The most frequently used method was using an electric mat or going to a Korean-style sauna in the Greater Chicago area. This feeling of emptiness is also extensively expressed in the popular media.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1206331212460166">
<title>Healing and well-being</title>
<p>In this category, two distinctive yet interrelated subthemes were identified: healing and well-being. The subtheme of healing revealed that the ondol was strongly tied to recovery, including a cure for illness and postpartum care, while the subtheme of well-being was more related to enhancing the overall wellness of a human being. Although these themes are not totally separate or distinct from one another, as they can be understood more as a continuum, content analysis of the interviews and popular media revealed that they are generally treated separately, depending on the position of the narrator.</p>
<p>Healing was a significant and persistent theme in both interviews and popular media. The right degree of temperature on the warm spot provided a good place for the tired, the ill, the aged, and postpartum care. An interviewee remarked that:
<disp-quote>
<p>On rainy or snowy days, or when I do not feel good, I would like to lie down on a warm floor. (Interviewee #2, female)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another interviewee added,
<disp-quote>
<p>My ankle is not well. So I often times go to <italic>jjimjilbang</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1206331212460166">10</xref></sup> and lay my feet on a sand pillow to warm them up.</p>
<p>Old people like us like a warm floor. (Interviewee #3, female)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Contact with the warm floor was believed to be an effective cure for the common cold, arthritis, and common tiredness. A series of postpartum care centers borrowed their names from the warm spot, <italic>araetmok</italic>, and used it for their advertisements (Late 1990s~current). Unique therapeutic heating rooms called <italic>jjimjilbang</italic> in Korea, which were highly commercialized around 1995, also borrowed the ondol concept for their advertisements. The interviewees indicated that, while it was not crucial to have it all the time, they missed the warm floors whenever they felt feeble or ill.</p>
<p>Unlike the subtheme of healing, the subtheme of well-being appeared only in narratives from popular media. The beneficial effect of the warm floor on overall well-being was prevalent in commercial advertisements and other popular media, but the interviewees did not agree with it, claiming it was unsubstantiated. Though the warmth of the floor was thought to aid in curing illnesses or provide temporary relief from various pains, they did not think it improved a person’s overall health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1206331212460166">
<title>Ethnic identity</title>
<p>The sense of ethnic identity was found only in the narratives from popular media. In particular, educational materials found on the Internet extensively employed the nationalist position, strongly embracing the theme of Korean ethnic identity and tradition. On the other hand, personal essays did not show such a strong connection with nationalism or ethnic identity. The authors of articles with strong nationalist positions saw the ondol as a source and symbol of Korean culture and lifestyle. They repeatedly reported that the ondol was the oldest heating system in the world and that the original form of the ondol must be preserved as an important part of cultural heritage. Furthermore, nationalist authors insisted that the ideas and technology from the ondol should be spread to other cultures because of its “superiority” to other heating methods. The vast majority of interviewees did not share this vision. Only a single person from an interview briefly described the Korean ondol as a “smart” invention. No other interviewees associated a traditional/nationalist/ethnic Korean identity with using the ondol, though they frequently portrayed its strengths.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1206331212460166">
<title>Development and modernization</title>
<p>Unprecedented technological advancement of the ondol system in the 20th century reminded both interviewees and the authors of popular media about the 20th-century development and modernization of the ondol in Korea. Although the history of the Korean ondol stretches over millennia, most technological refinements occurred during the interviewees’ lifetimes. The elderly often recalled how fast Korean society was developed and modernized, remarking how comfortable and convenient it is to live in modern society. Several interviewees further described the generational gap that this development created between them and their children.</p>
<p>The theme of development and modernization often surfaced when interviewees recalled how <italic>inconvenient</italic> it was to live with the traditional ondol system and how <italic>convenient</italic> it was to live with the hydronic ondol system. In particular, deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning evoked the difficulty that many people faced in daily life during the 1950s and 1960s. Use of the old ondol system often reminded interviewees of the poverty they faced during wartime and the early reconstruction of society. The emergence of the hydronic ondol delivered tremendous convenience to the interviewees and lifted the life-threatening dangers of burning the coal that was used in the modified ondol system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1206331212460166">
<title>Labor</title>
<p>The theme of labor distinguishes older interviewees from the younger interviewees and materials from popular media. The majority of the interviewees pointed out the difficulty in maintaining the temperature and the hard labor necessary to keep the fire alive with the traditional heated floor. The women in their late 70s and early 80s recalled that this labor was rather painful. Their memories were often intertwined with their memory of patriarchal oppression and poverty—that is, lifelong struggles to sustain their lives and families through colonization, war, and economic development in Korea. Men and women in their early 60s recalled the same labor with a slight degree of inconvenience. Their recollections were highly romanticized, as the ondol was often associated with “mother’s love,” particularly because they evidently knew that keeping the floor warm required hard labor on the part of their mothers. Only three pieces of literature also mentioned this theme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1206331212460166">Hwang, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1206331212460166">H. Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1206331212460166">Lee, n.d</xref>.), but it was highly romanticized in connection to the memory of their mothers, as well.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1206331212460166">
<title>Comparison Between Popular Media and Interview Analysis</title>
<p>The majority of themes from interviews and popular media overlap, particularly themes such as thermal contrast, social dynamics, and healing. Differences were also found. The themes of practice of everyday life and labor were heavily described by interviewees while the same themes were largely underplayed in the popular media. The theme of “practice of everyday life” and “labor,” which was found exclusively in the interviews, was firmly anchored in real life experiences. On the other hand, the themes of ethnic identity and well-being were only frequently discussed in popular media. Most of the narratives in these categories from popular media were highly romanticized and showed a departure from the reality of everyday life (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1206331212460166">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1206331212460166">Massey (1997)</xref> argues that places are constructed out of a particular constellation of social relations, meeting, and weaving together at a particular locus. In the context of house and home, it is the practice of everyday life that anchors this constellation into a physical structure, creating various meanings and experiences in it. The social position and the milieu in which the actor finds himself or herself inevitably influence these meanings, creating multiple and contested identities of places.</p>
<p>The three propositions put forth at the beginning of this study were explored within Korean domestic life and its ondol system. First, the idea that meanings of place arise from daily practices was explored. The operation of the ondol system that practically dictated daily routines, and its highly distinctive thermal gradation, generated deep meanings associated with each part of the ondol, particularly the warm spot as mother’s love, a family foci, a place of hierarchy, and many more. As newer systems freed the strong association between the system and daily routines, the meanings associated with the individual parts of the system gradually weakened, making it relatively hard for the interviewees to recall anything specific about the newer ondol system.</p>
<p>The second proposition—that the social position of the actor within the given place inevitably influences the ways in which the actor make meanings out of it—was explored when people who had different roles in maintaining the old ondol system differently constructed the meanings of the ondol. Those who had actively maintained the old ondol system described the meaning of the ondol within its real life situations while those who remained on the warm side—younger generations who experienced the old ondol system as young children—romanticized the meaning of the ondol, such as it being a symbol of a mother’s love.</p>
<p>Third, the proposition that the meaning of place changes as daily practices and social contexts change was explored through transformations of meanings of the Korean ondol. As Korean society changed along with innovations in housing technology, the experiences and meanings associated with the Korean ondol gradually changed, as well. Inside homes, heat efficiency dramatically improved, modern controls fitted with boilers allowed people to control temperatures with a fingertip in a fraction of a second, and high levels of insulation made buildings almost airtight, keeping indoor temperatures within an ideal range at all times. Along with the transition from an extended family system to a nuclear family system and less emphasis on the Confucian ethical order in family life, all these innovations resulted in a completely different indoor environment and lifestyle in Korean domestic space. Although new versions of the ondol provide enhanced comfort and convenience in daily life, the disappearing traditional ondol and the phenomenological meanings associated with it created nostalgic yearnings among Koreans. Scenes with the old ondol and parents and grandparents working hard on the fireplace were often portrayed as those of the good old days. Recent globalization and its emphasis on cultural identity also contributed to creating new meanings of Korean identity in association with the Korean ondol.</p>
<p>The multiple and changing meanings of the Korean ondol demonstrate that places are indeed intricate permutations of social relations and physical structures, which, together, operate on multiple levels at a specific time in history and a specific geographic location.</p>

<p>The Korean heated floor has evolved over a long period of time from a partially heated floor with an air passage underneath to the modern hydronic system. Regardless of the technology used, all of these variations are defined as the Korean <italic>ondol</italic> in this study, following the general use of the term in Korea. The ondol is the predominant form of heating in Korea, providing warmth to more than 90% of households.</p>

<p>Depending on how one defines the <italic>ondol</italic>, some scholars argue that the history of the ondol goes back to the Bronze Age. However, it seems that the fully developed <italic>ondol</italic> first appeared around the 11th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1206331212460166">Yeo, Yang, &amp; Kim, 2003</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-1206331212460166">
<label>4.</label>
<p>The initial survey of existing Korean literature about the <italic>ondol</italic> used two major databases of Korean scholarly journals and resulted in 271 articles published between 1926 and 2006. Among them, full texts of 181 articles were acquired. All the articles were published in major refereed research journals in Korea; therefore, reasonable study quality is assumed.</p>

<p>The collection of popular media included a variety of sources: (a) three major Korean daily newspapers accessed through the Internet; (b) local newspapers for Koreans in the greater Chicago area; (c) advertisements, essays, poems, and novels published on the Internet; and (d) two contemporary Korean TV dramas. A total of 53 articles were collected from Internet materials and local newspapers: 21 personal essays or poems; 3 advertisements; and 29 educational materials. The educational materials included those uploaded onto the Internet as teaching materials by general users or institutions. This material included Internet encyclopedias, as well as those provided by educational institutions such as universities, or those provided by the building industry for the purpose of describing the details of the <italic>ondol</italic>.</p>

<p>A purposive sample of 6 Korean American seniors from the Milwaukee area and 24 Korean American seniors from the Greater Chicago area were interviewed. All of interviewees were aged 55 years or older: 6 were in their 80s, 14 were in their 70s, 9 were in their 60s, and 1 interviewee was in his late 50s.</p>

<p>During the interview, demographic data were collected first. Each interviewee was then asked to choose two to three of their past residences that they most vividly recalled. They were given square pieces of poster board—each labeled with various types of rooms—and asked to arrange them in a way that best matched the past residences they had chosen. Question sessions about the residences were then carried out. Each interviewee was encouraged to answer all the questions included in the protocol, although the order and details were modified depending on the interviewee’s answers and preferences. The entire interview generally fell between 1 and 2 hours. The interview content was digitally recorded and stored in an electronic audio format for further analysis. Transcription and translation of the entire interview process were deemed unnecessary because it would require considerable time and effort, while the benefit of doing so seemed to be minimal. Therefore, only the parts fit for further analysis and quotation were transcribed and then translated.</p>

<p>This statement is based on my casual conversations with both Koreans in Korea and in the United States. In conversations with Korean elderly people residing in Korea, people often times wondered why the author would study such mundane things and had hard time eliciting any peculiarities of the system.</p>

<p>In Korean, <italic>Arae</italic>- stands for lower, and –<italic>mok</italic> stands for spot. Together, they literally mean a lower spot. Likewise, <italic>ui</italic>- means upper, and –<italic>mok</italic> means spot; therefore, together they literally mean an upper spot. It is not clear how these words came to represent a warm spot and a cold spot. It seems that the different height of underfloor structures—fire side low, and opposite side high for easier transmission of hot air—has created such uses.</p>

<p><italic>Jjimjil</italic> stands for therapeutic heating activity similar to fomentation whether it is wet or dry—“bang” has a meaning of a room. Together, <italic>jjimjilbang</italic> stands for a therapeutic heating room. Though the terminology itself does not connote any commercialism behind it, the <italic>jjimjilbang</italic> in Korea is almost exclusively commercial.</p>
