<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: Within Canada, health education is generally taught by teachers who are subject generalists, or subject specialists within other disciplines, with little-to-no formal teacher training in health education. Without teacher training related to curriculum and instruction in health education, teachers are effectively required to adapt their developing pedagogies to unique health contexts. This article highlights findings from a recent study in which pre-service physical education (PE) teachers implemented interactive drama (ID) as a pedagogical practice to engage adolescent students (aged 13–16 years) in meaningful learning opportunities related to particular health education curricular outcomes.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: The study was part of a Service Learning Project (SLP) within a secondary physical education curriculum and instruction course at Atlantic Canada University.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0017896911398811">1</xref></sup> During the SLP, pre-service PE teachers (<italic>n</italic> = 21) engaged adolescent students (<italic>n</italic> = 162) in ID presentations and discussions. After completion of the SLP, pre-service PE teachers shared their perspectives of ID as a pedagogical practice capable of meaningfully engaging themselves and their students within health education.</p>
<p><bold>Setting</bold>: Atlantic Canada University has a population of approximately 5,000 students, the majority of whom come from Atlantic and Eastern Canada. The SLP occurred at Melmerby School,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0017896911398811">2</xref></sup> a P-12 school with a student population of approximately 500 students.</p>
<p><bold>Method</bold>: Applying case study methodology, the researchers examined pre-service PE teachers’ written responses to a post-SLP survey. These data were collected so as to gain an in-depth understanding of ID as a perceived appropriate pedagogical practice for health education.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Three primary themes were identified through the data analysis. These were: enabling teachers; engaging students; and real-life connections.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: ID can be a beneficial pedagogical practice for health education; it has the potential to benefit both pre-service PE teachers and their adolescent students.</p>

<title>Objective</title>
<p>Within Canadian schools, health education is generally taught by teachers who are subject generalists or subject specialists within other disciplines, with little-to-no formal teacher training in health education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911398811">1</xref></sup> With schools’ primary goals oriented towards maximizing educational outcomes for students<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911398811">2</xref></sup> it is little surprise that they have such limited expertise in various health issues. Contributing to this scenario is the absence of national or provincial guidelines requiring health education teachers to have <italic>any</italic> health education training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911398811">3</xref></sup> It is likely for this very reason that the majority of teacher education programmes across the country fail to offer pre-service teachers the opportunity to subject-specialize in the field. The lack of teacher training opportunities, coupled with the resultant lack of health education specialists within Canadian schools, does little to tackle the absence of health literacy across Canada, where 60% of Canadians lack the capacity to understand and act upon health information and services to make appropriate health-related decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911398811">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911398811">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Partly in response to this current health education scenario, the researchers aimed to introduce pre-service physical education (PE) teachers to interactive drama (ID) as a pedagogical practice with which to engage adolescent students in meaningful learning opportunities related to particular health education curricular outcomes. ID differs from student role-plays within traditional drama in one especially significant manner: initial structured dramatic episodes within ID are modelled by pre-service PE teachers (as trained actors) rather than by students themselves. The resultant promotion of participation among adolescent students is meant to foster authentic experiential learning. While such participation may come in many forms, the researchers focused on three already-established modes of student participation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911398811">5</xref></sup> (i.e. students discussed scenes, students suggested changes to scenes, and students joined scenes as performers to ‘test’ alternative ‘solutions’).</p>
<p>Service leaning, as an approach for providing pre-service PE teachers an authentic in-the-field experience, provides unique possibilities. Differing from in-class assignments and field experiences, service learning is a ‘class-based, credit-bearing experience in which students participate in an organized service activity that meets a particular need of a community’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911398811">6</xref>, p. xii</sup> Unlike professors’ limited-to-no role in pre-service teachers’ field experience, within service learning, professors (among other tasks) design learning outcomes, help students connect in-class learning with in-the-field learning, and spend time supporting students in the community sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911398811">6</xref></sup> The objective of the SLP was to provide pre-service PE teachers an opportunity to implement ID while also contributing to a school community. The objective of this research was to develop an understanding of the potential for ID as a pedagogical practice for pre-service PE teachers. Specifically, the research question guiding this study was:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Given an opportunity to implement ID within a SLP, in what ways do pre-service PE teachers realize ID to be a potential pedagogical practice in heath education?</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>The benefits of arts-based and experiential education are well-established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911398811">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911398811">8</xref></sup> In addition to involving students, experiential education allows learning to be explicitly related to the outside ‘real’ world while also enabling the learner to have some measure of control over her/his learning. ID has previously been utilized within a number of disciplines and school contexts and, in recent years, its implementation within health education has become increasingly popular.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911398811">9</xref></sup> For example, student nurses have used ID to promote healthy sexual behaviours among secondary pupils in England,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911398811">10</xref></sup> a health promotion service has used ID to address drug use with 10–11 year olds,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911398811">11</xref></sup> and a travelling drama troupe has used ID to prevent teen smoking in Hawai’i.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911398811">12</xref></sup> In these and other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911398811">13</xref></sup>–<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911398811">15</xref></sup> researchers have been primarily concerned with students’ responses to ID (including, for example, changes in knowledge, attitudes, or behaviour). In contrast, this study purposely focused on the pre-service PE teachers’ perspectives related to the possibilities for ID as a pedagogical practice for health education.</p>
<p>Initially, pre-service PE teachers were taught about the theoretical and practical applications related to ID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911398811">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911398811">16</xref></sup> so that they might come to know and experience the practice as pedagogically sound. In an effort to achieve this goal, the pre-service PE teachers dedicated upwards of 10 hours of in-class and out-of-class time to learning about ID; in these hours they worked under the close supervision of one of the researchers who has considerable background and expertise in drama education (the other researcher’s background and expertise is in health and PE).</p>
<p>Once pre-service PE teachers were ready to plan a structured dramatic episode, they were required to choose a theme related to the provincial health education curriculum (e.g. risk and decision making, alcohol and drug use and abuse, social interactions, dating behaviour, or sexual behaviour). Pre-service PE teachers were given considerable freedom to choose their theme; the only enabling constraint was to ensure there was one structured dramatic episode for each theme. In addition to these structured dramatic episodes being thematically oriented, pre-service PE teachers were required to ensure that their structured dramatic episodes would allow them to address the outcomes associated with their particular theme (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911398811">Table 1</xref>). These structured dramatic episodes were then planned and rehearsed.</p>

<p>Once the initial structured dramatic episodes were ‘finalized’, pre-service PE teachers travelled to a rural school and spent five hours engaging adolescent students in their ID sessions. Initially, all 162 students watched as five structured dramatic episodes were performed. Once these five structured dramatic episodes were complete, the actors (i.e. the 21 pre-service PE teachers) divided themselves among the students such that they were able to accommodate 15 groups of adolescent students (with approximately 10–11 students within each group).</p>
<p>In these smaller groups, pre-service PE teachers engaged adolescent students in discussions related to the theme and its specific health education curricular outcomes. Students discussed possible and alternative endings to the structured dramatic episodes and were given opportunities to ‘play them out’. These possible and alternative endings were consequently revisited on numerous occasions as students came to discuss the faults and merits of various possibilities. At the conclusion of the day, the 15 groups of students performed their structured dramatic episodes (i.e. there were three presentations for each theme) so as to demonstrate their learning to all of their peers. From this, teachers were encouraged to continue classroom discussions related to the possibilities suggested by their students within their future health education classes.</p>

<title>Setting</title>
<p>Atlantic Canada University has a population of approximately 5,000 students, the majority of whom come from Atlantic and Eastern Canada. Atlantic Canada University’s Faculty of Education offers a two-year concurrent Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree and there are approximately 120 pre-service teachers admitted to this degree programme every year. Of these 120 pre-service teachers, approximately 24 of them are poised for certification in P-12 PE. These 24 pre-service PE teachers are not required to take a health education course as part of their BEd degree, although such a course is offered as an elective (<italic>no</italic> pre-service teachers specialize in health education). Atlantic Canada University is also the lone institution within the province that offers a physical education teacher education (PETE) programme.</p>
<p>Melmerby School is a rural school serving approximately 500 students in grades P-12. The majority of these 500 students are from working class families; many of the students’ employed parents work within the fishing or farming industries. Roughly 15% of the student population is of aboriginal ancestry. The 162 students who participated in the SLP were in grades 7–9 and were between 13 and 16 years of age.</p>
<p>The 21 pre-service PE teachers presented their five structured dramatic episodes on a stage within the school foyer, a space that easily accommodated the 162 students and their teachers. ‘Breakout’ sessions with student groups occurred in school classrooms and final student presentations occurred again on the main stage in the foyer.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Applying case study methodology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911398811">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911398811">19</xref></sup> researchers examined the survey responses of the pre-service PE teachers to gain an in-depth understanding of their perceptions of ID as a potential pedagogical practice in health education. The instrumental case, or entity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911398811">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911398811">21</xref></sup> in this investigative research was delimited to 21 pre-service PE teachers from a single secondary curriculum and instruction course. All consenting pre-service PE teachers completed surveys within two weeks of completing the SLP.</p>
<p>It is important to note that, although the survey responses were appropriate for effectively gathering important information related to the research question, such a data collection method was certainly not without limitations. The decision to collect data by use of a survey instrument was based largely on feasibility. Nonetheless, while still recognizing the richness of the data collected through this method, the researchers are very much aware of the potential for future interviews’ contribution to, and enrichment of, this type of inquiry.</p>
<p>In qualitative research, the quality of the data collected and analyzed often depends on the understanding, experiences, and abilities of the researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911398811">19</xref></sup> One of the researchers is a former health and PE teacher and the other is a former drama teacher. Moreover, both researchers are currently professors with Atlantic Canada Universities’ Faculty of Education. This expertise and experience likely provided the added benefit of initial, and achieved, deeper understanding which, in turn, enabled connections among ideas and the categorization of responses into appropriate emergent themes.</p>
<p>A detailed analysis and interpretation of the responses to the survey’s eight open-ended questions (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0017896911398811">Appendix 1</xref>) was intended to influence the researchers’ future teaching practice and research, thus fulfilling an essential criterion of case study research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911398811">18</xref></sup> Indeed, students’ responses to the survey questions influenced course content for particular (and in some respects, subsequent) classes.</p>
<p>Initially all responses to the eight questions were recorded verbatim. Then, as suggested by Tesch,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911398811">22</xref></sup> each researcher completed content analysis. In this process, both researchers independently read the list of written responses to each of the questions. Repeated statements that possessed significant meanings were highlighted with different codes and assigned a name or phrase based on visible content information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911398811">23</xref></sup> After several readings, the systematic coding process became deductive as the researchers searched for similar themes derived from the written responses; categories and sub-themes were evaluated, renamed, and grouped with others if similarities prevailed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911398811">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911398811">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The researchers then collaborated with one another to determine if the information they initially discovered, grouped, and named was similar.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911398811">19</xref></sup> Through this process, the categories and sub-themes were the same or very similar. In the small number of occasions where one researcher recognized something that was neglected by the other, purposeful follow-up collaborative sessions resulted in a category being entirely included or excluded. A decision was then made to count the number of responses representing each major theme to determine the frequency of responses and to allow for greater clarity and insight in the representation and interpretation of data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0017896911398811" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Three primary themes related to ID as a pedagogical practice were identified through the data analysis; these were enabling teachers, engaging students, and real-life connections (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0017896911398811">Figure 1</xref>). While some of the pre-service PE teachers’ survey responses may have been related to an altogether separate theme, these three categories represent the emergent themes that were most common and salient. For example, when pre-service PE teachers’ responses to the eight survey questions were coded, they were related to enabling teachers 77 times, engaging students 51 times, and real-life connections 39 times. Despite these quantitative differences in the coded responses, herein it is not suggested that one of these themes is any more important than another. Certainly, given the content and structure of the survey questions themselves, pre-service PE teachers may have been more likely to make comments related to their own practice (and consequently most closely aligned with enabling teachers). What the numbers are meant to indicate is that these three themes were alluded to on a great number of occasions (and more than any others) through pre-service PE teachers’ responses to a number of prompting questions. It is also worth noting, in some instances, a single response may have necessarily been coded into two separate categories. For example, consider the following response:</p>

<p>I grew as a facilitator/teacher during this project because I was able to give more power and decision making to the students. I felt as if I was able to practice guided discovery techniques and that the students really enjoyed being able to create their own skit.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this example the researchers coded this as both enabling teachers (‘I grew as a facilitator/teacher’) and engaging students (‘I was able to give more power and decision making to the students’).</p>
<sec id="section6-0017896911398811">
<title>Enabling teachers</title>
<p>The most common theme, enabling teachers, allows one to consider pre-service PE teachers’ perceived potential for ID as a pedagogical practice in health education. While the merits of ID focused on social interactions, sexual health, and alcohol and drug use have been established previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911398811">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911398811">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911398811">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911398811">26</xref></sup> (as indicated by measurements of resultant student knowledge, attitudes, or behaviour), this study’s data suggests the potential for soon-to-be teachers to adopt the teaching ‘methodology’ in the first place. While ID, by definition, may require ‘outside’ or ‘trained’ actors to engage students in an experiential learning opportunity, these pre-service PE teachers have found themselves able to successfully adopt this role as they planned and acted within their structured dramatic episodes. Moreover, they have similarly found themselves to feel confident in the pedagogy. Pre-service PE teachers’ statements made this point especially clear when they shared such responses as:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think that I am confident and competent in using improvisation as a teaching strategy in my course content.</p>
<p>The scenario has heightened my pedagogical awareness because it goes to show how we can take important and maybe touchy issues and act them out.</p>
<p>I have learned that I have a bigger imagination than I thought, and I am able to come up with scenarios to guide students through the process.</p>
<p>[In the future] I will allow my students to express themselves in various forms and will use role-playing and skits as a way to present their ideas.</p>
<p>It has taught me to begin with what you want your audience to learn, what is the main message.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0017896911398811">
<title>Engaging students</title>
<p>Good classroom teachers engage students and students’ ideas in worthwhile learning opportunities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911398811">27</xref></sup> Though classroom management has long been a requirement of effective teaching,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911398811">28</xref></sup> engaging students within the lesson offers more than the luxury of maintaining order and managing behaviour. Indeed, when students are more engaged in their in-school learning, they learn <italic>more</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911398811">29</xref></sup> When pre-service PE teachers alluded to engaging students they never spoke directly about managing students’ behaviours or misbehaviours. Rather, they spoke of engagement as a function, and evidence, of the interactive teaching tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896911398811">30</xref></sup> utilized in ID. In this respect, they further spoke of ID as a worthwhile strategy to engage students in the health education context. More specifically, pre-service PE teachers discovered ID to be especially appropriate when engaging adolescent students in ‘awkward’ health-related content while also providing a motivating milieu. Such understandings were suggested when pre-service PE teachers shared comments such as the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is easy to bring up difficult issues that may be awkward for youth to talk about openly.</p>
<p>I think it is easier to get students involved when you allow them to act out things, rather than having to just talk about them. They know that, as actors, their peers won’t really know if they are acting or saying what they really think. It’s easier to get involved this way.</p>
<p>Great way to get students engaged. Improv is fun and it keeps students active.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly pre-service PE teachers were also impressed with the possibilities for ID to allow for authentic experiential opportunities – as opportunities for engagement. Here, they recognized that ID empowers students to have some control over their own learning as they become required/enabled to make their own decisions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Students get excited about the topic you are teaching because they get to take ownership of their own learning. They get engaged once you get them hooked – the use of questioning helped students with conversation.</p>
<p>Teaching using improvisation techniques can be an effective tool in having students think critically and work through a given situation. It also allows for students to look at broader social issues and come up with their own solutions.</p>
<p>Students are active and willing. They learn a deeper understanding about the content because they have to participate.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section8-0017896911398811">
<title>Real-life connections</title>
<p>Real-world problems (which by their nature often ‘involve uncertainty, complexity, and nuanced judgement’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0017896911398811">31</xref>, p. 390</sup>) do not generally lend themselves to traditional school structures and curricula. This is especially true for neophyte teachers, who invariably tend to adopt teacher-centered teaching styles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0017896911398811">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0017896911398811">33</xref></sup> (e.g. direct or task/practice styles). With such a focus on direct teaching styles, ‘teachers tend toward more factual content with very little real-world application’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0017896911398811">34</xref>, p. 936</sup> Seemingly, ID has afforded these pre-service PE teachers opportunities to engage students through a student-centered teaching style. Furthermore, through this engagement they have found themselves able to make (along with their students) real-life connections.</p>
<p>The themes and their ID sessions all addressed real-life scenarios for adolescent students (as a purposeful way to address specific health education curricular outcomes). The five-hour ID session allowed the outcomes to be addressed in a unique manner (without, for example, the constraints of a bell schedule). Related to this emergent theme, pre-service PE teachers shared:</p>

<p>I found that using improv was a great way to teach about subjects or topics that are real in students’ lives.</p>
<p>The most positive thing was getting down to their level and coming up with real life endings to real life situations.</p>
<p>I have learned that I am going to ensure I bring social issue into each of my lessons and really listen to what the students are dealing with on a daily basis. I will provide them with the tools they need to combat some of the issues they will face.</p>
<p>What was positive is that some students did open up about their drinking experiences and were asking questions. It was good that they were thinking through options to avoid dangerous situations.</p>
<p>I learned that students are able to feed off one another and apply their improvisation on a real-world situation with valuable lessons learned.</p>
<p>My most positive result from my participation in this activity was having students get to the conclusion that you don’t need to drink to have fun and also providing them with ideas of how they can be more active and get involved in activities within their community.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>ID can be a beneficial pedagogical practice for health education. Whereas this study has provided insight into pre-service PE teachers’ application of ID, it can be concluded that the practice is one that is perceived to have potential when teaching health education. With the benefits of ID having been already determined,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911398811">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911398811">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911398811">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911398811">26</xref></sup> this study suggests that the practice is one that can be successfully introduced to, and accepted by, pre-service teachers (as opposed to being left to the ‘professionals’).</p>
<p>While those within teacher education are obviously introduced to general and subject-specific pedagogies, ID is currently not a teaching style/teaching model that is taught to all. Quite obviously it requires that teacher educators be well versed and capable with ID before they can confidently introduce the practice to pre-service teachers. Nonetheless, given that some teacher-education programmes do have drama specialists, the practice is one that can conceivably be introduced to many pre-service teachers who will soon be teaching health education.</p>
