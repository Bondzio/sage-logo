<abstract>
<p>We analyze the effect of chronic undernourishment on extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle maturation in the rat. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and alkaline ATPase histoenzymatic techniques were used to determine the relative proportion of different fiber types (oxidative/glycolytic and type I, IIa/IId, or IIb, respectively) and their cross-sectional area in control and undernourished EDL muscles at several postnatal (PN) ages. From PN days 15 to 45, undernourished EDL muscles showed predominance of oxidative and type IIa/IId fibers, but from PN days 60 to 90, there were a larger proportion of oxidative fibers and an equal proportion of type IIa/IId and IIb fibers. Meanwhile, in adult stages (from PN days 130–365), the relative proportion of fiber types in control and undernourished EDL muscles showed no significant differences. In addition, from PN days 15 to 90, there was a significant reduction in the cross-sectional area of all fibers (slow: 13–53%; intermediate: 24–74%; fast: 9–80%) but no differences from PN days 130 to 365. It is suggested that chronic undernourishment affects the maturation of fast-type muscle fibers only at juvenile stages (from PN days 15–45) and the probable occurrence of adaptive mechanisms in muscle fibers, allowing adult rats to counterbalance the alterations provoked by chronic food deprivation.</p>

<body>
<p>It is generally accepted that muscles are composed of four different fiber types: slow, non-fatigable oxidative fibers (type I); two types of fast, non-fatigable oxidative- glycolytic fibers (type IIa and IId or intermediate); and fast, fatigable glycolytic fibers (type IIb; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155413480149">Armstrong and Phelps 1984</xref>). At birth, practically all the fibers in fast muscles show fetal or slow-type characteristics, and subsequently, most of them acquire metabolic and physiological characteristics corresponding to intermediate and/or fast-type fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155413480149">Close 1964</xref>). The transformation from one type of muscle fiber to another during postnatal development (e.g., from slow to intermediate or from intermediate to fast fibers) implies the participation of a large variety of functional, molecular, and structural processes that may occur at a continuous, progressive, and dynamic manner during the postnatal development of the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155413480149">Lehnert et al. 2007</xref>). In contrast, it has been assumed that an imposed dietary restriction may disturb the expression of intrinsic mechanisms that are involved in fiber transformation and energy production of muscles mostly constituted by fast fibers compared with those composed by slow fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155413480149">Brozanski et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155413480149">Fiaccadori et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155413480149">White et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Dietary restrictions during critical stages of development (primarily pregnancy and lactation) generally produce drastic changes in the postnatal growth of skeletal muscles, including decreased muscle weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155413480149">Haltia et al. 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155413480149">Goldspink and Ward 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155413480149">Bedi et al. 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022155413480149">Lopes et al. 1982</xref>) and fiber size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022155413480149">Stickland et al. 1975</xref>). Some studies have indicated that prenatal or early postnatal undernutrition induces an increase in the relative proportion of type I fibers but decreases the number of type II fibers, causing a delay in muscle maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155413480149">Brozanski et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155413480149">Prakash et al. 1993</xref>). In addition, a reduction in the number of nuclei in type II fibers with no change in the total number of fibers has been found in the muscles of young rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155413480149">Bayol et al. 2004</xref>). Early postnatal food deprivation induces an increase in the oxidative metabolism of muscle fibers by using more lipids than glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155413480149">Lefaucheur et al. 2003</xref>). Meanwhile, the effects of both pre- and postnatal undernutrition (from gestation through weaning and/or juvenile stages of life) on young muscles increase the oxidative capability and the proportion of slow-oxidative fibers at the expense of fast-glycolytic fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155413480149">Haltia et al. 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155413480149">White et al. 2000</xref>). However, other studies have shown increased glycolytic activity and glycolytic enzymes accompanied by a decrease in oxidative capacity and oxidative enzymes in the gastrocnemius muscle of adult rats as a result of postnatal undernutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155413480149">Raju 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Because most studies have made use of different food paradigms to induce food deprivation at discrete periods of pre- and/or postnatal stages of life (e.g., during gestation and/or lactation periods) and only a few studies have used a chronic food deprivation paradigm (including pre- and postnatal stages), the information about the sequence of changes that undernutrition exerts on whole-muscle maturation is fragmented and inconclusive. To analyze the effect of chronic food deprivation on muscle maturation during most of the life span of animals, we characterize in this study the sequence of changes provoked by pre- and postnatal food deprivation on the metabolism, type, and cross-sectional area of fibers in rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle from early postnatal to adult stages of life. In summary, we found that in juvenile stages, there is an increment in the proportion of oxidative and type IIa/IId fibers accompanied by a reduction in the cross-sectional area of all fiber types in the undernourished EDL muscles, whereas no significant differences were found in adult stages as compared with the control group. Some data from this study have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155413480149">Ruiz et al. 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Nineteen adult female Wistar rats (225 ± 25 g body weight) were obtained from CINVESTAV’s breeding house (CINVESTAV, Ciudad de México, DF, Mexico) and divided in two groups, which were subjected to different feeding conditions. The control group (C), consisting of female rats (<italic>n</italic>=9) and their offspring, had free access to commercial food (Formulab 5008 [Lab Diet, Brentwood, MO]; composition: crude protein not less than 23%, crude fat not less than 6.5%, crude fiber not more than 4%, ash not more than 8%, added minerals not more than 2.5%) throughout the entire experimental period, and the amount of food consumed was measured every day until the day of the experiment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022155413480149">Table 1</xref>). The chronically undernourished group (U) consisted of the remaining female rats (<italic>n</italic>=10), which received 50% of the food intake of control animals determined before from 3 to 4 weeks before mating through pregnancy and lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155413480149">Chow and Lee 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155413480149">Bedi 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022155413480149">Segura et al. 2001</xref>). The offspring were also undernourished after weaning (postnatal day 21) until their age at the experimental session (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022155413480149">Table 1</xref>). After delivery, the sex and number of pups were determined, and the size of each litter was adjusted to 9 (usually 5 males and 4 females per litter). The experiments were performed only in male animals at 15, 21, 45, 60, 90, 130, and 365 postnatal days of age (PN; <italic>n</italic>=5–7 muscles per age and feeding condition). On the day of the experiment, 5 males were randomly selected from all the litters and weighed. All animals had unlimited access to water and were housed under the same environmental conditions of light/dark cycle and temperature (22–24C). Animal care and experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Mexican Official Norm (NOM-062-ZOO-1999) and the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 8023, revised in 1996) and were approved by the Institutional Bioethical Committee for Care and Handling of Laboratory Animals (UPEAL-Protocol 0013-02; CINVESTAV). The animals were euthanized by an overdose of anesthetic (urethane).</p>

<title>Histoenzymatic Analysis</title>
<p>The EDL muscles from the left or right hind limb were quickly removed, weighed, and immersed in 2-methyl butane that was cooled to near freezing with liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, the middle section of the muscle was mounted on specimen holders in a cryoprotectant solution (Tissue-Tek® OCTMT; Finetek, Torrance, CA). Serial transverse sections of 8 to 10 µm thickness were cut on a cryostat microtome at −20C (CM-1100; Leica Microsystems, Nussloch, Germany). The sections were mounted on glass coverslips for staining. In consecutive sections of the EDL muscle, the oxidative metabolism of the muscle fibers was inferred by staining for cytochrome c oxidase (COX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155413480149">Seligman et al. 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155413480149">Novikoff and Goldfischer 1969</xref>). In brief, the samples were incubated at 37C for 60 min in 1% w/v of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) and cytochrome c from equine heart (Sigma-Aldrich; Shanghai, China) in 0.2 M PBS (pH 7.6). The samples then were washed three times for 5 min in deionized water and dehydrated. Coverslips then were mounted with glycerogel (2% gelatin, 50% glycerol, 0.5% phenol). In the subsequent serial tissue sections, the myofibrillar ATPase activity at pH 9.4 was visualized using an alkaline ATPase (pH 9.4) technique (modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022155413480149">Guth and Samaha 1970</xref>). In brief, the muscle sections were submerged in a preincubation solution of 0.01 M Tris base (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA) and 0.018 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 9.4) for 20 min. The samples then were washed three times for 5 min with deionized water and subsequently incubated at 37C for 1 hr in 1.5% w/v of adenosine-5′-triphosphate (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) in a preincubation solution at pH 9.4. Later, the samples were incubated in 2% CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 5 min, transferred to 2% w/v CoCl<sub>2</sub> solution for another 5 min, and transferred to 10% v/v (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HSO<sub>4</sub> for 3 min. Then, the sections were washed, dehydrated, and mounted with glycerogel on coverslips, as described above. Photomicrographs of each muscle section were taken using a digital camera (AxioCam MRc; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) mounted on an inverted microscope (Axio Observer.D1; Zeiss). The fibers in the COX-stained muscle slices were classified according to the following criteria: dark fibers were identified as oxidative, whereas light fibers were considered glycolytic (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155413480149">Fig. 1</xref>). Using the alkaline ATPase technique, light, gray, and dark fibers were identified as slow type I (S), fast type IIb (F), and intermediate type IIa/IId (I), respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155413480149">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022155413480149">Soukup and Jirmanová 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155413480149">Miyabara et al. 2005</xref>). Because fiber types in EDL muscles are not evenly distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022155413480149">Pullen 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155413480149">Kernell 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022155413480149">Wang and Kernell 2001</xref>), the total number of each fiber type was determined in both control and undernourished EDL muscles with the help of a custom program in the MATLAB (MathWorks; Natick, MA) language written in our laboratory. The proportion of each fiber type was expressed as a percentage of the total number of fibers constituting the EDL muscles. Subsequently, the ratio of oxidative (O) to glycolytic (G) fibers (R<sub>O/G</sub>) and the ratio of intermediate (I) to fast (F) fibers (R<sub>I/F</sub>) were determined. Subsequently, the transversal area of randomly selected fibers (100 fibers of each type) was measured in sections from five different muscles per age and feeding condition with the Sigma Scan Pro program (version 4.01; Systat Software, Chicago, IL) and expressed in square micrometers. The average growth rate of muscles was determined from the linear regression of the initial ascending phase in the cross-sectional area × postnatal age relationship (between 15 and 45 days of life; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155413480149">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155413480149">C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155413480149">E</xref>) obtained for each fiber type in control and undernourished muscles.</p>

<title>Body and EDL Muscle Weight and Total Number of Fibers</title>
<p>At practically all ages (from PN15–PN130), the body weight of undernourished animals was significantly lower than that of control animals (28%–68%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022155413480149">Table 2</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 to <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), but at PN365, body weight was not significantly different between the groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022155413480149">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the gain of body weight in undernourished animals was less (1.6 ± 0.02 g body weight/d) than that of control animals (3.2 ± 0.04 g body weight/d). In concordance with the latter, a significant reduction in EDL muscle weight (from 41%–61%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022155413480149">Table 2</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 to <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) was observed in undernourished rats at practically all of the postnatal ages analyzed, with the exception of PN365, when no significant weight differences were observed between control and undernourished muscles. Meanwhile, the total number of fibers in undernourished EDL muscles was not different from that of controls at practically all of the postnatal ages analyzed, with the exception of PN15, when undernourished muscles contained a lesser number of fibers than control muscles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022155413480149">Table 2</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). These results indicate that chronic undernutrition reduces the weight of the EDL muscle without affecting the total number of fibers in it, from weaning to the adult stages of the rat.</p>

Unlike the control muscles, the undernourished muscles had a higher percentage (15% to 21% more) of oxidative fibers, accompanied by a corresponding significant decrement in the percentage of glycolytic fibers from PN21 to PN90 (17% to 14% less; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155413480149">Fig. 2A</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 to <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). However, the percentage of oxidative and glycolytic fibers in both the control and undernourished muscles was not significantly different from PN130 to PN365 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155413480149">Fig. 2A</xref>; <italic>p&gt;</italic>0.05). From PN21 to PN90, the average ratio of oxidative to glycolytic fibers (R<sub>O/G</sub>) in the undernourished muscles (range, 1.4–3.1) was higher than in control ones (range, 1.3–1.9), and no differences were found at PN15, PN130, or PN365 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155413480149">Fig. 4A</xref>). The mean percentage of type I fibers present in undernourished muscles was not significantly different from control muscles at any postnatal age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155413480149">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, the percentage of type IIa/IId fibers in the undernourished EDL muscles from PN15 to PN45 was significantly higher than that in control muscles, which was correlated with a proportional decrease in the percentage of type IIb fibers at the same postnatal ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155413480149">Fig. 2B</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 to <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). These proportions of fibers were reversed at PN130 and PN365, when the percentage of type IIb fibers was higher than type IIa/IId fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155413480149">Fig. 2B</xref>), but no significant differences were found between fiber types in both groups of muscles at those ages. From PN15 to PN45, the ratio of type IIa/IId with respect to type IIb fibers (R<sub>I/F</sub>) in undernourished muscles was higher than that of control muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155413480149">Fig. 4B</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 to <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05).

These results may indicate that chronic undernutrition exerts a differential effect on the proportion of muscle fiber types at different postnatal stages of development, with a greater effect in juveniles than in adults.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has been assumed that a severe nutritional restriction significantly affects the growth and maturation of tissues and cells, and when undernourishment occurs earlier, its effects are more severe, generalizing the alterations to organs and/or systems in the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155413480149">Ihemelandu 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022155413480149">Zhu et al. 2006</xref>). According to our data, the body and muscle weights of chronically undernourished animals were significantly lower than those of control animals. Similar results have been reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155413480149">Rowe 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155413480149">Beverly et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022155413480149">Segura et al. 2001</xref>), in which a close relationship between low food intake and reduced body and muscle weight of the offspring has been suggested. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155413480149">Bayol and colleagues (2004)</xref> suggested that there is no relationship between maternal food intake during gestation and the postnatal body growth rate in the offspring, but we found in this study that the body growth of chronically undernourished animals was inferior to that of control animals (see Results). The differences between both studies possibly are related to the feeding paradigms employed; Bayol and colleagues used maternal food deprivation followed by ad libitum food restitution, whereas in this study, we maintained the food restriction throughout the whole life span of animals. In addition, previous studies have suggested that the reduction in muscle weight of undernourished animals is associated with the loss of tissue proteins and/or decreases in the fiber area and volume (hypotrophy) or a reduction in the total number of fibers (hypoplasia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155413480149">Rowe 1968</xref>). Some studies have shown that prenatal undernutrition decreased by 19% to 34% the total number of fibers in the lumbrical and soleus muscles of newborn rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155413480149">Ameredes et al. 1999</xref>). Similar alterations have been found in pigs and ewes with different feeding protocols to provoke undernutrition than that used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022155413480149">Wilson et al. 1988</xref>). Other studies affirm that the number of muscle fibers does not change during the postnatal development of the undernourished rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155413480149">Dwyer et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022155413480149">Dermitas and Özcan 2012</xref>). In agreement with the latter, our results indicate that chronic undernourishment has essentially no effect on the number of fibers in the EDL muscle at any postnatal age, with the exception of PN15, when there is a noticeable reduction in the number of fibers, which probably is associated with a delay in the hypoplasia process due to an early effect of undernourishment; this assumption requires a more detailed analysis than that carried out in this study. According to the latter, it could be assumed that the observed decrement in muscle weight of juvenile and adult undernourished animals is mostly due to a loss of cellular components, instead of a reduction in the number of muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155413480149">Haltia et al. 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, our data also indicate that, at juvenile stages, all fiber types in undernourished EDL muscles showed a smaller cross-sectional area and a lower growth rate than control muscles. It is noteworthy that the growth rate of type IIb fibers was the most affected, followed by type IIa/IId, and the least altered was that corresponding to type I fibers from juvenile and young adult undernourished animals (PN15–PN90). However, at adult stages, the cross-sectional area of all fibers was similar in control and undernourished muscles. This suggests that chronic undernourishment induces a delay and/or alteration in the hypertrophy process of the EDL muscle fibers in the juvenile and young adult rat (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155413480149">Goldspink 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155413480149">Rowe 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>The histoenzymatic evidence obtained in this study indicates that chronic undernourishment induces a relative increase in the proportion of fibers showing oxidative metabolism at the expense of glycolytic fibers in the EDL muscle in late preweaning, juvenile, and adult stages (PN15–PN90). In addition, a significant increase in the relative proportion of intermediate type IIa/IId fibers was accompanied by a proportional decrease in the relative proportion of type IIb fibers from PN15 to PN45. Our results partially agree with those reported in previous studies, which found that, at juvenile stages of life, several food deprivation paradigms (applied at different postnatal stages of development) induce an increase in the proportion of oxidative compared with glycolytic fibers in distinct fast muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155413480149">Bedi et al. 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155413480149">Lewis et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022155413480149">Yamaguchi et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155413480149">White et al. 2000</xref>). The relatively prolonged period of time in which EDL fibers show a predominance of oxidative metabolism in the undernourished muscles may serve as a protective mechanism against food deprivation, similar to that observed in skeletal muscles subjected to extreme conditions of enhanced neuromuscular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155413480149">Close 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155413480149">Howells et al. 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155413480149">Raju 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022155413480149">Sieck et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155413480149">White et al. 2000</xref>). Based on the consideration that muscles containing type II fibers with lower oxidative capacity are more easily fatigued, whereas muscles constituting mostly type I fibers with higher oxidative capacity are more fatigue resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155413480149">Burke and Edgerton 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155413480149">Donoghue et al. 2005</xref>), as well as the results obtained in this study indicating that undernourished EDL muscles contain an increased proportion of fibers showing oxidative metabolism concomitantly with a higher proportion of type IIa/IId fibers at PN21 to PN45, it could be argued that chronic undernourishment induces an increase in muscle fatigue resistance at those ages. In accordance with this hypothesis, an increase in the fatigue index (higher resistance to fatigue) of diaphragm muscles in the undernourished rat has been demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155413480149">Sieck et al. 1987</xref>). In summary, the evidence obtained in this study suggests that chronic undernourishment affects the fiber growth of the EDL muscle by decreasing their cell volume and/or protein content, and such alterations seem to occur concomitantly with changes in the transformation and/or differentiation from type IIa/IId to type IIb fibers and the enhancement of oxidative metabolism in the EDL muscle at the early and juvenile stages of postnatal life in the rat.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The evidence obtained in this study suggests that chronic undernourishment negatively influences muscle maturation, particularly at the early and juvenile stages of life, when the fibers increase in thickness and volume. These changes are accompanied by an enhancement in the fiber oxidative metabolism and a modification in the transformation and/or differentiation of type IIa/IId to type IIb fibers in the EDL muscle. These changes could indicate the probable occurrence of adaptive mechanisms that allow muscles to counterbalance, in a plastic and dynamic manner, the alterations provoked by chronic food deprivation.</p>
