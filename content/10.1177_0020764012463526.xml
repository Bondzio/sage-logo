<p>There is no doubt that schizophrenia is one of the most serious complex and chronic conditions, one that can lead to an ever-increasing burden of care on individuals, their families and society as a whole. An intriguing and occasionally difficult to diagnose condition, schizophrenia remains an enigma. These two books, published in 2012 by the same publisher, aim to increase our understanding. Lieberman, Stroup and Perkins’ book focuses on clinical essentials of the illness – what clinicians need to learn; and Lauriello and Pallanti focus on treatment.</p>
<p>Lieberman et al. start with epidemiology and natural history, providing a brief overview of epidemiology and the factors associated with prognosis, including recovery and chronicity. This is followed by a chapter on psychopathology, with case examples. Prodrome and first-episode, neurocognitive impairments, social and functional impairments, comorbid substance use and medical conditions form subsequent chapters. These are followed by chapters on pharmacotherapies, psychosocial therapies and treatment of chronic schizophrenia. Natural history of neurocognitive impairment is described as a precursor of schizophrenia, indicating an organic template for the condition to develop in vulnerable individuals under the ‘right’ circumstances. The interventions are well described.</p>
<p><italic>Clinical manual for treatment of schizophrenia</italic> is also an edited multi-authored volume, with 12 chapters. The first chapter sets the scene on diagnosis and epidemiology, and the following chapter describes the biological basis and basic science underlying schizophrenia. Prodromal phase and first-episode schizophrenia is taken up in the third chapter, followed by a lengthy well-constructed chapter on the clinical assessment of schizophrenia. As with the Lieberman volume, two chapters are devoted to comorbidity and substance use. Pharmacological treatments, treatment resistance, psychological interventions and family issues take up the remaining chapters, and remission is covered in the last chapter.</p>
<p>Both books are well referenced and well indexed. The Lieberman volume says it all in its title, whereas the clinical manual could have done more on the success and failure of treatments. However, clinicians at all levels will find both books helpful in day-to-day clinical practice.</p>
