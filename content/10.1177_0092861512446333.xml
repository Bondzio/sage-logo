         <abstract>
            <p>The use of a single central laboratory with universal references ranges is not always a viable option in clinical studies; examples are oncology studies where a rapid turnaround of clinical laboratory results is critical. However, the complexities associated with multiple sites, multiple laboratories, and multiple age and sex groups can lead to logistical nightmares across clinical trials and make handling laboratory data one of the most challenging, labor-intensive, and time-consuming tasks for clinical data managers, especially where different laboratories are used for the same patient. Also, evidence suggests that the reference ranges (RRs) used by the local laboratories often create a false sense of precision that is not always supported by science. Managing time-specific, demographic-specific, and site-specific RRs requires significant investment in time and labor. As a result, an alternative approach to management of local laboratory RRs that uses “standard” (sometimes called “published”) ranges has been growing in popularity over the past several years. This article attempts to compare the pros and cons of this approach relative to the historic ways of handling local laboratory RRs. Scientific, operational, and economic perspectives are also presented.</p>

         <title>Background: Importance of Reference Ranges in Clinical Research</title>
         <p>Laboratory data are critical markers of disease, hence they are a key measures of safety within clinical trials. Laboratory analytes are among the most common biomarkers used in clinical research and medical care because laboratory abnormalities often precede clinical symptoms and serve as a first indicator of potential adverse events associated with an investigational medicinal product. Because clinical laboratory results are essential to clinical trials, there is a need to collect and ensure the accuracy and integrity of a very large amount of these types of data. For example, laboratory data account for approximately 30% of the clinical data in a typical oncology phase 2 clinical trial. According to Karvanen, “In many studies and especially in early clinical development phase (such as oncology phase 1 studies), laboratory data constitute 50%-80% of the data to be collected.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512446333">1</xref>
            </sup> Based on the authors’ experience, a typical small oncology biotechnology company deals with &gt;30,000–60,000 laboratory records (vs ∼1000–1500 adverse events [AEs]) per investigational product. This order of magnitude is not insignificant. The average new drug application to the FDA contains about 573,000 laboratory test results—the sponsors might be evaluating thousands of results each day.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512446333">2</xref>

         </p>
         <p>Laboratory results are of little value without the ability to analyze the results in comparison with baseline or reference values. Laboratory results are typically either compared with other samples taken from the same subject at a different time point (eg, baseline values) or are compared with an established reference range. Reference ranges (RRs) can also be known as “normal ranges” (although not all populations can be considered truly “normal” or “healthy”).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0092861512446333">i</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>RRs are established by analyzing a large number of samples and statistically determining the appropriate range of values.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0092861512446333">ii</xref>
            </sup> Because values may differ according to variables such as age, gender, disease processes, time of day, or regional variations, multiple ranges are often established for a given laboratory test. Laboratories may either establish their own set of RRs or obtain ranges from published sources. RRs are usually collected at the beginning of a study, unless there are changes to the specimen collection, instrumentation, or methodology.<sup>

         <p>The costs of maintaining multiple normal laboratory ranges from multiple laboratories are very high. Briefly, for each laboratory, (1) clinical operations determine RRs, (2) sites or data management enter RRs into electronic data capture (EDC) systems, (3) during the monitoring process, clinical operations check that the laboratory units and ranges displayed in EDC system reflect what is on the patient laboratory report, and (4) often laboratories update RRs during the course of a study requiring additional entry and subsequent data management. As a result, multitudes of hours are invested each year to maintain and verify RRs.</p>
         <p>Why is there a need to maintain site-specific laboratory normal ranges? An informal survey conducted at the 2011 annual DIA meeting revealed that many participants believed that no alternative approach was published and no alternatives were explicitly supported by the FDA. As a result, this article attempts to fill this gap by proposing a scientifically solid and cost-effective way of handling laboratory RRs in clinical trials.</p>

(Unusual values from the sample may be censored just because they are several standard deviations from the mean and make the curve messy.<sup>

         <p>Furthermore, when the normal range changes, tracking the significance of the result can be challenging or even compromised. A case was observed for which ALT values for a patient were 51 and 48, respectively, for baseline and postbaseline. When the upper limit of the normal range decreased from 52 to 45, the patient was classified as shifting from normal to above normal, when the patient’s values actually declined.<sup>

         <p>The alternative 4 methodology allows for significant operational flexibility and adaptability. It also gives sponsor companies the ability to assess and mitigate risks on a case-by-case basis. For instance, if an investigational new drug bears risk of drug-induced liver injury, close attention might be given to those biomarkers that are indicative of liver injuries (such as bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], ALT, AST—see FDA drug-induced liver injury guidance<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092861512446333">18</xref>
            </sup> for more details). In addition, those analytes with higher variability of local RRs might be scrutinized more carefully (ie, using the cutoff point of coefficient of variation [CV] &gt; 10% suggested by Ruvuna et al<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512446333">6</xref>
            </sup>) when pooling results across laboratories relative to the analytes of lower variability or of those that bear lower risk for the particular patient population.</p>
         <p>Furthermore, compared to the inherent labor-intensiveness of the current practice (alternative 1), it is estimated that approximately 80%–90% of RR management costs can be cut. Therefore, savings of the equivalent of 0.25%–1.1% of the total typical oncology trial budget can be expected (product of all percentage points in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512446333">Table 2</xref>). Thus, aggregate industry cost savings associated with alternative 4 across all oncology clinical trials in the United States are estimated at US$144–$540 million per year.</p>

         <title>Potential Risks and Criticism of the Proposed Method</title>
         <p>Currently, the acceptance of alternative 4, utilizing published RRs, is constrained by perceived potential risks associated with this approach. What are these potential risks, and how much risk is acceptable? According to the FDA,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092861512446333">19</xref>
            </sup> “[R]isk management is an iterative process of (1) assessing a . . . benefit-risk balance, (2) developing and implementing tools to minimize its risks while preserving its benefits, (3) evaluating tool effectiveness and reassessing the benefit-risk balance, and (4) making adjustments, as appropriate, to the risk minimization tools to further improve the benefit-risk balance” Also, according to the FDA,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092861512446333">20</xref>
            </sup> “There is a growing consensus that risk-based approaches to monitoring, such as focusing on the most critical data elements, are more likely to ensure subject protection and overall study quality.” Furthermore, “Sponsors should perform a risk assessment that generally considers the types of data to be collected in a clinical trial, the specific activities required to collect these data, and the range of potential safety and other human subject protection concerns that are inherent to the clinical investigation. Sponsors should consider the findings of the risk assessment when developing a monitoring plan. There is increasing recognition that some types of errors in a clinical trial are more important than others.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092861512446333">20</xref>
            </sup> One should take a close look at the following 3 sources of potential “risks” associated with the proposed methodology of handling laboratory RRs.</p>
         <p>Clearly, risk to patient safety is the primary concern of the clinicians and regulators in clinical trials. Thus, one of the risks frequently mentioned by the opponents of the proposed process is that patients’ safety might be jeopardized in case of use of standard/published RRs because of potential misclassification of AEs. However, in this approach, use of standard/published RRs is limited to the collection/analysis of data by the sponsor companies. It is possible and recommended that the clinical investigators participating in clinical trials continue using local RRs. In essence, the clinical decision criteria at the patient level do not change. Thus, there is no additional risk to the patients from using alternative 4.</p>
         <p>The second set of concerns is the risks associated with analysis and reporting of laboratory data, more specifically potential underreporting or overreporting of AEs (because of the small differences in CTC grade calculations using local and standard RRs). For example, one may argue that there is a possibility of “incorrect” calculations of maximum tolerated dose in dose-escalation studies. In our opinion, these risks are overestimated, for worrying about “incorrect” dosing presumes that a set of normal ranges is correct and another set is incorrect, and we do think they are merely inconsistent. One could propose that the local laboratory ranges be used for patient care if there is a difference. Many trials use central laboratories as well as local laboratories, and the results will vary. If there are concerns about incorrect dosing presuming that the local laboratory range is correct, then use of a central laboratory would carry the same concern, and most major drug trials use central laboratories.</p>
         <p>The third type of risk might come from the potential bias when the authors of the study protocol are free to select across multiple published RRs for a particular marker. This risk can be minimized either by setting the laboratory RR standards at the industry level or by additional requirements imposed on the sponsor companies being held to the question of why one published RR was chosen over another.</p>
         <p>Finally, it can be argued that the existing (alternative 1, local RRs) method bears some risks to the patient, for it is noted that when urgent (nonscheduled) laboratory results are needed and alternative laboratories are used, errors in interpretation may arise.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The evidence above suggests that the RRs used by the local laboratories often create a false sense of precision that is not always supported by science. Local RRs are based on the local populations evaluated by the hospital. It is possible but not very likely that this local population of the particular hospital is more representative of the patients in the study than the population used to calculate the standard/published RRs, unless the hospital is a specialty hospital that treats only a narrow set of diseases. Even oncology centers are usually located in a general hospital whose laboratories serve a broad range of patients of different ages, races, and genders, many of whom may be healthy persons who are getting annual physicals. Thus, the fears associated with perceived “risks” of using standard RRs are unfounded. The concern over “incorrect” dosing (or “incorrect” analysis) because of the use of standard/textbook RRs presumes that a set of normal ranges is correct and another set is incorrect, while they may merely be inconsistent. In addition, based on the authors’ experience, the differences in grading laboratory AEs using standard RRs versus local RRs are relatively clinically insignificant (5%-15%).</p>
         <p>Based on the evidence presented, it is recommended that the existing process be altered to the use of standard RR methods (ie, those set by the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>)<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861512446333">16</xref>
            </sup> by pharmaceutical companies for data analysis purposes. At the same time, personnel at investigational sites can be instructed to perform dose modifications and grade AEs based on site-specific ranges, if the sponsor company prefers a less controversial approach.</p>
         <p>There is no single best uniform approach to every possible situation in managing local RRs in clinical trials, and study-specific approaches should be selected based on study details such as indication, study population, critical analytes, sample size, and so on. In addition, research might be needed to determine the precise sensitivities of each parameter. In approaching any new study, it is important to discern between the analytes of the higher risk/importance and the analytes or lower risk/importance. The high importance analytes need to be scrutinized much more thoroughly than the others. In doing so, the clinical trial sponsors will follow the FDA recommendation that “each sponsor [should] design a monitoring plan that is tailored to the specific human subject protection and data integrity risks of the trial.”<sup>

         </p>
         <p>There is anecdotal evidence that the standard RR methodology has been successfully used in the United States by a number of reputable pharmaceutical companies. If the standard RR method is adapted, industry-wide cost savings in the United States could approach US$144–$540 million per year. Open support of the standard RRs by the FDA and EMA (European Medicines Agency) could assist with changing the status quo and accelerating the wider acceptance of the method in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
