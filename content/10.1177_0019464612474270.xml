<p>This book is about the haj pilgrimage from British India between 1860 and 1920. It discusses the management of the haj and the spiritual journeys of the pilgrims via both the official India Office archives as well as Urdu travelogues and memoirs of pilgrims. It frames British positioning on ethical issues like the control of contagious diseases, epidemics and quarantine in the political and commercial imperatives of imperial politics. According to the author, Saurabh Mishra, the haj is a critical forum to study the evolution of colonial dilemmas and predicaments in the realm of medicine, health, gender and free trade.</p>
<p>Mishra showcases the pilgrims’ destination—Mecca—as the site around which medical and scientific debates on the cholera epidemic evolved. He discusses the official management of the pilgrims’ journey to Mecca as a way of highlighting the differences of opinion within the colonial administration on the causes of this epidemic. The provincial voices argued that it had to do with public hygiene, customs and habits and was contagious. Indian pilgrims could well become carriers of the disease. On the contrary, the representatives at the international sanitary conference (1866), driven by larger imperial concerns, pushed for the non-contagious theory.</p>
<p>Mishra draws on Michael Foucault’s notion of the authoritative and intrusive state that monopolises medical governance. He uses his notion of ‘medicalising’ to describe the post-1866 British and European medical intrusions in Mecca: emergence of hospitals, dispensaries, quarantine locales, health boards and medical periodicals overseeing the city. Mishra is surprised that neither the Urdu press nor the elite pilgrims object to this ‘medicalisation’ of the city. He also comments on the silence of the Unani practitioners on this issue. And from such silences he questions the centrality of Mecca in forging the pan-Islam frame that according to him also shadows the Indian Muslim psyche.</p>
<p>One very much appreciates Mishra’s bringing to the fore the material context and processes of ‘medicalisation’: the working and impact of quarantine on the islands of Kamaran island and that of Toru; the descriptions of everyday life on these islands and the urban economy that they trigger; the concerns for the dignity of women and the debates around issues of elite gender concerns; the interplay of the elite and poor pilgrims; and the evolution of the social and cultural stereotypes of the Arab as representing a ‘delimited’ territory. However, the very prevalence of these processes, as they reconfigure within the frame of British and European medical governance, indicates the limits to the totalising power of the Foucaultian medical ‘hegemony’ that the book appears to assume and take for granted. And thus the fascinating details of developments and the economic, social and administrative changes in Mecca and the quarantine islands that the book offers run counter to Mishra’s distancing himself from the ‘limited raj’ thesis. Indeed, the ‘limited raj’ as defined by Anand Yang some years back referred not merely to the failure of colonial rule to permeate to the local level, but to its inability or disinclination to monopolise power in the Foucault way. And given the many possibilities that the ‘medicalising’ of Mecca opened for the Unani medical men and Indian Muslim literati and entrepreneurs, the Urdu press and their silence on the issue may seem less bewildering! For instance, Juan Cole, Omar Khalidi and others have shown that schools, madrasas, guest houses, clean water canals and roads for the well-being, health and hygiene of Indian hajis and pilgrims in general saw Indian entrepreneur, Muslim royalty and elite invest in the city. Indian private publishers visited the city looking for business from many fugitive Indian Muslim scholars settled there. And the lectures of Indian Muslim Unani medical men attracted a continuous traffic from nineteenth-century Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>On the issue of the silence of the Urdu press on the medicalising process reflecting chinks in the pan-Islam psyche of India Muslims, there is a lot to be said. The vast and rich literature on pan-Islamism in the nineteenth century is conspicuous by its absence in this book. This scholarship has already effectively questioned the centrality of Mecca in such a transcendental frame. The idea that Unani practitioners and the Urdu press in the nineteenth century will be the watch- dog of the British administration of pilgrims in Mecca also misses out on the new scholarship on both the printing press and Unani social history. Their histories, as shown by Ulrike Starke, Freitag, Guy Attewell and my own work respectively, were far too entangled with colonial rule to offer predictable and simplistic responses to medicalisation. Finally, while this book gives an interesting and fresh account of the administration of haj and its links with the debates on the medical investigations on cholera, it falls short of scholarly rigour when it touches on the Muslim intellectual and social histories to round off its argument. The effort to combine the history of disease with the colonial management of Muslim religious and social trajectories is welcome. But the thin readings on the latter do not help build the case of the former.</p>
