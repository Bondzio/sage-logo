<abstract>
<p>Sedation during invasive procedures provides appropriate humanitarian care as well as facilitates the completion of procedures. Although generally safe and effective, adverse effects may occur especially in patients with comorbid diseases. One particularly challenging situation is the child with an anterior mediastinal mass who requires sedation during performance of a biopsy to obtain a tissue diagnosis. When there is evidence of airway compromise, it is generally accepted that the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is necessary as complete airway obstruction may occur, if positive pressure ventilation is chosen. We present the use of a dexmedetomidine–ketamine combination for procedural sedation in a three-year-old child who presented with a large mediastinal mass and respiratory compromise. Previous reports regarding the use of dexmedetomidine and ketamine for procedural sedation are reviewed and the potential efficacy of this combination is discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Invasive and noninvasive procedures remain a common and necessary component in the management of children with acute diseases. Although procedural sedation is generally safe and effective, patients with underlying comorbid conditions are at increased risk of complications during and after the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111416523">1</xref></sup> One particularly difficult and challenging situation is the patient with an anterior mediastinal mass who requires sedation for the performance of a biopsy to arrive at a tissue diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111416523">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111416523"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111416523">4</xref></sup> When there is more than a 50% decrease in the cross-sectional diameter of the airway, preoperative symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome, or airway/respiratory compromise, it is generally accepted that the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is necessary as complete airway obstruction may occur if positive pressure ventilation is chosen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111416523">5</xref></sup> In such scenarios, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may be the only way to salvage these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111416523">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111416523">7</xref></sup> We present the use of a dexmedetomidine–ketamine combination for procedural sedation in a three-year-old child who presented with a large mediastinal mass and respiratory compromise.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>Approval for the retrospective review of this case and presentation of the material in this format was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, Ohio). A three-year-old, 14 kg female status post allogeneic bone marrow transplant for lymphoblastic (T-cell) lymphoma presented with a one- to two-week history of abdominal pain and a progressively worsening cough. Four days earlier, she had been seen at an outside emergency room and diagnosed with pneumonia and croup. A course of an oral antibiotic had been started and a single dose of dexamethasone (dose unknown) administered. Her white blood cell count at the time was 11,400/mm<sup>3</sup>. Worsening of her symptoms prompted reevaluation due to her parents’ increasing concerns and she arrived at our institution. The parents had also noted swelling of her neck and face. On arrival, the child was acutely ill with tachypnea and nasal flaring. Her oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry was 92% to 93% on room air. She was agitated and would not cooperate with the placement of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula or facemask. She avoided laying flat and had a harsh, croup-like cough. Chest radiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111416523">Figure 1</xref>
) revealed bilateral pleural effusions, left-sided atelectasis versus pneumonia, and a widened superior mediastinum compatible with a mediastinal mass. Computed tomography scan of the chest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135111416523">Figure 2</xref>
) revealed a large soft tissue mass in the mediastinum which extended to the thoracic inlet. The mass completely encircled the brachiocephalic vessels, the aortic arch, trachea, and several of the central venous structures. The mass was relatively homogeneous and measured 6.5 cm transversely, 7.3 cm in anterioposterior (AP) dimension, and approximately 6.8 cms craniocaudally. There was generalized narrowing of the intrathoracic trachea related to the circumferential mass. The trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet measured 9 × 12 mm in the transverse and AP dimensions, respectively, whereas the distal trachea measured 5 × 7 mm in the transverse and AP dimensions (cross-sectional area of 108 vs 35 mm<sup>2</sup>). There was also a moderate-sized pericardial effusion and bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions. Consultation with cardiothoracic surgery and anesthesia were obtained to facilitate obtaining tissue for a diagnosis. Given the patient’s condition, it was decided that the safest option was to proceed with the biopsy of a large cervical/supraclavicular mass/lymph node. After discussion with the cardiothoracic surgeon, a plan was made to accomplish the biopsy using procedural sedation. Prior to bringing the patient into the cardiac operating room, the perfusion team was alerted. They were in the hospital with a primed circuit in the event that CPB was needed. The difficult airway cart was available with standard items for dealing with a potentially difficult airway related to a mediastinal mass including flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopes of varying sizes and microlaryngeal endotracheal tubes (26-28 cm in length with outside diameters of 3.0 and 4.0 mm). Additionally, the operating room had rigid bronchoscopes available in the event that airway management became necessary due to airway obstruction.</p>

<p>Prior to coming to the operating room, topical anesthetic cream was placed over the right cervical area and a peripheral intravenous cannula was placed in her right hand. The patient’s father brought her into the operating room and remained throughout the biopsy. Routine American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors were placed including continuous electrocardiograph (ECG), continuous pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) measured through a nasal cannula, and intermittent noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP). Her room air oxygen saturation was 92%, her heart rate (HR) was 180 to 190 beats/min, her respiratory rate was 28 to 40 breaths/min with nasal flaring and use of accessory muscles of respiratory. She was kept sitting up at a 30° to 45° angle throughout. She was too agitated to allow for an initial BP reading. Dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg) and ketamine (1 mg/kg) were administered over 5 minutes. Two minutes after starting these medications, she was calm enough to allow the placement of a nasal cannula. In an attempt to provide continuous nasal positive airway pressure (CPAP), an adult-sized nasal cannula with ETCO<sub>2</sub>-sensing capabilities was placed and oxygen delivered at 4 L/min. The patient’s initial HR decreased to 160 beats/min and the first measured NIBP was 104/58 mm Hg after the bolus dose of ketamine and dexmedetomidine. The ETCO<sub>2</sub> was 36 mm Hg. A dexmedetomidine infusion was started at 0.5 μg/kg per hour. After sterile preparation and draping, the incision site on the neck was infiltrated with 2 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine. During the 80-minute procedure (biopsy), additional doses of ketamine (0.3-0.5 mg/kg) were administered every 30 to 45 minutes as needed based on the patient’s response to the procedure. Throughout the procedure, the HR was 120 to 140 beats/min, the respiratory rate was 20 to 24 breaths/min, the ETCO<sub>2</sub> was 34 to 40 mm Hg, and the NIBP was 80 to 100/40-64 mm Hg. After the lymph node/neck mass biopsy, the patient was repositioned on the operating room table, again maintaining a 30° to 45° head-up position. The dexmedetomidine infusion was continued at 0.5 μg/kg per min. Additional doses of ketamine (0.3-0.5 mg/kg) were administered every 30 to 45 minutes as needed. A percutaneous intravenous central catheter (PICC) was attempted in the right antecubital area, but due to technical difficulties from previous central venous cannulae and thrombotic complications, it could not be advanced into the central circulation. A PICC line was successfully placed via a femoral approach. The entire procedure (biopsy and PICC line placement) lasted approximately 135 minutes. The patient was transported to the postanesthesia care unit and the remainder of her postoperative course was uneventful. The biopsy was positive for recurrent lymphoblastic lymphoma and she is currently undergoing chemotherapy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dexmedetomidine is an α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist which received initial approval from the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1999, for the sedation of adults during mechanical ventilation and subsequently in 2009 for monitored anesthesia care (MAC) of adults. Despite lacking a specific FDA-approved indication in infants and children, it has been used successfully in several different clinical scenarios including sedation during mechanical ventilation, procedural sedation, supplementation of postoperative analgesia, prevention of emergence delirium, control of postanesthesia shivering, and the treatment of withdrawal from various substances including opioids and benzodiazepines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111416523">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our patient, concerns included the need to provide effective sedation to obtain tissue for a diagnosis while minimizing the potential for apnea and the need for positive pressure ventilation, given the tracheal compression and baseline respiratory dysfunction. Although propofol is a frequently chosen agent for procedural sedation, providing a rapid onset and recovery, it may be associated with adverse effects on both hemodynamic and respiratory functions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111416523">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111416523"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111416523">11</xref></sup> the latter including respiratory depression, apnea, and upper airway obstruction. Such effects are significantly less common with dexmedetomidine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111416523">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111416523">13</xref></sup> However, despite its efficacy as the sole agent for sedation during nonpainful radiologic imaging,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111416523">14</xref></sup> dexmedetomidine may fail when used as the sole agent for painful procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111416523">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111416523">16</xref></sup> In such scenarios, we have found that the combination of dexmedetomidine with ketamine may be used to provide the optimal level of sedation and analgesia with limited effects on respiratory and cardiovascular function.</p>
<p>The use of ketamine provides several benefits including the provision of analgesia which is not present with dexmedetomidine, an increase in HR and BP to offset the bradycardia of dexmedetomidine, and a more rapid onset when compared to dexmedetomidine alone. Dexmedetomidine prevents several of the potential deleterious effects of ketamine including emergence agitation, excessive salivation, and stimulation of the cardiovascular system (increased HR and BP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111416523">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical experience with the combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine continues to increase with the demonstration of its efficacy in prospective trials, case series, and isolated case reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111416523">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111416523"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150135111416523"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111416523"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150135111416523"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150135111416523">23</xref></sup> In the majority of these reports, as in our patient, effective sedation was provided by an initial loading dose of ketamine and dexmedetomidine followed by a dexmedetomidine infusion supplemented with intermittent, as needed bolus doses of ketamine. Mester et al successfully used this combination for sedation during cardiac catheterization in the pediatric population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111416523">18</xref></sup> The dosing regimen included a bolus dose of ketamine (2 mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg) administered over 3 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine. Of the 16 patients, 3 required supplementation with an additional bolus dose of ketamine during the procedure. Adequate hemodynamic and respiratory functions were maintained. Two patients developed upper airway obstruction which responded to repositioning of the airway. Mild hypercarbia was noted with a Pa<sc>co</sc>
<sub>2</sub> ≥ 45 mm Hg in seven patients. In another case series, McVey and Tobias described the successful use of dexmedetomidine and ketamine for procedural sedation during lumbar puncture for spinal anesthesia in 12 pediatric patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111416523">19</xref></sup> The dosing regimen for the ketamine and dexmedetomidine was similar to that reported by Mester et al.</p>
<p>Reports of the use of dexmedetomidine with or without ketamine for sedation in patients with a mediastinal mass are limited.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150135111416523">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150135111416523">24</xref>
</sup> Abdelmalak et al described the use of high-dose dexmedetomidine to provide anesthesia in two adults with anterior mediastinal masses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150135111416523">23</xref></sup> In both cases, sedative doses of dexmedetomidine (bolus dose of 1 μg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.6 μg/kg per h) were used to facilitate awake endotracheal intubation. Following this, the high-dose technique which was described by the authors as up to five times the usual sedative dose of 0.2 to 0.7 μg/kg per h was used as the primary component of a general anesthetic which allowed the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation during bronchoscopic tumor debridement.</p>
<p>Mahmoud et al described a case similar to ours in which dexmedetomidine was used for sedation during biopsy of a mediastinal mass in a 4-year-old, 20-kg patient who was unable to lay supine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150135111416523">24</xref></sup> Dexmedetomidine was administered as a loading dose of 2 μg/kg over 10 minutes followed by an infusion at 2 μg/kg per h. During the loading dose, ketamine (10 mg) was administered. After the loading dose of ketamine and dexmedetomidine, propofol (1 mg/kg) was administered to facilitate the placement of a laryngeal mask airway. Anesthesia was maintained with the dexmedetomidine infusion and intermittent bolus doses of midazolam (total dose of 1 mg) and ketamine (total dose of 30 mg). A percutaneous needle biopsy of the mediastinal mass was performed without incident followed by a bone marrow aspirate and lumbar puncture.</p>
<p>Although we chose to proceed with sedation for our patient, whenever such a decision is made, a formalized plan to deal with airway obstruction must be in place. In such patients, simple maneuvers such as the application of CPAP or changing position even into the prone position may be necessary to relieve complete airway obstruction. Additionally, given that complete airway obstruction may occur, access to appropriate equipment including a difficult airway cart, rigid bronchoscopes, and the ready ability to proceed to some type of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) must be in place. We would suggest that the latter include a perfusionist at hand with a primed CPB or ECMO circuit. In the event that general anesthesia is considered in such patients, the above mentioned equipment and facilities are also mandatory. If general anesthesia is chosen, neuromuscular-blocking agents should be avoided and spontaneous ventilation maintained. Alternatively, in extreme cases with significant impairment of hemodynamic or respiratory function, preoperative chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be used to provide tumor shrinkage and resolution of symptomatology. However, as in many other centers, our standard practice per the pediatric oncologists is to try to obtain tissue whenever feasible as it is postulated that preoperative radiation or chemotherapy may alter the efficacy of tissue diagnosis and distort tumor markers that are used to determine chemotherapeutic regimens.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that a bolus dose of ketamine and dexmedetomidine followed by a dexmedetomidine infusion provided effective sedation for biopsy of a cervical lymph node/mass and placement of a PICC line in a three-year-old with a large mediastinal mass and respiratory compromise. This combination of agents was chosen, given the need to maintain spontaneous ventilation. Regardless of the agent or agents used for procedural sedation, there is a potential for not only hemodynamic, but also respiratory depression. Given these concerns, appropriate monitoring and access to resuscitation medications and airway equipment is mandatory during procedural sedation. With these caveats in mind, we believe that in this and other clinical scenarios, the combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine should be considered when choosing agents for procedural sedation.</p>
