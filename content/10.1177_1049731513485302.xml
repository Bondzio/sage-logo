<p>This book is a foundational text explicitly intended for undergraduate and graduate students in social work programs. The overarching purposes of the book are to provide students with a broadened understanding of evidence-informed practice (EIP), to link the relationship between assessment and intervention of clients across the life cycle through an EIP lens, and to describe the tools, resources, knowledge base, and critical thinking skills essential for EIP.</p>
<p>The book has 10 chapters written by seasoned social work practitioners and scholars who are affiliated with social work schools throughout the United States, as well as two authors from New Zealand. It is organized according to the life span (stages of the life span), with separate chapters on EIP assessments and interventions for each life stage including children, adolescents, adults, and elderly. There is one chapter focusing on assessing and intervening with families. The three editors thoughtfully structured the text so that chapters on interventions follow those on assessments, a creative approach that is mindful of the practical application of EIP, and also helps students make the essential links between assessment and intervention in a way that is both intuitive and instructive. The editors also offer an appropriate scope for each chapter, one that is neither too broad or nor too narrow, as each chapter generally follows a format sequentially addressing key points of historical background, summaries of current EIPs, limitations of EIPs, and implications for social work practice at the micro, mezzo, and macro levels. The depth and breadth dimensions of this book are well developed for the student reader.</p>
<p>All of the chapters, with the exception of those on adolescence, follow the introductory paragraphs with a discussion of historical background, as it pertains to the life stage cohort and its associated assessments or interventions. Like an extended preface, this subsection helps ground students in the advancement of EIP over the course of time, reinforcing its current importance through an understanding of its historical development. In these subsections, the authors blend contextual factors of the life stage group as they have changed over time, with debates that have shaped the progression of research and practice as well as important scholar–practitioners in the field who have developed well-supported interventions and assessments. Each chapter provides a highly readable and well-articulated orientation to EIP and as such, assists the reader in not only catching the wave of EIP but also riding with it.</p>
<p>Further, the summary of current EIPs in each chapter was a helpful source of relevant information for students not only pertaining to existing EIP’s but also in describing how to locate, evaluate, fit, and integrate EIP into clinical practice. Numerous student-friendly tables, charts, and other diagrams are woven throughout each chapter providing clear presentations of the material. The authors take various approaches to summarize what is a considerably large topic in order to condense it into one coherent overview. Many highlight theories and/or explain scales as well as other instruments for assessment and intervention that have demonstrated validity and reliability to achieve this goal. Other authors provide extensive charts of current literature listing both quantitative and qualitative research regarding conceptual/theoretical frameworks, outcome studies, and specified interventions. Still others offer emerging trends, overviews, and in-depth descriptions of widely used programs and approaches that have shown promising effectiveness.</p>
<p>What was equally valuable for student learning, however, was the text’s incorporation of limitations of EIPs. In each chapter, these primarily addressed the reality that research is conducted under certain conditions by specifically trained individuals, producing results that are therefore, not always readily generalizable. Acknowledging limitations as such balances the tension between encouraging students to utilize the resources shown to have demonstrated effectiveness, while also communicating the importance of being responsive to issues transcending practice such as gender, ethnicity, culture, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion and spirituality, and ethics that must be addressed in order to advance current EIPs and ultimately improve social work practice. A consistent message running throughout these chapters is the need for more research on assessments and interventions with individuals of diverse and underrepresented groups. Several authors caution students that different instruments for assessment and intervention are neither developed for nor are readily transferable to all populations. They also address important issues particular to the social work perspective and value base, such as critiquing the lack of assessment instruments that use a strengths-based perspective, over and against the prevailing tendency to pathologize and label clients in the assessment process.</p>
<p>Broadening the vantage point and addressing how the work of the profession is integrated across systems, the authors address how EIPs are impactful at micro, mezzo, and macro levels. Although not every author entitled their subsection “Implications for Social Work,” all address the topic at some point in the chapter, perhaps with a slightly different title such as “Context and Focus of Treatment,” as in the chapter on adolescent interventions (Chapter 4). As a volume aligned more toward the clinical end of the social work practice spectrum, understanding these different contexts of practice is an important topic for student learning that reinforces the reality that the boundaries between these levels are by no means rigid, but highly permeable. Although authors take various approaches to address this topic, some address particular challenges social workers face at each level, such as the difficulty to perform adequate assessments at the micro level, given the time limitations imposed by the managed care context. Others identify and elaborate on contexts that see the integration of all three of these levels, such as working with children in schools, whereas another author uses the framework as an opportunity to provide suggestions for practice at each level.</p>
<p>Across the poignant discussions and data provided in each chapter, it is evident that the contributors are operating out of an EIP definition that endorses the use of empirically supported research, but one that also embraces a wide array of systemically collected data such as case studies, research study findings, reviews of literature, best or promising practices, and evidence from the experiences of various practitioners, consumers, policy makers, and so forth. Within this broadened view, the volume exhibits no bias of supporting a rigid hierarchy or rank ordering with regard to what constitutes “evidence,” per se. This nonelitist orientation to evidence in practice is perhaps best seen in the depth of attention given to essential therapeutic practices, systems and ecological theoretical frameworks, contextual factors, and special concerns for specific populations.</p>
<p>Throughout the text, students will read about the importance of the common therapeutic factors of empathy, warmth, and authenticity, paramount for effective work. He or she will see sample genograms, ecomaps, culturagrams, questionnaires, diagrams of ecological frameworks, and numerous tables listing everything from steps for teaching social skills to cognitive interview procedures. By emphasizing these factors alongside the assessments and interventions with demonstrated effectiveness, the volume communicates the irreplaceable value of practitioner knowledge as one of many sources widening the scope of defining EIP. As a result, this text acts like a bridge by addressing the need for stronger empirical foundations for social work practice, as our social work profession begins to more meaningfully embrace evidence in practice. The inclusiveness of how the book and its authors utilize evidence is refreshing to any student or practitioner.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are a few minor areas of this well-edited volume with room for improvement. Because it is a foundational text for social work students, an extended preface or introductory chapter providing a more comprehensive conceptual foundation of EIP would add clarity, especially with reference to specific terms associated with EIP and its framework. Students may benefit from having more information regarding the debates over how terms have been and are used, with a general sense of the climate regarding EIP in social work. As is, many authors use the phrase evidence-based practice throughout the book, as that has been the term used for the past decade; in addition, they each provide separate definitions leaving the reader with several descriptions of commonly used terms. Second, selective case examples for each life span group showing the process of assessment and intervention together would help strengthen the link between these concomitant tasks in a way that some students may more readily learn from.</p>
<p>True to its intent, this book is very readable and student-friendly. Each chapter begins with text boxes that address the overall purpose, rationale, EIP presentation, and overarching questions of the chapter. The points made in these alternative abstracts are succinct yet informative, and are especially helpful in setting the terrain for student thinking without defeating their purpose by being overly complicated or inapplicable. Without question, the editors’ incorporation of these boxes offers a fresh contribution to the structuring of foundational texts, one that is sure to set a new trend for other volumes of its kind. Likewise, the conclusion of each chapter is student oriented in its provision of key terms, review questions for critical thinking, and invaluable links to online resources. Key terms are an often overlooked asset, but in a text that features the importance of research as it relates to evaluation, policy, and practice, here they follow the structure of a journal article with all the more relevancy and, moreover, encourage students to pursue their own further research. Ultimately however, the links to online resources are like finding gold at the end of the rainbow. Throughout every chapter, authors cite numerous organizations where EIP resources can be located and all of these, plus more, are listed with descriptions and website links at the end of the chapter. For this feature alone, many social workers would benefit from having a copy on their desk.</p>
