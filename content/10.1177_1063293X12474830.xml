<abstract>
<p>Conventional simulators have focused on the abstract aspects of an automatic storage and retrieval system, which mainly deals with design verification, alternative comparison, and system diagnosis. Although such simulators can provide overall system visibility by monitoring how well the process works, the simulation models are not sufficiently realistic for detailed design and implementation purposes. To address this problem, we propose a method of control level simulation of an automatic storage and retrieval system in an automobile plant. The proposed method involves four major steps: (1) designing the process and layout for effective storage and retrieval; (2) abstract simulation of the automatic storage and retrieval system; (3) preparing the mechanical design to obtain three-dimensional kinematic models and the electrical design to produce a control program and a plant model; and (4) control level simulation of the automatic storage and retrieval system, including both manual mode and automode simulations via a human–machine interface. The major benefit of the proposed method is the reduction of the construction time and effort required to validate the programmable logic controller program of a real automatic storage and retrieval system, since potential errors can be detected and fixed before actual implementation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Changing customer values, technological advancements, new competitors, global sourcing, regulatory mandates, and industry restructuring are creating unprecedented changes and challenges in the automobile industry. An automobile manufacturer that would remain competitive in the continuously changing marketplace must persistently strive for improved production systems and products.</p>
<p>In a broad sense, an automatic storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) is one that automatically stores and retrieves materials from storage without direct handling by a human worker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063293X12474830">Eastman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063293X12474830">Lindkvist, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063293X12474830">Vasili et al., 2008</xref>). An AS/RS that flexibly supplies panels to the right place and at the right time is one of the most important automated facilities in automobile production. It consists of numerous pieces of equipment and systems (AS/RS vehicles, racks, conveyers, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), trolley carts, programmable logic controller (PLC) systems, control systems, and computer planning) that transport the panels and aid flexibility in making operational changes. It can be used to increase production volume, automate facility control, and strengthen inventory. AS/RS is the kernel of automated logistics, flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), and computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM).</p>
<p>Since an AS/RS is a huge and complex system that moves many things concurrently, it is important to consider both the mechanical and the control aspects when implementing it. From a mechanical perspective, the facilities should be designed to avoid crashes and ensure proper movement by taking into consideration relevant kinematic factors. Once the mechanical design has been developed, the electrical design should begin. From the control perspective, the PLC program, which controls the entire system, should be properly designed and validated to move controlled factors sequentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063293X12474830">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063293X12474830">Chuang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063293X12474830">David, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063293X12474830">Jang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063293X12474830">Manesis and Akantziotis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063293X12474830">Rullan, 1997</xref>). Although unforeseen errors occur in the system, the program copes with them efficiently. If a means could be found for testing a complete system from these two perspectives before it is implemented, it would reduce the efforts required to stabilize the system.</p>
<p>Considering the huge costs and risks involved, it is impractical to attempt a full on-site testing of an entire system from both perspectives before implementation.</p>
<p>Simulation and emulation systems have been proven to be accurate predictors and valuable tools for validating and implementing AS/RSs. They provide overall system visibility by monitoring how well the process works, which is often impossible in real situations. They are also powerful analysis tools that can be used for studying many operation alternatives and for testing a system’s ability to cope with unexpected situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X12474830">Al-Ahmari and Ridgway, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063293X12474830">Hibnio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063293X12474830">Jang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063293X12474830">Klingstam and Gullander, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Considerable study has been undertaken in the field of control level simulation and validation of AS/RSs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063293X12474830">XuSong and HongBin (2006)</xref> discussed the concept, the modeling method of building an AS/RS real-time simulator, and a control integrated system based on the AS/RS control system structure. They proposed some key features and the more significant methods of building simulation models using virtual reality. Their research investigated the design, simulation, and testing of new AS/RSs, and the diagnosis of problems in existing AS/RSs. All the results showed that the proposed integrated system is indeed feasible and has many benefits. In another research, they also discussed the case study of the simulation and evaluation of an automobile part factory AS/RS using the commercial software FlexSim<sup>®</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063293X12474830">XuSong and HongBin, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063293X12474830">Lee et al. (1996)</xref> discussed a computer simulation model of a narrow-aside AS/RS serviced by rail-guided vehicles. The model can be used to analyze the system’s operational logic and to investigate the effects of key parameters on its performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063293X12474830">Park et al. (2008)</xref> proposed the architecture of a PLC program environment that enables visual verification and integrated the program with the corresponding plant model. The proposed architecture provided a theoretical method for developing a plant model based on discrete event system specifications (DEVS) for the PLC simulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12474830">Park et al. (2010)</xref> reported an automated procedure for constructing a plant model of a simple manufacturing cell. The method, however, has a couple of limitations: (1) to generate the plant model, the PLC symbols need to follow the naming convention of the proposed method, and (2) the tasks of a manufacturing device must be repetitive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063293X12474830">Roodbergen and Vis (2009)</xref> provided a literature overview of the last 30 years of AS/RSs. They proposed a general description of AS/RSs and a classification of related design and control issues. They categorized the main components of an AS/RS into racks, cranes, input/output (I/O) points, and pick position. Their article is a critical overview of the important issues concerning the design and control of AS/RSs in both production and distribution environments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063293X12474830">Amato et al. (2005)</xref> developed a control algorithm of an automated warehouse system using the colored timed Petri nets framework. A simulation model of a multi-aisle AS/RS has also been developed to compare the performances of analytical travel time models for the computation of the travel time in an AS/RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063293X12474830">Lerher et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, Fumarola and Poelman discussed possible manual and automatic distribution methods for the purpose of generating three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments. They presented different facets of the process, from the initial gathering of data to the final delivery. Although many studies have been conducted on the simulation of AS/RSs, few have focused on the control level and construction.</p>
<p>In an automobile assembly plant, an AS/RS acts as a buffer between the “press line” (stamping operation) and the “body assembly line” (body building operation). Press lines are ahead of all other operations in the assembly plant, so if the stampings are not sufficient, all the other operations would be affected. The control of an AS/RS was formerly not complicated, since the press and assembly lines handled only a single type of vehicle. Nowadays, it is much different.</p>
<p>With the increasing demand for a variety of vehicles, the need for smaller production lots, and frequent model changes, an AS/RS should be sufficiently responsive and adaptable to a broad range of circumstances. The control of an AS/RS is different from that of a regular robotic manufacturing system (e.g. a welding robot cell, trimming robot cell, or stamping cell). While robotic cells are usually triggered by a single output signal from a controller, an AS/RS is triggered by the <italic>demand</italic> from the next operation (body assembly line). Since the triggering of the AS/RS includes highly complex information, we devised a pallet data structure and proposed an effective way of using it to verify the control program of the system.</p>
<p>The objective of this study is the development of a control level simulation that can be used to verify the mechanical and electrical designs of an AS/RS of an automobile plant. Many articles have been written on the abstract aspects of this subject, but they have mainly focused on design verification, alternative comparison, and system diagnosis of an AS/RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063293X12474830">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063293X12474830">Lee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063293X12474830">XuSong and HongBin, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063293X12474830">2007</xref>), with only a few addressing the control level. This article proposes a method for simulating the control level of an AS/RS based on a virtual factory. It affords a realistic impression of an AS/RS using 3D graphic models and a real factory PLC program. The major benefit of the proposed method is the reduction of the construction time and efforts required to validate the PLC program of a real AS/RS, since potential errors can be detected and fixed before actual implementation.</p>
<p>The overall structure of the rest of this article is as follows: Section “Control level simulation of an AS/RS” addresses the overall framework of our control level simulation of an AS/RS for verifying the stem’s mechanical and electrical designs. Section “Model development for control level simulation” describes an efficient method for developing a model that can be synchronized with the mechanical and control designs of the simulated system. Finally, concluding remarks are made in section “Discussion and conclusions.”</p>

<title>Control level simulation of an AS/RS</title>
<p>First, it is necessary to identify why we need to verify an AS/RS model at the control level rather than at the abstract level. An abstract level simulation verifies conceptual models of a real thing, state of affairs, or process. Its main purpose is to verify the flow or logical problems from a macroscopic point of view. Although it can prove to be a powerful tool for the abstract level verification of a production system, it is not suitable for verifying PLC programs at the control level. Since PLC programs contain low-level information, sensor signals, interlock signals, and detailed information about signal sequence, it is necessary to separately simulate these. Thus, we propose a method for verifying the control logic of an AS/RS.</p>
<p>An AS/RS is a combination of equipment and controls that handle, store, and retrieve materials with precision and speed under a defined degree of automation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1063293X12474830">Figure 1</xref>. Such systems vary from relatively simple, manually controlled order-picking machines operating in small storage facilities to extremely large, computer-controlled storage/retrieval systems totally integrated into a manufacturing and distribution process. The AS/RS is used to increase production volume in automated manufacturing plants through facility control and strengthening of inventory.</p>

</fig>
<p>As a result of these factors, an AS/RS is a huge and very complex system. Traditionally, the main purpose of an AS/RS simulation is the verification of logistic issues by means of an abstract plant model. The findings of many studies on AS/RSs using abstract level simulation languages, including ARENA<sup>®</sup> and Automod<sup>®</sup>, have been used to solve logistic problems and optimize schedules in the systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063293X12474830">Anglani et al., 2002</xref>). However, they remain analysis tools for the initial design (abstract level) of an AS/RS, since their simulation models are not sufficiently realistic for detailed design or implementation purposes (control level).</p>
<p>To overcome these problems, control level simulation techniques are needed for the offline verification of a PLC program by means of a plant model (the counterpart model). Since PLC programs only contain control information and no device models, it is necessary to build a corresponding plant model in order to perform a simulation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1063293X12474830">Figure 2</xref>. The plant model interconnects the input and output of the PLC, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1063293X12474830">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12474830">Park et al., 2010</xref>). The behavior of the plant model should be the same as that of the actual plant in order to verify the PLC. Since a production line consists of various devices such as robots, transporters, jigs, solenoids, and sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063293X12474830">Groover, 2006</xref>), a plant model can be regarded as a set of device models. By means of simulation, it is possible to achieve the following benefits: (1) reduction of the time and cost required for implementing the PLC program of an AS/RS on the shop floor; (2) a robust PLC program; (3) a tool for communication between users and programmers; and (4) ease of redeveloping PLC programs, graphic models, and plant models, on the basis of previous ones.</p>

<p>Although many studies have been conducted on robotic offline programming (OLP), few have focused on control level AS/RS simulation. This article uses a case study to present an efficient method for constructing a PLC validation environment for an AS/RS.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1063293X12474830">Figure 4</xref>, the following four steps are involved in the proposed simulation method: Step 1—<italic>Designing the process to be controlled and simulated</italic>: In most cases, when a new process is designed or an existing one is redeveloped, it is based on legacy information on existing processes and facilities. Step 2—<italic>Abstract level simulation</italic>: To verify or optimize the designed process, abstract level simulation (discrete event simulation) is performed. Based on the results of the simulation, it is possible to roughly sketch the entire system, including what devices will be used, where they will be installed, and how the process will progress. Step 3—<italic>Designing and simulating the mechanical and electrical models</italic>: This includes developing two-dimensional (2D) and 3D models of the manufacturing devices. They should be evaluated by mechanical simulation and checked for motion, kinematic, and assembly errors. Realistic 3D device and product models can be obtained by mechanical simulation and are reliable for preparing fabrication drawings of the devices. The PLC program and plant models can also be obtained from the electrical design. Electrical engineers usually write the PLC program manually by referring to the rough control logic of the abstract level simulator. Since PLC programming is a very tedious and error-prone job, it is essential to verify the PLC program offline to reduce the stabilization time of a production system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12474830">Park et al. (2010)</xref> suggested a method for generating a plant model from the control logic. The plant model is an essential factor in developing a PLC simulation environment because it describes the PLC program with a discrete event model that represents the behavior of a device model. Step 4—<italic>Control level simulation</italic>: As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1063293X12474830">Figure 5</xref>, the proposed control level simulation method involves the use of graphic models developed from the mechanical design, a PLC program, and a plant model developed from the electrical design.</p>

<p>Since the forgoing three inputs are conventionally used by mechanical and electrical designers, it was not difficult to integrate them. Therefore, we only considered creating an integrated environment for the control level simulation (Step 4). Once the environment was developed, it was possible to verify the PLC program intuitively, since the environment was the same as that for test-running the system.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1063293X12474830">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the concept of a PLC simulation environment. The left-hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1063293X12474830">Figure 5</xref> shows the virtual environment and the right side shows the resources (PLC program and PLC hardware) used in a real factory. The virtual environment consisted of the plant or logical models (referred to as the electrical design) and the graphic models (referred to as the mechanical design). This environment was used to simulate the control program. The “3D graphic model rendering tool” shows the corresponding plant models that reflect the changing states of the production system during the PLC simulation. Thus, it is easier for users to verify the PLC program by visualizing the plant model.</p>
<p>The following six components constitute this environment: (1) The logical simulator: It simulates the plant model, which is a discrete event system model. The plant model interacts with the input and output of the PLC program through the OLE for process control (or object linking and embedding for process control) (OPC) and can be made by the user or generated from the electrical design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12474830">Park et al., 2010</xref>). Since the behavior of the plant model should be the same as that of the actual system in order to verify the PLC, the logical simulator uses plant models to simulate the actual logic of the AS/RS. (2) The graphic simulator: The graphic models based on the mechanical design enable the visual verification of a PLC program. It is controlled by the plant models in the logical simulator. Since the models are 3D and all the devices and panels are the same as actual ones, a realistic verification environment is created for the user. (3) OPC: OPC plays the role of a connection between the PLC I/O points and the logical simulator. (4) Human–machine interface (HMI): HMI is a user interface of the local control console, where the system is controlled by means of a PC. (5) SIEMENS PLC: The hardware PLC (or software PLC) made by SIEMENS receives the input signal in the plant, processes it with the PLC program, and sends an output signal. (6) ETHERNET: This is a set of network cabling and access protocol standards for a bus topology that constitutes a pathway between the PLC hardware and the virtual factory. Although the graphic and plant models are obtained as in Step 3, the other components are used as in a traditional PLC program verification process. It is therefore not difficult to apply this method.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the objective of this study is the development of a method for control level simulation for verifying the mechanical and electrical designs of the AS/RS of an automobile plant. To do this, it is necessary to describe the development of the graphic and plant models of an AS/RS, based on the actual process of an automobile plant. The detailed procedures are discussed in the next section.</p>

<title>Model development for control level simulation</title>
<p>Before explaining the control level simulation of an AS/RS, we will consider the specifications of an AS/RS used in an automobile plant. The AS/RS consists of four devices, namely, stacker crane, forklift, pallets, and a robot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1063293X12474830">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Traditionally, an AS/RS rack is composed of a set of columns referred to as bays and a set of rows referred to as tiers. The intersections of the bays and the tiers are referred to as cells. Although all cells in a traditional AS/RS have the same width and height, the cell size of the AS/RS used in the automobile industry is determined by the size of the pallets that contain the vehicle panels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1063293X12474830">Figure 7</xref>, the structure module of an AS/RS consists of a single-deep stored unit load in two parallel long and narrow racks with an aisle between them. The stacker crane installed in the aisle must be able to freely move in and out and stop exactly at a desired cell. A cell address comprises a pair of integers (tier, bay) and the discrete value of the side (inbound side rack = 0; outbound side rack = 1).</p>

<p>The forklift replaces an empty pallet with a full one on the inbound (front) rack when an alarm informs it of the presence of an empty pallet. Similarly, the handling robot selects a panel from the pallet located on the outbound (back) rack and moves it to the shuttle. When the handling robot selects the last panel from a pallet, it sends a signal to the PLC to inform it of the empty pallet’s location. Although these two components are located outside the rack structure, they communicate with the stacker crane through the PLC for the supply or extraction of a panel or pallet.</p>
<p>The stacker crane simultaneously moves in both the horizontal and the vertical directions. It moves horizontally along floor-mounted rails parallel to the storage racks and vertically along a pillar of the rack. The stacker crane has two pairs of bars (Z1–Z2: empty pallet; Z3–Z4: full pallet) for loading an empty pallet and a full pallet, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1063293X12474830">Figure 8</xref>.</p>

<p>For the PLC simulation of the AS/RS, it is necessary to create a communication link between the plant model and the PLC program. The communication link can be defined by the pallet data structure, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063293X12474830">Table 1</xref>. A pallet contains four tags: Vehicle_ Type, Panel_ Type, Pallet_State, and Position_Address. For example, {A1, BACK, Full, (1, 1, 1)} means a pallet located at cell (1, 1, 1) of the rack, containing the back panel of vehicle type A1. Once the plant model of the AS/RS receives the signal with the data structure from the PLC, it operates sequentially according to the procedure to replace an empty pallet with a full one.</p>

<p>There are seven steps to replace an empty pallet located on the outbound rack with a full pallet located on the inbound rack using the stacker crane: (1) The stacker crane picks up an empty pallet at cell “300” on the outbound rack using the “Z1–Z2” bars. (2) It travels along the rail from cell “300” to cell “100.” (3) The stacker crane picks up the full pallet located at cell “100” using the “Z3–Z4” bars. (4) It moves slightly to adjust the center of the “Z1–Z2” bars to cell “100.” (5) It sets down the empty pallet in cell “100.” (6) The stacker crane moves from cell “100” to cell “300.” (7) It places the full pallet in cell “300.” Since this trip requires precision, the crane must know the exact horizontal and vertical coordinates of the cell.</p>
<p>The detailed development of a virtual AS/RS simulation environment will be explained using a simple process, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1063293X12474830">Figure 9</xref>, up to the first of the seven steps enumerated earlier.</p>

<p>To simulate the AS/RS using the PLC program, plant models, and graphic models, it is necessary to set them up and initialize them. The PLC program for starting the AS/RS is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1063293X12474830">Figure 10(a)</xref>, and its symbol table is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1063293X12474830">Figure 10(b)</xref>. From the output symbol (ASRS_MEMO_START) in the PLC program, it can be immediately understood that the AS/RS has been initialized. If the program is being run in a PLC, by satisfying the start condition, the user can control the AS/RS via the HMI. We will illustrate the process of replacing the pallet at cell “300” using the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1063293X12474830">Figure 11</xref>.</p>

<p>In the sample cell, we assume that the panels are extracted manually from the pallet by the handling robot. This is described as a pallet replacing event, which is initiated by the user during the simulation. The detailed procedure for executing the simulation using the PLC program and the plant and graphic models is as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1063293X12474830" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>When the user pushes the “ASRS_PS_ PUSH_300_BACK_EMPTY” button in the HMI, an input signal symbolized as “ASRS_PS_ 300_BACK_EMPTY” is sent to the program.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>After the transmission of the signal in Step 1, an output signal “ASRS_SOL_300_BACK_EMPTY” is sent by the PLC according to the program.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In this case, the plant model of cell “300” has two possible states: the full state and the empty state. The full state is the initial state because the system is initialized by locating the full pallet at cell “300.” To enter this state, the “ASRS_LS_300_ BACK_FULL” signal has to be true, that is, “1.” If the pallet is located at cell “300,” a limit sensor (LS) in the graphic model senses the pallet and issues the “ASRS_LS_300_BACK_FULL” signal. When the state transits from full to empty, the “ASRS_LS_300_BACK_FULL” signal changes to false or “0.”</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>While the output signal “ASRS_SOL_300_ BACK_EMPTY” triggers the task “empty pallet from the cell,” the corresponding graphic model is changed to the empty pallet model. This state transition writes the “AS_LS_300_BACK_EMPTY” true “1” by the sensor of the graphic model.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A memory signal “ASRS_M_300_EMPTY” is issued by the two input signals “AS_LS_300_ BACK_EMPTY” and “AS_LS_300_BACK_ FULL” and will be used in another part of the program to complete the replacement process. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1063293X12474830">Figure 12</xref> shows the remainder of the seven steps mentioned earlier with the graphic models.</p>

<p>With the aid of the proposed control level simulation method, we can efficiently check whether the mechanical and electrical designs can achieve the control objectives before the AS/RS is installed on the shop floor. Furthermore, the graphic models, plant models, and PLC programs are reusable if the AS/RS is modified in a few aspects.</p>
<p>We applied the proposed method to the AS/RS constructed by a Korean automaker. The method was implemented in C++ language, and the test runs were performed on a personal computer, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1063293X12474830">Figure 13</xref>. The PLC program shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1063293X12474830">Figure 10(a)</xref> was written using Step 7 of the PLC program provided by SIEMENS Corporation.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of the case study was the verification of a newly designed PLC program for the AS/RS, which was capable of using existing facilities to process information not only about present car types “A” and “B,” but also about a newly designed car type “C.” By inserting the newly designed car type “C” in the AS/RS, the addresses of the rack cells were significantly changed. Thus, there are three detailed goals of this case study: (1) to determine the reliability of the newly designed PLC program, (2) to achieve on-site stabilization of the production system based on the control level simulation, and (3) to analyze and understand the newly designed PLC program by means of a virtual test run. To achieve these goals, we applied the proposed control level simulation to the AS/RS. The simulation was carried out under the manual operating mode and automatic control mode to verify the new PLC program. We were able to detect more than 50 error codes in the PLC program, which were revised. Most of the errors were logical and sequential errors caused by the newly inserted car type “C.” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1063293X12474830">Figure 14</xref> shows the reduced time and effort required for the stabilization of the system, which was a benefit of the proposed method.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>It is necessary to minimize the stabilization time of a production system in order to reduce the time required to get the products to the market. There is the need to fix various errors caused by mechanical devices that were not properly adjusted, faults in the control program, or operators that are unfamiliar with new procedures. This article proposed a method for the control level simulation of the AS/RS of an automobile plant that can be used to verify the mechanical and electrical designs. By means of the proposed method, it is possible to analyze control level information in the AS/RS in various ways and intuitively recognize hidden errors. Although an AS/RS is a very powerful tool in a manufacturing system, the verification of its mechanical and control designs requires considerable time and effort. As a remedy to this problem, our proposed simulation method affords a realistic test run of the system, which can be used for the offline verification of the designs. This is accomplished by means of graphic models that are the same as those on a shop floor and a PLC program used in a real factory. Since this method can be used to control a huge AS/RS and fix detected errors before actual implementation, it reduces the construction time and effort required to validate the PLC program.</p>
