<abstract>
<p>The aim of this article is to assess the role that Fascist representations of the March on Rome had in determining the overall direction of historical research on Fascism, and thus to understand why the violence practised during the days of the March has been neglected by both contemporaries and historians. The first part of the article examines the ways in which the March was seen by Fascists and anti-Fascists during the interwar years, when the Fascists were still in power. The second part considers historical interpretations of the March since the Second World War, in order to assess continuities and discontinuities within the historiography. The article ends by identifying the common ground shared by apparently discordant interpretations of the same event.</p>

<p>The Italian intellectual and journalist Curzio Malaparte was in Florence in October 1922 when the March on Rome started, and during the events he met Israel Zangwill, a British writer and Zionist activist. They walked around the Tuscan capital together trying to understand what was happening: at the time Malaparte was a member of the Fascist party.</p>
<p>In <italic>Tecnica del colpo di stato</italic>, Malaparte recalled those days in Florence and stated that Zangwill could not quite believe that a revolution had begun. Zangwill thought that the March was ‘a comedy’, suspecting – as did many liberals and democrats in Italy – some negotiation between the King and Mussolini; the March was, for him, simply a ‘mise en scène’ to impose something which had already been decided.</p>
<p>In Malaparte’s words, Zangwill: ‘ … could not understand how a revolution could be made without barricades, without fights, and without bodies in the streets. “Everything is proceeding exactly as planned”, he exclaimed: “it is a comedy, it can only be a comedy”’. Malaparte’s interpretation of Zangwill’s words assumed that the events in question were the result of a political negotiation in which neither violence nor the desire for revolution played any part. For Malaparte, this was due to the distorting lens through which many foreigners looked at contemporary Italy; for such observers it was not a modern country but one in the grip of pre-modern and ancient patterns of conduct: intrigue was more plausible than revolution, negotiation and compromise more acceptable than violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691412448165">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Malaparte’s book was published in 1931, and was followed by many other studies on the origins of Fascism and the March on Rome, the description of the latter as a ‘comedy’ or a ‘mise en scène’ was still widespread in British and Italian historiography in 1973, when Adrian Lyttelton first published <italic>The Seizure of Power: Fascism in Italy 1919–1929</italic>. Referring to Malaparte’s interpretation, Lyttelton contested the thesis that the March on Rome was a bluff, emphasizing rather its importance as an act of ‘psychological warfare’. Moreover, he asserted that ‘the seizure of power by “force” in a modern State is never possible’, emphasized the Fascist takeover of public offices in many of Italy’s towns and villages, and pointed to the concurrent use both of force and of negotiation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691412448165">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lyttelton’s interpretation was thus very different from Christopher Seton-Watson’s earlier account. Seton-Watson had declared that the March on Rome ‘was a victory march, of no political significance, for power had already been won without force’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265691412448165">3</xref></sup> Along the same lines, Denis Mack Smith in his biography of Mussolini, published some years after Lyttelton’s <italic>Seizure of Power</italic>, underlined the importance to Mussolini of creating a myth of the March, ‘to enforce an “ultimatum” he had given to the King’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265691412448165">4</xref></sup> Recently, Donald Sassoon has underlined the fact that ‘Mussolini’s advent to power was – strictly speaking – quite legal’ and that ‘the image of turmoil and radical change was reinforced with the passage of time’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265691412448165">5</xref></sup> Only MacGregor Knox explicitly recognized the importance of the use of violence in the days of the March, in his comparative analysis of the origins of Fascism and Nazism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265691412448165">6</xref></sup> In their interpretations of Italian Fascism, these British historians were quite similar to their Italian counterparts, as we shall see at the end of this article.</p>
<p>There were, and are, good reasons for attempting to deconstruct the image and the myth that the Fascists, and above all Mussolini, tried to create of the March on Rome. There is no doubt that this event would have been impossible without the king’s decision not to sign the decree proclaiming a state of siege, and without the support of sections of the army and the police. Fascist representations of the March on Rome gave space only to Fascist actions, downplaying or expunging completely the negotiations of Italy’s political elite and the importance of the king’s decision for the destiny of both the March and Fascism.</p>
<p>In recent years a new generation of historians has tried to set aside previous narratives of Fascism which had accorded no space to the regime’s rhetoric, image and self-presentation, and thus had shown scant understanding of Fascist culture and its capacity to dictate emotions and to determine participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265691412448165">7</xref></sup> This historiography serves to shed new light on renowned episodes of Fascist history, without distracting attention from the economic, social and political history of the movement and of the regime.</p>
<p>This article is an attempt to assess the role that Fascist representations of the March had in determining the overall direction of historical research, and thus to endeavour to understand why the role of violence and the squadristi during the days of the March has been neglected by contemporaries and historians alike.</p>
<p>Elsewhere I have tried to demonstrate that the use of violence had a large part to play in the success of the March on Rome, and that it does much to account for the impact of the Fascists in both the political and the institutional arenas. It was the violence of the early movement as well as that of the days of the March that created the preconditions for the radical institutional change realized by the Fascists. It was violence that demoralized and divided further both the opposition and the pre-Fascist ruling class, or at least their most active and conscious sections. It was Fascist violence that destroyed the last shreds of legitimacy vested in Italian political institutions and sanctioned the temporary rupture in the State’s monopoly of violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265691412448165">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, I will develop my argument by examining the ways in which the March on Rome was regarded by Fascists and anti-Fascists during the interwar years when the Fascists were in power. I will then go on to consider interpretations advanced by historians since the Second World War years, in order to assess the continuities and discontinuities in analyses of the March. In conclusion, I will reflect upon the common ground shared by apparently discordant interpretations.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0265691412448165"><title>Fascist Interpretations</title>
<p>After October 1922, the March on Rome became a fundamental event in the rhetoric and political construction of the Fascist regime. From this moment onwards, Fascist propaganda repeatedly recalled this event, and celebrated it as a revolutionary turning point. This idea of a turning point was emphasized despite the fact that there were differing interpretations of the March on Rome, even among Fascists.</p>
<p>Although few films were produced at this time, a documentary about the March, <italic>A noi,</italic> was released in Italy as early as November 1922.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265691412448165">9</xref></sup> Despite its limited distribution – which was surprising given the obvious importance of the theme for the new regime – the very existence of such a film demonstrates the significance attached to the March, as well as to propaganda more generally at the very beginning of the Fascist regime. <italic>A noi</italic>, its title taken from one of the rallying cries of the squadristi, disappeared almost immediately from cinemas – probably, as the historian Mario Isnenghi has observed, on account of the fact that the images it showed were not sufficiently codified, and its portrayal of the Duce made Mussolini appear less central to the events than he would have wished.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0265691412448165">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In fact, from his seizure of power onwards Mussolini carefully controlled all records – memoirs, diaries, histories – of the March on Rome, aware that this event was an important propaganda tool but mindful also that it could prove to be a dangerous idea if used by his adversaries, who might imagine organizing something similar, or by the die-hard squadristi, dissatisfied with the outcome of their ‘revolution’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0265691412448165">11</xref></sup> Mussolini’s speeches and articles clearly demonstrate that even in the Duce’s rhetoric the conception of the March on Rome changed over time. Although the revolutionary meaning of the event was often stressed, different nuances were in evidence, depending on the precise political aims Mussolini sought to promote. Indeed as Mussolini moved through different political phases the images that he sought to convey of this event evolved according to shifting requirements and to the audiences he was addressing.</p>
<p>In the famous ‘discorso del bivacco’ (the Bivouac Speech), the first speech delivered by him in parliament as Prime Minister (prior to winning a vote of confidence for his government), Mussolini intimidated the Chamber of the Deputies, boasting that the blackshirts would have had the power to shut down parliament and physically defeat all opponents of Fascism, but that he had not wanted to do this, or at least not at first because he had wished to ‘defend and give the greatest value to the revolution of the “black shirts”’. He depicted a non-violent March during which, although the possibility for violence had been real enough, the squadristi had, for the sake of the nation, shown commendable restraint.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0265691412448165">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Only a year and a half later, when addressing the <italic>Milizia</italic>, Mussolini referred to this same event in quite different terms:<disp-quote>
<p>Then we marched on Rome and it was not without casualties. The revolution was not bloodless, as some now say. Even then we had our dead, our wounded, and everybody knew that once the die was cast, we would have risked everything.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0265691412448165">13</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Here, as we can see, reference was made only to the violence suffered by the Fascists and none to that inflicted on others.</p>
<p>In June 1924, during the crisis provoked by the murder of the socialist MP Giacomo Matteotti, Mussolini emphasized instead all he had done since coming to power to restore public order in the country. In this speech, in front of the Senate, the Fascist leader said that every revolution needed to stop illegality at some point, and affirmed that this process was under way. He presented himself once again as the only person able to restore public order in the country and claimed that he was not totally responsible for the actions of the <italic>squadristi</italic>, a perspective which was obviously quite different from that taken in his address to the <italic>Milizia</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0265691412448165">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over the following years, Mussolini would alternately choose to emphasize one or other aspect of the March on Rome. In May 1926, in a speech given in Genoa, he underlined the link between the soldiers in the First World War and the blackshirts. On the anniversary of the March, some months later, he emphasized the durability of the regime – contrasting this with the comments made by observers at the time – and also affirmed that ‘the pure, unique and enduring revolution’ had occurred in 1925, when ‘the old liberal democratic state’ had been ‘buried’. This was tantamount to devaluing the importance of the March itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0265691412448165">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In subsequent years, the rhetoric of the ‘second march’ as well as the possibility of ‘completing the revolution’ continued, and was ratcheted up in times of crisis, particularly in 1943–45, under the <italic>Repubblica sociale italiana</italic>. In this phase such language was used in order to retain the support of the more extreme Fascists, the ‘old guard’, as well as of the youth who had grown up with the myth of squadrismo. In any case, and notwithstanding these variations, the prevailing official discourse on the March portrayed it as a peaceful revolution. No space was given to the negotiations that had made the event possible, and little reference was made to the role of the king. The <italic>Enciclopedia Treccani</italic>, published between 1929 and 1937, and one of the most important written monuments of the Fascist regime, described the March, under the heading ‘Revolution’, as an ‘essential renewal in ideas and principles’: the analysis did not discuss methods and violence, nor was there any chronicle of the factors that had brought Mussolini to power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0265691412448165">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The myth-histories produced by <italic>squadristi</italic> who had been in Rome or had taken part in the March were quite different.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0265691412448165">17</xref></sup> For them, the memory of the acts of violence was a fundamental part of the March and of their actions in the early days of Fascism. Diaries recounting the March written by die-hard blackshirts were not accorded much recognition by the regime and were closely scrutinized before publication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0265691412448165">18</xref></sup> The wider public’s image of the March on Rome continued to be the myth that Mussolini and the other Fascist leaders tried to impose.</p>
<p>In 1929 former <italic>squadrista</italic> Giorgio Alberto Chiurco, a doctor and Federal Secretary of Siena’s party section (November 1928–April 1929), published his important five-volume <italic>Storia della rivoluzione fascista</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0265691412448165">19</xref></sup> This work was a paean of praise to the squads and their activities in the period 1919–1922, and a chronicle of the acts perpetrated by Fascists and <italic>squadristi</italic> during the first years of the Fascist movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0265691412448165">20</xref></sup> The last volume was devoted to descriptions of the March on Rome. Violent episodes during the days of the March were described, not always in an accurate manner, but the picture that came across was quite different from that proposed by the rhetoric of the regime. Chiurco’s richly documented books emphasized the role of the blackshirts, which was not always the case in the official celebrations of the March and the origins of Fascism. In order to bring out the heroism of the <italic>squadristi</italic>, the narrative gave pride of place to their unbridled violence.</p>
<p>Chiurco provided his readers with facts and episodes that had previously been little considered and even less advertised by the regime, for instance: the statement that the violent clashes all over Italy had led to the deaths of some 40 people (the numbers of injuries, acts of violence and deaths given by Chiurco were not always exact); police and army reactions to Fascist actions; the almost complete absence of any response from the opposition; and the mandatory dismissal, under threat of violence, of many local administrations run by opposition parties. In the years following the March a normalizing attitude had obscured most of the violence the <italic>squadristi</italic> had used in those days, while at the same time the attempt was made to foster a mythical image of this event. Chiurco had also played down Mussolini’s part in the March, whereas, as the leader of Fascism, he had depicted himself (and had been depicted by others) as having been at the heart of this epochal event.</p>
<p>It is important to bear in mind that this wealth of documentation made the <italic>Storia della rivoluzione fascista</italic> one of the key sources – probably the only one available and surely one of the best in terms of quantity and quality of information apart from contemporary newspapers – for anti-Fascist historians and politicians studying the origins of Fascism in Italy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0265691412448165">21</xref></sup> This was due not only to the lack of other sources, but also because of the amount of information the book provided. Besides, for anybody reading between the lines, it was clear from Chiurco’s account that the organization of the March was poor and that it would not have succeeded if the army had opposed it. It was likewise clear that the blackshirts had an ambiguous role in the mythology of the regime.</p>
<p>The presence of Chiurco’s book in private and public libraries throughout the country shows the importance it had for the regime. The <italic>Storia della rivoluzione fascista</italic> was, in effect, a paper monument to the blackshirts, even if it was only partly consistent with the most widespread and official image of the March. Was this because Chiurco’s history accorded some recognition to the <italic>squadristi</italic> while at the same time the five volumes represented more of a monument than a book that many would have read? Did its real message therefore elude many of its readers?</p>
<p>Only three years after the publication of Chiurco’s <italic>Storia</italic>, another, quite different, and far better known monument to Fascism was created, namely the <italic>Mostra della Rivoluzione fascista.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0265691412448165">22</xref></sup> This exhibition, as Marla Stone has argued, not only represented a celebration of the history of the seizure of power, but served also as an instrument for the legitimation of the regime after its first decade. Here, it was the March on Rome, and not the wider story of Fascism’s origins, which proved to be the ideal event for the constitution of a ‘mass-based myth’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0265691412448165">23</xref></sup> The representation of the March managed to blend a sense of revolution and salvation – portraying the Fascist movement as the saviour of the endangered country – without any mention of Fascist subversion of liberal legality. In the exhibition, symbolic aspects were more important than the historical reconstruction of events, so that, despite the unabashed rhetoric of violence, there was little reference to the brutal acts perpetrated by the <italic>squadristi</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>Mostra della Rivoluzione fascista</italic> remained open for two years and was an enormous success, visited by hundreds of thousands of people. The regime encouraged visits through propaganda, discounts for collective travel, and so on, as a way of celebrating its tenth anniversary.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that the <italic>Mostra</italic> itself remains one of the most important documentary archives for the history and representation of Fascist origins and the March on Rome, as well as of the subsequent period, as the organizers collected materials and documents from all over the country between January and September 1932, assisted by local Fascist Party offices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0265691412448165"><title>Anti-Fascist Interpretations</title>
<p>Between 1922 and 1945 writing the history of the origins of Fascism and the regime was part of a cultural and political battle that Fascists and anti-Fascists fought in order to rally support for their opposing causes. Anti-Fascist writings, however, had free circulation only in foreign countries, as a strict system of censorship had been imposed in Italy. These writings, together with the public conferences they managed to organize, were the forms through which anti-Fascist intellectuals hoped to discredit some of the untruths disseminated by the regime and to challenge the regime’s official history of its origins. Although only some of them focused their attention on the March on Rome, this event was accorded more weight than in later post-Fascist historiography.</p>
<p>Anti-Fascists aimed to show that, contrary to Fascist discourse, the squads did not win control of the state by marching on Rome; these intellectuals emphasized that, had the king approved the Facta government’s proposed decree declaring a state of siege, the army could have used force to defeat the squads.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0265691412448165">24</xref></sup> This line of argument was reinforced by scrutinizing the level of violence used by Fascists and State complicity in favour of the <italic>squadristi</italic> before the March, but also the numbers of blackshirts and soldiers that would have been involved in a potential clash between the two forces. This added weight to, or in some cases laid the ground for, a strong anti-monarchist feeling. Furthermore, anti-Fascist intellectuals sought to demonstrate that the March had not really gone according to plan, and that the numbers involved increased dramatically following the king’s refusal to ratify the government’s decree.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0265691412448165">25</xref></sup> They also emphasized the peculiar role of Mussolini as leader of the Fascists during the March, demonstrating that this had been a political role, and that he had not fought alongside his men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0265691412448165">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nonetheless, not every anti-Fascist study gave equal prominence to the March on Rome and I want to focus on some of the books that – in post-Fascist Italy, but also among Italian exiles in interwar Europe – paid particular attention to this event. I will concentrate on three texts, namely: <italic>La dittatura fascista in Italia</italic> (<italic>The Fascist Dictatorship in Italy</italic>) by Gaetano Salvemini, published for the first time in English in 1928; <italic>Marcia su Roma e dintorni</italic> (<italic>The March on Rome and Thereabouts</italic>) by Emilio Lussu, written in 1931, published in various languages and appearing for the first time in Italian outside Italy in 1933, and <italic>Nascita e avvento del fascismo</italic> (<italic>The Rise of Italian Fascism 1918–1922</italic>) by Angelo Tasca, published in London and Paris, under the name of Angelo Rossi, in 1938.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0265691412448165">27</xref></sup> All three authors were exiled for political reasons while writing and publishing their histories, and the books also reflect their diverse personal and political contexts.</p>
<p>Salvemini was a professor of medieval and modern history when he moved to England. He had been a political activist since his youth, a member of the Socialist Party until 1911, and thereafter an activist for the democratic cause. He had been in favour of Italy’s intervention in the First World War alongside the democratic powers and had been elected an MP in 1919.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0265691412448165">28</xref></sup> Salvemini’s politics inspired him to make a close analysis of Fascism from the beginning of the movement, as his diary covering those years demonstrates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0265691412448165">29</xref></sup> In exile he devoted much of his time to scrutinizing Fascism, in part as a means of carrying on a political battle against the regime from abroad.</p>
<p>His 1928 book on Fascism was one of the first anti-Fascist historical analyses to appear since the establishment of the dictatorship. It was published in the same year as <italic>L’aventure italienne: légendes et réalités</italic> written by Silvio Trentin, who had been a jurist and professor of law before he went into exile.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0265691412448165">30</xref></sup> A significant part of Salvemini’s <italic>Fascist Dictatorship</italic> was devoted to the origins of Fascism, a section of which dealt with the March on Rome. In this text Salvemini replied to some of the assertions in the book by Sir Percival Phillips, a journalist with the <italic>Daily Mail</italic>, in order to elucidate the manner in which ‘the legend’ of this event had been fabricated. Phillips in fact subscribed to the Fascist myth of the March on Rome, describing it as a huge and victorious revolution. In riposte, Salvemini demonstrated that the Fascists had been aware of the army’s neutrality, and his tally of participants in the March, and of their weapons, fell far short of the numbers supplied by the English journalist. Salvemini also drew attention to the king’s refusal to sign the decree proclaiming martial law. Furthermore, he showed the importance of Fascist anti-parliamentary action in contrast to Phillips’s representation of a March ‘against Bolshevism’. Salvemini ended his analysis by saying, ‘There was no revolution, as has been claimed, but a <italic>coup d’état</italic>, staged as a spontaneous rising of “Black Shirts”, but in reality carried out by a military “Black Hand”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0265691412448165">31</xref></sup> If we still lack substantial documentation on the role of the army, and of some generals in particular – such as might serve to reinforce or undermine Salvemini’s thesis – all his other statements have since been confirmed.</p>
<p>Irony was one of the most effective tools employed by Emilio Lussu to describe the total failure of liberal Italy in the face of Fascism. Lussu was a lawyer, an interventionist and a combatant in the First World War, founder of the Partito Sardo d’Azione (a regionalist and democratic party based in Sardinia), a republican and an anti-Fascist. He stayed in Italy until, after being confined on the island of Lipari for political reasons, he managed in 1929 to escape together with Carlo Rosselli and Francesco Fausto Nitti. His book <italic>The March on Rome and Thereabouts</italic>, based on his personal memories, is particularly interesting for the account it gives of the Fascist conquest of power in Sardinia, though some pages are specifically devoted to the March on Rome. In these pages, Lussu pointed out the incompetent organization of the March and the inability of Facta’s government to address the situation, as well as the king’s responsibility in deciding not to sign the decree. In particular he depicted the king’s ambiguity towards both the liberal state and the Fascists. Furthermore, Lussu was witheringly ironical about Mussolini’s stance at the time, commenting upon his choice to go straight from Naples, where the Fascist Congress had just voted to march on Rome, to Milan:<disp-quote>
<p>Milan is at the other end of the line, 600 kilometres from Rome. Had Mussolini stayed in Naples he would have been nearer to the originally prescribed combat zone … But there is the offsetting factor that Milan is conveniently a short distance from the Swiss frontier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0265691412448165">32</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Mussolini’s stance at this time demonstrated that the outcome was not obvious from the outset, and reflects not only the ambiguities and opportunism of the national elite (both Fascist and non-Fascist), but also the radicalism of Mussolini’s supporters. Lussu’s book did not, however, enquire into the reasons for this radicalism, though they too are an important part of the story. On the contrary, his narrative stressed the blackshirts’ belief that they were not taking much of a risk, and this lent credence to the interpretation, widely diffused abroad, that the seizure of power had been the result of a political negotiation with the king. By focusing on the rapid alignment of the state and its ruling class with Fascism, and on the importance of Italian political transformism, violence and the use of force were left in the shadows and forgotten by Lussu.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Rise of Italian Fascism</italic>, Tasca describes and documents the development of the Fascist conquest of Italy in the four years between the birth of the political movement and its March on Rome. Here, one finds a precise reconstruction of all the major moments of violence, and a strong critical interpretation: recognition of a national strategy of violence (at least from the end of 1920), as well as an analysis of the balance of local forces underlying the success of the Fascist movement. The detailed picture that emerged took Tasca several years of research, as he studied the main newspapers of the period and all the available Fascist and anti-Fascist memoirs and histories, as well as Chiurco’s book. It was an arduous task, as can be seen from even a cursory look at Tasca’s archive, now stored in the Fondazione Feltrinelli.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0265691412448165">33</xref></sup> Nonetheless, when Tasca analysed the March on Rome he denied the significance of the violent action that had taken place and claimed that almost no violence had occurred after the lifting of the state of siege.</p>
<p>The fact that Tasca did not consider Fascist violence in the hours and days after the lifting of the state of siege contrasts with his emphasis on the violent nature of Fascism before the March on Rome. His presentation of the March, like that of many anti-Fascist historians, was clearly designed to dismantle the mythical image created by the Fascists, whereby the March had been a revolution owing its success to the energy and vigour of the <italic>squadristi</italic>. This presentation nonetheless also enabled Tasca to advance a critical analysis of the action of left-wing parties in Italy during that period, of their incapacity to react and of their ultimate defeat. Tasca had been a political activist all his life and was among the founders of the <italic>Partito comunista italiano</italic> (PCI, the Italian Communist Party); and he left Italy for France in 1926. In the years between his exile and the publication of <italic>The Rise of Italian Fascism</italic>, Tasca had moved politically from expulsion from the Communist Party, to collaboration with the Italian Socialist Party in exile, to alignment with the Unity Pact between socialists and communists to fight Fascism. It is in the context of a wider intellectual and political phase of the crisis, and of Tasca’s desire to affirm and demonstrate the rootedness of his reflections and ideals, that <italic>The Rise of Italian Fascism</italic> should be read. It was not only a book – the most complete one – on the origins of Fascism but also, as the historian Alexander De Grand puts it, ‘a critique of socialist revolutionary heritage’. As such, it represented a critique of the Italian Marxist tradition influenced by the French left-wing revisionism of the time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0265691412448165">34</xref></sup> In this sense, the value of the book was not limited to Italy, as could plausibly be said of the other two books under consideration, since it contained reflections on the international victory of Fascism.</p>
<p>For Salvemini, Lussu and Tasca – and the other anti-Fascist intellectuals writing, during the regime, on the origins of Fascism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0265691412448165">35</xref></sup> – it was important to counteract the Fascists’ image of the March by explicitly emphasizing the chaotic nature of the event, the fact that the <italic>squadristi</italic> would have lost the battle if the army had responded, and the presence of a much smaller number of Fascists in Rome than had been previously revealed in the official propaganda. Moreover, the principal concern of these anti-Fascist historians and journalists was to expose those who had supported the March, thereby making its success possible, and to identify the failures in the opposition’s strategy. This was useful for identifying political alliances for the present and future, and for reflecting upon a post-Fascist future for Italy. In that context, an emphasis on the importance of the March on Rome and the role played by violence in it would have probably served to sustain the Fascist interpretation of the event.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0265691412448165"><title>II. Post-war</title>
<p>One of the first acts of the Allies upon their arrival in Italy was to establish, in a formal institutional sense, discontinuity with the previous political regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0265691412448165">36</xref></sup> Yet the years following the liberation of Italy led not only to the diffusion of pamphlets and analyses of Italy’s recent history that had previously circulated only clandestinely or abroad, but also to the publication of a considerable number of Fascist memoirs of the period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0265691412448165">37</xref></sup> It is more than a little disconcerting to discover that many of these memoirs, though written by Fascists or by individuals who had played an ambiguous role under the regime, were published by some of the most important newspapers, periodicals and publishers of the post-war period. Despite the huge readership these pamphlets enjoyed, they were not considered to be a crucial source in historical research, nor did they lead to a major shift in the historical representations surveyed above.</p>
<p>Apart from this kind of literature, the first Italian studies of the origins of Fascism to appear after the Liberation were mostly books and articles that had been published abroad during the interwar period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0265691412448165">38</xref></sup> Beginning in the 1950s, and accelerating from the 1960s onwards, the origins of Fascism became a scholarly topic. This early research was mostly devoted to analyses of the roles and responsibilities of political leaders during the rise of Fascism, and it emphasized the same points rehearsed by anti-Fascists during the Fascist era.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0265691412448165">39</xref></sup> There was still a political need to give Italians a different image of history from that purveyed by Fascist propaganda. The actions of the king were closely scrutinized, and his role was no longer considered marginal in Mussolini’s rise to official political power. Moreover, the difficulties – and at times also the shortcomings – of the Italian ruling class were examined in order both to understand the past and to warn against the possible future errors of democratic leaders. But it was also part of the methodology and style of Italian historiography at the time to focus on political and biographical research when reflecting on political history. The authors of these books, as with those published in the interwar period, were not always professional historians but more often politicians, lawyers or journalists.</p>
<p>Thanks to this research, the roles of Giovanni Giolitti, Francesco Saverio Nitti, Luigi Facta, Antonio Salandra, Benito Mussolini, Filippo Turati, Luigi Sturzo, and many other leading politicians in post-First World War Italy, as well as that of the king, were closely analysed. Furthermore, through the research of Alatri, Vené, Répaci and De Felice we are as well informed as we can hope to be regarding the stance of the Italian political ruling class in the days of the March on Rome; the role of Mussolini, his contacts with his men and with the government and the king; the part played by each of the ministers; and the contact between the government and the king. De Felice, in particular, wrote at great length on the organization of the March, its funding, the attitude of the freemasonry movement, the difficult relationships among the quadrumviri, and the reactions of the Italian ruling class and the army.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0265691412448165">40</xref></sup> He based all this on memoirs, historical monographs published during and after Fascism, and archival investigation.</p>
<p>From the end of the 1960s, in particular, important research began to be produced about the provincial origins of Fascism, research that in some cases helped to detail the role of the March in different towns, districts and regions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0265691412448165">41</xref></sup> At the same time, legal historians, and those scholars concerned with constitutional law especially, have in many cases concluded that there was no formal break in legitimacy in 1922. The most radical have thus claimed that the constitution – the <italic>Statuto albertino</italic> – had always been the fundamental law of the state, and that since Fascism had never revoked it, no formal break had occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0265691412448165">42</xref></sup> Alberto Aquarone, who believed that the crucial break in Italian political institutions had begun in 1925, nonetheless affirmed that the earlier flouting of the constitutional rules anticipated it. He also reckoned that the origins of the Fascist dictatorship lay in the legalization of the Fascist militia under Mussolini’s direct rule, and in the new electoral law imposed by the Fascists, an interpretation proposed many years earlier by the jurist Trentin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0265691412448165">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>In all these studies, the March on Rome was still regarded as a symbol, a moment of institutional crisis and negotiation between political leaders which brought Mussolini to power. No one thought to discover just how the regime had viewed it, nor was the role of the squads or the meanings and forms of their political rites analysed. Furthermore, the image of the March on Rome in public memory promoted by Dino Risi’s film <italic>Marcia su Roma</italic>, which came out in 1962, did not help matters. In Risi’s film, participation in the March by the two main characters is almost accidental, a viewpoint as misleading as the idealization of the event and its martyrs created by the regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0265691412448165">44</xref></sup> Risi drew cinema audiences’ attention to the rhetoric of the regime, something that Italians could still remember, but failed to explain the strength or longevity of the Fascist regime.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Adrian Lyttelton stated that the March could not be considered as merely a bluff, since this ‘trick’ had achieved all too real results. Consequently, he affirmed, it should be considered as an example of psychological warfare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0265691412448165">45</xref></sup> It is interesting to reflect that this first important shift in the interpretation of the March did not come from an Italian historian: perhaps the burden of the prevailing historical representation weighed less heavily upon Lyttelton. More importantly, his re-reading of the March was part of a programme of research that not only took into account the crisis of the liberal state but also, and more fundamentally, the consolidation of the regime during the 1920s. Looking at the March by examining its effects upon, and consequences for, the regime was certainly a fundamental shift in the consideration of this event, its meaning and its relevance.</p>
<p>The analyses of the origins of Fascism dating from the late 1980s and the 1990s did not supply answers to all of the still unresolved historiographical issues. For example, we still do not know why, before the king decided not to sign the decree for the state of siege and Mussolini took power, thousands of men were prepared to risk injury or death in the March on Rome, or why they believed they were not running any such risk.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the development of research into the origins of Fascism all over Italy, and regarding the <italic>squadristi</italic>, has greatly contributed to a more complex understanding of the period, and of the social, political and generational groups involved in Fascism. However, in the most important histories of the origins of Fascism, the March on Rome was not central to the analysis either of the crisis of the state or of the building of the regime. This was in part because two of the major works on the origins of Fascism did not take the March fully into account. Roberto Vivarelli has in fact not yet completed his analysis of the period, while Emilio Gentile – the scholar who, among many other things, opened up a new field in the studies of the origins of Fascism by looking at the importance of violence and the rituals of the blackshirts – devoted very little attention to the March and to <italic>squadrismo</italic> during the March, compared with that devoted to <italic>squadrismo</italic> in the previous period; again because his initial volume on the history of the Fascist party has had no sequel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0265691412448165">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Subsequently, in the 1990s, Mario Isnenghi set out to redefine the image of the March by setting aside the stereotypical representation of the event in order to describe it, somewhat provocatively, as one of the most fundamental moments in Italy’s history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0265691412448165">47</xref></sup> Isnenghi’s article on the March featured in a series of volumes on the <italic>lieux de mémoire</italic> of Italian history, in which he analysed the most meaningful sites of memory in terms of representations. The essay on the March shed light on the manner in which different representations combined to build up not just an image of the event, but also an interpretation of what being Italian meant.</p>
<p>It is only during the last ten years that, as closer attention has been paid to the role of violence, our image of the March has shifted more radically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0265691412448165">48</xref></sup> No longer can we consider Fascist violence to be a simple reaction to socialist violence, nor an epiphenomenon in Fascist history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0265691412448165">49</xref></sup> Furthermore, this recent research has made it possible for reflections on the March on Rome to consider the role of the blackshirts and their violence as a crucial moment in the construction of the Fascist regime and the history of Italy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0265691412448165" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is not difficult to see that, alongside the various attempts to construct political and historiographical discontinuities, the continuities between the liberal state and the post-Fascist democratic republic – and the continuities between the Fascist and the republican states – have played an important role in the historiography of the March. Many surviving socialists and communists, and their political heirs, may well have regretted their failure to grasp the importance of the March at the beginning of Fascism, confident as they were that the moment would pass like many others before it, or that Fascist rule would not differ greatly from liberal government. Liberals, Catholics and democrats may well have regretted their failure to understand events, having at times colluded with Fascism and helped it to remain in power. All this influenced deeply – though at different levels – the way in which historians from heterogeneous anti-Fascist backgrounds viewed the March on Rome. What is astonishing is that a stringently self-critical analysis of policies enacted when Fascism was a nascent movement did not form part of the public agenda of political forces during the postwar period, absorbed as all their political energies were by the task of rebuilding Italy; and even the violence and the crimes committed by Italians and by Fascists during the Second World War and the Republic of Salò were rapidly forgotten or, at most, interpreted as a parenthesis in Italian history.</p>
<p>Some of the actors in the political arena bore too great a responsibility for the March on Rome glorified by the Fascists for their roles to be analysed in detail. It was better to avoid thinking about the strange years of Mussolini’s coalition government, during which the future first President of the Republic and monarchist, Enrico de Nicola, was the president of the Chamber of Deputies. Apart from Matteotti’s murder, only the electoral law was judged worthy of attention. The way in which society changed as a consequence of Fascism’s rise to power and the March on Rome was a subject that historians seemed even less willing to consider.</p>
<p>Consideration of the violence and the role of Fascist action during the March on Rome reveals not only the responsibilities and complicities of the liberal ruling class in the victory of Fascism, but also the mechanisms that brought Fascism to power and the tolerance (and appreciation) that part of the Italian population showed for Fascism, its use of violence, and its disregard of liberal parliamentarianism. Furthermore, it permits an evaluation of the effectiveness of violence in provoking fear and humiliation in the adversaries of Fascism, thus shaping their individual political decisions. Finally, it allows us to observe and evaluate the March on Rome – an event which influenced European conservative and right-wing parties alike during the years that followed and which would provide a template for, among other things, Hitler’s conquest of power – with the attention it deserves.</p>
