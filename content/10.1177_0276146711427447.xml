<p>Land policy is crucial to Vietnam’s socioeconomic development. Yet, land policy in Vietnam often is short-sighted, resulting in inequities and a form of commons tragedy. In this essay, the author reviews the evolving land policy in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, pointing out inconsistencies and shortcomings. The essay concludes with recommendations to improve policy and the long-term well-being of Vietnam and its people; specifically, several events should occur for Vietnam to achieve middle-income status by 2020, as the government of Vietnam intends. Rapid industrialization and modernization should continue; land currently used for agriculture (particularly rice) need to be converted to industrial parks; residential areas, and infrastructure; and all land should be used in ways that yields the highest social returns. Public investment should help boost agricultural (and land) productivity; and environmental (and land) management should ensure that the institutions and incentives support environmental sustainability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The challenge for land policy and land management in Vietnam is to ensure that the nation’s limited land base is used efficiently and equitably to promote socioeconomic development. Since the constitution requires the state to manage all land, this should not be a difficult task. Nonetheless, the evidence—more than 600 laws, decrees, and directives related to land since the mid-1980s, dissatisfied citizens who regularly petition the National Assembly to resolve land issues, and large tracts of land recalled for urban, industrial, and commercial development that remain unused or underutilized for extended periods—indicates that the state, through its various government agencies, is struggling to fulfill its constitutional responsibility.</p>
<p>The experiences of other centrally planned economies, which have adopted market-based reforms, suggest that these outcomes are not unusual. In addition to the problems of overcoming ideologically entrenched objections to freeing up access to land and convincing risk-averse officials to reduce their reliance on controls over land use, there are other difficulties in promoting a “socialist-oriented market economy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146711427447">Socialist Republic of Vietnam 1992</xref>, chap. II, Article 15.2). Questions such as how much market; how much socialism; and which trumps which (when and under what conditions) are never easy to answer in advance. Moreover, economic and social reforms invariably proceed in ways that are hard to anticipate. Indeed, the large number of laws and decrees, land disputes, misuse of land, and intensifying environmental damage indicate that the formulation and implementation of land policy in Vietnam have primarily involved “muddling through.”</p>
<p>This approach is likely to continue with the prospect that many issues in land policy and land management will remain unresolved for the foreseeable future. As evident in the examples discussed below—food security, public investment in agriculture, and environmental management—current land policies in Vietnam significantly distort the allocation of land and the efficiency with which it is used. These distortions result from too much central control over the use of agricultural land (rice land in particular), too little public investment in support of agriculture (especially to promote agricultural research and expand rural infrastructure), and a pattern of environmental management which is too fragmented. Constructive changes in these areas would raise rural welfare (especially of farmers and their dependents), boost economic growth, and substantially enhance socioeconomic development.</p>
<p>The essay is organized as follows. The next section briefly describes how land policy and land management contribute to socioeconomic development in Vietnam. Subsequent sections discuss the land-related issues involved in promoting food security, raising the level of public investment in agriculture, and strengthening environmental management. Then the essay examines who gains and who loses from current approaches to land policy and land management. Suggestions are offered for constructive change that would contribute to socioeconomic development and conclusions are shared.</p>

<sec id="section2-0276146711427447">
<title>Background</title>
<p>To understand land policy and land management in Vietnam, it is useful to begin with the constitution. Chapter II, Article 17 asserts that land is subject to “ownership by the entire people” while Chapter II, Article 18 affirms that the “State manages all the land…” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146711427447">Socialist Republic of Vietnam 1992</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0276146711427447">1</xref>
</sup> These provisions reflect a legacy of ideological and other struggles, which have shaped public attitudes about access to, control over, and use of land. In practice, collective ownership is a benign requirement. At some level, all states exercise ultimate sovereignty over land. The main difficulties relate to state management of land. In this area, the constitution offers no guidance on which state agencies are responsible, how land management should be accomplished, or how (and by whom) inconsistent goals across agencies should be rationalized or resolved.</p>
<p>Specific aspects of the state’s management of land have been counterproductive. The collectivization of agricultural land (from the mid-1950s in the North and from the mid-1970s in the South) kept the country poor, the rural areas underdeveloped, progressively starved a large share of the population, and seriously degraded the environment, especially in the hills and highlands.</p>
<p>Economic stagnation and environmental deterioration prompted the government to modify its policies. The most far-reaching change was the adoption of <italic>Doi Moi</italic>, which included passage of the Law on Land 1988. This Law formally dismantled agricultural collectives. Farmers responded vigorously and agricultural output rose sharply. Food and fiber exports increased and national food security improved. The expanding agricultural surplus boosted the resources available for industrialization and urbanization. These trends gained impetus in the late 1990s through a series of enterprise laws which opened the economy to local and foreign investment.</p>
<p>With these and other changes, Vietnam is becoming a middle-income country. Achieving this goal by 2020 is the centerpiece of the government’s development strategy. That strategy focuses on six elements: the promotion of rapid economic growth, poverty reduction, food security, international competitiveness, social harmony, and environmental sustainability. Land policy and land management are critical to all of them.</p>
<p>Rapid economic growth has been sustained by the regular conversion of land from relatively low productivity rural/agricultural uses to higher productivity urban/industrial/commercial activities. Poverty, particularly rural poverty, fell sharply when collectivized agriculture was abandoned and agricultural output and rural incomes rose, and labor moved out of agriculture. Food security has been reinforced by rising agricultural output and rural incomes, and the progressive expansion of rural infrastructure and social services. <italic>Doi Moi</italic> has enhanced the economy’s international competitiveness resulting in major increases in the volume and variety of land and water-based exports. In the process, Vietnam has become a leading exporter of rice, coffee, tropical fruits, rubber, and seafood.</p>
<p>The impact of land policy on social harmony is difficult to judge. The upside is that rapid economic growth and employment creation have enabled many of those displaced through the recall of agricultural land (especially the young and better educated) to be absorbed into the expanding urban/industrial sectors. The downside is that large numbers of the roughly four million people whose livelihoods have been disrupted over the last two decades by land conversion (particularly older and less well-educated workers) have been economically marginalized.</p>
<p>Environmental sustainability and land management are closely connected. Maintaining watersheds or coastal protection zones (mangroves, wetlands), creating national reserves, or rehabilitating denuded uplands all require the transformation (or preservation) of large areas of land. With the land base of Vietnam so limited, trade-offs always arise. Difficulties emerge when different state agencies seek to use the same area as a watershed, a resettlement area, for logging, an industrial park, an irrigation reservoir, or to expand the road and rail network. In principle, these matters are meant to be resolved through land use planning and zoning. In practice, the trade-offs reflect political accommodation rather than environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Meeting the objectives above poses several challenges. One is to rationalize the role of central control over land allocation and use. Another is to ensure that public investments are made in ways that boost the productivity of land. A third is promoting land use that is environmentally sustainable. Success depends largely on how the state “manages all the land.” Even under the best of conditions, some inconsistencies and confusion will be evident. Yet, in Vietnam, the difficulties have been (and continue to be) compounded by the lack of explicit guidance over who (specifically which state agency) has to do what, when, where, with whom, for whom, how, and over what period to allocate and use land efficiently, equitably, and sustainably.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0276146711427447">2</xref>
</sup> By default, this question is answered on a case-by-case basis through political, bureaucratic, and administrative processes. This is especially unfortunate for Vietnam’s least influential (and most dispersed) group, namely, farmers and rural land use certificate holders. They have little political power and are critically underrepresented within the bureaucracy. Accordingly, it is no surprise that they also remain subject to the most rigid central controls and, in the process, bear the bulk of the costs when land is transformed from agricultural to other uses.</p>

<title>Land Policy and Food Security<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0276146711427447">3</xref>
</sup>
</title>
<p>In Vietnam, food security is directly linked to land policy. The government interprets national food security to mean rice self-sufficiency,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0276146711427447">4</xref>
</sup> a goal which is achieved through explicit controls over rice land.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0276146711427447">5</xref>
</sup> The goal of producing enough rice to guarantee food security has been widely stated and regularly repeated. For example, in 2007, the Party’s Central Committee expressed its determination to maintain “… rice land to firmly and sustainably ensure food security for the nation.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0276146711427447">6</xref>
</sup> And, in August 2009, the Party Politburo approved a plan to keep land permanently under rice. Overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the aim is “… output of 39 to 41 million tons of rice a year to secure food security for the country’s projected population of 100 million in 2020 and 130 million in 2030.” A national food security committee, headed by a Deputy Prime Minister, will ensure that “… Vietnam’s rice cultivation area must be kept permanently at 3.8 million hectares, including 3.2 million hectares of paddy rice.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0276146711427447">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although rice production has always been important to the economy and society of Vietnam, the current approach to food security was largely shaped by widespread food shortages and hunger during the 1970s and 1980s.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0276146711427447">8</xref>
</sup> With rice comprising approximately 90 percent of staple food consumption, the emphasis on rice self-sufficiency is understandable. Due to the continuing influence of <italic>Doi Moi</italic>, Vietnam has been self-sufficient in rice since 1990 and there is currently no national rice shortage. Indeed, the country is the World’s second largest rice exporter after Thailand with annual milled rice exports regularly exceeding five million tons which is equivalent to the output on roughly one-quarter of the country’s rice land. Neither of these conditions has produced any tangible shift in national food security policy.</p>
<p>The political advantages of rice self-sufficiency are indisputable. While Vietnam remains rice self-sufficient, the government will never face problems of food insecurity as it defines the term. Nonetheless, as a national food security strategy, rice self-sufficiency is inefficient, ineffective, and inequitable. It is inefficient because it locks land and other resources (labor, physical capital, and finance) into a low-value use.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0276146711427447">9</xref>
</sup> This reduces agricultural output and lowers the national growth rate. Vietnam could produce less rice than at present and have higher gross domestic product while remaining food secure (as defined by the government). More important, Vietnamese farmers could have higher average incomes and welfare.</p>
<p>Rice self-sufficiency is an ineffective approach to food security. Despite large annual rice exports, many Vietnamese are too poor to food even though supplies, including rice, are plentiful.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0276146711427447">10</xref>
</sup> According to World Bank data, 37 percent of children under five in Vietnam were underweight in 1990. By 2000-07, the proportion had fallen to 20 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711427447">World Bank 2009b</xref>, table 1.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0276146711427447">United Nations 2009</xref>, table I). If rice self-sufficiency actually ensured food security, that proportion would have fallen to zero.</p>
<p>Rice self-sufficiency is inequitable. To achieve national food security, the government requires one segment of the population (rice farmers) to continue an activity (rice production) that keeps them poor by preventing them from using their resources (land, labor, finance, and equipment) more productively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0276146711427447">11</xref>
</sup> That is, in the public interest, one of the poorest groups in Vietnam is obliged, without compensation, to subsidize the rest of society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0276146711427447">12</xref>
</sup> No other group, whether members of the security forces, politicians, civil servants, party officials, or managers of state-owned enterprises, is required to make similar sacrifices of income or welfare in the public interest.</p>

<title>Land Policy and Pubic Investment in Agriculture<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0276146711427447">13</xref>
</sup>
</title>
<p>Land policy affects agricultural productivity (and hence rural incomes and welfare) by improving the allocation of land and modifying its uses. These productivity effects are reinforced by public investment in agriculture which transforms the agronomic features of land (particularly through irrigation and drainage, and services derived from agricultural R&amp;D) and modifies its location relative to input and output markets through the development of infrastructure.</p>
<p>A detailed overview of these matters appeared in the 1994 World Development Report (WDR) “Infrastructure for Development” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0276146711427447">World Bank 1994</xref>). Improvements in the quality and spread of infrastructure services reduce the real resource costs of linking producers and consumers to markets, and of connecting consumers with social services and other amenities. Sustained reductions in these costs expand commercial, financial, and distribution networks and by doing so promote agricultural and rural development by enhancing opportunities for enterprise, income generation, and wealth creation (and vice versa). That is, improved infrastructure services increase the economic supply of land, which in turn extends the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0276146711427447">Schultz 1953</xref>, chap. 13; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0276146711427447">Smith 1776</xref>, chap. III).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0276146711427447">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The 2009 WDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711427447">World Bank 2009b</xref>) reinforced the point. Drawing on the modern discipline of economic geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711427447">Grigg 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146711427447">Krugman 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0276146711427447">Wu and Gopinath 2008</xref>), it analyzes differences in the spatial pattern of growth and development in terms of differences in economic density, (economic) distance, and (economic and social) division. There are several implications for land policy. First, economic development is spatially uneven. Particular locations tend to acquire an advantage—as a market, transshipment point, raw material source, port, or administrative center—with that advantage often increasing over time. Second, markets shape the economic landscape. They always take time to develop and deepen, but, once established, benefit from “… growing cities, mobile people, and vigorous trade” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711427447">World Bank 2009b</xref>, 13). Third, “… human capital moves to where it is abundant, not scarce” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711427447">World Bank 2009b</xref>, 21). This outcome is consistent with research on teams and agglomeration effects in which an individual’s knowledge and skills are more valuable in settings where there are many other people with knowledge and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146711427447">Olson 1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0276146711427447">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0276146711427447">Radner 1998</xref>). Fourth, declining transport costs enhance the benefits of specialization and increased scale. Those benefits promote trade and exchange with neighboring regions (and countries) rather than with those which are more distant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711427447">World Bank 2009b</xref>, 21).</p>
<p>The WDR offers suggestions how Vietnam (and other developing countries) can benefit from these trends. Since economic activity tends to concentrate, the quest for <italic>national</italic> development requires the government to generate resources in areas of high economic density and to use them to promote development more broadly. Doing that requires “spatially blind institutions,” which avoid regional or location biases; the promotion of spatially networked investments that more closely integrate regions and districts; and the formulation of spatially targeted interventions that encourage social and human development throughout the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711427447">World Bank 2009b</xref>, 23-4).</p>
<p>These trends are evident in Vietnam and in some areas they are having a positive impact on land use in agriculture and the rural areas. In other respects, however, the impacts have been negative. On the positive side, some resources generated in the high economic density areas—Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Haiphong, Ba Ria–Vung Tau, and Danang—are being used to support development more broadly. Examples are the expansion of infrastructure, particularly electricity, bridges and ports, and the extension of social services such as health and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146711427447">Le 2006</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0276146711427447">15</xref>
</sup> The reduction in barriers, reflected in falling transport costs, has strengthened local trade links particularly within Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711427447">World Bank 2009b</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0276146711427447">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>One of the most obvious negative factors is that public sector expenditures in rural areas and agriculture are disproportionately lower than the share of the rural population in total population (72 percent in 2008) and the share of agriculture in national output (18 percent in 2008; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711427447">World Bank 2009b</xref>). A World Bank study pointed out that in 2005, public sector investment in the rural areas was 7 percent of the total (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0276146711427447">World Bank 2005</xref>). This was confirmed by data from the National Assembly showing that between 2000 and 2005, only 9 percent of the government’s budget for “basic investment” was spent on agriculture and rural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146711427447">Le 2006</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0276146711427447">17</xref>
</sup> Foreign aid partially compensates. To illustrate, in MARD’s “Plan of Agriculture and Rural Development for the year 2007,” total expenditure was projected to be Vietnamese Dong (VND) 4,056 billion, of which VND 1,869 billion (46 percent) was foreign aid. This share likely will increase over the period 2010-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0276146711427447">Van Nguyen 2009</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0276146711427447">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A further adverse trend has been the shift in the age, skill, and gender balance of the agricultural labor force. Evident in data compiled by the government statistical office (GSO), this is the mirror image of the migration of the young and better-educated from rural areas referred to earlier.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0276146711427447">19</xref>
</sup> These trends are likely to continue. In principle, they could be offset (at least partially) by public investment in research focused on the activities of farmers who are less skilled, older, and becoming increasingly dominated by women. Yet, that has not happened. Indeed, Vietnam has lagged well behind comparable countries in its spending on agricultural research and farmer education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146711427447">Stads and Nguyen 2006</xref>, 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0276146711427447">World Bank 2007</xref>, 167). Despite significant efforts over recent years to upgrade research capacity and link Vietnamese scholars with their international counterparts, too little is being spent in this area to meet the government’s ambitious goals for agricultural growth and export expansion.</p>
<p>As a final point, agriculture and rural areas have been adversely affected by the largely uncoordinated attempts by most provinces to promote industrial development by creating more than 200 industrial parks (or zones) throughout the country.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0276146711427447">20</xref>
</sup> Land has been recalled from agriculture and rural uses and cleared awaiting (potential) investors in areas that have no comparative advantage for industrial or commercial activity. Missed in this “build-it-and-they-will-come” scramble for provincial development is the lesson from economic geography, noted earlier, that economic activity concentrates spatially. Land use planning at all levels of government is meant to preclude this form of resource misallocation. The law, however, discourages the efficient use of land.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0276146711427447">21</xref>
</sup> As a result, rural welfare has declined with the needless displacement of farmers from their land and the pointless disruption of their livelihoods.</p>

By contrast, the largely unregulated use of pesticides, herbicides, and antibiotics has increased pollution in the Mekong and Red River Deltas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0276146711427447">World Bank 2006</xref>), areas that are already under pressure from the effects of rapid urbanization and industrialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146711427447">Boa 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146711427447">Romanowicz 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146711427447">Thanh et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0276146711427447">VNA 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146711427447">VietNamNet 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0276146711427447">WEPA 2003</xref>). The excessive pumping of ground water in the Mekong Delta is accentuating the problem of saltwater intrusion due to land subsidence. Dams and power plants such as Son La and Yali Falls (among others) have created adverse local and downriver effects. The increase in motorized personal and public transport has raised levels of urban smog and particulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146711427447">Goldmark 2010</xref>). Delays in the installation of waste treatment facilities in industrial parks lead to the dumping of untreated solid waste and effluents into local waterways and landfills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146711427447">VietNamNet 2009a</xref>). Upriver pollution has increased the costs of water purification.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the widely projected negative effects of climate change, a reality check is needed. Significant and sustained environmental stress already exists in Vietnam. The adverse effects of past excesses need to be remedied and the environmental problems created by current activities addressed. There are two reasons. First, doing so will prevent or at least minimize further environmental damage. This will maintain land productivity. Second, appropriate current responses will create the conditions (reflected in relevant policies, processes, incentives, and institutions) that enable the country to confront the consequences of climate change as and when they unfold.</p>
<p>The mixed environmental record offers opportunities and poses challenges. Progress in environmental management to date has had several valuable spillover effects. The reforestation program represents a significant contribution to carbon sequestration and improved land use. By stabilizing key watershed areas, flash flooding risks are reduced. Watershed protection has also diminished downstream siltation and pollution raising the efficiency of all watershed- and river-dependent activities. The reduced silt load extends the effective life of dams and weirs and reduces the need for dredging rivers and harbors. Water treatment plants can operate at reduced capacity helping to lower their costs.</p>
<p>However, the pollution associated with the overuse (and misuse) of insecticides and pesticides has direct effects on product quality especially of grain, fish, shellfish, and fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146711427447">Romanowicz 2007</xref>). Sold locally, the contaminated products pose health hazards for Vietnamese consumers. When exported, they risk being condemned by foreign health authorities and undermining Vietnam’s reputation as a responsible exporter.</p>
<p>Saltwater intrusion has increased due to the damming of rivers beyond Vietnam’s borders and soil subsidence in the Delta (Pomerantz 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146711427447">VietNamNet 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711427447">World Bank 2009b</xref>). This reduces the area of land suited to double-cropping of rice (or salt-intolerant crops). Farmers have adapted by expanding shrimp-rice rotations, a change which so far has been highly profitable and environmentally beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0276146711427447">Le et al. 2007</xref>). Efforts to build dykes to defend against saltwater have often been counterproductive. Regular flooding of the Delta is essential to sustain fertility and soil structure. Moreover, even with careful management, dykes and barriers trap pollutants which degrade the soil and reduce land productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146711427447">Romanowicz 2007</xref>; <italic>Tuoi Tre</italic> 2010).<sup>

</p>
<p>Changes in land policy in Vietnam have already had significant impacts on the environment. The land laws enable farmers who participate in the reforestation program to gain access to land. Legal restrictions have reduced (though probably not eliminated) destructive practices associated with commercial logging. Finally, the decollectivization of land use induced farmers to improve standards of land management. Indeed, it was the absence of appropriate incentives and effective institutional arrangements that produced the “tragedy of the commons” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146711427447">Hardin 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146711427447">Shultz and Holbrook 1999</xref>) evident in denuded hills in highland areas.</p>

<title>Implications of Vietnam’s Land Policy and Land Management</title>
<p>Who gains, who loses, and who bears the costs of land policy and land management in Vietnam? The examples above help answer these questions. In the process, they assist in identifying the constructive changes in land policy that would foster socioeconomic development, especially for farmers and rural land use certificate holders.</p>
<p>With respect to food security, the gainers and losers are obvious. Politicians and officials, whose principal interest is rice self-sufficiency, are assured that Vietnam remains food secure. Rice consumers also benefit, although not as much as they would gain if rice prices and transactions costs were to decline. The former would occur if rice imports from Cambodia (currently roughly a million tons per year) were to increase; the latter would result from subjecting the state-run marketing agencies to more intense competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146711427447">Ngan 2009</xref>). The losers are farmers (and their dependents) who incur a positive opportunity cost by producing rice. Given their circumstances—location, skills, information, risk tolerance, and available resources—being required to grow rice prevents them from producing some other higher value agricultural product.</p>
<p>Other major losers from the government’s current food security policy are the poor and food insecure. Indeed, poverty is the fundamental food security problem in Vietnam. There are ample supplies of food (including rice). Despite this, large numbers of people lack the income to purchase an adequate diet. The evidence is compelling. Data for 2002 reported by the World Bank show that 28.9 percent of the population was below the national poverty line. That average consisted of 6.6 percent of the urban population and 35.6 percent of the rural population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711427447">World Bank 2009b</xref>, 65). And, as noted above, malnutrition rates for children and adults remain high.</p>
<p>The economy as a whole is losing as well. Continuing to produce rice on land which if it were reallocated would yield higher returns, lowers the overall growth rate. This shows up (partially) as persistent rural poverty, lower urban income, foregone industrial production, reduced exports, and a diminished national standard of living.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0276146711427447">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Identifying specific groups who gain or lose from low levels of public sector investment in agriculture is not easy. Current investment spending heavily favors irrigation, which directly benefits particular groups of farmers. The imbalances in public investment are so large and so widespread that the impacts are macroeconomic. The most significant effect is that the low rate of rural investment limits the opportunities for farmers and rural residents to generate income and create wealth as “pathways out of poverty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0276146711427447">World Bank 2007</xref>, 45-9). The young and better educated workers move out of rural areas more rapidly, overloading the urban labor market and adding to urban congestion. These pressures raise the costs of urban/industrial development, absorbing resources that might otherwise have been used to promote agriculture. As a final point, the imbalances in Vietnam are inconsistent with the development trajectory of other rapidly growing (Asian) countries, most of which made a special effort to support agriculture during the transition to an urban/industrial society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146711427447">Blanco Armas, Gomez Osorio, and Moreno-Dodson 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0276146711427447">World Bank 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>While the above suggests that on average rural dwellers lose and urban dwellers gain from the existing structure of public investment, current trends confirm that the country as a whole is losing. Vietnamese agriculture has been losing its dynamism. World Bank and Vietnam’s GSO data show that from 1990 to 2000, agricultural output increased on average of 4.3 percent per annum. From 2000 to 2008, the growth rate was 3.8 percent. Although agriculture typically grows more slowly than the rest of the economy, the sector’s growth rate should not be dropping at this stage, especially when it is a source of livelihood for such a large segment of Vietnam’s population.</p>
<p>The gains and losses from the continued fragmentation of environmental management are relatively clear. Few Vietnamese can gain if the present situation persists. Urban pollution—dust, soot, noxious fumes, toxic effluents, untreated sewerage, and contaminated groundwater—will intensify and mitigation costs will increase. These costs will be capitalized into the value of land. Land which is upriver, elevated, and on the leeward side of contaminated areas will gain in value. Land which is downriver, low-lying, and on the wind-ward side of contaminated sites will lose value. In the rural areas, the spread of toxins and pollutants will raise costs and reduce labor and land productivity. Export markets may disappear or become difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>The issue is not about adding law or regulations. The principal challenges relate to implementation of, and compliance with, existing laws. Thus far, those who gain from the present circumstances are enterprises and individuals who should comply with emission, dumping, pumping, effluent-treatment, and other standards but do not. The problem, however, goes deeper. Investors, many of which are state-owned agencies, do not provide the required facilities. A government report in 2008, noted that of the 183 industrial zones in Vietnam, fewer than sixty-five had functional effluent/waste treatment plants, while others only operate their treatment facilities during visits by inspectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0276146711427447">VNA 2008</xref>; Do and Kim Khoi 2009).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0276146711427447">
<title>Where to from Here for Land Policy and Land Management?</title>
<p>Perhaps, the most constructive change would be for the government to rearrange its activities in ways that meet the constitutional requirement, Chapter II, Article 18 referred to earlier, that the “… State manages all the land according to overall planning and in conformity with the law, and guarantees that its use shall conform to the set objectives and yield effective results.” Public policy is reflected in what governments do rather than what they say they do. Based on this standard, Vietnam’s present land policies are not consistent with keeping the country on a sustained growth trajectory. The land use planning process is largely dysfunctional and many Vietnamese in rural areas are being grossly mistreated and often impoverished by the state’s land management procedures.</p>
<p>One specific improvement would be for the government to abandon its focus on rice self-sufficiency which restricts the use and conversion of rice land. They could do this by adopting the internationally accepted definition of food security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146711427447">FAO 2006</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0276146711427447">25</xref>
</sup> to emphasize the availability of all food, not just rice. This approach would better reflect reality as well since rising incomes, especially in urban areas, are systematically upgrading average diets.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0276146711427447">26</xref>
</sup> A second advantage is that it would direct attention to the capacity of all Vietnamese to gain access to food helping to emphasize the importance of income generation and poverty reduction.</p>
<p>The change would lead Vietnam to stress food self-reliance which is the food security policy of all modern economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146711427447">Panagariya 2002</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0276146711427447">27</xref>
</sup> Food self-reliance engages the whole economy—its productive capacity, physical distribution system, social redistribution capabilities, and policies related to food storage, commodity reserves, foreign exchange holdings, and trade in food products. It also encompasses public sector initiatives to reduce poverty and raise social welfare, especially programs that enable the poor and vulnerable (women in particular) to increase their productivity and incomes.</p>
<p>Redressing the imbalance in public sector investment would have a positive impact on agriculture and rural development. Indeed, international experience confirms that for sustained long-term development, agriculture has to remain robust, enabling labor to move out of the sector voluntarily rather than being pushed out by poverty. Many public sector activities supporting farmers, their families, and the rural population more generally could be expanded. Transport, storage and processing facilities, telecommunications, health and education, drainage and sanitation are some of the more obvious examples. Basic improvements in these areas would lower the unit costs of productive inputs, increase factor productivity, and raise the net returns on output. Both would add to farmer incomes and welfare, particularly of rural women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146711427447">Agnet 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0276146711427447">IFPRI 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146711427447">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional public investment would boost the quality of adaptive agricultural research. There is a large array of new technology and many new techniques that need to studied, tested, and adapted to Vietnamese conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146711427447">Hossain, Tran, and Janaiah 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146711427447">Khanh 2009</xref>). Public–private partnerships offer an opportunity to accelerate these activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0276146711427447">World Bank 2007</xref>, 170-1). This approach would engage farmers in upgrading their agricultural varieties and production techniques while simultaneously providing the private sector with a vested interest in promoting agricultural prosperity.</p>
<p>International evidence (primarily from India, China, and Indonesia) demonstrates that the extension of rural infrastructure has been one of the most effective means of reducing rural poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146711427447">Blanco Armas, Gomez Osorio, and Moreno-Dodson 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146711427447">Fan 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711427447">IFPRI 2002</xref>). By increasing the economic supply of land, it raises local and national wealth and welfare and boosts rural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711427447">Butterfield 1977</xref>). That, in turn, is associated with the spread of appropriate technology (both for farming and enhancing rural livelihoods), the strengthening of links among and between communities, the enhancement of rural administration, and the generation of incentives for labor-intensive economic opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146711427447">Bui 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146711427447">Fan 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0276146711427447">World Bank 2005</xref>). Each of these enables rural dwellers to participate in their own development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146711427447">Agnet 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>By reducing poverty, these investments improve environmental management. Poor people have few options other than to exploit every available short-term opportunity to gain a livelihood. Setting aside resources for the future is not a rational response for them. For this reason, a fundamental challenge in dealing with short-term environmental issues is to reduce poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146711427447">World Bank 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Investment and environmental management overlap in other ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0276146711427447">World Bank 2007</xref>). For example, Vietnam has state-of-the-art environmental legislation but monitoring and enforcement are weak. The government could remedy this situation by removing from its land laws and regulations the provisions that induce farmers to underinvest in their land (due to the short-term leases, the biased land recall procedures, the lack of transparency in land management, and the absence of due process in resolving land disputes), and to mismanage their resources (excessive pumping of groundwater, overuse of chemicals, and inefficient use of irrigation water). In this regard, strengthening institutional arrangements will be critical. Land laws and legal directives can prohibit the misuse of pesticides and herbicides and the overextraction of ground water. Ensuring compliance, however, requires effective monitoring, transparent, honest administrative oversight, and penalties that deter polluters.</p>

<sec id="section8-0276146711427447">
<title>Concluding Comments</title>
<p>In a constructive move, the Government of Vietnam has postponed revisions of the 2003 Law on Land until 2012. If it were effectively employed, the interlude will enable all stakeholders to more fully integrate land into the general law on property. Doing so would define a uniform set of land use rights for all Vietnamese, rural and urban, specify the circumstances for every land user under which those rights may be transferred, and develop transparent procedures common to all land users through which their rights may be defended (or adjudicated) without prejudice or recrimination. The last-mentioned provision will be a major achievement, particularly for rural land users to whom the present law provides no effective means of defending their claims to use land against the state or any of its agencies. Such a change would have a major impact on rural wealth, welfare, and income generation capacity.</p>
<p>Land policy and land management are key elements in the Government of Vietnam’s quest for sustained socioeconomic development. Yet, due to the breadth and rapidity of the reforms introduced under <italic>Doi Moi,</italic> the government (as the representative of the state) has had difficulty determining where, how, when, and why it needs to intervene (or disengage) from land management in ways that help promote socioeconomic development. The examples discussed in this essay—food security, agricultural investment, and environmental management—indicate that, so far, government action and inaction have created serious distortions. By shifting the balance, the government would ensure that land is used more efficiently, all land users are treated equitably, and that land policy and land management would boost rather than undermine national welfare.</p>
<p>No one disputes the government’s responsibility for national food security. The question is how it is achieved. The current policy of rice self-sufficiency, based on the controls over land use, is inefficient (it reduces economic growth), ineffective (many Vietnamese are ill-fed, despite national food surpluses), and inequitable (rice farmers, who are poor, are subsidizing the rest of society to achieve a national goal).</p>
<p>An appropriate response would be to redefine food security to include availability <italic>and</italic> access to food. This would focus attention on improving the productive capacity of agriculture (food crops, plantation crops, and aquaculture products) and increasing the capacity of all Vietnamese families to generate the incomes that give them access to adequate supplies of food. It would also shift the attention of the government and its agencies to the development of the food, trade, and investment policies that achieve and sustain national food self-reliance.</p>
<p>The productivity of agricultural land depends upon the efficiency with which farmers allocate their resources on their farms <italic>and</italic> the quality and scope of the infrastructure and other services which support their farming activities. Sustaining productivity growth in agriculture will require more attention to expanding basic infrastructure services in the rural areas as a means of improving food security, expanding employment opportunities, increasing output, and reducing poverty. Increased expenditure on adaptive agricultural research has high (social) returns. International cooperation in this area will help Vietnam adapt existing techniques and technologies to local conditions.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the potential impacts of climate change, the environment that supports agriculture in Vietnam is already subject to threats and stresses. At present, environment and land management do not effectively mitigate them. The main requirement is for the government to create the incentives for individuals, private firms, and state-owned enterprises to act responsibly. It will also require appropriate public oversight to ensure they continue acting that way.</p>
<p>For Vietnam to achieve middle-income status by 2020, as the government intends, rapid industrialization and modernization will need to continue. Land now in agriculture (and rice) will invariably be converted to industrial parks, residential areas, and infrastructure. The implications for land policy are clear. All land should be used in ways that yields the highest social returns; public investment should help boost agricultural (and land) productivity; and environmental (and land) management should ensure that the institutions and incentives support environmental sustainability. With land policies that reflect these objectives, all Vietnamese will be food secure, rural residents will have the capacities to generate higher incomes from agriculture and related activities, and the society as a whole will be able to enjoy high rates of sustained economic growth.</p>

<p>Citing a report to the National Assembly, Le Tuan noted that between 2000 and 2005, “… there had been 17,902 billion dong invested into rural bridges and transportation system. There were now only 219/899 communes without road access to commune centers, 88.37% of communes reached by electric grid, 58% of households in rural area using sanitary water.”</p>

<p>For the decade 1997-2007, Vietnam’s exports “within region” increased from 14 to 20 percent of total exports. For total imports, the increase was from 13 to 34 percent. Over that same period, exports to, and imports from, “high-income economies” declined.</p>

<p>Decree 68/2001/ND-CP of the government on master planning and land use planning creates adverse incentives. Like LL2003, Articles 21 through 30 and Decree 69, Articles 4 through 10, the law is framed in terms of the “needs” of each level of government. There is no mechanism specified to coordinate efficiently land use, whether market based or institutional.</p>

<p>A large amount of untreated effluents are regularly discharged by the major cities seriously affecting downriver activities. One report noted: “According to Hanoi Natural Resource and Environment Department, every day the total amount of urban wastewater discharged is 500,000 m<sup>3</sup>, of which 100,000 m<sup>3</sup> is from industries, hospitals and other services. Only 8 to 10 percent of the amount is treated in four newly built wastewater treatment plants with total capacity of 48,000 m<sup>3</sup> per day” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0276146711427447">VietNamNet 2009b</xref>).</p>

<p>The GSO regularly reports value productivity of workers in different sectors. These annual series “Productivity of employed population by kinds of economic activity” highlight the potential gains if Vietnam were to reallocate resources from low productivity to higher productivity sectors. To illustrate, productivity per worker in agriculture and forestry was VND 4 million in 2000 and VND 12.2 million in 2008 while the average in all sectors was VND 11.7 million in 2000, and VND 32.9 million in 2008.</p>

<p>This is an implication of Bennet’s Law which relates to “calorie substitution.” As per capita incomes rise, consumers demand higher-quality foods. GSO data confirm this trend with Vietnamese consumers gaining a larger share of their calorie intake from wheat products, milk, fish, and meat and a smaller share from rice, tubers, and other starchy foods.</p>

<p>By way of reference, the United States is the world’s foremost food self-reliant country. In 2008, it imported $80.5 billion of food and agricultural products “paying for” them with $115.3 billion of food and agriculture exports.</p>
