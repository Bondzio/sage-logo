<p>The Lisbon Treaty has institutionalized a dual constitution, supranational in the single market’s policies and intergovernmental in (among others) economic and financial policies. The extremely complex system of economic governance set up for answering the euro crisis has been defined and implemented on the basis of the intergovernmental constitution of the EU. The euro crisis has thus represented a test for the validity of the intergovernmental constitution of the Lisbon Treaty. Although the measures adopted in the period 2010-2012, consisting of legislative decisions and new intergovernmental treaties, are of an unprecedented magnitude, they were nevertheless unable to promote effective and legitimate solutions for dealing with the financial crisis. In the context of an existential challenge, the intergovernmental approach faced a structural difficulty in solving basic dilemmas of collective action.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, the EU has formalized two different logics of decision making, one supranational and the other intergovernmental. While the two logics interacted within a single framework before the 1992, after that period the EU has allocated different policies to different institutional frameworks to be pursued through different constitutional logics. The single market policies have continued to be managed through the decision-making interaction of supranational institutions (as the Commission, the European Parliament [EP], the European Court of Justice [ECJ]) and intergovernmental institutions (as the Council of Ministers thus only Council and the European Council), while new policies as financial and economic policies (or foreign and security policies) have come to be controlled exclusively by the intergovernmental institutions. This was the Maastricht Compromise: The member states accepted to Europeanize policies traditionally closed to the core of their sovereignty at the condition that, in Brussels, their national governments would control their decision-making process. Although the 2009 Lisbon Treaty repealed the separate pillars instituted in Maastricht, it nevertheless constitutionalized different decision-making regimes for dealing with different policies. In our case, economic and financial policies have been considered not only the domain of the European Council and Council (<italic>institutional framework</italic>) but also their development has been based on coordination among governments (<italic>constitutional logic</italic>).</p>
<p>When the euro crisis exploded, thus, there was in place a specific constitutional logic and a specific institutional framework for dealing with it. The euro crisis has represented an occasion for assessing the crisis management and crisis prevention capabilities of the intergovernmental EU. The article argues that the test has been unsatisfactory. For supporting this argument, the decisions taken by the intergovernmental EU for dealing with the euro crisis are reconstructed in detail. The extremely complex system of economic governance set up during the euro crisis (in the period 2010-2012) has been largely motivated and defined on the basis of the intergovernmental logic and decided through and within the intergovernmental institutional framework. The financial crisis that broke out in 2008, taking a serious turn for the worse in 2010 and deepening since then, has tottered the intergovernmental structure set up in the Lisbon Treaty. The financial bankruptcy of Greece and Ireland and the serious financial difficulties of Portugal, Spain, and Italy (and thus the Cyprus’ banking crisis of April 2013, here not analyzed) determined the need to radically redefine the EU intergovernmental arrangement constructed in the course of the last two decades. New measures and treaties were introduced and approved in the attempt to ameliorate market pressures on the weaker and indebted member states of the euro-area, but they did not work as expected. They were considered ineffective by the financial markets and illegitimate by the affected citizens (as shown by the strikes and riots in the capitals of the indebted EU member states).</p>
<p>The article is divided into three sections. The first section aims to show that the Lisbon Treaty has institutionalized a dual constitution with related decision-making regimes (supranational regarding the policies of the single market and intergovernmental regarding inter alia economic and financial policies). The second section will describe the measures taken in the period 2010-2012 on the basis of the intergovernmental logic and decision-making regime for dealing with the euro crisis, showing their inability to offer effective and legitimate answers to the crisis. The third section will discuss the structural reasons of that inability. To analyze the limits of the intergovernmental EU does not imply, <italic>a contrario</italic>, that the supranational EU would have fared better as the conclusion will indicate.</p>

<title>The Lisbon Treaty: The Dual Constitution</title>
<sec id="section3-0010414013489502">
<title>The Supranational Side</title>
<p>The Treaty of Lisbon came into force on December 1, 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414013489502">Foster, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414013489502">2</xref></sup> Although the Treaty of Lisbon has scrapped any constitutional symbolism, it has defined (in terms of roles and functions) the EU’s institutional structure and its logic of operating (as constitutions do). For a large majority of policies where integration proceeds through formal acts (<italic>integration through law</italic>), it is plausible to argue that the Lisbon Treaty has set up a governmental structure organized around two distinct legislative chambers and two distinct executive institutions, thus bringing to maturity a long process of distinction between the executive and the legislative branches.</p>
<p>Celebrating the co-decision procedure as “the ordinary legislative procedure” (TFEU, Art. 289), the Treaty has institutionalized a two-chamber legislative branch, consisting of a lower chamber representing the European electorate (the EP) and an upper chamber representing the governments of the member states (the Council). According to TFEU, Art. 289, “the ordinary legislative procedure shall consist in the joint adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of a regulation, directive or decision on a proposal from the Commission.” The Treaty has thus celebrated the growing role acquired by the EP since its direct election in 1979 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414013489502">Shackleton, 2005</xref>). The EP has finally become an institution of equal standing with the Council representing (in its various ministerial formations, 10, included the General Affairs Council, as of 2012) the ministers of the EU member states’ governments. At the same time, by recognizing the European Council (which consists of the heads of state or government of the EU member states, chaired by a president elected “by a qualified majority” of them “for a term of two and half years, renewable once,” TEU Art. 15(5)) as the body responsible for setting the general political guidelines and priorities of the EU, the Treaty has formally transformed it into a political executive of the Union, while confirming the Commission in its role of technical executive of the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414013489502">Scoutheete, 2011</xref>). The European Council, therefore, can no longer be considered a body linked to the Council as it was in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414013489502">Eggermont, 2012</xref>), because the latter exercises legislative functions, while the former only executive ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414013489502">Kreppel, 2011</xref>). The Lisbon Treaty has therefore built a four-sided institutional framework for governing the EU policies (on the single market), with a bicameral legislature and a dual executive branch.</p>
<p>The four institutions are separate because they are formed through different electoral procedures, represent different communities of interest, and operate according to different prerogatives and nevertheless they are reciprocally connected through several mechanisms of checks and balances. That is, the European Council and the Council are expressions of member state governments, and their composition depends on the outcomes of the staggered national elections in the member states, while the EP depends on the outcome of the elections organized in districts within member states every 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414013489502">3</xref></sup> Or consider the Commission’s president who is nominated by the European Council, but should then receive the EP’s approval. Moreover, the Treaty requires (TFEU, Art. 17.7) the European Council “of taking into account the elections to the European Parliament” in the appointment of the president of the Commission. The commissioners are nominated by the European Council, in cooperation with Commission’s president, but even they have to pass through a process of approval as a college by the EP. Thus, in the large majority of single market’s policies, where integration is taking place through legal acts, the EU decides through a complex interplay if not overlapping of those institutions each, however, independent from the others (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414013489502">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>It is a decision-making system complex and nevertheless balanced. In fact, “where reference is made in the Treaties to the ordinary legislative procedure for the adoption of an act,” the above procedure shall apply (TFEU, art. 294): The Commission has monopoly over legislative proposals (although its proposals have increasingly reflected European Council’s political inputs) that have the form of a directive, regulation, or decision; before submitting its proposal, the Commission will have to consult the various committees of the representatives of the member states (COREPER) supporting the activities of the Council, the parliamentary committees, and interested or influential social and functional private organizations; once submitted, the Commission’s proposal will have to be discussed, amended, and approved by both legislative branches (the EP, through the absolute majority of its voting members, and the Council, through a qualified majority of the national ministers). This decision-making system tries to satisfy the effectiveness’ criteria, with the competitive cooperation between the European Council and the Commission, and the legitimacy’s criteria, thanks to the legislative role of the EP and the Council and the supervisory role of ECJ, together with member states’ constitutional courts.</p>

<title>The Intergovernmental Side</title>
<p>Integration through law does not represent, however, the only logic celebrated by the Lisbon Treaty. With the extension of the integration process to policy realms traditionally considered sensitive to the national sovereignty of the member states, such as welfare and employment policies, foreign and security policy (Common Foreign and Security Policies [CFSP]), military and security policy (European Security and Defence Policy [ESDP]), and economic and financial policies (and the Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414013489502">4</xref></sup>), the EU has looked to organize the decision-making process by new modes of governance, based on open method of coordination, benchmarking, mainstreaming, peer review and, more generally, <italic>intergovernmental coordination</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414013489502">Caporaso &amp; Wittenbrinck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414013489502">Heritier &amp; Rhodes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414013489502">Idema &amp; Keleman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414013489502">Kohler-Koch &amp; Rittberger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414013489502">Trubek &amp; Trubek, 2007</xref>). It was the 1992 Maastricht Treaty that institutionalized a <italic>compromise</italic> between those asserting the need to promote integration also in policy’s areas historically at the center of national sovereignty, as monetary and economic policy or foreign and security policy, and those unwilling to downsizing the powers of national governments in those policy’s realms. The compromise consisted, on one side, in integrating at the Union’s level also those policies and, on the other side, in interpreting this integration as <italic>voluntary coordination</italic> between member states’ governments, with minor if not insignificant role of the supranational institutions. Indeed, for distinguishing between different models of integration, the Maastricht Treaty set up three distinct institutional pillars or decision-making regimes.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Treaty has abolished the institutional distinction between pillars, giving a unified legal personality to the EU, but it has maintained the distinction between different logics and decision-making regimes, the supranational and the intergovernmental. Although each logic accommodates several patterns of decision-making, the two logics have remained distinct. Certainly, the boundary between the supranational and intergovernmental logics is not fixed and insurmountable, as shown by the justice and home affairs that since Maastricht was gradually transformed from an intergovernmental to a supranational policy. Nonetheless, the Lisbon Treaty has formally entrenched the intergovernmental decision-making regime, thus celebrating an alternative model of integration based on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414013489502">Allerkamp, 2009</xref>, p. 14): (a) “policy entrepreneurship (coming, <italic>n.d.r.</italic>) from some national capitals and the active involvement of the European Council in setting the overall direction of policy”; (b) “the predominance of the Council of Ministers in consolidating cooperation”; (c) “the limited or marginal role of the Commission”; (d) “the exclusion of the EP and the ECJ from the circle of involvement”; (e) “the involvement of a distinct circle of key national policy-makers”; (f) “the adoption of special arrangements for managing cooperation, in particular the Council Secretariat”; (g) “the opaqueness of the process to national parliaments and citizens”; and (h) “the capacity on occasion to deliver substantial joint policy.” What we have here is a simplified decision-making regime, based on the European Council and the Council, within which national governments play an exclusive role.</p>
<p>Regarding EMU, the Lisbon Treaty is clear in establishing that its policies should be pursued through <italic>soft law</italic>, not <italic>hard law</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414013489502">Heipertz &amp; Verdun, 2010</xref>). After the Maastricht Treaty, EMU has come to aggregate a set of policies aimed at converging the economies of all the EU member states. EMU constituted the institutional context for moving in direction of a single currency (according to the schedule defined by the 1988 Delors Report). Although monetary policy came to be centralized in the ECB (starting on June 1, 1998), economic and financial policies were left in the hands of national governments. The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), an agreement between all EU member states for promoting the stability of the EMU (based on two Council’s regulations entered into force on July 1, 1998, and January 1, 1999), was clear in asserting the exclusive role of the Council in deciding the measure related to the excessive deficit procedure. This approach was thus institutionalized by the Lisbon Treaty that has annexed the SGP as Protocol N. 12. As TFEU, Art. 119 states, “the adoption of an economic policy . . . is based on the close coordination of Member States’ economic policies.” For the Lisbon Treaty, economic and financial policies continue to be reserved territories of the Council (in its configuration as Council on Economic and Financial Affairs known as ECOFIN) with the Commission allowed to play a technical role, although important, in monitoring the economic performance of member states. TFEU, Art. 126(14) is peremptory at this regard: “The Council shall, acting unanimously in accordance with a special legislative procedure and after consulting the European Parliament and the European Central Bank, adopt the appropriate provisions” for implementing agreed-upon economic guidelines. However, while being required to consult the EP on some legislative proposals concerning economic and financial policy, the Council is not bound by latter’s position. The EMU functions according to a variant of intergovernmentalism that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414013489502">Puetter (2012)</xref> defined as “deliberative intergovernmentalism.”</p>
<p>Although it is recognized (TUE, Art. 126(6) and 126(7)) that the Commission may initiate a procedure against a member state running an excessive budget deficit, the Commission’s recommendation has, however, the status of a proposal because only the ECOFIN Council can take the appropriate measures (that may go from requests of information addressed to the member state that fails to comply to fines imposed on it). It is thus up to the Council to decide whether to proceed along the lines of the Commission’s proposal (as it didn’t do in 2003, when the Commission proposed opening an infringement procedure against France and Germany, who were not respecting the parameters of the SGP). The sanctions for excessive deficits and debts should be subject to the wills of member states’ governments (or their financial ministers in the ECOFIN Council). This is even truer for euro-area member states, whose main deliberations take place either in the Euro Summit or in the Euro Group (consisting, respectively, of the heads of state and government and the ministers of economics and finance of the EU member states adopting the common currency, as regulated by Protocol N. 14 annexed to the Lisbon Treaty), with the technical support of the Commission. The Euro Group has the status of an “informal institution,” embodying a specific approach to policy-making defined as “informal governance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414013489502">Puetter, 2006</xref>). Protocol N. 14 does not even mention the EP, at least as the institution required to be informed about the decisions made. And no supervisory role is recognized or assigned to the ECJ. By establishing a common currency (the euro adopted by 17 member states as of 2012), the EU has thus centralized monetary policy (assigning its management to a supranational institution, the ECB). At the same time, by introducing the coordination logic, it has allowed for the decentralization of those financial, fiscal, and budgetary policies necessarily connected to monetary policy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414013489502">Figure 2</xref>). It has been the intergovernmental Union that was tested by the dramatic events of the euro crisis.</p>

<title>Intergovernmentalism: Ascent and Crisis</title>
<sec id="section6-0010414013489502">
<title>The Politics of Intergovernmentalism</title>
<p>Once the financial crisis arrived to Europe in 2009-2010, the EU intergovernmental constitution enjoyed the support of a powerful constellation of political leaders and public opinions. After all, once the EU entered the throes of a crisis after the failure of the Constitutional Treaty in the French and Dutch popular referendum of 2005, the intergovernmental approach emerged as the only feasible strategy for promoting integration. As <italic>The Economists’ s</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414013489502">Charlemagne (2012)</xref> wrote, after “the French and Dutch voters killed the proposed EU constitution . . . intergovernmentalism (became) the new fashion.”</p>
<p>The apex of the intergovernmental moment was reached between 2009 and mid-2012. In that period, in fact, French and German governments converged toward an intergovernmental interpretation of the integration process. President Sarkozy, in his 2007-2012 mandate, was the spokesperson of a political vision of the integration as a process driven by national governments. In Sarkozy’s vision, there was no room for the EP and the Commission in the decision-making process, not to mention the ECJ. One might argue that this vision appears to cohere quite well with a domestic semipresidential system based on the decision-making primacy of the president of republic. At the same time, it may be surprising that such an intergovernmental vision of Europe came to be shared by the post-2009 German government of Angela Merkel. After Helmut Kohl’s chancellorship, a new generation of German politicians with no experience of World War II (WWII) has come into power. This change emerged clearly with the Schroeder government which followed the last Kohl government in 1998 and which lasted till 2005. Since then, “generational change . . . allowed (German) political leaders to <italic>normalise</italic> EU policy in the sense of becoming more like other large member states” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414013489502">Sloam, 2005</xref>, p. 98). The new generation was “ready to articulate material German interests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414013489502">Sloam, 2005</xref>, p. 88) and not only to profess guilty for the country’s past. During the first half of the 2000s, the social-democratic and green governmental elites began questioning the paymaster role that Germany traditionally played within the process of European integration (e.g., asking for a renegotiation of the EU budget), did not refrain from mobilizing German military force abroad (e.g., participating in the 1999 Kosovo war), and articulated a vision of a German interest distinct from the European interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414013489502">5</xref></sup> However, this new German assertiveness remained within the federal perspective of an increasingly economically and politically integrated Europe. This continuity was clearly expressed in the famous speech by the German Foreign Affairs Minister Joschka Fischer at Humboldt University in Berlin on May 12, 2000, not by chance titled “From Confederacy to Federation: Thoughts on the Finality of European Integration.”</p>
<p>When Angela Merkel took power for the first time in 2005,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414013489502">6</xref></sup> the generational change acquired also a new territorial connotation. Angela Merkel was and is the first chancellor coming from the Eastern part of Germany (the <italic>Deutsche Demokratische Republik</italic> [DDR]), remained under Soviet control during the Cold War era. The DDR was not involved in the public self-analysis of German responsibilities for the Holocaust and WWII that instead developed in the Western part of Germany (the <italic>Bundesrepublik Deutschland</italic>). A territorial origin that might explain why Angela Merkel is considered to be a European more in the head than the heart.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414013489502">7</xref></sup> Moreover, with the outcome of the 2009 German elections, which led to the formation of a coalition government between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the <italic>Freie Demokratische Partei</italic> (FDP), the chancellorship of Angela Merkel became more exposed to the intergovernmental tone. The FDP took increasingly a clear euro-realistic position, quite unusual for German politics. At the same time, the German constitutional court or <italic>Bundesverfassungsgericht</italic> (BVerfG)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010414013489502">8</xref></sup> has introduced powerful hurdles to the further transfer of national sovereignty to the EU. Finally the German public seemed increasingly wary of paying taxes to aid countries with high public debts and deficits. It was probably this combination of factors that led the Merkel’s government formed in 2009 to search for institutional and policy solutions to the euro crisis that would not be questioned by the Court, her coalitional partner, or her voters. Merkel’s government gradually moved from a reaffirmation of national interests (as the previous governments did) to a preference for an intergovernmental solution to the crisis, a preference at odds with the political structure and public culture of her country.</p>
<p>The German parliamentary-federal system, in fact, is quite different from the French semipresidential-unitary system. In Germany, the bicameral legislature (the <italic>Bundestag</italic>, representing the citizens, and the <italic>Bundesrat</italic>, representing the <italic>laender’s</italic> executives) plays a crucial role in the policy-making process, and the judiciary is the indispensable solver of any constitutional dispute. Thus, if France, in the 2009-2012 period, came to adopt the German economic paradigm enshrined in the new intergovernmental treaties and legislative measures, in the same period Germany came to adopt the French political paradigm, accepting that decision-making power in the EU should be locked in the exclusive hands of the governments meeting within the European Council and the ECOFIN Council (or the Euro Summit and the Euro Group regarding the euro-area member states). This marked a significant change for a country like Germany, which was traditionally the defender of the Commission and the EP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414013489502">Pederson, 1998</xref>). Finally, among the larger countries, the intergovernmental vision was supported not only by the British coalition government of David Cameron (elected in 2010) but also by the Italian government of Silvio Berlusconi (2008-2011).</p>
<p>At the turn of the first decade of the 2000s, thus, the consensus was that integration has reached such depth that only member states’ governments can drive it properly. As President Sarkozy made clear in his speech in Toulon on December 2, 2011,
<disp-quote>
<p>the reform of Europe is not a march towards supra-nationality . . . The crisis has pushed the heads of state and government to assume greater responsibility because ultimately they have the democratic legitimacy to take decisions . . . The integration of Europe will go the intergovernmental way because Europe needs to make strategic political choices.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A year before President Sarkozy’ speech, on November 2, 2010,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010414013489502">9</xref></sup> German chancellor Angela Merkel assessed that “the Lisbon Treaty has placed the institutional structure (of the EU) on a new foundation,” out-dating the traditional distinction between the “Community and the Intergovernmental methods.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0010414013489502">10</xref></sup> Indeed, she added, the EU is functioning according to a “new Union method,” which consists of “coordinated action in a spirit of solidarity.”</p>
<p>If the decision-making preeminence of national governments was justified by the legitimacy coming to them from their own domestic electorates, as both Sarkozy and Merkel asserted in several occasions, then the control of their action should be assigned to national legislatures, not the EP, which is, indeed, the position expressed by the German constitutional court in its judgments. In the decision of September 12, 2012, on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and Fiscal Compact, the court states (Art. 2 (4)) that
<disp-quote>
<p>in matters of European Stability Mechanism . . . the responsibility shall be exercised by the plenary session of the German <italic>Bundestag</italic> ( . . . and) in all other matters . . . which affect the budgetary responsibility of the German <italic>Bundestag . . .</italic> the budget committee of the German <italic>Bundestag</italic> shall be involved.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0010414013489502">11</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, the intergovernmental logic brings with it an interparliamentary balancing: National parliaments should coordinate for controlling the coordinated national governments. The Lisbon Treaty prefigures this possibility, when it encourages

<p>In a speech given on January 11, 2012, the then French minister for European Affairs, Jean Leonetti, proposed the creation of an indirectly formed “Euro-area parliament,” consisting of parliamentarians of the national parliaments of the euro-area, as an institution balancing the Euro Summit.</p>

<title>The Crisis and Its Dynamic</title>
<p>When the crisis started to hit Greece, there was in place a decision-making regime for structuring the institutional and policy’s answer to financial turmoil enjoying a large political support. As established by the intergovernmental constitution, the European Council and the ECOFIN Council took immediately the center-stage of the policy-making process, while the Commission was marginalized and the EP left dormant. Continuous meetings of the European Council and ECOFIN Council were organized between 2010 and 2012,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0010414013489502">12</xref></sup> although none of them did come out as decisive. At least there were four rounds of crucial decisions concerning the new economic governance of the EU.</p>
<p>The first round took place in 2010. At the ECOFIN Council of May 2010, first it was adopted a regulation to create the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) as a new EU law instrument and then, at the margin of that meeting,
<disp-quote>
<p>the members of the Council from the 17 euro area countries “switched hats” and transformed themselves into representatives of their states at an intergovernmental conference; in that capacity, they adopted a decision by which they committed themselves to establish the (European Financial Stability Facility or) EFSF outside the EU legal framework. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414013489502">De Witte, 2012</xref>, p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The EFSF consisted of an executive agreement (not a new formal treaty), in the form of a private company established under Luxembourg law, thus authorized to negotiate with its 17 shareholders. Both instruments were used “simultaneously and cumulatively with respect to Ireland and Portugal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414013489502">De Witte, 2012</xref>, p. 4) and then Greece. Moreover, in the Council of September 7, 2010, it was approved the European Semester, an instrument for enhancing time consistency in EU economic policy coordination, entered into force by January 2011. If the former were instruments of crisis management (to help Ireland, Portugal, and then Greece to face the crisis of sovereign debt), the latter was rather a framework for promoting crisis prevention because finalized to coordinate <italic>ex ante</italic> the budgetary and economic policies of the EU member states, in line with both the SGP and Europe 2010 strategy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414013489502">Hallerberg, Marzinotto, &amp; Wolff, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The second round took place in the first half of 2011. Between the European Council of March 24-25 and the European Council of June 23-24, several measures were taken. First of all, the so-called Six Pack consisting of legislative proposals finalized to tighten further the policy coordination required by both the European Semester and the SGP. All of these became operative by December 13, 2011. They were (a) the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and coordination of economic policies through a regulation amending Council Regulation 1466/97 approved with the co-decision procedure on Commission’s proposal, (b) the speeding up and clarification of the excessive deficit procedure through a Council regulation amending Council Regulation 1467/97 approved with a special legislative procedure (with the EP only consulted), (c) the enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area through a new regulation approved with the co-decision procedure on Commission’s proposal, (d) the definition of a budgetary framework of the member states through a new Council directive implemented with a nonlegislative procedure (with the EP only consulted), (e) the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances through a new regulation approved with the co-decision procedure on Commission’s proposal, and (f) the enforcement of measures for correcting excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area through a new regulation approved with the co-decision procedure on Commission’s proposal. To these measures, it should be added the Euro Plus Pact, consisting of a political commitment (a sort if intergovernmental agreement) between the euro area member states, but also open to non-euro area ones (Denmark, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, and Romania) aimed to foster stronger economic policy coordination. The signatories of the Pact made concrete commitments to a list of political reforms intended to improve the fiscal strength and competitiveness of each country. The Pact was intended as a more stringent successor to the SGP although it continued to be based on the open method of coordination. It was finally adopted in March 2011.</p>
<p>The third round developed in the second half of 2011 and the first month of 2012. A first version of the Treaty on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) was signed in July 2011 by all the EU member states. The Treaty’s project was decided on March 25, 2011, on the basis of a European Council’s decision taken on December 16, 2010, to amend TFEU Art. 136 that states that “the member States whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole.” It was finally established on September 27, 2012, outside the EU legal framework and became operative by January 1, 2013, having to wait the decision of the German constitutional court regarding its constitutional congruence with the German Basic Law, decision finally and positively expressed on September 12, 2012. The ESM constitutes a permanent firewall for the euro-area with a maximum lending capacity of 500 billion euro. It has replaced the two temporary EU funding programs, EFSF and EFSM, although the latter continue to handle the transfer and monitoring of the previously bailout loans for Ireland, Portugal, and Greece. The ESM is an intergovernmental organization under public international law, established among the euro-area member states and endowed of its own institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0010414013489502">13</xref></sup> In the second half of 2011, other crucial decisions were made, particularly during the European Council’s meeting of December 8-9, 2011. Under the leadership of German chancellor Angela Merkel, followed by French president Nicolas Sarkozy, a proposal to amend the Lisbon Treaty for integrating the fiscal policies of the member states was advanced. This time, automatic mechanisms of sanctions on member states not respecting the more stringent criteria of deficit-GDP percentage (0.5% a year) and debt-GDP percentage (60%, with the downsizing of 1/20 of the over stock every year) were proposed. Moreover, it was requested that each member state would introduce the golden rule of a mandatory balanced budget domestically at the constitutional or equivalent level. The United Kingdom’s veto to pursuing fiscal integration within the Lisbon Treaty’s legal framework, motivated by the need to protect the London financial district from possibly restrictive fiscal regulations, made it necessary to move beyond the Lisbon Treaty. The new intergovernmental treaty, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination, and Governance in the EMU, known as Fiscal Compact Treaty, with its own governance structure, was signed by all the 17 euro-area member states plus those non-euro area member states (all of them, apart from the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic) interested in participating in the Treaty on March 2, 2012. It has entered into force on January 1, 2013.</p>
<p>Finally, a fourth round developed between the European Council of June 28-29 and December 13-14, 2012. If the June’s European Council moved the agenda of the EU from fiscal rigor to the need of promoting economic growth, the December’s European Council formalized a road map for moving “towards a genuine economic and monetary union.” This direction implies, in particular for the euro-area member states, to share an integrated financial framework (with the decision taken in the ECOFIN Council’s meeting on April 11-12, 2013, to set up a banking union endowed of a single supervisory mechanism hosted by the ECB), an integrated budgetary framework, an integrated economic policy framework and to strengthen democratic legitimacy and accountability of the euro-area institutions. In this period, two regulations were approved through the co-decision procedure (the so-called Two Pack), applicable to the euro-area member states only on the basis of TFEU, Art. 136, aimed to further strengthening the surveillance mechanisms in the euro-area. The two regulations build on the SGP and the European Semester and impose the euro-area member states to submit their budgetary plan for the following year to the Commission and the Euro Group before October 15 along with the independent macroeconomic forecast on which they are based. The exercise in Autumn introduced by the Two Packs would allow the monitoring and sharing of information on the member states’ budgetary policies before their adoption. The Two Pack is a further and more stringent contribution to the crisis prevention regime of the euro-area member states.</p>
<p>Considering the complex of new measures adopted and treaties approved in the period 2010-2012, one has to acknowledge their extraordinary policy magnitude and complexity. Some of them, as the Six Pack and the Two Pack, have strengthened the supranational side of the EU, given they consisted of regulations and directives approved predominantly through the co-decision procedure. However, with the deepening of the euro crisis, the EU has more and more shifted toward an intergovernmental direction. A multiplicity of treaties were set up, as the EFSF thus substituted by the ESM for crisis management and the Fiscal Compact for crisis prevention. It was observed that those decisions have put “the EU system . . . in the throes of a revolution (although) like all revolutions, this one (too) displays numerous evolutionary features” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414013489502">Ludlow, 2011a</xref>, p. 5). However, that revolution was not sufficient to appease the financial markets that indeed began demanding higher interest rates for buying public bonds from the southern and peripheral euro-area member states. Market pressures became so powerful that many of these countries with high ratios of public debt to GDP had to register the collapse of their incumbent governments. In some cases (Ireland, Portugal, Spain), the crisis was resolved through new elections, while in others (Greece, Italy) it was resolved through the substitution of the parties in government with a “national solidarity” executive composed by technocrats and supported by a large trans-parties alliance in the parliament. The formation of executives independent from electoral consensus was considered necessary not only to promote the required reforms (previously vetoed by powerful electoral constituencies) but also to guarantee the virtuous euro-area member states (Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Austria) that Greece and Italy would be serious in cutting their public debt and rationalizing their general systems of public expenditure. The hope was to show the financial markets (and the domestic electorates of the virtuous countries) that the entire euro-area was committed to achieving financial stability. Nevertheless, markets’ speculation continued. Even the most audacious decisions arrived late for answering to the market’s pressures, were too limited in their reach in that specific moment, and were perceived as illegitimate by the affected interests.</p>

<title>Intergovernmentalism: Dilemmas and Reaction</title>
<sec id="section9-0010414013489502">
<title>The Dilemmas of Intergovernmentalism</title>
<p>Why has the intergovernmental EU set up an extremely complex system of economic governance that nevertheless was unable to appease the markets and to convince the citizens of the indebted countries? One might answer that the euro crisis hit so deeply the EU to require the setting up of amazingly complex instruments of both crisis management and crisis prevention. But why have crucial policy’s instruments been located outside the legal structure of the EU? Such institutional intricacy has to be considered the logical outcome of a decision-making regime that is based primarily on national governments’ coordination. Coordination is insufficient for solving basic dilemmas of collective action. If any decision-making regime should be able to generate effective and legitimate solutions for the problems it has to deal with, the intergovernmental regime has shown to be based on shaky foundations in doing that.</p>
<p>Let us start from considering the effectiveness’ side of the intergovernmental decision-making regime. Three basic dilemmas emerged during the euro crisis. The <italic>first</italic> was the <italic>veto dilemma</italic>: How to neutralize oppositions in a decision-making process requiring unanimous consent? This dilemma accompanied the entire evolution of the euro crisis, bringing the European Council and the ECOFIN Council to answer the crisis regularly “too late and too little.” Although the financial crisis was initially circumscribed only to Greece, it gradually began expanding to other euro-area member states because of the decision-making stalemate produced by divergent strategies for dealing with it. Divergences in the domestic electoral interests of the various incumbent governments (governments with a sound budget did not want to pay for the difficulties of indebted countries whose governments expected instead to be helped for surviving politically) made the decision-making process dramatically muddled. Or, for neutralizing the British veto on fiscal coordination, it was necessary to move outside of the Lisbon Treaty, setting up a new treaty. At the same time, the difficulty in speeding up the decision-making process during the crisis increased the stake of the leadership’s role in driving the EU toward the necessary answers. As the financial crisis deepened, the bilateral leadership of Germany and France, in the period 2009 to mid-2012, was transformed into a compelling <italic>directoire</italic> of the EU financial policy. Analytically, it is not clear where to locate the boundary between bilateral leadership on one side and bilateral <italic>directoire</italic> on the other. To be sure, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414013489502">Heipertz and Verdun (2010</xref>, p. 20) argued, “when Member States governments bargain with one another, the largest countries have the greater influence.” Of course, the bilateral leadership of France and Germany has historically represented the engine of the integration process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414013489502">Cole, 2010</xref>). However, their bilateral leadership was not resented by the other member states as long as the two countries, although sharing a strategic goal, “started from quite diverging points when it came to sketching the road toward this common goal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414013489502">Schild, 2010</xref>, p. 1380). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010414013489502">Webber (1999</xref>, p. 16) put it, the greater the divergence between French and German preferences on the policy before reaching a common goal, the easier it was for the other member states to “multilateralize” that common goal.</p>
<p>The deepening of euro crisis prevented this multilateralization for two reasons. First, Merkel’s Germany and Sarkozy’s France came to share the same ends and means for dealing with the crisis. Although France initially used a strategy different from Germany’s, fear of playing victim to market speculations if unprotected by an alliance with Germany brought France closer and closer to the Germany’s restrictive monetary position (no role for the ECB to act as lender of last resort, no Euro-bonds, no expansive policies either at the EU or domestic level). With the coordination of the Brussels office of President Herman van Rompuy, the financial strategy for dealing with the crisis came to be dictated by Berlin and Paris sharing not only the same strategic goals (financial stability and fiscal integration) but also the means (policies) to reach them (the introduction of a balanced budget clause in the constitution of the member states even through a new treaty, domestic structural reforms, fiscal discipline). Second, Sarkozy and Merkel, in their attempt to solve the veto dilemma proper of the intergovernmental method, came to “verticalize” the decision-making process. They regularly met (in Berlin or Paris other than in Brussels) before the European Council meetings to identify common or shared positions that were later imposed in the following formal meeting of the heads of state and governments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0010414013489502">14</xref></sup> Probably, the epitome of this attitude was the meeting between the two leaders in Deauville on December 5, 2011, where they took decisions then reported to the European Council meeting of the following December 8-9. Indeed, it became common to talk in the press of a “Merkozy” government within the European Council. Is a <italic>directoire</italic> compatible with the logic of European integration?</p>
<p>The second is the <italic>enforcement dilemma</italic>: How to guarantee the application of a decision taken on a voluntary bases? The enforcement dilemma emerged dramatically with regard to the approval of the new treaties (the ESM and the Fiscal Compact) by their contracting parties. In fact, to avoid jeopardizing the entire project by the possible rejection of one or another intergovernmental treaty by few of their contracting parties, the Fiscal Compact Treaty (Title VI, Art. 14.2) had to state that it “shall enter to force on 1 January 2013, provided that twelve Contracting Parties whose currency is the euro have deposited their instrument of ratification.” Twelve and not all the 17 member states of the euro-area (that is 70% of the euro-area member states but less than 50% of the 25 states signing the Treaty). It is the first time (in the European integration experience) that unanimity has been eliminated as a barrier for activating an intergovernmental treaty (that would require, by its own logic, the unanimous consent of all the contracting parties). Or, anticipating plausible rejection of the Fiscal Compact Treaty, the ESM Treaty had to state (Point 5) that “the granting of financial assistance . . . will be conditional, as of 1 March 2013, on the ratification of Fiscal Compact Treaty by the ESM Member concerned.” This threat was efficacious in cooling down the euro-skeptical mood of Irish voters (in the referendum on the Fiscal Compact held on May 31, 2012) or the anti-European mood of Greek voters (in the elections of June 2012 that followed the indecisive elections of May 2012). However, in moving in this direction, the intergovernmental logic had not only contradicted itself but also had to introduce explicit threats not properly congenial with “the spirit of solidarity” celebrated by Angela Merkel in her November 2, 2010, speech.</p>
<p>The third is the <italic>compliance dilemma</italic>: Once enforced an agreement, how to guarantee the respect of its rules even when they no longer fit the interest of one or the other of the voluntary contracting parties? This dilemma emerged dramatically in the case of the disrespect of the rules of the SGP. It became apparent in 2009 that Greece cheated the other member states’ governments (manipulating its statistical data regarding public deficit and debt) for remaining in the euro-area. However, the same dilemma emerged in 2003, when France and Germany were saved from sanctions by a decision of the ECOFIN (and in contrast to a Commission’s recommendation) notwithstanding their disrespect for the SGP’s parameters. The Fiscal Compact Treaty tries to deal with the noncompliance possibility providing for a binding and automatic intervention of the ECJ upon those contracting parties that do not respect the agreed rules. It is stated (Art. 8.1) that
<disp-quote>
<p>where a Contracting Party considers, independently of the Commission’s report, that another Contracting Party has failed to comply with Article 3(2), it may also bring the matter before the Court of Justice . . . the judgment of the Court of Justice shall be binding on the parties in the procedure.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This also applies when the Commission issues a report on a contracting party failing to comply with the rules established by the Treaty. In the latter case, if the Commission, after having given the contracting party concerned the opportunity to submit its observations, still confirms the noncompliance by the contracting party in question, the matter will be brought to the ECJ. Art. 17 of the Fiscal Compact Treaty has come to stress that, to neutralize a recommendation of the Commission to intervene against a member state breaching a deficit criteria, “a qualified majority of the member states (should be) opposed to the decision proposed or recommended.” The role of the Commission has thus been strengthened (contrary to the intergovernmental logic), although within the parameters defined by the intergovernmental decisions.</p>
<p>The clause of the reversed qualified majority is an attempt to make less likely noncompliance. Indeed, the discretion of the Council has been reduced (if compared with the rules concerning the SGP institutionalized in the intergovernmental side of the Lisbon Treaty), not only by the Treaty but also by the combination of the Six Pack and Two Pack, recognizing the need to rely on third actors (the ECJ or the Commission) for keeping the contracting parties aligned with the agreed aims of the Treaty. Even the ESM Treaty states that, in case of a dispute between an ESM member and the ESM (Art. 37.2),
<disp-quote>
<p>the dispute shall be submitted to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union shall be binding on the parties in the procedure, which shall take the necessary measures to comply with the judgement within a period to be decided by said Court. (Art. 37.3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the same time, majority voting is extended even in the ESM. In fact, its Board of Directors “shall take decisions by qualified majority, unless otherwise stated in this Treaty” (Art. 6.5). However, because a qualified majority consists of an 80% of the total shares or keys of the Treaty’ stock and having Germany the control of more than 27% of those keys, it will be impossible to have a qualified majority voting (QMV) against Germany. In financial policy, there is a German line that no member state can cross.</p>
<p>However, the various solutions of the noncompliance dilemma seem problematic. It is problematic, in fact, that a new organization (set up by the Fiscal Compact Treaty or ESM Treaty) might use an institution (such as the ECJ) of another organization (the EU of the Lisbon Treaty) to bind its own member states. This may also apply to the technical expertise of the Commission or ECB, upon which both treaties rely (see Art. 17(5) and Art 18(2)). Certainly, the intervention of the ECJ is justified by TFEU, Art. 273, that states as follows: “the Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction in any dispute between Member States which relates to the subject matter of the Treaties if the dispute is submitted to it under a special agreement between the parties.” Nevertheless, the ECJ or the Commission or the ECB are institutions operating within a legal framework defined also by the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic that did not agree upon the Fiscal Compact Treaty that utilizes them. Which are the political, legal, and technical implications of this discrepancy?</p>
<p>If the above dilemmas constrained the effectiveness of the intergovernmental EU (regarding crisis management in the first case and crisis prevention in the other two cases), the latter met also difficult hurdles in dealing with the <italic>legitimacy dilemma</italic>: How to guarantee legitimacy to decisions reached by national executives in the European Council or the ECOFIN Council that were never discussed, let alone approved, by the institution representing the European citizens (the EP)? Indeed, this dilemma became evident as the crisis deepened and the citizens of the indebted member states had to pay high costs for making the necessary structural adjustment of their country possible. Not only did they have to abide by decisions imposed by impersonal financial markets but also, above all, by the ECOFIN Council and the European Council where the national executives of the larger member states (they never voted) played a predominant role. The problem does not concern only the content of the decision but above all the procedure for reaching it. The highly centralized crisis prevention regime, set up during the euro crisis, operates under the control of the larger and creditor member states that impose their criteria to the small and debtor member states. The effects of the intergovernmental centralization are clearly uneven.</p>
<p>Making content analysis of quality newspaper’s articles on the euro crisis in six European countries (Austria, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland) from December 2009 to March 2012, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414013489502">Kriesi and Grande (2012</xref>, p. 19) arrived to the conclusion that “by far the most important individual actor in this (euro crisis, <italic>n.d.r.</italic>) debate was the German Chancellor Angela Merkel . . . followed by the (then) French President Nicolas Sarkozy.” Indeed, the affected citizens have continued to protest against Angela Merkel and not Herman van Rompuy or Manuel Barroso (respectively, president of the European Council and the Commission in the period). This effect has inevitably increased the public perception of the illegitimacy of the intergovernmental decision-making regime. The intergovernmental framework cannot identify a satisfactory solution to this dilemma because it assumes that the legitimacy of the EU derives from the legitimacy of its member states’ governments, as asserted by President Sarkozy in his Toulon speech on December 2, 2011. However, the legitimacy of decisions taken on behalf of the EU cannot be a derivative of the legitimacy enjoyed by the governments of its member states. Decisions made at the EU level would require a legitimizing mechanism at that level, not at the level of its member states. Without a proper involvement of the EP in those decisions, the latter inevitably lacks the justification for being considered legitimate by the European citizens affected by those decisions.</p>

<sec id="section10-0010414013489502">
<title>Reacting to Intergovernmentalism</title>
<p>Facing the German–French slide into the intergovernmental logic, the EP and the Commission started to react, more and more vociferously, to the <italic>directoire</italic> and its lack of legitimacy. Particularly under EP’s pressure, both intergovernmental treaties were subjected to several revisions. The Fiscal Compact Treaty, which passed through five different drafts in less than 2 months (December 8-9, 2011, to January 31, 2012) before a final version was published, was particularly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414013489502">Krellinger, 2012</xref>). In the final version, for instance, it refers to the necessity of applying it (Art. 2.1) “in conformity with the Treaties on which the European Union is founded . . . and with European Union law.” Moreover, because of the EP’s mobilization, the Treaty declares that
<disp-quote>
<p>within five years at most following the entry into force of this Treaty, on the basis of an assessment of the experience with its implementation, the necessary steps shall be taken, in compliance with the provisions of the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, with the aim of incorporating the substance of this Treaty into the legal framework of the European Union. (Art. 16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, the EP was fast to notice, already during the decision to create the ESM Treaty, that the latter “poses a risk to the integrity of the Treaty-based system” of the EU.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0010414013489502">15</xref></sup> At the same time, the supranational institutions’ criticism of the Fiscal Compact Treaty pressured the Treaty’s framers to recognize that the operation of the intergovernmental Summit of the Heads of State and Government should rely on the president of the Commission. As stated in Art. 12(4), “the President of the Euro Summit shall ensure the preparation and continuity of Euro Summits meetings, in close cooperation with the President of the European Commission.”</p>
<p>The Fiscal Compact Treaty has finally arrived to formalize (Art. 10) the possibility for member states whose currency is the euro to recur “to enhanced cooperation as provided for in Article 20 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and in Articles 326 to 334 of the Treaty on the function of the European Union (TFEU),” thus making the new Treaty de facto redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414013489502">Zillier, 2012</xref>). After a long negotiation, the Fiscal Compact Treaty has come to recognize, first, that the Commission’s role in monitoring the excessive deficit’s member states is necessary and, second, that the EP cannot be considered an outsider on par with the EU member states whose currency is not the euro (both conditions absent in the initial announcement of the Fiscal Compact Treaty). However, if the Commission has been finally included in the policy-making process, the EP continues to be kept on the margins. According to Art. 12(5),
<disp-quote>
<p>The President of the European Parliament may be invited to be heard (by the Euro Summit, <italic>n.d.r.</italic>). The President of the Euro Summit shall present a report to the European Parliament after each of the meetings of the Euro Summits.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, the EP has entered the Treaty, but its powers on Euro Summit’s Reports remain undefined. At the same time, the EP is never mentioned in the ESM Treaty. Although the intentions of the German and French promoters of the new treaties were originally much more intergovernmental, the reaction coming from the EP and the Commission has tamed them, but only to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The election in May 2012 of the new French president, Francoise Hollande, brought to a resetting of the relations between France and Germany and more in general to a multilateralization of the decision-making process in financial policy. The new Italian government of Mario Monti (that substituted that of Silvio Berlusconi in November 2011) unmoored Italy from the intergovernmental coalition. Finally, also in Germany, Chancellor Merkel gradually silenced the previous intergovernmental attitude. In a talk given at the Berlin’s <italic>Neues Museum</italic> on February 7, 2012, she indicated the need for “a political union, something that wasn’t done when the euro was launched,” thus stressing the importance of having an effective Commission and a strengthened EP within an established bicameral legislature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414013489502">Peel, 2012</xref>). The distance from the intergovernmental approach was further made explicit in the speech given to the EP on November 8, 2012, when Chancellor Merkel stated that “legitimacy and oversight are to be found on the level where decision are made and implemented. That means that if one of the European level’s competences is strengthened, the role of the European Parliament must also be strengthened,” thus adding “we should not contemplate—as is sometimes suggested—establishing an additional parliamentary institution. The European Parliament is the bedrock.” Finally, the growing isolationism of United Kingdom contributed to the further weakening of the coalition in favor of the intergovernmental approach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0010414013489502">16</xref></sup> Certainly, the popular riots in the streets of many European capitals supported the reaction to intergovernmentalism.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The intergovernmental “moment” has been obfuscated by the euro crisis. The intergovernmental EU, because constrained by its intrinsic logic, has not solved the dilemmas of collective action in an effective and legitimate way. At the origins of the intergovernmental EU, there was the assumption that crucial policies (as the financial one) may be Europeanized only if controlled by the member states’ governments in the European Council and ECOFIN Council. Supranational institutions like the Commission and the ECJ were considered necessary for reducing the transaction costs of the intergovernmental negotiation, but not for making more effective the decision-making process. The euro crisis has shown that this assumption is unwarranted. The intergovernmental EU had not only difficulty in taking timing decision of crisis management, but it had also to rely more and more on the discretion of those supranational institutions for making credible commitments of crisis prevention. It is largely credited, for instance, that it was the supranational ECB that induced a reduction of the spread between Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish public bonds and German bonds, with the declaration its president Mario Draghi in London on July 26, 2012 that he was “ready to do whatever it takes” for saving the euro. At the same time, the euro crisis has also shown that indirect legitimacy is insufficient for justifying decisions taken at the level and on behalf of the Union.</p>
<p>To have shown the limits of the intergovernmental EU in dealing with the euro crisis does not imply, <italic>a contrario</italic>, that the supranational EU would have fared better if allowed to deal with economic and financial policies. The supranational EU does not have the resources and powers for advancing an alternative model of economic governance: It has not an independent budget or fiscal capacity (based on European taxes and not member states’ financial transfer), nor a Treasury able to use it for anticyclical policies, nor a legislature with the tools of scrutiny and control on the latter. The euro crisis has called into question the viability of the Maastricht compromise as constitutionalized in and by the Lisbon Treaty. To bring the new intergovernmental treaties back into the Lisbon Treaty will not seem to be a solution. The future of the EU will depend on its capacity to find a renewed balance between intergovernmental and supranational institutions even in those crucial policies as the financial, budgetary, and fiscal ones.</p>

<p>The Lisbon Treaty is constituted of the amendments to the two consolidated treaties, the Treaty on the European Union or TUE of 1992 and the Treaty on the European Community, signed originally in Rome in 1957 and redefined in Amsterdam in 1997, renamed as Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFUE), plus the Declaration concerning the Charter of Fundamental Rights considered de facto as a third treaty.</p>

<p>It should be stressed that the Lisbon Treaty does not apportion the 751 seats (starting with the elections of 2014) of the EP strictly according to the population of the member states. Indeed (a) a minimum of 6 EP seats are assigned to each member states (162 seats); (b) the remaining 589 seats are assigned to member states in proportion to their population; (c) the larger member state (Germany) can obtain a maximum of 96 seats. This electoral criteria is known as degressive proportionality.</p>

<p>In a famous 1997 statement, the new leader of the SPD (Social-democratic Party) Gerhard Schroeder said, “Kohl says the Germans have to be tied into Europe or they will stir up old fears of the ‘furum teutonicus.’ I say that’s not the case. I believe that Germans have become European not because they have to be, but because they want to be. That is the difference” (now in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414013489502">Sloam, 2005</xref>, p. 89).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that, while the Lisbon Treaty (TUE, Art. 15.3) states that “the European Council shall meet twice every six months,” in the 2010 it met 6 times (8 times if one considers two meeting of the Euro-area member states’ heads of government), in 2011 it met 7 times (9 times if one considers also the meetings of the Euro-area member states’ heads of government) and in 2012 it met 6 times, any time followed by a meeting of the euro-area member states’ heads of state and government.</p>

<p>The Conclusions of the European Council of March 24-25, 2011, states, “The ESM will have a Board of Governors consisting of the Ministers of Finance of the euro-area Member States (as voting members), with the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the President of the ECB as observers. The Board of Directors will elect a Chairperson from among its voting members . . . The ESM will have a Board of Directors which will carry out specific tasks as delegated by the Board of Governors . . . All decisions by the Board of Directors will be taken by qualified majority . . . A qualified majority is defined as 80 percent of the votes” (<italic>EUCO 10/11, Concl 3</italic>, pp. 22-23).</p>

<p>It is worthwhile to read the chronicles of the preparation of the various European Council held into 2011 by Peter Ludlow with their detailed description of the triangulation between chancellor Angela Merkel and her staff, president Nicolas Sarkozy and his staff, and the office of president Herman Van Rompuy.

<p>The <italic>European Union Act</italic>, enacted in United Kingdom on July 19, 2011, calls even into question the constitutionalization of the EU brought about by the ECJ’s decisions of the 1960s on direct effect and supremacy of Community law. Indeed, it states that “there are no circumstances in which the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice can elevate Community Law to a status within the corpus of English domestic law to which it could not aspire by any route of English law itself . . . The conditions of Parliament’s legislative supremacy in the United Kingdom necessarily remain in the United Kingdom’s hands.”</p>
