<body>
<p>Human temporal bones provide an important resource for the study of inner ear pathology. Unfortunately, there are only a few remaining temporal bone laboratories worldwide with a sufficient number of specimens for further study. This has a serious impact on both research collaboration and training of future researchers. Such difficulties may be partially overcome by using remote access microscopy via a virtual network of temporal bone pathology laboratories.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to present a low-cost telepathology network for both diagnostic and educational purposes.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599813477840" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>For the purposes of a temporal bone histopathology study at the University College London (UCL) Ear Institute, we set up a low-cost telepathology system/network with which MSc students at the UCL Ear Institute (London, UK) could have live remote sessions with their supervisor (1st University Department of Otolaryngology, Athens, Greece) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813477840"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Ethics approval was not required because of the nature of the study, which was performed on archival material and covered by an ongoing license from the Human Tissue Act.</p>

</fig>
<p>A Zeiss optical microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) with a standard digital camera was used for image capture. The digital image was finally projected onto a desktop screen through the AxioVision software, provided with the microscope. TeamViewer (Tampa, Florida) was used as a freeware to share the images with the distant computer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813477840"><bold>Figures 1</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813477840"><bold>2</bold></xref>), whereas verbal communication was also feasible through TeamViewer or Skype VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) application.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Commercial telepathology systems are extremely expensive, especially those involving digital cameras fixed on robotic microscopes or the combination of digital cameras and microscopes with teleconferencing software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813477840">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813477840"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813477840"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813477840"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477840">5</xref></sup> We have, therefore, set up a low-cost telepathology network, which allowed remote supervision of MSc research projects on temporal bone histopathology.</p>
<p>The image resolution provided is lower compared with that of a commercial telepathology system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813477840">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477840">5</xref></sup> However, the proposed setup is definitely functional and quite reliable, providing the researchers with pictures of satisfactory quality and resolution on a low-cost basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813477840"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Some crucial issues must also be taken into account with regard to the real benefits and the possible limitations of such a low-cost network:</p>
<sec id="section3-0194599813477840">
<title>Ethical/Legal Considerations</title>
<p>The UCL Human Temporal Bone Pathology Collection has adopted an archival numbering system, and hence no patient-related information was transmitted over the Internet during the research project. Similarly, archiving information from the US temporal bone laboratories is currently available on the Internet and usually includes non–patient-related data regarding diagnosis, the location of the specimen, and a case-identifier code for the glass slide studied (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research.meei.harvard.edu/Otopathology/tbimages/tbdb.html">http://research.meei.harvard.edu/Otopathology/tbimages/tbdb.html</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Our laboratory has also obtained a license from the Human Tissue Act in UK, and similar licenses are known to be available in other temporal bone laboratories. Hence, a global network connecting the few remaining temporal bone laboratories via remote access microscopy settings is technically and legally feasible, provided that all required licenses are obtained and patient-related information is strictly maintained in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>Free access to the Internet, required by both TeamViewer and Skype software, can be achieved via exception rules, usually supported by most firewalls. TeamViewer’s access to the remote computer connected to the hospital server system is also password protected and provided only to authorized personnel/registered researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599813477840">
<title>Financial Considerations</title>
<p>Most of the equipment used in the basic setup described is already available in the majority of temporal bone laboratories. Although freeware editions of software were actually used in our project, we suggest that institutional licenses for software and applications involved should be purchased, given the low cost and great advantages of the full versions: Skype Premium version enables group video calling, group screen sharing, conference calls, and video/audio calls with a total cost of $4.49/month. TeamViewer Premium license supports remote access, remote control sessions/meetings from an unlimited number of workstations, file transfer, remote printing, and installation on server operating systems, with a total cost of $998/year. All those advanced features can obviously provide a fully functional global network with interactive participation of all registered workstations. The total cost reaches $3200 excluding the microscope. On the contrary, the cost of an average commercial telepathology system varies between $140,706 and $234,510.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477840">5</xref></sup>
</p>

<sec id="section5-0194599813477840">
<title>Political Considerations</title>
<p>The shrinking number of active temporal bone histopathology laboratories and experienced otopathologists provides the rationale for a global network. Setting up a network of remote workstations is now more than feasible given the advances of new software and computer applications, which were made during the past decade toward interactive teleconference and file transfer/sharing. Although the vast majority of certified laboratories are fully equipped, collaboration of such stations for both diagnostic and educational purposes is far from being considered a routine procedure. Therefore, valuable archived material is actually studied by a few researchers instead of being used for interactive teamwork of otopathologists around the globe. Since the cost of such a network is actually very low, the need for institutional agreements toward a virtual global otopathology laboratory is now more than evident. Planned multicenter research projects running under the auspices of certified institutions, with respect to all ethical or legal issues that would obviously arise, could turn the traditional static glass slide to a dynamic research material, accessible by every registered otopathologist.</p>
