<abstract>
<p>This article focuses on cosmopolitanism as an object of sociological analysis, through an empirical study of Canadian development workers who were posted in Pakistan for extended periods of time and have subsequently resumed their lives in Canada. These global migrants developed various attachments to Pakistani culture and people through their transnational experiences. Employing a continuum of cosmopolitanism, the article describes these attachments, which, it argues, form the basis of a tentative and ambivalent culture of cosmopolitanism as it is lived by these development workers on their return to Canada. The study’s aim is to clarify the concept of cosmopolitanism by documenting the emergence of a new sociality characterized by global connectivities that engender justice-oriented alliances and solidarities.</p>

<p>Nous nous intéressons dans cet article au cosmopolitanisme en tant qu’objet d’analyse sociologique. Nous le faisons à partir d’une étude empirique sur des coopérants canadiens qui ont été en poste au Pakistan pendant des périodes prolongées et sont par la suite revenus vivre au Canada. À travers leurs expériences transnationales, ces migrants de l’ère globale ont développé différentes formes d’attachement à la culture et au peuple pakistanais. En nous fondant sur un continuum du cosmopolitanisme, nous décrivons ces divers attachements qui forment à notre avis la base d’une culture expérimentale et ambivalente du cosmopolitanisme tel qu’il est vécu par ces coopérants à leur retour au Canada. Notre objectif est d’éclaircir la notion de cosmopolitanisme en démontrant l’émergence d’une nouvelle socialité caractérisée par des connectivités mondiales qui génèrent des alliances et des solidarités axées sur la justice.</p>

<p><bold>Cooperantes canadienses, encuentros transnacionales y culturas de cosmopolitismo</bold></p>
<p>Este artículo se centra en el cosmopolitismo como un objeto de análisis sociológico. Ello se hace a través de un estudio empírico de los cooperantes canadienses que fueron destinados en Pakistán durante largos periodos de tiempo y luego han retomado sus vidas en Canadá. Estos migrantes globales desarrollaron varios vínculos con la cultura y las gentes de Pakistán a través de sus experiencias trasnacionales. Empleando un continuum de cosmopolitismo, se describen estos vínculos, los cuales son explicados a partir de una tentativa y ambivalente cultura del cosmopolitismo, tal como es vivida por esos cooperantes a su regreso a Canadá. Mi objetivo es clarificar el concepto de cosmopolitismo documentando la emergencia de una nueva sociabilidad caracterizada por conexiones globales que engendran alianzas y solidaridades orientadas por la noción de justicia.</p>

<p>Cosmopolitanism is no longer a dream but has become a social reality, however distorted, which needs to be explored. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423053">Beck, 2006</xref>: 44)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ulrich Beck argues that we are currently witnessing the ‘cosmopolitanization of reality’ at the local scale of lifeworlds and social institutions alongside the global scale of transnational organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423053">Beck, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423053">2006</xref>). He understands this as a profound ontological change characterized by ‘new transnational forms of living and communicating, new ascriptions and responsibilities, new ways to see self and others in the context of global interdependence’ (2004: 430). For him, cosmopolitanization is a consequence of cross-cultural dialogue and mutual interference in daily life. It is also generated as the lives of local social actors become increasingly intertwined with actors beyond their national borders, as well as through a growing non-hierarchical acceptance of otherness, leading to a crisis in the legitimacy of xenophobic and exclusionary national politics.</p>
<p>Beck’s work is part of a field of cosmopolitanism research that has been largely preoccupied with theorizing the cosmopolitanization of reality by elaborating the definition of cosmopolitanism, separating out its normative and analytical dimensions and delineating its consequences. That field has recently expanded to include research that tackles cosmopolitanism at a more concrete level by specifying, through empirical studies, its operations and features that manifest intimately in individual lives to produce this new sociality. Detailing cosmopolitanism in everyday life enriches understandings of the multifaceted dynamics and meanings of these social processes, which entail a plurality of scalar interdependencies.</p>
<p>I contribute to this burgeoning literature through a study of Canadian development workers who were posted in Pakistan for extended periods of time and have subsequently resumed their lives in Canada. My objectives are to explore how cosmopolitanism manifests among my research participants upon their return home and what those dynamics tell us about the nature of cosmopolitanism. I argue that these global migrants developed various attachments to Pakistani culture and people through their transnational experiences, which form the basis of a tentative and ambivalent culture of cosmopolitanism as they live it in Canada. I show that this process produces new subjectivities, political forms and connectivities between the local and the global.</p>
<p>This analysis is developed in the remainder of the article, which has three main sections. In the first, I outline the ways in which cosmopolitanism is conceptualized in the literature, focusing on its cultural rendering to develop a framework for mapping the cosmopolitan moment in everyday life. I rely on Victor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0268580911423053">Roudometof’s (2005)</xref> work, which offers a robust analytic tool for this type of tracing. He differentiates processes of globalization, transnationalism and cosmopolitanism, and then develops a continuum of cosmopolitanism characterized by categories of ‘degrees of attachment’. The second section delineates the methodological framing of the project. The article’s final section analyses how my research participants fall along a continuum of cosmopolitanism after living in Pakistan for extended periods of time. I describe the degrees of their attachment to four dimensions of social life that form the basis of a culture of cosmopolitanism in Canada among these returned development workers. Few participants developed unambiguously cosmopolitan attitudes. While those attitudes are widespread, local orientations are also common, which positions these development workers across the cosmopolitan continuum as a group and as individuals. I end by identifying tentative shifts in social relations that these cosmopolitan orientations engender.</p>
<p>In detailing the increasingly transnational character of everyday life for these Canadians, the article maps the cosmopolitanization of their lives, and in so doing augments current understandings of the parameters of a culture of cosmopolitanism in Canada. The culture of cosmopolitanism that develops among these mobile Northern professionals, who have access to considerable resources, is elite in nature. It is a classed formation that, while produced through similar processes of transcultural engagement, differs in form and mechanics from the cosmopolitan cultures of immigrants, refugees, migrant laborers and the local others these Canadians encountered in Pakistan. The article also achieves a political objective. By delineating this particularly classed culture of cosmopolitanism, I provide some insight into ‘how we as human beings and diverse and conflicting cultures in the context of huge disparities of power and wealth learn to identify (and make common cause) with others (locally and transnationally) through political involvement and action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0268580911423053">Roman, 2006</xref>: 366).</p>

<title>What is cosmopolitanism?</title>
<p>The term cosmopolitanism has a long and complex history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0268580911423053">1</xref></sup> Recently it has regained rhetorical currency among social scientists concerned with a range of processes that currently threaten the fate of human collectivities: ethnic and regional chauvinism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0268580911423053">Turner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0268580911423053">Van der Veer, 2002</xref>), extreme nationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580911423053">Pollock et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423053">Robbins, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0268580911423053">Roudometof, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0268580911423053">Szerszynski and Urry, 2002</xref>), religious intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423053">Calhoun, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423053">Fine, 2003</xref>), a lack of social and ethical responsibility to strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423053">Appiah, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423053">Calhoun, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423053">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580911423053">Featherstone, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580911423053">Fine and Cohen, 2002</xref>), the unequal global distribution of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423053">De Sousa Santos, 2006</xref>) and waning democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423053">Calhoun, 2001</xref>). These concerns, combined with anxieties about the American ‘war on terror’ and other Bush-era foreign policy agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423053">Calhoun, 2002</xref>), account for renewed interest in cosmopolitanism as a vehicle for encouraging solidarity among strangers, generating cultural translatability and achieving global peace and justice.</p>
<p>The term also has a wide range of meanings, which can be typologized into three ‘visions’ of cosmopolitanism: normative, political and cultural.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0268580911423053">2</xref></sup> Cultural approaches – developed primarily by anthropologists, sociologists and geographers – foreground shifting cultural patterns of life that throw into question the territorially given nature of the social. Patterns of interest include people’s greater tolerance, empathy and respect for other cultures and values, their cultural competencies and their desire and ability to communicate cross-culturally. This banal cosmopolitanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423053">Beck, 2002</xref>) entails a range of cultural dispositions that scholars claim can transform subjectivities, forge bonds of reciprocal commitment and responsibility across borders and generate attachments between the local and the global (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580911423053">Breckenridge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580911423053">Cheah and Robbins, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580911423053">Clifford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580911423053">Delanty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423053">Fine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0268580911423053">Kurasawa, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0268580911423053">Vertovec and Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0268580911423053">Werbner, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>Others caution against rosy treatments of cultural cosmopolitanism. Craig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423053">Calhoun (2001)</xref>, for instance, situates cosmopolitanism in projects of empire and capitalism, thereby challenging its emancipatory potential and questioning the nature and scope of participants. Relatedly, cosmopolitanism is critiqued as a form of colonialism that translates otherness into western idioms to facilitate an improving conversion of the local other into the western universal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0268580911423053">Van der Veer, 2002</xref>). Most treatments also lack an explicit analysis of class, gender and sexuality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0268580911423053">Werbner’s (1999)</xref> work, as a notable exception, delineates cosmopolitanism as a classed phenomenon in which working-class labor migrants and business elites, through similar processes of cultural openness, produce different forms of transcultural hybridization. Although women throughout the last century, due to their social positioning, were more likely than men to engage in consumer culture and the allure of elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423053">Nava, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0268580911423053">2006</xref>), androcentric theorizing characterizes cosmopolitanism as masculine agency, ‘an individual who has the ability to live anywhere and the capacity to tolerate and understand the barbarism of others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0268580911423053">Sichone, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0268580911423053">Stivens, 2008</xref>: 88). Ulf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0268580911423053">Hannerz’s (1996)</xref> emphasis on ‘the cosmopolitan’ – a cultural travelling type distinguishable from tourists, migrants and refugees – is consequently criticized for implying an elite white man whose privilege allows for multiple opportunities abroad and whose ‘openness’ manifests in particular social distinctions and dispositions that often perpetuate capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0268580911423053">Matthew and Sidhu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0268580911423053">Sklair, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0268580911423053">Turner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0268580911423053">Van der Veer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0268580911423053">Venn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0268580911423053">Wilson, 1998</xref>). Moreover, invoking a subject who is ‘open to difference’ posits a humanist self that is transparent, accessible and fully intelligible to both selves and others, despite widespread recognition that similarity and difference are context dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580911423053">Hawkins, 2010</xref>) and not self-evident, mutually recognizable and somehow the property of individual social actors. Finally, critics warn that cosmopolitanism has enemies in the forces of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423053">McRobbie, 2006</xref>) and the ‘war on terror’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423053">Calhoun, 2002</xref>), in accompanying operations of disciplinary power and in the many mobile individuals who cross borders but remain in self-contained enclaves of likeness, eschewing transnational encounters and dialogic imaginings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580911423053">Clifford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0268580911423053">Matthews and Sidhu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0268580911423053">Werbner, 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>To clarify the character of cosmopolitanism, scholars have begun to analyse cultures of cosmopolitanism at the concrete level of everyday life in a range of geographical locales using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Despite this substantial body of literature, there is little agreement on how best to operationalize cosmopolitanism in empirical studies. Authors variously (and often concurrently) conceptualize cosmopolitanism as: (a) a set of identities (‘the cosmopolitan’ and ‘the local’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423053">Calcutt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0268580911423053">Latham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423053">Olofsson and Öhman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580911423053">Pichler, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423053">2009</xref>); (b) a set of attitudes that includes a recognition of others’ values, an open and tolerant worldview, a willingness to accommodate others and support for global governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423053">Calcutt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423053">Gustafson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580911423053">Mau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580911423053">Molz, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423053">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423053">Notar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580911423053">Phillips and Smith, 2008</xref>); (c) a sense of belonging and closeness to the world as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580911423053">Landau and Freemantle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0268580911423053">Schueth and O’Loughlin, 2007</xref>); and (d) a set of cultural competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0268580911423053">Lamont and Aksartova, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423053">Pécoud, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580911423053">Pichler, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423053">2009</xref>). Most of them foreground ‘openness’ as a key feature of cosmopolitanism, while a few focus on ‘the cosmopolitan’ as a fundamental identity. These two problems combine to prevent most studies from examining the ways in which people can be locally and globally situated simultaneously (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423053">Gustafson, 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to Victor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0268580911423053">Roudometof’s (2005)</xref> work, which provides a less problematic operationalization of cosmopolitanism, as well as an analytic tool for mapping the cosmopolitan moment in the context of everyday life.</p>
<p>Roudometof differentiates processes of globalization, transnationalism and cosmopolitanism, and then develops a continuum of cosmopolitanism characterized by categories of ‘degrees of attachment’. He defines globalization as the processes at work in daily life that undermine national borders. Transnationalism is the social reality engendered under conditions of globalization. It does not refer to people’s feelings or attitudes. Rather, it involves three developments: transnational spaces in which people’s transnational encounters occur, the actual interactions and practices performed in these spaces and transnational communities composed of different groups of global migrants. Finally, cosmopolitanism describes the feelings, attitudes and values that result from transnationalism, without the necessity of global travel.</p>
<p>Because transnationalism plays out at many different levels, Roudometof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0268580911423053">2005</xref>: 127) argues that we are likely to observe:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . a bifurcation of attitudes among the public. Faced with the reality of transnational experience, members of the public might opt for an open attitude welcoming the new experiences or they might opt for a defensive closed attitude seeking to limit the extent to which transnational social spaces penetrate their cultural milieu. In the first instance, we speak of cosmopolitans, while in the second we speak of locals. However, instead of thinking of these two categories as discontinuous variables, I suggest that most people are likely to develop highly complex attitudes with regard to the two alternatives, and, therefore, it is better to conceptualize the two categories as forming a single continuum. Individuals might take different positions within this continuum, but their choices should vary along several dimensions that dictate the basic features of the two categories.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I avoid the terms ‘locals’ and ‘cosmopolitans’, with their classed and gendered associations, by employing local and cosmopolitan ‘orientations’ as the ideal types on the ends of this continuum. Rather than assume that a cosmopolitan orientation necessarily results from transnational experience, we can more realistically expect that individuals develop a complex combination of cosmopolitan and local attitudes, values and predispositions through their engagements in transnational spaces. Consequently, attitudes will not usually cluster at the ends of the continuum.</p>
<p>Others support Roudometof’s reasoning that transnational experience will likely produce both cosmopolitan and local attitudes due to its differing effects on different people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0268580911423053">Hannerz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580911423053">Kwok-Bun, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0268580911423053">Tarrow, 2005</xref>). They call for empirical studies that investigate this relationship more definitively. Quantitative studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423053">Gustafson (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580911423053">Mau et al. (2008)</xref> tackle this challenge by examining the relationship between transnational engagements and cosmopolitan orientations using Swedish and German survey data respectively. Both studies found that transnational activities are strongly associated with cosmopolitan values, even when controlling for gender, age, birthplace, place of residence, education and socioeconomic classification, <italic>with no accompanying decline in local orientations</italic>. Authors demonstrate a clear (but not absolute) correlation. However, they cannot explain it or determine the causal direction of influence due to the type of data used. They propose a strong causal pathway from transnational experience to cosmopolitan orientation, rather than the reverse, but agree that the relationship is mutually constitutive, that a cosmopolitan orientation may also lead people to seek out engagements in transnational spaces. These studies suggest that the relationship between transnational engagements and cosmopolitan orientations is highly complex. Not only does transnational experience take many forms, it can also be both a cause and effect of cosmopolitanism, but not necessarily. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423053">Gustafson (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580911423053">Mau et al. (2008)</xref> urge researchers to conduct further studies that illuminate this multifaceted relationship, as well as the coexistence of cosmopolitan and local attitudes. I undertake these tasks in the empirical portion of this article.</p>
<p>If the poles that define Roudometof’s continuum are local and cosmopolitan orientations, then what are their features that can be plotted to chart a culture of cosmopolitanism? Roudometof suggests focusing on degrees of attachments to important dimensions of social life. He delineates four such attachments: to a native country, to a specific locality, to local culture and to national protectionism. Locally oriented people, in this scheme, value being a citizen of a particular state, rather than being part of a global citizenry. A cosmopolitan orientation separates ‘home’ from where a person lives, disrupting the notion of locality as a physical place, whereas a local orientation values attachment to a neighborhood or city. Local and cosmopolitan orientations also diverge in attachments to local culture, including religion and language, demonstrating a connection to their cultural roots or, conversely, a dedication to cultural pluralism. A particular ‘structure of feeling’ is also relevant to this aspect of a cosmopolitan orientation: the allure of elsewhere, an urge to experience another culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423053">Nava, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0268580911423053">Stivens, 2008</xref>). Finally, these orientations differ in their stance on institutional protectionism at the national level, with the local supporting economic tariffs on imports and efforts to enhance national security, and the cosmopolitan encouraging international engagements and global migrations for work or more fulfilling lifestyles.</p>
<p>In Kantian philosophy, cosmopolitanism is understood as antithetical to an attachment to the local, which is conceived as a precondition for ethnic conflict. Roudometof’s continuum does not imply that a connection to the local is inherently chauvinistic. Rather, by foregrounding degrees of attachments, it allows that people may retain local loyalties as they develop a social imaginary organized around global interdependence that is ‘rooted’ in local lifeworlds. The Guatemalan diaspora in San Francisco, for example, develops a social imagination that ‘acknowledges the local and particular in a framework of shared values about what it means to be human’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423053">Delugan, 2010</xref>: 83).</p>
<p>Roudometof’s continuum is a useful analytic tool in three additional ways. First, by operationalizing cosmopolitanism as clusters of attitudes, values and predispositions that are engendered under conditions of transnationalism, it bypasses the notion of a cultural disposition of ‘openness’. Second, using the concept of attachments, it documents and explains why some people who have transnational experiences do not develop a cosmopolitan orientation. Third, it produces a nuanced mapping of a culture of cosmopolitanism that plots different degrees of cosmopolitan and local attitudes and inconsistencies among them. Once I delineate the methodological framing of my research project, I use this continuum to map the degrees of attachments that form the basis of a tentative and ambivalent culture of cosmopolitanism among an elite group of Canadian development workers who have lived in Pakistan for extended periods of time.</p>

<title>The study</title>
<p>Between January and July 2005, I conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with 31 development workers from across Canada. I began recruiting them using email messages, which I sent to the Canadian head offices of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the International Development Research Center, OXFAM, the Aga Khan Foundation and World Vision. These organizations distributed an electronic recruitment letter to everyone on their contact lists, which described the research as an effort to understand how their experiences of living abroad had affected their personal and work lives since returning home. Beyond this description, the letter stipulated that I was looking for professionals currently residing in Canada who had held development positions in either a governmental or non-governmental organization in Pakistan for at least one year.</p>
<p>My interest in professional Canadian development workers with experience in Pakistan developed from previous ethnographic research with white women working in northern Pakistan as development volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423053">Cook, 2007</xref>). I investigated how these transnational migrants constructed lives for themselves in this unfamiliar social and labor context. I was disappointed to find little evidence of cross-cultural dialogue and acceptance of otherness among these long-term volunteers. More often hierarchical difference structured their engagements with Pakistanis. That study, which was limited to exploring volunteers’ lives in Pakistan, precluded an understanding of what participants took away from these experiences after they were distanced from the everyday challenges of making a life abroad. My current project addresses this gap, while also focusing on professionals who are specifically trained for international development work and consequently may have different transcultural experiences than volunteers.</p>
<p>In the recruitment letter, I requested that prospective participants contact me by email. Within three weeks, eight interested people responded to negotiate interview logistics. I learned during my previous study that development workers in Pakistan often construct tightly knit communities while they are living abroad, so I made use of these webs of social relations by employing a snowball sampling strategy to identify and gain access to additional participants. These eight people furnished me with enough introductions to eventually enlist 31 participants who varied by age, gender, profession and development work experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0268580911423053">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Each interview lasted for approximately three hours and was directed by an interview guide. But conversations were structured to be flexible, leaving room for participants to choose discussion issues and directions. I spoke with them in their homes or offices, and sometimes in public places like coffee shops. I analysed the verbatim transcripts using standard qualitative open coding techniques to inductively identify recurring themes related to the cosmopolitanization of daily life. While I did not structure interview guide questions around Roudometof’s notion of degrees of attachment, inductively derived themes closely corresponded to that rubric, which I then used to typologize the data.</p>

<sec id="section3-0268580911423053">
<title>Degrees of attachment</title>
<p>Most participants initially struggled to articulate how their lives in Canada are marked by their transnational encounters abroad. Everyone agreed that these experiences profoundly affected who they are and what they think is important, but tracing their effects on everyday existence was challenging. No one had considered the question. They more effortlessly described their experiences of living and working in Pakistan, a country that emerged out of the traumatic dissolution of the Raj and has since struggled with indeterminate borders, civil war, military coups, political corruption and international intervention. Their musings on why they undertook development work in Pakistan, what they experienced and learned and who they encountered provided a productive grounding for subsequent reflections on how their daily lives in Canada are marked by these transnational encounters. Informal interview conversations served as incitements to reflection, showing that local and cosmopolitan orientations in this group are not transparent and self-evident, but through mindful deliberation and narrative accounting can be fairly clearly articulated.</p>
<p>In thinking through the impact of global mobility on ‘home’ life in Canada, my participants often anticipate Roudometof’s claim that transnational travel is not the only route to transnational experience and ensuing cosmopolitan attitudes. Indeed, Anita,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0268580911423053">4</xref></sup> a 57-year-old professor of nursing who spent three years developing programs for women health professionals at the Aga Khan University in Karachi, claims that ‘Being exposed to cultures in your own society, as opposed to going abroad and experiencing that culture as a foreigner there, that’s even <italic>more</italic> changing, initiates more development internally, and more empathy between cultures’. Drawing on his three-year experience as a development program coordinator in Islamabad, Mark agrees that ‘the main way and most <italic>effective</italic> way that a lot of Canadians will experience Pakistani culture is seeing it here on more of a day-to-day basis’. According to Anita and Mark, transnational interactions in local transnational spaces, which are sustained and often unavoidable, are more likely to effect local transformation of a cosmopolitan nature than overseas experiences. Many participants also question the claim that global travel necessarily leads to a cosmopolitan orientation. Karl, a multilingual water engineer, encountered ‘some development workers who embraced that cross-cultural opportunity and those who shut themselves off from it, who can live abroad for two years or five years and not have gained anything from the experience, who have just been there and sought as many ways to recreate their home world wherever they happen to be’, constructing what Joseph calls ‘home facsimiles abroad’. Mary assumes that the same affinity to locality, which she also witnessed among a couple of her CIDA peers in Islamabad, is at work in Canada: ‘We have a very, you know, diversified population right here in Canada, but the same people who are closed to the idea of travelling to developing countries are also probably closed to interacting with people from other cultural backgrounds here in Canada.’</p>
<p>Mary astutely differentiates local and cosmopolitan orientations, but implies they are mutually exclusive. The development workers in this study pursued opportunities for travel to the global South. However, not all of them developed unambiguously cosmopolitan attitudes and values. While those attitudes are certainly widespread and often fervent, local orientations are also common, which positions these development workers across the cosmopolitan continuum as a group and as individuals.</p>
<sec id="section4-0268580911423053">
<title>Attachment to nation</title>
<p>Participants’ unmistakable lack of exclusive attachment to Canada and their Canadian citizenship perhaps best illustrates a robust cosmopolitan orientation. No one clings to a self-evident ‘Canadianness’. Rather, like Isabel, they find themselves asking ‘what does it mean to be Canadian and what does it mean to go and work overseas and for how long? When I was in Pakistan I reflected a lot on my politics of my nationality. What is nationality really and why is that important? You know these boundaries, sometimes we like them and sometimes we don’t.’ Mark goes further, saying that ‘overseas work experiences help me see the importance of thinking of ourselves as <italic>global</italic> citizens, of the value and benefits of sort of seeking out, enjoying and benefiting from cross-cultural relations. I mean I tap into something that’s larger than where I come from. It’s very positive for me.’ Global citizenship is also positive for Laurie: ‘I love aspects of Canada, no question about it. But I just don’t love a steady diet of it!’ After working for four years as an environmental consultant, Frank suspects that if he had moved ‘into a UN position and got on that career track, I probably would still be out there. I would be even less attached to Canada. I’ve talked to some people who have done this, and none of us think of ourselves as purely Canadian anymore.’ At the most extreme, Michael, who appreciates the privileges that accompany a Canadian upbringing in a white middle-class household, characterizes himself at several points in our interview as Pakistani: ‘I was born in Karachi and 50 years later I went back. I don’t have a living memory of it because I was just a tot when I left. . . . Most people we knew in Karachi were immigrants or refugees who came in the aftermath of Partition. So, often I was the only Pakistani in the group.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0268580911423053">
<title>Attachment to locality</title>
<p>While most participants clearly articulate a lack of exclusive attachment to Canada, the overwhelming majority did not explicitly refer to the more micro scale of locality in terms either of attachment or detachment. For those CIDA employees and professors of nursing who first encountered Pakistan during multiple short-term work junkets, followed by an extended sojourn of several years, ‘home’ remained the neighborhoods and cities they temporarily left behind. Even though none of them said they were homesick abroad, on return they settled back comfortably into the rhythms, if not always the preoccupations, of local life. Five participants are notable exceptions in that they describe alienating feelings of detachment from locality. During a ‘home leave’ to Canada, Mark’s four-year-old daughter broke down, crying ‘I want to go home! I want to go home to Pakistan’, a longing Mark optimistically interprets as an expanded sense of home and global belonging. Less sanguinely, after more than five years of result-based management work for the Aga Khan Foundation in Islamabad, George doesn’t ‘feel at home anywhere now. I don’t know why, it’s a curse. So when I’m travelling sometimes I’m acutely aware that this isn’t where I actually belong but I have to fit in and function. And then when I go to a shopping mall or something here, I’m like my god, this isn’t my home either! So, yeah, I don’t really feel like I fit in anywhere.’ Wendy’s troubling feelings help her empathize with newcomers to Canada: ‘I have two Egyptian friends who are struggling with depression because of their trials and tribulations with immigration. . . . They’re caught between places, and may never be able to cope or belong in either of them. And after my experiences overseas, I’m displaced myself, feeling like I’m living in a couple of different places at the same time. So I kind of relate to how they feel.’ Helen and Andrea experience a detachment from local preoccupations, rather than from unsettled experiences of home. For Helen, ‘worrying about kids’ soccer seems inconsequential compared to issues of world poverty and injustice’, while Andrea is frustrated with people who are ‘more interested in things happening in their own neighborhood than they are about the whole world, like what the inside of our church looks like, you know, trying to make yourself perfect within some local organization and forgetting about a wider social responsibility completely’.</p>

<sec id="section6-0268580911423053">
<title>Attachment to local culture</title>
<p>When it comes to loyalties to local culture, a dialogic imagination and cosmopolitan orientation that values cultural pluralism are almost ubiquitous among participants. Jean senses her ‘old [ethnocentric] foundation shifting’ as she ‘goes with the cultural flow’ of Pakistan, making her what Michael calls ‘culturally street smart’. Although ‘going with the flow’ may imply a degree of passivity, everyone expressed a ‘sheer fascination for new places’ (Frank) and an urge to engage different cultural circumstances. Martin adeptly describes this impulse to go abroad: ‘I’m interested in learning languages and history and meeting new people, experiencing new cultures. . . . It’s the <italic>thrill</italic> of going somewhere else, living in a different culture and learning about it.’ This desire for cultural difference leads George to characterize Vancouver, a city most Canadians view as a cultural mélange, as ‘just kind of monotone. There’s just not enough diversity, not enough richness. I have these yearnings to go again where I’m exposed to neat places, and where I’m put outside my element, put outside my comfort zone. I really enjoy that and find it really rewarding, and I learn a lot from it.’</p>
<p>Although others struggled to find the time, Wendy, Martin and Ellen devoted themselves to learning a local language in Pakistan, acknowledging that linguistic abilities enabled them to ‘connect better with people’ (Ellen). Except for two, all the women (but none of the men) wore <italic>shalwar kameez</italic>, the national dress of Pakistan that comprises a long tunic over loose pyjama trousers, with the addition, for women, of a long scarf that drapes over the shoulders. Even though the dominant discourse in the West represents <italic>shalwar kameez</italic> for women as ‘oppressive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423053">Cook, 2005</xref>), Andrea ‘found it quite the opposite. I found it very liberating. It’s a great class equalizer.’ Participants also learned to appreciate Pakistan’s rich, vibrant and ancient culture, as well as Pakistanis’ talents as problem solvers and creative adaptors who do well with the limited resources at their disposal. But two aspects of their cultural engagement with Pakistan most profoundly detached them from local culture, making them cultural pluralists.</p>
<p>First, an extended association with Pakistani culture induced a new understanding of and respect for Islam, which positively affected a couple of participants’ own spirituality. According to Jeannie, ‘the monolith that is Islam [in Canada] gets subdivided into its component parts pretty quickly [in Pakistan] . . . I’ve learned respect for Islam.’ Jean, a professor of nursing who has over 10 years of work experience in Karachi, subsequently has ‘a hard time criticizing Muslims because the Sunnis and Shiites and Ismailis I know just aren’t like how they’re portrayed here. So yes, I guess my religious world has grown.’ Also exercising a dialogic imagination about the intermingling of religious cultural elements in her life, Isabel asserts that ‘Being in a Muslim country definitely helped me deepen my own faith, understanding belief systems and commitment and discipline from another point of view.’ George is the only participant who retains an affinity to local religious culture in that his ‘tolerance for Islam is <italic>completely</italic> lower than when I first started going there. I was far more interested in finding out more about the religion and how it works, and now I’m, you know, fairly opposed to the religion, less perhaps what’s in the books, but especially the way I saw it practised and the way that people think about it.’</p>
<p>Second, participants said their understandings of Muslim women as passive spectres of social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580911423053">Cook, 2008</xref>) were shaken as they saw these women actively participating in many spheres of daily life in Pakistan, leading Zonny to appreciate how ‘[western] feminism and Islamic feminism can sort of live together’. Andrea now believes that not all Muslim women are merely pawns in arranged marriages after watching prospective brides choose grooms and ‘negotiate [marriage contracts] for six months before turning the guys down’. Pakistani women in political positions also unsettle common western assumptions. Frank has pictures of himself with the ‘elected chair of the local Islamic council, who’s also the head of a women’s NGO that runs a micro-credit bank. So women have some power, they just have to wear a black robe. And there’s essentially no hunger in her region, and each village is electrified in ways that don’t harm the environment. And then I come back to Canada, and people say “Oh, isn’t Pakistan scary?” This is a really messed up world.’</p>
<p>Running throughout these quotations and the longer interview transcripts is a noteworthy emphasis on learning, participants’ desires to engage with and understand another culture from the inside out. No one characterized this learning as a smooth or straightforward process. Rather, it required disconcerting reflection on their own cultural practices, myths and assumptions as they listened carefully to others and eventually joined with local voices in probing and problematizing western discourses of otherness. As ironists, they dissociated themselves from their previous cultural vantage points – a practice Bryan Turner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0268580911423053">2002</xref>: 57) calls ‘reflexive distancing from the homeland’ – revising and reformulating their predispositions along the way, to create more provisional pictures of society, to become skeptical of grand national narratives and to develop respect for another culture. Reflexivity was initiated when these development workers found themselves in new situations where old answers no longer sufficed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0268580911423053">
<title>Attachment to national protectionism</title>
<p>Only a few participants mentioned in interview conversations their lack of attachment to a state agenda of national protectionism. Concerned about the Canadian preoccupation with guarding national economic interests, Frank blusters that ‘Nobody cares about what’s happening in Pakistan, because they’re all wrapped up in what we’re doing here. If you start going on a rampage about why the hell doesn’t the federal government get to 0.7 percent of GDP for foreign assistance, nobody cares, because they’re all worried about tax levels and stupid stuff like that!’ Jean has ‘criticisms of some of the political issues and our foreign aid, and what we’re doing in Afghanistan and Pakistan, going in and bombarding a country. We go there, create an elitist position and then we don’t want to leave.’ Although my participants promote global work migrations and international engagements between countries, several are – like Jean – critical of imperialistic encounters such as the ‘war on terror’ that exploit South Asian people as national protectionist strategies are pursued. For instance, Anne is ‘now <italic>angry</italic> at the Canadian and American governments, because of the way they’ve messed around with the world. Pakistan has been just another pawn in their games. Sometimes they intervene, sometimes they walk out of child protection programs. They’re <italic>jerks</italic>! How can you <italic>do</italic> that in a country like this?’</p>
<p>Although participants are strongly oriented towards cosmopolitanism, they do not employ the language of ‘openness’ to describe their predispositions, as many scholars do. After the unsettling experience of transnational encounters, they have some sense that others (and themselves) are not readily transparent and accessible, or fully intelligible, as ‘openness’ implies. ‘Tolerance’, another commonly employed concept in the cosmopolitanism literature, is also eschewed, perhaps because these development workers are ambivalent; while they come to appreciate some aspects of Pakistani culture, like Islam, they develop critiques of self-serving politicians and rampant corruption. Participants do not communicate a humanist stance of ‘openness’ and ‘tolerance’, but rather a relationally constituted subjectivity riddled with ambivalences and occlusions. Their cosmopolitan orientations are characterized by elements of self-doubt, reflexive self-distanciation and irony that enable them to search for commonalities and connections without disregarding disparate and inequitable histories. Their notable ethic of care, which is engendered through global connectedness and dependency, is based on the recognition of human and cultural vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423053">McRobbie, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-0268580911423053">
<title>Cosmopolitan consequences</title>
<p>A sizeable body of theoretically oriented research has debated the definition, dimensions and implications of cosmopolitanism. But a growing number of scholars are turning their attention to documenting cultures of cosmopolitanism in the making. My contribution to this literature has been to refine conceptions of cosmopolitanism by describing and analysing the tentative, ambivalent and classed culture of cosmopolitanism that is ‘becoming’ among an elite group of returned Canadian development workers. I tackled this goal by employing Roudometof’s continuum of cosmopolitanism, which is an analytic tool that effectively encapsulates the range of orientations and attachments articulated by my participants. Whether or not it is equally useful in studying the cosmopolitan realities of differently classed groups is a topic for further research. In this case the continuum enables me to map the complex repertoire of local and cosmopolitan allegiances that characterize a culture of cosmopolitanism, while demonstrating an overarching cosmopolitan orientation. It also helps to explain why some people who have transnational encounters may not develop a cosmopolitan orientation when local attachments prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423053">Cook, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>What are the implications of this analysis for how we understand cosmopolitanism? First, the frameworks my participants use to describe their transnational engagements differ from those employed by many scholars, showing that cosmopolitanism is more appropriately operationalized as an ambivalent set of attachments than as ‘openness’ and ‘tolerance’. Second, in contrast to Kantian notions of cosmopolitanism as a stance of detachment, we see that it entails numerous obligations to others. Third, cosmopolitanism is animated as a tangible set of attachments at play in everyday life, rather than some abstract engagement with a world of difference. These attachments are heterogeneous, within groups and individuals, which constitute a multiplicity of cosmopolitanisms with varying intensities. Finally, this analysis helps clarify the relationship between transnational engagements and cosmopolitan orientations. My qualitative data support quantitative findings that these processes are associated, without the absolute loss of local attachments. But it goes further to explain <italic>why</italic> and <italic>how</italic> they are associated. The relationship is certainly mutually constitutive. Some participants, especially those bilingual children of recent immigrants, may have been inclined towards a cosmopolitan orientation that led them to seek out development work, which in turn intensified that orientation. However, most of them characterized what I am calling a cosmopolitan orientation as a product of their extended transnational engagements in Pakistan.</p>
<p>I presume that a similar relationship and set of processes is unfolding among the Pakistani people with whom these foreign development workers interacted during their tenure overseas. Further research could tease out those processes and their effects in that culture, which would allow us to detail another culture of cosmopolitanism, what we might call a ‘subaltern’ version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423053">Notar, 2008</xref>). A study of this kind would also empirically strengthen the claim made by Roudometof and my participants that transnational engagements, which influence attachments, are not limited to those we have abroad.</p>
<p>This mapping of cosmopolitan and local orientations also illuminates two tentative shifts in social relations. First, as these development workers robustly experience and recognize others, both proximate and distant, in their daily lives, their subjectivities are hybridized. As cosmopolitanized subjects, they are decentred in new ways, creating new reflexive practices of the self that are not wholly circumscribed by the local. In contrast to a humanist subject, ostensibly coherent and transparent, cosmopolitanized subjects are relationally, multiply and conflictually constituted beings. And they are not so much open to and tolerant of difference, as self-doubting ironists exploring current global connections alongside imbricated, inequitable histories. Moreover, they are ambivalently cosmopolitanized, constituted through both local and cosmopolitan orientations. This insight troubles facile hopes for grand transnational political transformations even as it enriches prospects for and interpretations of cultures of cosmopolitanism.</p>
<p>Second, a nascent culture of cosmopolitanism – characterized in part by recognized communal dependencies, vulnerabilities and histories – generates additional connectivities through which social relations are constituted beyond the limits of national societies. Localities become deterritorialized ‘glocalities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0268580911423053">Robertson, 1995</xref>) through global connectivity, leading, as this analysis demonstrates, to new forms of political community, as well as sociality. The new forms of community documented here question imperial and capitalist projects of the past and present as they agitate for reciprocal global relations.</p>
<p>The resulting ‘utopia in a minor key’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580911423053">Clifford, 1998</xref>: 366) may not engender a global revolution. It may not even make it easier in the short term for proximate others to find employment, make a living wage and access affordable housing, or for cosmopolitanized subjects to intervene in global economics and militarism. Cultural differences that are gendered, classed and racialized persist. But here and there cosmopolitan orientations and related ethics of care prevail. They may be sporadic and diffuse, with few global or local institutions to support them, and their full effects remain to be seen. However, even a hesitant growth of a culture of cosmopolitanism suggests that changes in the context within which social and political life has been historically understood are afoot. More empirical studies of the cosmopolitanization of reality are needed to track their developments and effects.</p>
