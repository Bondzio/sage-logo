<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The association between specific sleeping disorders and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unclear. We assessed the association between sleep loss due to worry and future risk of CVD and death in a representative sample of community dwelling adults.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A cohort of 11,905 adults (aged 53.4 ± 12.2 years, 42.2% male) without known history of CVD were drawn from the Scottish Health Surveys. Self-reported sleep disturbance was measured using a single item from the General Health Questionnaire. Incident CVD events (comprising CVD death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary surgical procedures, stroke, and heart failure) over 8-year follow up were ascertained by a linkage to national registers; a total of 1448 CVD events and 1249 all-cause deaths were recorded.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 15.6% of the sample reported ‘rather more’ or ‘much more than usual’ sleep loss due to worry over the prior 4 weeks. Sleep loss due to worry (much more than usual) was associated with elevated risk of CVD [age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35–2.25] and all-cause mortality (age- and sex-adjusted HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.57–2.61). Adjustment for a range of psychosocial, behavioural, and clinical risk factors partly attenuated the association, and in particular health behaviours (smoking, alcohol, physical inactivity) accounted for approximately 40% of the sleep–CVD relation.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Sleep loss due to worry was associated with a greater risk of CVD and all-cause mortality, but the association can be largely explained by intermediate risk factors such as health behaviours.</p>

<p>Cognitive representations of past stressful events (rumination) or feared events in the future (worry) are associated with increased psychophysiological activity and might act as a precurser in disease onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711426092">1</xref></sup> In particular, worry is commonly linked with sleep disturbance, although it is a condition that tends to afflict younger individuals in contrast to clinical sleeping problems such as insomnia and sleep apnoea that increase with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711426092">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711426092">4</xref></sup> Disturbed sleep is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), as sleep is commonly viewed as a restorative period when physiological workload on the cardiovascular system is decreased, such as the well-characterized dip in nocturnal blood pressure. Recent experimental and epidemiological data have implicated sleep quantity and quality as correlates of several CVD risk factors, including obesity and metabolic disturbances,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711426092">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711426092">8</xref></sup> incident hypertension,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711426092">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711426092">10</xref></sup> coronary artery calcification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711426092">11</xref></sup> and inflammatory markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711426092">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that short (&lt;5 h) and/or long (&gt;9 h) self-reported sleep durations were independently associated with a modestly increased risk of CVD events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711426092">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711426092">22</xref></sup> Evidence on the association between sleep disturbance and risk of CVD events is more mixed although it is mostly based on data on insomnia symptoms rather than sleep loss due to worry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711426092">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711426092">26</xref></sup> In the Whitehall II study of British civil servants, short sleep duration and sleep disturbance were both associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), but after adjustment for confounders only those reporting sleep loss due to worry had a raised risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711426092">2</xref></sup> Given the potential interaction between stress and sleep, we hypothesized an association between ‘sleep loss due to worry’ and risk of future CVD and all-cause mortality, and tested this hypothesis in a representative sample of community dwelling adults free from CVD at baseline.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1741826711426092" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711426092"><title>Study design and participants</title>
<p>The Scottish Health Survey (SHS) is a cross-sectional survey that is typically conducted serially every 3–5 years, that draws a nationally representative sample of the general population living in households. For the present analysis we combined data from separate surveys sampled in 1995, 1998, and 2003 (comprising 28.8, 37.0, and 34.2% of the present sample, respectively) in adults aged 35 years and older, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711426092">27</xref></sup> We linked these data to records of hospital admissions and mortality; thus, the analyses were based on a prospective cohort design. Participants from the different survey years contributed data only once and were comparable in terms of demographics and risk factors. The main exclusion criteria for the present analysis were a history of clinically confirmed CVD, which was identified from 20 years of retrospective patient hospital records. Participants gave full informed consent to take part in the study and ethical approval was obtained from the London Research Ethics Council.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711426092"><title>Baseline assessment and sleep</title>
<p>Survey interviewers visited eligible households and collected data on demographics and lifestyle (e.g., smoking, alcohol, physical activity) variables and measured height and weight for the calculation of body mass index (BMI). Socioeconomic status was assessed using the Registrar General Classification (I/II, professional/intermediate; III, skilled nonmanual and skilled manual; IV/V, part-skilled/unskilled). Sleep disturbance was assessed using a single item from the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, which enquired about whether the participant had experienced sleep loss due to worry in the previous 4 weeks, as employed previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711426092">2</xref></sup> There were four possible responses, including ‘not at all’, ‘no more than usual’, ‘rather more than usual’, and ‘much more than usual’. On a separate visit, nurses collected information on medical history and medication (from information on pill dispensers and containers) and recorded the average of three seated blood pressure readings (Omron HEM-907 blood pressure monitor). Hypertension was confirmed from a self-report of a physicians diagnosis, use of antihypertensive medication, or identified from the clinic blood pressure measure (≥140/90 mmHg). The use of antidepressant medication (codes 040301‐4), hypnotics (040101), anxiolytics (040102), and antipsychotics (040201) was coded according to the British National Formulary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711426092">28</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711426092"><title>Clinical events follow up</title>
<p>The surveys were linked to a patient-based database of hospital admissions and deaths with follow up until December 2007 [Information Services Division (ISD) Scotland].<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711426092">29</xref></sup> The ISD database has demonstrated 94% accuracy and 99% completeness when samples of computerized CVD records from the Scottish national database were compared with the original patient case notes. Classification of the underlying cause of death is based on information collected on the death certificate together with any additional information provided subsequently by the certifying doctor. The primary endpoint for the present analyses was a composite of fatal and nonfatal CVD events. Mortality from cardiovascular causes was coded according to International Classification of Diseases version 9 (ICD-9) (390–459) and ICD-10 (I01–99), and nonfatal events included CVD-related hospital admissions incorporating acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery, percutaneous coronary angioplasty, stroke, and heart failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711426092"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Differences in the characteristics of participants with relation to sleep disturbance were analysed using ANOVA tests to examine continuous variables and chi-squared tests to examine categorical variables. Cox proportional hazards models were used with months as the time scale to estimate the risk of CVD events according to the four responses on the sleep loss question. Study members that survived were censored at 31 December 2007. In preliminary analyses, there were no clear differences in our results between men and women, so the data were pooled and adjusted for sex and age in the basic model. We used an a priori approach to construct several multivariate models in order to adjust for different groups of possible confounding variables: psychosocial (socioeconomic position, marital status, antidepressant medication use); behavioural (physical activity, smoking, alcohol); and clinical risk factors (hypertension, BMI, diabetes). The proportional hazards assumption was examined by comparing the cumulative hazard plots grouped on exposure, although no appreciable violations were noted. All analyses were performed using SPSS (version 14) and all tests of statistical significance were based on two-sided probability (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711426092" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The overall survey response rate ranged between 60–76% for the different survey years. The initial sample consisted of 16,144 participants, although after exclusion of 702 participants with clinically confirmed CVD at baseline, participants lost to follow up (<italic>n</italic> = 2993), and participants with missing demographic variables (<italic>n</italic> = 544), the final analytical sample comprised 11,905 adults (aged 53.4 ± 12.2 years, 42.2% male). Participants lost to follow up were, on average, younger than those included in the study (48.8 years, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001). Participants that did not respond to the sleep item question (<italic>n</italic> = 278) were older (60.0 vs. 53.4 years, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001) but less likely to be smokers (27.0% vs. 31.8%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) compared with the analytic sample. Approximately 15.6% of the sample reported some sleep loss due to worry, and in general those participants were younger, more likely to be women, not married, coming from lower working class, using antidepressants, and demonstrating poorer health behaviours and clinical risk factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711426092">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Over an average of 8-year follow up (range 1 month to 12.4 years) there were 1448 CVD events and 1249 all-cause deaths. Participants that reported ‘much more than usual’ sleep loss due to worry were at elevated risk of CVD and all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711426092">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711426092">3</xref>). The effect estimates were attenuated after adjustment for a range of psychosocial, behavioural, and clinical risk factors, and in particular health behaviours (smoking, alcohol, physical activity) accounted for approximately 40% of the sleep–CVD relation. When we adjusted for all of these factors simultaneously, the association between ‘much more than usual’ sleep loss and CVD no longer remained significant [hazard ratio (HR) 1.13, 95% CI 0.87–1.46] although the association persisted for all-cause mortality (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.00–1.70). In order to account for reverse causality, we removed all CVD events occurring in the first 2 years of follow up (<italic>n</italic> = 217), although this had essentially no impact on the results (age- and sex-adjusted HR for CVD 1.70, 95% CI 1.29–2.25).

<p>The use of psychotropic medications that could potentially confound associations of sleep disturbance and CVD were examined.

<p>Previous data have implicated sleep quantity and quality as correlates of several CVD risk factors, although evidence for an association between sleep disturbance and risk of clinical CVD events is sparse. In this study we specifically examined reported sleep loss due to worry, which more commonly afflicts younger individuals in contrast to clinical sleeping problems such as insomnia and sleep apnoea that are more prevalent in older participants. Reports of disturbed sleep were highly prevalent (15.6%) and this corroborates data from the Whitehall II British occupational cohort, which also used sleep items from the General Health Questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711426092">2</xref></sup> The results of this general population study demonstrated an association between sleep loss due to worry and risk of CVD and all-cause mortality, but the associations were largely explained by intermediate risk factors such as health behaviours. Although sleep disturbance is a common problem, the associations between sleeping trouble and social- and health-related risk factors are unclear. In the present sample of the general population we found that participants reporting sleep loss were more likely to be female, not married, coming from lower working class, using psychotropic medications, and demonstrating poorer health behaviours and clinical risk factors, which is consistent with data from other British cohorts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711426092">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711426092">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent studies on sleep disturbances and CVD have reported inconsistent findings. For example, sleep disturbances were associated with elevated CHD incidence among British civil servants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711426092">2</xref></sup> and work disability due to diseases of the circulatory system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711426092">25</xref></sup> in a population of Finnish public sector employees, but not with deaths from heart disease among participants in the Cancer Prevention Study II, USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711426092">18</xref></sup> In the MONICA Augsburg cohort, difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction, although the analysis was severely limited by the small number of events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711426092">15</xref></sup> In the present study, based on a large general population with almost 1500 CVD events and over 1200 all-cause deaths, we found evidence for an association between sleep loss due to worries with CVD and mortality.</p>
<p>Disturbances of the physiological processes during sleep, rather than sleep duration itself, might be crucial for increasing CVD risk. An increased number of microarousals per hour has been associated with elevated blood lipid concentration, cortisol concentration, and blood pressure, independently of total sleep time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711426092">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711426092">32</xref></sup> Sleep loss due to worry may be particularly harmful,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741826711426092">33</xref></sup> as rumination and worry have been linked with increased psychophysiological activity. In particular, people with higher levels of trait worry and rumination demonstrate elevated cortisol responses, and slower recovery of blood pressure and cardiac autonomic function following acute mental stressors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741826711426092">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741826711426092">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, we employed a self-reported measure of sleep disturbance, although it was not feasible to obtain more detailed and objective assessments of sleep, such as sleep diaries, actigraphs, and polysomnography, from such a large population. Previous studies have shown high correlations between subjective and objective estimates of sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741826711426092">37</xref></sup> Secondly, we were unable to assess if sleep loss was of a chronic and recurrent nature, since the questionnaire enquired about sleep disturbance in the past 4 weeks. Nevertheless, recent data have indicated that sleeping trouble is often prolonged and the average length of a continuous episode of troubled sleeping was 2.4 years among middle-aged British women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711426092">30</xref></sup> A further limitation was a lack of information about sleeping hours or the presence of sleep apnoea. However, clinically verified sleep apnoea is prevalent in approximately 0.5−1.5% of the general population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741826711426092">38</xref></sup> whereas, in our study, the prevalence of disturbed sleep (more than usual) was 15.6%. Furthermore, since the prevalence of sleep apnoea in participants with a BMI &lt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> is rare, we repeated our analyses after removing obese and overweight participants (BMI &gt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and found no differences in the risk estimation. We also included BMI as a covariate in our analysis. Finally, patients with sleep apnoea often complain about tiredness rather than short sleep or sleeping difficulties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741826711426092">39</xref></sup> so there is unlikely to be a strong correlation between sleep apnoea and the sleep-disturbance question used in this study. We did not directly measure depressive symptoms and anxiety, although adjustments for the use of antidepressants and other psychotropic medications (as a surrogate marker) did not appreciably alter the results. Although our follow-up data on CVD hospital admissions are likely to be complete, we were not able to identify men and women treated as outpatients for CVD. It is, therefore, likely that we have only captured the most severe cases of CVD in the present analysis.</p>
