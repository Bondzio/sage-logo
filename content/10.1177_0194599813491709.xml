<p>I read with great interest the invited article written by Gurgel et al: “A New Standardized Format for Reporting Hearing Outcome in Clinical Trials.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813491709">1</xref></sup> The journals <italic>Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, Otology &amp; Neurotology</italic>, and <italic>Laryngoscope</italic> have adopted the new minimal reporting standard as a publication requirement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813491709">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813491709">2</xref></sup> The new standard for reporting hearing outcome is very important to investigators to present their hearing data and to draw comparisons across studies in the future. However, I feel some descriptions in the article were not quite clear.</p>
<p>First, the label “&gt;91” on the y-axis of Figure 1 is inadequate since it would mean some data could not be plotted on the scattergram; for example, when the rounded PTA values are 91. Thus the label “&gt;91” should be represented as “≥91” or “&gt;90,” and a similar change should be made for the description “from 0 to &gt;91 dB” in the last line of the left column on page 804.</p>
<p>Second, the labels “≥50” on the x-axis or y-axis of Figure 2 (as well as Figure 3) are also inadequate. According to the description “For example, column or row ‘10’ includes the numbers 1-10, ‘20’ includes 11-20, etc.” in lines 4-5 of the left column on page 805, which means column or row “40” includes the numbers 31-40. Then how would the data about “41-49” be plotted on the figures? Thus the labels “≥50” should be represented as “&gt;40” (rather than “≥40”) if the scattergram remains 11 columns × 11 rows. Alternatively, additional columns or rows could be added to Figure 2, forming a scattergram with 13 columns × 13 rows, and the labels from top to bottom (or from left to right) on x-axis or y-axis of the revised figure should be as follows: &gt;50 (or ≥51), 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, No change, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and &gt;50 (or ≥51).</p>
