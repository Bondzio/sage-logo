<p>The use of social media and Websites to improve health has been growing in importance in recent years with a proliferation of sites offering information, peer-support and the opportunity to share experiences, pictures and recommendations. In particular, the use of sites linked to pregnancy and parenting has led to women becoming more aware of alternative sources of information about pregnancy and the opportunity to form strong social bonds with other women at similar stages in pregnancy or facing the same problems. However, it is the role of social media in organising women to influence health policy and the opportunities afforded by social media for research which form the basis for this analysis of the role of the Netmums social network.</p>
<p>The author makes a compelling case for the use of data from networks like Netmums and gives some examples of how this had led to advances in knowledge. The kind of research opportunities arising from polling and on-line questionnaires are to be welcomed but bring their own problems. It is very difficult to know how representative respondents are of the wider Netmums community because the sample is usually only a small proportion of users. The use of Netmums to help recruit clinical trial participants is another interesting development and forms part of the move to conduct more clinical trials online. However, the problems in conducting such trials, especially ensuring participant retention, should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>The development of mobile phone technology has meant that many women, particularly young women, now use their smartphones as their primary means of accessing social media sites. This seems to allow for even more versatility and innovation in research design with the potential to use downloadable apps both to deliver information and health interventions to assist with, for example, smoking cessation and diet during pregnancy and also to evaluate their effects. There are great opportunities for e-health and m-health interventions offering exciting times ahead for researchers.</p>
