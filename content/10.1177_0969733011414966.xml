<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this qualitative study was to analyse nurses’ professional dignity in their everyday working lives. We explored the factors that affect nursing professional dignity in practice that emerge in relationships with health professionals, among clinical nurses working in hospitals and in community settings in central Italy. The main themes identified were: (i) nursing professional dignity perceived as an achievement; (ii) recognition of dignity beyond professional roles. These two concepts are interconnected. This study provides insights into professional dignity in nursing being perceived as an achievement linked to the intrinsic dignity of every human being. The ‘nursing professional dignity perceived as an achievement’ was perceived as having declined in different social factors. Some factors of nursing professional dignity perceived as an achievement were attained more easily in community settings. ‘Recognition of dignity beyond professional roles’ underpins the intrinsic dignity as an expression of humanity, embedded in persons regardless of any profession, and values, such as: respect, moral integrity, humility, working conscientiously and kindness.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nursing professional dignity should be maintained in practice every day, especially in relations with health care recipients and other professionals. The first facet of dignity (patients’ dignity) is an intrinsic value demonstrated by health professionals, especially nurses. Nursing scholars declare that ‘respect for human dignity is our sea, our common community . . .’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011414966">1</xref>
</sup> and that it resides in the empathic encounter with patients. Patients’ dignity has been studied extensively by different professions in the health care sector, as underlined by empirical research in palliative care and dignity in dying,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011414966">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011414966"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011414966"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011414966"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011414966">6</xref></sup> and in older adults and vulnerable people.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011414966">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011414966"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011414966">9</xref>
</sup> The second facet, that of a self-regarding professional right, remains underexplored<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011414966">10</xref>
</sup> and an unclear concept in nursing,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011414966">11</xref>
</sup> and is still in need of a definition. Nursing professional dignity as a distinct concept does not have a clear definition in the literature, but nursing research, labour studies, organizational and related health research has provided descriptions of the elements that have an influence on nursing professional dignity. </p>
<p>Nursing professional dignity can be defined as a complex, multivalent concept, composed of social elements<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011414966">12</xref>
</sup> and intrinsic characteristics of the person.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011414966">13</xref>
</sup> These elements are inextricably interconnected. The main factors of these two concepts overlap and are constituted of: personal characteristics of every person,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011414966">14</xref>
</sup> intra- and inter-professional relations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011414966">15</xref>
</sup> workplace characteristics,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011414966">10</xref>
</sup> teamworking,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011414966">16</xref>
</sup> professional competence and experience of nurses,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011414966">17</xref>
</sup> social recognition by the general public, and professional autonomy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011414966">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011414966">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Some of these indicators of satisfaction/non-satisfaction, respect/no respect, are broadly referenced in the literature and concern interrelated organizational and human conditions,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011414966">20</xref>
</sup> organizational justice in its interactional dimension,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011414966">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011414966">22</xref>
</sup> and have a strong impact on nursing professional dignity and on satisfaction in work settings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011414966">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011414966">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that there is a direct and critical relationship between nurses’ work, nursing work environments and dignity, constituting the social part of dignity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011414966">12</xref></sup> Means of understanding these factors include studies on ‘magnet hospitals’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011414966">25</xref>
</sup> in the USA that have to meet high standards of quality in nursing practice and in the care of patients. Such standards of nursing care are not at present officially stated in Italy, even though health organizations must be quality certified. </p>
<p>First and foremost, nursing professional dignity is linked to the personal characteristics of every person. This basic personal dignity must be valued and respected<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011414966">26</xref>
</sup> because human beings have an inalienable intrinsic dignity, and because it shapes the perception of self-respect and self-esteem of professionals. </p>
<p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011414966">27</xref>
</sup> of 1948 welcomes the concept of dignity as an expression of the essence of human beings. Peláez stated that,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011414966">28</xref>
</sup> ‘[t]he concept of human dignity does not indicate a specific right, rather the fundamentals of every human right . . . dignity cannot be removed from outside, only violated’. To maintain the intrinsic dignity of a human being means to acknowledge the intrinsic ‘being a person’ of the other.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011414966">26</xref>
</sup> If dignity serves as a guiding principle for the global health movement,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011414966">29</xref></sup> professional dignity must be explored, because to give dignity to others means giving dignity to one’s self respect and sense one’s self as valuable. For this reason, we undertook a study, to be followed in different countries, to analyse different nursing perceptions of the topic. We felt that this indefinable value that belongs to every person is intrinsic in nurses involved in their professional roles, despite it still to be understood and analysed. We started by considering the situation in the area in Italy where we live and work </p>
<sec id="section2-0969733011414966">
<title>Nursing autonomy and intra- and inter-professional relations in Italy</title>
<p>The Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) came into being in 1978, inspired by the Beveridge Report of 1942 that laid the foundation of the British NHS (National Health Service). Italy is divided into 21 Regions, each with broad autonomy, especially in the health sector. The enactment of Law 42 on 26 February 1999 ‘<italic>Disposition concerning health professions</italic>’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011414966">30</xref>
</sup> was a milestone in the history of the Italian nursing profession, ratifying nursing professional autonomy. Nurses officially became autonomous professionals with great responsibility, but in 2011 the positive effects of this law can hardly be perceived in terms of professional autonomy. Nevertheless, the basis of registration for nurses has been a compulsory three-year university degree since 2001. The changes since 1991, when the hospital-based nursing diploma was nearly abandoned, were first the continuation of the nursing diploma and a university diploma as a double pathway between 1992 and 1996, and then a university-based diploma only from 1996 to 2001. From 2001, a nursing degree at bachelor level exists as the single pathway to entry to the profession. Nursing in Italy has achieved important goals in terms of education, decisional autonomy and responsibility, and the status of a self-regulated profession by legislative norms. Yet, many nurses still perceive themselves as a non-autonomous professional group because inter-professional relations continue to be dominated by medicine at all levels of the health system. In some regions of southern Italy this situation is exacerbated by financial restraints of the local health systems. </p>

<title>Aims of the study</title>
<p>The purpose of this qualitative study was to analyse nurses’ professional dignity in their everyday working lives.

<p>In this qualitative study we adopted an inductive content analysis approach,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733011414966">31</xref>
</sup> using focus groups to collect information on a specific topic. Although focus groups are historically rooted in the marketing and advertising sector, their efficacy in producing validated results in the health and nursing sector is well documented.<sup>

<title>Research question</title>
<p>One of the research questions used was:</p>
<p>What indicators of nursing professional dignity emerge from the nursing inter- and intra-professional relations in both hospital and community settings?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733011414966">
<title>Focus groups</title>
<p>Between 2009 and 2010 we conducted 11 focus groups in the Lazio Region of central Italy. We chose this approach to facilitate discussions prompted by specific questions. The initial pilot focus group question asked participants to point out some indicators of professional dignity and provide practical examples. We asked if nursing professional respect had ever either been violated or regarded as an important value by other professionals working in the same place. When asked to articulate what professional dignity meant to them, participants gave examples based on their own experiences as nurses in different contexts. Their conversation was then condensed into meaningful categories and themes.</p>
<p>We digitally recorded all focus group discussions and transcribed them verbatim as first cycle coding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011414966">34</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We conducted two focus groups in a public hospital with different clinical specialties with 14 nurses involved; three groups in two different university teaching hospitals with different clinical specialties (20 nurses); two focus groups in two different private hospitals (12 nurses); one group in a palliative care centre (6 nurses); and three groups in two nursing educational facilities with nurses attending post-graduate educational courses (20 nurses).</p>

<p>Data were collected by the principal investigators and two research assistants:</p>
<p>The first focus group was used as a pilot focus group in the analysis process and was analytically reviewed to define and improve the questions. A total of 72 registered nurses were recruited on the following two criteria:</p>

<p>Participants were recruited on a voluntary basis by senior nurses or nurse directors who approached the clinical units on our behalf. The research project and its purpose was described to the participants who were then asked for their written consent. Once a sufficient number of nurses had agreed to participate, the focus groups were arranged.</p>
<p>Each of the eleven focus groups had between six and eight participants and lasted between a minimum of an hour to a maximum of one hour and forty minutes. The focus groups were made up of registered nurses from a variety of different areas, including medicine, surgery and outpatient clinics to ensure heterogeneity. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0969733011414966">
<title>Ethics</title>
<p>Ethical approval was obtained from the management and review committees of the healthcare facilities. Before the study, participants were provided with an information sheet and detailed explanation of the study and advised that they were free to refuse to participate or withdraw at any time. Consent forms were signed. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0969733011414966">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The data were analysed by using inductive content analysis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733011414966">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011414966">35</xref>
</sup> starting from the information retrieved and identifying codes, sub-categories, categories and thematic areas.</p>
<p>The focus group discussions were quickly transcribed and read through several times in order to capture meaningful content. Immediate debriefing with the observers after each focus group was carried out, along with debriefing notes. The observers were two PhD students who attended all the focus groups and helped researchers to take notes and observe participants’ non-verbal behaviours during the focus group sessions. Transcription and checking the contents with the observers enabled a) picking up parts of words, and b) detecting non-verbal communication, gestures and behaviour. Debriefing notes included comments about the focus group processes and the significance of data.</p>
<p>This was followed by a reading of the information retrieved where textual units were identified. The research team relied on a line-by-line analysis to identify unit analysis and sort phenomena arising into conceptually meaningful sub-categories and then into categories. Units analysed were not reduced into smaller concepts<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733011414966">39</xref>
</sup> but where transcribed verbatim, and the textual units (codes) were sorted out, summed up and categorized. Subsequently, open codes with similar content were arranged in sub-categories and then categorized. The categories were identified around different meanings of nursing professional dignity in community and hospital settings. All main categories were then compared and two main themes on professional dignity emerged. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0969733011414966">
<title>Rigour</title>
<p>Dependability was established through coding, sub-categorizing and categorizing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733011414966">36</xref>
</sup> Credibility was established by four independent assistants who had an interceding reliability of 95% using Krippendorff’s α. Researchers and assistants met regularly to discuss emerging findings and reach consensus on data analysis. </p>
<p>To code the transcript, it was necessary to go through the transcripts line by line and paragraph by paragraph, looking for significant statements and codes relevant to the topic addressed. The researchers conducted a data analysis that allowed various categories to emerge from the codes and the themes from the categories. During a two-day research retreat, the preliminary results were discussed, clarified and re-conceptualized into two broader themes describing the characteristics of nursing professional dignity in hospital and community workplaces.</p>
<p>Finally, a member of the research group, who had neither participated in the focus group nor in prior analysis, read the original un-coded transcripts of the focus groups to validate the results. We then presented the themes to the focus group participants and competent nursing scholars in an email survey; they confirmed their validity. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0969733011414966">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The following two overarching main themes were identified and used to explain and describe significant features of nursing professional dignity: (i) nursing professional dignity perceived as an achievement; (ii) recognition of dignity beyond professional roles. Dignity must be recognized simply because persons are human beings beyond professional roles.</p>
<p>The professional dignity of nurses perceived as an achievement had worsened in various ways, noticeable in some hospitals in the area where nurses had previously worked. Broadly speaking, dignity was perceived as an achievement because in several settings where the investigation was conducted, prerequisites for fostering respect for nursing professional dignity were by no means satisfactory. Instead, in the community settings nurses perceived a higher level of professional dignity and were happier to work in settings where respect among professionals is a more recognized value. In doing this, we explored several aspects of professional dignity in practice at community and hospital levels. The main factors of dignity of nursing as a profession perceived as an achievement were linked to:</p>
<sec id="section13-0969733011414966">
<title>Communication and showing respect in inter- and intra-professional relationships</title>
<p>Some studies have demonstrated that inter-professional relations are paramount for both patients and nurses, and the lack of these relations leads to the loss of professional dignity, with a big impact on organizations in terms of high turn-over nursing rates, diminished quality of care, and a lower quality of care perceived by patients. An important role is played by the nurse-physician relationship:<disp-quote>

<title>Social factors expressed by the general public and other health professionals through the point of view of nurses interviewed</title>
<p>In our study we found that culturally, the Italian general public think that only physicians and not nurses resolve health problems. Nevertheless, the general public see nurses as people who can be relied on and who courageously care for those who suffer, with increasing competencies. We considered social recognition shown by the general public and expressed by other health professionals: <disp-quote>
<p>[Patient] You [nurses] are important in hospitals; without nurses, hospitals cannot be run, there isn’t any care.</p>
<p>There is a strong contrast between the way nurses are seen by the mass media and the way they are considered by society in reality, in the sense that when you speak to people, they recognize the importance of nurses, when they say ‘you are important for the hospital; without nurses hospitals wouldn’t be able to work, there wouldn’t be any care’. The same thing happens with nurses providing care at home. People say that they are important and essential, but the mass media fundamentally still see nurses as they used to be 20 or 30 years ago, whereas social recognition in general is growing as time goes by, because also nurses’ competencies are growing. (Community staff nurse) </p>

<p>We also considered the general public’s social recognition of physicians. In fact, they are often considered the only true professionals, and hence more respected by patients:<disp-quote>
<p>Family members who did not want to speak directly to nurses, do not acknowledge the professionalism of health professionals other than physicians. (Hospital staff nurse)</p>

<title>Competence acquired through education, lifelong learning and experience</title>
<p>Life-long learning is an essential element for health professionals to gain competence. In doing this, nurses gain more self-esteem and awareness of the role played in a knowledge-based society where it is necessary to improve the service offered to the general public. The right to safe nursing care has to be guaranteed by a professional who applies the principles of evidence-based nursing practice. Many nurses are more confident and increase their dignity by having more experience in the field and participating in continuous professional development. In this way, their relationship with physicians improves because they recognize the nurses’ competence to perform their job:<disp-quote>
<p>Education and life-long learning are essential to have dignity and be respected. (Community staff nurse)</p>

</sup> valued the ‘liberty of operating according to one’s own competencies for the best interests of the patient . . .  to make one’s own autonomous decisions in the specific field of competence and make interdependent decisions where the disciplinary field is overlapped by other fields of knowledge . . . ’. Professional identity is closely linked to the control of professional autonomy:<disp-quote>
<p>The concept of dignity depends and is in relation to your autonomy, I feel I have dignity when I have some autonomy. (Community staff nurse) </p>
<p>You achieve autonomy directly proportional to your preparation. It is a concept that goes along with it. You can’t achieve professional autonomy if you don’t show it to those who are competent in it. Autonomy is surely a factor that indicates dignity, but it depends on other things. Professional autonomy comes afterwards, when the physicians say ‘you deal with this’, when they know you, when the physicians know you have the ability to do it, when they know that in many other situations you have been up to it.

<p>Some factors of <italic>nursing professional dignity perceived as an achievement</italic> are more evident in community settings. Some conditions show how working in the community – as opposed to hospitals with rigid hierarchies and old-fashioned reasoning that do not take into account the different levels of caring – gives nurses the feeling of achievement of professional dignity, such as the major recognition of communication and showing respect in inter- and intra-professional relationships, team working and professional autonomy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides some insights into the nursing professional dignity perceived as an achievement linked to the intrinsic dignity of every human being; a concept that goes beyond professional roles. The main sources of the lack of respect for nursing professional dignity in different health settings derive from a series of interrelated factors. The inappropriate work environment experienced by nurses working in hospitals<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733011414966">40</xref></sup> was often characterized by hierarchical and bureaucratic organizations where they felt powerlessness, with reduced clinical autonomy, with heavy workloads, being marginalized compared to other health professionals, and devaluated with a consequent lack of confidence in their own capabilities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733011414966">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733011414966">42</xref></sup> They developed feelings of lack of personal self-esteem, self-worth and lack of awareness of their specific competencies.</p>
<p>The moral suffering of many nurses, working especially in hospitals in the area considered, was linked to the devaluation of social dignity in interpersonal relationships between health professionals, a lack of teamwork and poor nurse clinical autonomy. The nurses experienced in particular ‘a range of emotions going from feelings of abandonment by their organizations to lack of [a] sense of respect and belonging’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733011414966">40</xref>
</sup> The main factors that constitute the nursing professional dignity perceived as an achievement are:</p>
<sec id="section20-0969733011414966">
<title>Organizational ethical climate, interpersonal relationships and respect of dignity</title>
<p>Many dimensions of the ethical climate<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733011414966">41</xref>
</sup> are linked to social dignity expressed by interpersonal relationships and lack of respect for dignity of the other, such as: disregard, i.e. giving little or no attention to other health professionals, and in our study, contempt, restriction of professional autonomy, verbal disparagement, discrimination, and disrespect demonstrated by gestures or in words. </p>

</sup> in nurses included in our study gave rise to feelings of anger, frustration, lack of confidence, inadequacy and guilt, as well as resentment, compromised moral integrity, shame, and professional disempowerment. In the Lazio Region, we found that the inter-professional relationships, especially in hospital settings, were dominated by the hierarchy intrinsic to the organizations that maintain the biomedical model, as Sirota<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733011414966">45</xref>
</sup> also reported in other settings. Such relationships were frequently based on top-down communication, thus increasing the perception of nursing as a powerless profession and hindering inter-professional relationships.</p>
<p>The nurse-physician collaboration is broadly treated in literature<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733011414966">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733011414966">47</xref>
</sup> and is a key element of nursing professional dignity. Various tools<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969733011414966">48</xref>
</sup> measure this relationship, such as the Schmalenberg Kramer<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733011414966">49</xref>
</sup> classification, which describes five kinds of relationships between nurses and physicians: collegial, collaborative, student-teacher, friendly/stranger, and hostile/adversarial relationships. In our research, the nurse-physician relationship was often hostile/adversarial or friendly/stranger.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733011414966">49</xref>
</sup> However, when nurses were more skilled and experienced, their relationships with physicians improved. Such relationships tended to be better in the community settings. Negative relationships were mainly found in hospitals characterized by a culture where the nurse-physician relationships were built on a rigid hierarchy of competencies and of subordination.<sup>

</sup> that improve care, such as better teamwork, interpersonal relationships and interaction between physicians and nurses. This also proves that effective teamwork is fundamental for patient safety. Transdisciplinary team dynamics imply a practice where the level of agreement between all the health professionals involved is very high and professional borders become blurred and vanish,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969733011414966">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0969733011414966">51</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969733011414966">52</xref>
</sup> thus providing an added value to the dignity of professionals.</p>
<p>The concept of transdisciplinary teamwork, which surpasses that of the interdisciplinary team and the multidisciplinary team,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969733011414966">53</xref>
</sup> could have a key role in fostering nursing professional dignity. In our research we found that in some hospitals there were multidisciplinary teams where different professionals worked with the same patients, but independently or with little interaction. Instead, the concept of transdisciplinarity implies sharing assessment and evaluation tools, documentation and theoretical and practical paradigms.</p>

<title>The social recognition of competence acquired through education, life-long learning and experience</title>
<p>The concept of professional trust has often been linked to respect, but also to recognizing the competence of others. In reality, this is usually a one-way process from physicians to nurses. The nurses we interviewed felt that they were the only ones who had to prove that they had competences. In the nurse-physician relationship this inter-professional trust is often achieved by experience and time. Enhancing competence, sharing clinical decisions and respecting others’ opinions are important conditions that build respect for professional dignity. We found that nurses were eager to achieve competence through education, life-long learning and experience, because they felt that education and competences were important prerequisites in order to be considered with respect and dignity by other health professionals. </p>

</sup> professional autonomy means ‘having the authority to make decisions and the freedom to act in accordance with one's professional knowledge base’; however, professional clinical autonomy is a complex concept and it has various definitions. Expressing professional dignity was linked to the capability of showing autonomy in making choices in one’s own scope of practice, especially in hospitals, and we found that professional autonomy fostered professional identity and was tied to the expression of more confidence, self-respect and self-esteem by nurses. </p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011414966">26</xref>
</sup> in this case of nurses, is closely linked to and integrated with professional dignity.</p>
<p>We found that dignity was the expression of humanity, being listened to, showing respect for others, and trust. These are key values that involve the integrity of every human being, independently of the role played in society. From our research, important ethical factors emerged, such as: honesty, kindness, generosity and courage. These are manifestations of an intrinsic character of human dignity, a universal value that belongs to every person simply because people are human beings, and they go beyond specific professional roles. </p>
<p>Respect of others<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0969733011414966">57</xref>
</sup> becomes a key element that changes relationships of power and empowerment in health care environments and fosters nursing professional dignity. Respect emerged a particular concept of nursing professional dignity connected to vocation as a motivational factor in nursing, which was seen by nurses as a double meaning concept that could give high recognition and professional dignity, but could be perceived by the general public and some nurses as a stereotyped issue, related to a non-autonomous role that suggested a lack of professionalism.</p>

<title>Limitations </title>
<p>Our study was focused on describing the elements characterizing nursing professional dignity according to nurses’ points of view and though some of the factors that emerged are well explored in literature, others need more careful analysis and are still to be discovered. The fact of not having a clear definition of nursing professional dignity hindered the interiorization of the issue. Our conclusions are partial, because to have a broader view of the issue and build a more comprehensive definition of nursing professional dignity, it is imperative to figure out different factors describing the topic in different countries and health settings. Nursing professional dignity could be analysed from other points of views: physicians, other health professionals and above all nursing students who have to be fully aware of the implications of this concept for their future work. The topic could also be assessed by patients in hospitals and in community settings or could be analysed more deeply in the media. Using focus groups can distort the issue by uneven discussion of the issue. Having conducted the study only in one area of Italy is also a limitation that we hope to overcome shortly with planned replication studies in other European countries.</p>
<p>Further investigation and replication of the study are necessary in other parts of the world to better understand the topic of professional dignity in nursing. Our own study will be conducted in the UK in 2011–12. However, we encourage researchers in various parts of the world to concern themselves with the topic in order to formulate a definition of the phenomenon in the first instance. The long history of nursing in the shadow of the medical profession, and the present world-wide concerns about shortages of nurses constitute a potent need to understand some of the reasons why nurses feel (and often are) undervalued, and what the profession can contribute actively to change these perceptions and realities.</p>

<p>Future developments of this research suggest that the concept of vocation as a motivational factor for nursing, which is a concept historically found in the helping professions and nursing in particular, have to be seen as a concept with a double meaning: that foster nursing professional dignity but, at the same time, are linked to old cultures where nursing profession was regarded as subordinate to other professions. </p>

<p>The organizational environments of the settings included in our study, with their low staffing levels, time constraints, and non-specific duties, did not promote quality or respect for the dignity of others. In many ways, the Italian environment, where the study was carried out, was not adequate, mainly because the organizational settings were hierarchical, with overwork and limits on autonomy, and significant nursing shortages.
