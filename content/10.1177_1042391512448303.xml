<abstract>
<p>Few robust engineering approaches currently exist to assess flame spread performance of interior finish materials for a range of source fires, in support of compartment fire hazard analysis. As a step toward closing this gap, a simplified approach for assessing (a) the propensity for a material to support self-propagating flame spread and (b) the extent of flame spread for a range of source fire conditions has been developed. In addition, a general approach for integrating the output of the simplified flame spread analysis into a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been developed to predict the overall fire growth and spread hazard for a passenger rail vehicle compartment.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1042391512448303" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fire development in a passenger rail vehicle will be influenced by the size and location of the source fire, the type, amount and characteristics of fuel available to burn (e.g. interior linings, seating materials and contents), vehicle configurations, and other passenger-related items that may be carried onboard. Any given combination of these parameters can significantly affect the ultimate fire size. Factors such as the effects of adjacent materials on fire spread and growth, the potential for flame spread away from the fire origin, and ventilation conditions must also be considered. For instance, a fire initiating on the floor adjacent to a stainless steel panel and away from any seats will not likely grow to a significant size because of the absence of fuel. However, a fire on a seat directly adjacent to a clear plastic advertisement panel that extends upward to a plastic laminate ceiling panel may result in significant flame spread and a large ultimate fire size.</p>
<p>Although computational analysis is commonly used to help simulate fires in passenger rail vehicles, the typical focus is to assess vehicles in tunnels having associated ventilation requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1042391512448303">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1042391512448303">3</xref>]; the initial stages of the fire development in such environments are often not considered. In part, this approach is driven by past vehicle fires in tunnels and a desire to understand the potential severe case fires for ventilation needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1042391512448303">2</xref>]. However, if the vehicle fire hazard assessment is based solely on past rail and tunnel fire experience and does not consider the specific characteristics of the vehicle in question, opportunities to reduce the maximum heat release rate (HRR) of the vehicle by reducing the overall contribution of the vehicle materials or through other options might be missed. In addition, from a risk and security management perspective, such approaches may not provide sufficient means to help assess the potential for source fires of various sizes to lead to full vehicle involvement. For these analyses, a better understanding of the propensity for interior materials to support flame spread, and the ability to better incorporate flame spread into the computational analysis, is needed. Although this need has been recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1042391512448303">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1042391512448303">4</xref>], little has been published regarding tools and approaches to address the initial stages of fire spread and development in passenger rail vehicles.</p>
<p>As a step toward better understanding of the relationship between source fire conditions (size, location), properties of interior lining materials (e.g. walls and ceilings), and the propensity for growth to full-vehicle involvement, research has been conducted that considers these factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1042391512448303">5</xref>]. Key outcomes of this research include (a) development of a ‘go/no-go’ screening approach for assessing the propensity of interior lining materials to facilitate self-propagating flame spread using material property data from a laboratory apparatus, (b) development of a simple formula-based engineering tool to assess initial flame spread, and (c) development of a method to incorporate the flame spread characteristics into a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. In this study, the laboratory apparatus is the cone calorimeter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1042391512448303">6</xref>], which is a readily available and economical test methodology that supports consideration of a wide range of heat fluxes, while the CFD model is fire dynamics simulator (FDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1042391512448303">7</xref>]. The screening tool results in the calculation of a value referred to here as the ‘b-parameter’, which is indicative of a given material’s propensity to spread flame or self-extinguish.</p>
<p>While a similar approach is described in work aimed at validating FDS against bench-scale (single burning item) and full-scale tests using cone calorimeter data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1042391512448303">8</xref>], the approach outlined here provides a process for engineers to follow in the hazard assessment of existing vehicles and for material selection in new vehicles. The current analysis demonstrates the utility of using the b-parameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1042391512448303">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1042391512448303">10</xref>] and simplified upward flame spread modeling for initial screening, and indicates how burner surfaces can be utilized within FDS to simulate the concept of flame spread in a compartment. This approach is applied following the steps outlined below and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1042391512448303">Figure 1</xref>.

If final conclusions regarding the fire hazard of the proposed materials can be derived based on the calculated b-parameters and this simplified flame spread modeling, and there are not other fire hazard concerns (such as unique geometrical arrangements or ventilation factors often found in the complexity of passenger trains), analysis is complete.

<sec id="sec2-1042391512448303"><title>Illustrative example</title>
<p>The application of the analytical approach outlined above will be demonstrated in the remaining part of this article through a practical example aimed at showing how one can assess the relative fire hazard associated with interior lining materials in a passenger rail vehicle. It should be noted that the example reflects materials that are commonly used in passenger rail vehicles and typical vehicle design parameters. Its purpose is to demonstrate the analysis methodology that has been proposed, and is not intended as a source for input data to support fire modeling or analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1042391512448303">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1042391512448303">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The present section defines the basic premise of the illustrative example; subsequent sections will refer to this example in order to demonstrate the concepts being discussed.</p>
<p>For this example, assume an urban rail operator is adding a series of new vehicles to their system. Tunnel and station fire and life safety features (suppression, smoke exhaust, etc.) are not being upgraded, so the new vehicles must be designed with attention to the constraints of the existing fire and life safety systems. In particular, smoke control systems are sized to address fire scenarios with maximum total HRRs no larger than 11 MW, and these systems cannot be upgraded. The rail vehicle design team has narrowed the choice of interior wall and ceiling linings to two glass-reinforced polymer (GRP) material options. Full-scale fire tests of these materials in the vehicle installation are not possible within the design budget or schedule. The materials being considered are labeled GRP A and GRP B for the purposes of this analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1042391512448303"><title>Identify fire scenarios</title>
<p>As revealed from assessing past events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1042391512448303">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1042391512448303">5</xref>], a wide range of fire scenarios may be anticipated in passenger rail vehicles. To help determine the scenarios of concern, a fire threat, vulnerability, consequence and risk assessment (TVCRA) may be warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1042391512448303">12</xref>]. A fire TVCRA would consider sources of potential ignition, initial fuels and resulting initiation fires (threats), the potential for propagating the initiation fire within the vehicle (vulnerability), the impact of the growing/developed fire (consequence), and where desired, an assessment of the probability of event occurrence (risk). For the purpose of this article, the focus is limited to assessing the potential of an initiation fire to ignite interior finish materials, the ability of those materials to propagate flame spread once ignition occurs, and the contribution of the interior materials to the total HRR (vulnerability and consequence assessment).</p>
<p>Assuming that one has identified the fire threats of concern, one then needs to assess the potential for ignition of secondary fuels: in the context of this article, interior lining materials. In order to quantify whether an initiating fire is likely to ignite adjacent lining materials, the thermal exposure resulting from the initial fire needs to be considered. To evaluate whether a material will ignite under a given fire exposure, the material’s critical heat flux (CHF) must be reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1042391512448303">13</xref>]. CHF is the minimum heat flux at or below which a material does not generate sufficient combustible vapors to support combustion. Quintiere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1042391512448303">14</xref>] describes how these parameters and others can be derived from small-scale test data. Dembsey and Williamson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1042391512448303">15</xref>] describe the value of estimating the critical ignition source strength for predicting flame spread potential.</p>
<p>Different combustible materials require different levels of incident heat flux in order to ignite. In some cases, the required heat fluxes may not be possible given credible design fires. It is important to review the likely fires within the vehicle being studied in order to understand the hazards they present to the lining materials.</p>
<p>As part of the fire TVCRA, the engineer will have to characterize the source fire(s) of concern, estimate the heat flux exposure to the target surface generated by the source fire(s), assess the potential for ignition of the secondary fuels, and assess the propensity for the fire to continue to develop and spread. Various approaches for estimating the heat flux to a target surface are readily available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1042391512448303">14</xref>]. Although there are many items that might be considered, at the scale of interest for this approach, the source fire heat flux is expected to be the dominating factor. As such, key steps include estimation of the heat flux(es) at the target, the exposure time(s) at the estimated heat flux level(s), and the shape and area of the exposure.</p>
<p>For the example used here, the source fire consists of several bags of trash on the floor against a wall of the vehicle. Such a fuel load is representative of a mixture of combustible materials contained within a relatively small fixed volume, as may be typical of items carried on to a passenger rail vehicle. This is modeled as a fire HRR of approximately 500 kW which results in an incident heat flux to the wall of 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup> over a rectangular area of height 1 m and width 0.6 m; further discussion is provided in Appendix C. In this scenario, the wall is considered to be the initial material burning. Flame spread to additional surfaces (i.e. ceiling, floor and seats) is incorporated through the use of CFD analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1042391512448303"><title>Material flammability characteristics</title>
<p>Once the source fire has been characterized, the next step is to determine whether the interior lining materials are vulnerable to flame propagation and fire development. Given a focus on flame spread, information is required regarding the properties of vehicle materials as outlined above. Such properties can be obtained from cone calorimeter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1042391512448303">6</xref>] test data. These data are used as part of a first-order ‘go/no-go’ screening tool that involves evaluation of the b-parameter to help determine, if different vehicle lining materials are likely to support flame spread at various heat flux levels. For any representative heat flux, independent of initial conditions, if the b-parameter is greater than zero, the flame is predicted to accelerate and spread; but if the b-parameter is less than zero, the flame is predicted to decelerate and eventually extinguish itself. By assessing a material’s b-parameter at various heat fluxes, a first-order assessment of flame spread potential under different source fire and compartment conditions can be obtained.</p>
<p>The b-parameter, as shown in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1042391512448303">1</xref>), utilizes parameters measured or derived from cone calorimeter results. The theoretical basis of this equation can be found in the work of Cleary and Quintiere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1042391512448303">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1042391512448303">10</xref>].

Where, <inline-formula id="ilm1-1042391512448303"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-1042391512448303"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>·</mml:mi></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>″</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the average HRR per unit area (kW/m<sup>2</sup>), <italic>t<sub>ig</sub></italic> is the time to ignition in the cone calorimeter and <italic>t<sub>bo</sub></italic> is the measured burnout time. (For the purposes of this study, <italic>t</italic><sub>end</sub> is measured as the time to flame out, time when the HRRPUA &lt; 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, as further discussed below.)</p>
<p>A cone calorimeter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1042391512448303">6</xref>] heat release rate per unit area (HRRPUA) graph for each tested incident heat flux is needed to develop the input for b-parameter calculation. Geometric instabilities, cellular flames and extended tail-like results can affect the analysis results. Cellular flames, which are physically observed and recorded during each cone calorimeter test, can represent unstable flames that flash during tests. Long tail-like results at the end of a cone test are due to non-uniform or edge burning that result in extended values and burning times. This tail-like behavior can lead to lower HRRPUA averages, if not identified and omitted. To account for these behaviors, each test is independently analyzed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1042391512448303">Figure 2</xref> shows derived cone calorimeter HRRPUA results for a representative FRP material at a heat flux of 25 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. Average HRRPUA can be determined via integration from the observed ignition time to the time when the HRRPUA becomes less than 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, as utilized in this analysis to reduce the effects of unstable flames.
<fig id="fig2-1042391512448303" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Representative material – 25 kW/m<sup>2</sup> cone calorimeter results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1042391512448303-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Variations in the cone calorimeter setup, testing methodology and approaches for post-processing of data may influence results, and the engineer must consider these impacts and validate the approach used, as required.</p>
<p>After <italic>t<sub>ig</sub></italic>, <italic>t<sub>bo</sub></italic> and average HRRPUA are observed or derived from tests, the b-parameter value can be calculated from equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1042391512448303">1</xref>).</p>
<p>The b-parameter is used to compare GRP A and GRP B utilizing characteristics measured in the cone calorimeter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1042391512448303">6</xref>]. In this instance, it is important to quantify the tendency of the material to spread flame at a range of heat fluxes likely seen from initiation fires observed in rail cars. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1042391512448303">Table 1</xref> shows average HRRPUA values for GRP A and GRP B at cone incident heat fluxes of 15, 20, 50 and 75 kW/m<sup>2</sup> with the respective b-parameters. It can be seen that GRP B has positive b-parameter values for all heat flux levels, indicating that it has a tendency to spread flame. This is especially true given heat flux values in excess of 20 kW/m<sup>2</sup> for which strongly positive b-parameter values are calculated. The b-parameter calculated for a heat flux exposure of 15 kW/m<sup>2</sup> is not definitive, and thus would likely warrant further review. However, unlike GRP B, GRP A exhibits negative b-parameters given a heat flux of 20 kW/m<sup>2</sup> or less. Even at a heat flux level of 75 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, the b-parameter calculated for GRP A is less than that calculated for GRP B given a much lower heat flux (20 kW/m<sup>2</sup>).

<p>Results such as those presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1042391512448303">Table 1</xref> can be used as a screening tool in identifying likelihood of a material to spread flame in an acceleratory manner or simply to extinguish itself. Owing to the uncertainty in measurements and calculations, it is important to note that b-parameter values furthest from zero provide more definitive results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1042391512448303">16</xref>], where maximum b-parameter uncertainty is estimated to be 0.7 full scale.</p>
<p>Appendix A provides b-parameter data sets for various materials found in passenger rail vehicles and further illustrates the usefulness of the screening tool.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1042391512448303"><title>Flame spread tool</title>
<p>If the b-parameter screening analysis indicates that a material has a propensity to propagate flame spread, additional vulnerability assessment is warranted. To support this, a simplified upward flame spread model based on the work of Mowrer and Williamson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1042391512448303">17</xref>] was developed to represent the initial flame spread on vehicle lining materials. It should be noted that flame spread is a complex phenomenon, and certain bounding conditions and assumptions have been made in this simplified model. Notably, the model uses only parameters measured in small-scale tests (i.e. the cone calorimeter) and equations that model flame height, pyrolysis height and burnout height. Front velocities (e.g. the flame spread velocity) can also be developed from this model, and HRRs are calculated from the spread results to better understand the fire hazards.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1042391512448303">Figure 3</xref> illustrates characteristics of upward flame spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1042391512448303">17</xref>].

If the heat flux is sufficient to ignite the wall material, the flame extends up the wall, in turn emitting a flame heat flux, <inline-formula id="ilm3-1042391512448303"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math3-1042391512448303"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>″</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> to the virgin fuel above. For the purposes of this model, preheating caused by convection and radiation from the upper gas layer is ignored.</p>
<p>The idealized heat flux distribution reveals the potential heat fluxes involved, assuming that the flame heat flux up the wall is constant. For the purposes of this study, the incident heat flux used in the cone calorimeter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1042391512448303">6</xref>] is also used as the external heat flux as well as flame heat flux. This is a reasonable approximation because the incident heat flux in the cone calorimeter is not significantly affected by the flames formed under the cone. See Appendix B for additional discussion relative to wall heat fluxes and cone calorimeter heat fluxes.</p>
<p>A model of the illustrative example was created to demonstrate how these parameters relate to one another and how they change over time. It is important to note that flame spread along the wall is concurrent flow flame spread which is considered one-dimensional, while the actual assumed flames for the model are two-dimensional in terms of a planer flame orthogonal to the wall. To be able to use concurrent flame spread simulations to calculate HRR curves, particular attention is given to the overall pyrolysis and burnout areas. Details on pyrolysis and burnout fronts used in the area calculations are provided in Appendix B.</p>
<p>As a simplifying assumption, the pre-heat and spread areas are based on expected burn patterns. In this case, assuming a source fire located directly adjacent to a wall, one might expect vertical flame spread up the wall, fanning out in a semi-circular and T-shape manner upon reaching the flat ceiling, if the ceiling material is combustible (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1042391512448303">Figure 4</xref> and Appendix B). With this assumption, developing burning area up the vertical wall is relatively straightforward because initially only the source fire width is required. Lateral spread across the wall in the initial growth phase is expected to be comparatively minimal and is neglected during prediction of the initial flame spread. If continued flame spread is predicted, and therefore CFD analysis is called for, more complex lateral flame spread can be considered at that stage.
<fig id="fig4-1042391512448303" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Representative flame spread.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1042391512448303-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Along the interface of the wall and the ceiling, a region of wall area will experience lateral flame spread. The depth of this region below the ceiling can be estimated as 0.08 <italic>H</italic>, where <italic>H</italic> is the ceiling height [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1042391512448303">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on these assumptions, HRR values are established using pyrolysis areas based on <italic>x<sub>p</sub></italic> − <italic>x<sub>b</sub></italic>, with the following:</p>

<p>With this approach, the source fire is described through definition of the fire geometry height and width, the length of time that the source fire burns (<italic>t<sub>bs</sub></italic>), and the incidental heat flux imposed on the wall. For the sake of simplicity, the length of time that the source fire burns (<italic>t<sub>bs</sub></italic>) is assumed to be equal to the length of time that the initial wall materials burn (<italic>t<sub>bo</sub></italic>).</p>
<p>Appendix B provides example calculations that demonstrate negative and positive b-parameter effects.</p>
<p>Continuing the illustrative example, the above methodology was applied to review initial flame spread behaviors of GRP A and GRP B. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1042391512448303">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1042391512448303">6</xref> provide example results that show the positions of the flame front, pyrolysis front and burnout front as a function time, as well as the predicted HRR curves for the two GRP materials given an incident heat flux of 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup>.
<fig id="fig5-1042391512448303" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Flame spread analysis results – GRP A with 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup> exposure. GRP: glass-reinforced polymer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1042391512448303-fig5.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig6-1042391512448303" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Flame spread analysis results – GRP B with 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup> exposure. GRP: glass-reinforced polymer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1042391512448303-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As can be seen in the figures, both materials support flame spread given a heat flux exposure of 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. However, GRP A exhibits a lower calculated average HRR per unit area than GRP B, and thus the peak HRR for GRP A is lower than that of GRP B. The pyrolysis front for GRP B reaches the ceiling (at 3.0 m) and then the far side of the ceiling (at 6.0 m) more quickly than the pyrolysis front of GRP A does. This indicates that under these conditions, GRP B can be expected to spread flames more rapidly than GRP A. However, the data also suggest that both of these materials are likely to spread flame when subjected to certain levels of heat flux. Therefore, these results are not sufficient to draw conclusions regarding the conformance of these materials to the defined performance criteria and further modeling is required to determine the consequences of this initial flame spread within the rail vehicle.</p>
<p>The modeler must evaluate the precision of this methodology for the specific situation, and must evaluate the impact of the assumptions that are inherent in the approach. Adaptation of this methodology for a specific case will require validation by the modeler.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1042391512448303"><title>Integration with CFD</title>
<p>If application of the simplified approach outlined above is not conclusive regarding the potential fire consequences given the vehicle interior materials (e.g. if continued but not rapid flame spread is predicted), CFD analysis may be required in order to develop overall fire hazard conclusions. Also, geometries and arrangements that may be expected to support flame spread (closely spaced combustible seats, combustible materials lining the ceiling, etc.) may require advanced analysis even if the simplified approach indicates that the initial burning material represents a limited flame spread hazard. A large number of possible material and geometrical conditions are possible in the design of passenger rail vehicles; therefore the engineer must consider these factors when evaluating the need for advanced analysis.</p>
<p>An approach using FDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1042391512448303">7</xref>] has been developed which includes the following steps:
<list id="list2-1042391512448303" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Determine CFD model input parameters needed to simulate various design fires.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Simulate various design fires within the vehicle using CFD for each material.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Model initial flame spread as a series of burners that together recreate the flame spread behavior predicted by the simplified analysis outlined above.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Model combustibility characteristics of adjacent surface materials by distilling material parameters from cone calorimeter data, in this case through application of a GA analysis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use CFD results to inform the material choice and to help understand the overall fire hazard associated with the vehicle.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The application of CFD to rail vehicle fire hazard modeling and the use of a GA for estimating FDS parameters is discussed in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1042391512448303">19</xref>] and will not be expanded upon here. However, FDS has not been validated for flame spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1042391512448303">2</xref>]. As such, the unique approach taken here is to manually specify initial ignition and flame spread on the wall materials in the FDS model to match the predictions generated by the simplified flame spread calculation. A series of burner surfaces is implemented in the model; these burners are sized and prescribed with individual HRR curves such that, at any given time, the extent of the pyrolysis area and the total HRR are equivalent to that predicted by the initial flame spread analysis.</p>
<p>To obtain necessary pyrolysis data for the illustrative example materials, cone calorimeter tests were carried out according to ASTM standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1042391512448303">6</xref>]. Thermocouples were added to the apparatus to record specimen front and back surface temperatures needed for determining FDS input parameters; temperature data obtained using an infrared camera were not used in developing material properties due to concerns related to the accuracy of the camera in tracking surface temperatures when flames are present. The specimen holder was modified so that temperature measurements could be taken inside the sample (where possible) and on the back face of the sample. GRP A and GRP B were exposed to heat flux levels of 15, 20, 50, and 75 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1042391512448303">Figures 7</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1042391512448303">10</xref> show derived average HRRPUA values based on the 20 and 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup> tests.

<p>Several input parameters in FDS are used to describe the composition of solid surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1042391512448303">7</xref>].

<p>The parameters <italic>cell size factor</italic> and <italic>stretch factor</italic> allow the user to increase the numerical stability of the pyrolysis calculation. By setting cell size factor to 0.5, the surface mesh cells that are used to calculate heat transfer are reduced in size to half of the size calculated through a default rule in FDS. This rule bases the surface mesh cell size on the square root of the material’s thermal diffusivity. Setting the stretch factor to 1.0 forces the surface mesh cells to be uniform in size.</p>

<p>With the GA-derived input data, an FDS model of an example vehicle was developed to evaluate the impact of the two GRP materials. Within the FDS model, all wall and ceiling surfaces, including door interior linings, were composed of the GRP material being considered. Seats were assumed to be comprised of steel structures with plastic sides and backs and carpet-like seat surfaces. The flooring was assumed to be a rubber-based flooring material. This combination of materials is typical of certain types of subway or other short-trip passenger rail vehicles, and has been used here to illustrate the overall approach without introducing a large number of different materials. Other types of rolling stock, such as commuter rail vehicles, may have different combinations of materials that can contribute to fire spread; each material present in a vehicle should be evaluated for its potential to contribute to overall fire growth.</p>
<p>Since the seat and floor materials are not being evaluated here, the different models evaluating GRP A and GRP B assumed the same seat and floor materials. All windows were assumed to be glass. Breakage of windows was not modeled. It was assumed that all doors on one side of the car were open during the modeled fire scenario. This represents a condition where the car is parked at a station with the doors on one side open. End car doors were assumed to be closed. Effects of station geometry and fire protection systems (such as sprinklers and smoke control) were not modeled because the intent of the analysis was to evaluate the effect of different materials on overall fire size. The smoke was assumed to vent from the train to an infinite volume. Based on past research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1042391512448303">20</xref>], it has been shown that for fire sizes and materials typical of passenger rail vehicles, flame spread is predicted well with a grid resolution of 50 mm, which was used in this case.

<p>The initial temperature for the ambient environment (inside and outside of the train) and all surface boundaries has been specified as 20°C. The spread of smoke has been calculated using large eddy simulation techniques, in which the large-scale eddies are computed directly and the sub-grid scale dissipative process is empirically modeled. This means that the large-scale mixing taking place between the plume/smoke layer and the ambient air is computed directly through first principles by the CFD model. For the purposes of this demonstration, a single initiating fire on the floor of a vehicle directly adjacent to a wall has been considered. An analysis of a proposed rail vehicle should include attention to a range of design fire scenarios.</p>
<p>The materials being considered here have strongly positive b-parameter values when exposed to heat flux values on the order of 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. In order to cause this level of heat flux, the CFD analysis has assumed that a 500 kW source fire occurs in contact with a wall of the vehicle (a 500 kW fire is representative of several bags of trash).</p>
<p>As discussed previously, initial ignition and flame spread on the wall materials in the FDS model were manually specified using burner surfaces to match the initial flame spread model. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1042391512448303">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1042391512448303">14</xref> show how the initial HRRs prescribed in FDS align with the curves calculated during the initial flame spread analysis. Additional material ignition beyond the prescribed initial burning area is predicted by FDS using the material properties determined through the GA analysis.

Again, alignment is seen between the HRRs from FDS and that from the flame spread model for initial stages of burning. The HRR is later seen to continue to increase in the FDS simulation as adjacent materials are determined by FDS to ignite.

<p>GRP A results in a peak HRR of approximately 9.2 MW and exhibits a defined decay phase shortly after the peak HRR is experienced. GRP B results in a maximum HRR of approximately 12.0 MW with a sustained HRR of approximately 11.0 MW subsequent to the peak for the remaining simulated duration. Because the maximum HRR was the focus of this analysis, the simulations were not run until complete burn-out. The example analysis provided here illustrates that the installation of GRP A will result in a maximum HRR of less than the stated criterion of 11.0 MW. The other material considered, GRP B, results in a maximum HRR of approximately 12.0 MW, which exceeds the stated limit.</p>
<p>While reviewing this example, it should be cautioned that this analysis has not specifically addressed life safety within the rail vehicle or associated tunnels or stations, nor has it considered the possible impact of additional design initiating fires, vehicle layouts, or ventilation conditions. Each of these factors may need to be considered when carrying out this type of study for an actual project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1042391512448303"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>This approach uses a combination of small-scale test data and simplified analysis tools (b-parameter calculation and simple flame spread model). Each component has associated uncertainty. At the small-scale test level, differences in materials (from one sample to another), variations in data collection from different test apparatus, and potential errors in reporting may exist. Development of common protocols for testing, apparatus calibration, and data reporting would help reduce uncertainty in the data. Because the simplified analysis techniques (b-parameter and flame spread model) are intended to provide a simple screening approach, some of the complexity associated with factors such as vehicle geometries were ignored (e.g. it was assumed that walls and ceilings were flat with no obstructions). Geometric details were later incorporated with the integration to CFD. Sensitivity analysis could be undertaken to better understand the importance of these issues relative to the level of accuracy needed in the screening approach, and modifications could be made if appropriate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1042391512448303"><title>Summary</title>
<p>An approach has been developed that illustrates how small-scale test data, coupled with a simplified flame spread model, can be used to screen interior finish materials in passenger rail vehicles for their propensity to spread fire given a range of the source fires as part of a fire TVCRA. This yields a simple ‘go/no-go’ screening approach for assessing material flame spread potential. If the screening tool is inconclusive or indicates that a material is likely to readily spread flame, a more advanced analysis is required. To consider more complex behaviors associated with a growing fire within a vehicle, this article has also demonstrated how initial flame spread can be modeled in the CFD program FDS using a series of burner surfaces that together represent the total HRR and extent of flame spread as a function of time as predicted by the simplified analysis tools.</p>

<p>Calculation of the b-parameter for a range of materials can result in a comparison of the relative propensities of these materials to support flame spread. In turn, this information can be used to inform decisions regarding material choices in the context of established performance criteria.</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1042391512448303">Figure 16</xref> indicates that the sample called GRP Gel Coat will accelerate flame at lower heat fluxes than the sample called plywood ceiling with white laminated front and timber grain back.

<p>Mowrer and Williamson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1042391512448303">17</xref>] show that the flame spread rate is related to the advancement of the pyrolysis front
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-1042391512448303"><label>(5)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1042391512448303-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>The characteristic flame spread time, <italic>t<sub>ig</sub></italic>, is the time to ignition from each of the cone calorimeter tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1042391512448303">6</xref>]. Obtaining <italic>t<sub>ig</sub></italic> directly from cone data further simplifies the model by directly incorporating parameters such as the ignition temperature and thermal inertia. Once burnout initiates, the rate of fuel burnout can be shown from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1042391512448303">17</xref>] to be as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula6-1042391512448303"><label>(6)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1042391512448303-eq6.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>From these initial conditions, the model is divided into near field and far field zones. The near field zone is comprised of the source fire with its incident heat flux and geometric configuration. The heat flux represents the time period from the source ignition, <inline-formula id="ilm5-1042391512448303"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math5-1042391512448303"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ig</mml:mi> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, to the source burnout time, <inline-formula id="ilm6-1042391512448303"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math6-1042391512448303"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The characteristic geometry considers the height and width of the initial source fire, <italic>x</italic><sub>poh</sub> and <italic>x</italic><sub>pow</sub>, respectively. This model assumes that initial wall ignition is based on the source fire.</p>
<p>The far field zone is comprised of the wall flame zone above the source fire. The time to ignition, <italic>t</italic><sub>ig</sub>, based on the forward zone heat flux, is taken directly from the cone calorimeter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1042391512448303">6</xref>]. The far field zone will also consider <inline-formula id="ilm7-1042391512448303"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math7-1042391512448303"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>·</mml:mi></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>″</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <italic>t<sub>bo</sub></italic> based on the pyrolysis zone heat flux. The losses from the forward heating zone are not accounted for. The pyrolysis zone heat flux is assumed to be the prescribed cone calorimeter insult heat flux plus an additional 20 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, from the flaming sample. For example, if the prescribed heat flux insult in a given cone calorimeter test is 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, the total assumed pyrolysis zone heat flux is 70 kW/m<sup>2</sup> (50 kW/m<sup>2 </sup>+ 20 kW/m<sup>2</sup>). The prescribed cone calorimeter heat flux represents an external insult, while the additional 20 kW/m<sup>2</sup> accounts for the insult to the material surface from the flames that result from the burning of that material. The engineer should evaluate the appropriateness of this approach for each material being considered.</p>
<p>As a simplified approach, <inline-formula id="ilm8-1042391512448303"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math8-1042391512448303"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <italic>t<sub>bo</sub></italic> are considered to be the same value, taken as the burnout time observed in the cone calorimeter.

<p>This value depends on the material being studied and must be chosen on a case by case basis. The value of 0.01 m<sup>2</sup>/kW was chosen to demonstrate this method as cone tests were conducted consistent with ASTM E 1354 which requires an insulation substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1042391512448303">10</xref>].

<p>As a proof of concept and to illustrate the effects of negative and positive b-parameter values, both small and large representative source fire scenarios were analyzed. The analysis considered an example FRP gelcoat material under different levels of external incident heat flux. Incident heat flux levels of 25 and 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup> were chosen to represent a range of sizes of initial fires occurring in proximity to the material being considered. This range was chosen based on the work by Beaulieu and Dembsey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1042391512448303">23</xref>] where inward total heat flux levels were compared to flame heights for wall fires. Given a fire located against a wall, an inward total heat flux of 25 kW/m<sup>2</sup> is representative of a flame height of approximately 0.5 m, while an inward total heat flux of 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup> is representative of a flame height of approximately 1 m. These heat flux values were assumed for source fires located directly adjacent to a wall or for wall fire flame spread.</p>
<p>Given an incident heat flux of 25 kW/m<sup>2</sup> in the cone calorimeter, a b-parameter value of −0.15 was calculated. When the same material was exposed to an incident heat flux of 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, the resulting b-parameter was calculated to be 0.19. Cone calorimeter results for the 25 kWm<sup>2</sup> and the 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup> fire scenarios can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1042391512448303">Table 5</xref>. The small source fire scenario is representative of a waste paper basket with an HRR of approximately 40 kW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1042391512448303">24</xref>] that is assumed to be located directly adjacent to a wall. It is reasonable to use this source fire scenario in the context of rail vehicles because waste paper baskets tend to contain crumpled up paper, debris and other miscellaneous trash that may be involved in an intentional or accidental fire in a passenger rail vehicle. The wall area exposed to the fire’s incident heat flux (25 kW/m<sup>2</sup>) was assumed to be 0.5 m tall by 0.3 m wide.

<p>The larger source fire scenario is representative of 0.5 L of gasoline on vinyl flooring with an HRR of approximately 500 kW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1042391512448303">24</xref>]. This scenario is representative of an intentional scenario involving a flammable liquid. The fire in this case was assumed to be 1.0 m tall × 0.6 m wide. With an HRR of approximated 500 kW, the incident heat flux to the wall was ∼50 kW/m<sup>2</sup> and was applied to a wall area ∼1.0 m tall × 0.6 m wide.</p>
