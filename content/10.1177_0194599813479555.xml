<abstract>
<p>An emerging focus on measurement and reporting of health care quality indicators calls for a sound evidence base that otolaryngologists can use to support clinical care decisions. In addition to traditional clinical trials, practitioners are heeding results of high-quality comparative-effectiveness and health services research analyses to better understand the complexity of disease epidemiology, care variation, health care costs, and surgical utilization for common conditions. Many national publicly available data sources exist for use in clinical research that may be of benefit for the academic and clinical otolaryngologist. The strength and value of these sources vary depending on the intended use or research question. The purpose of this commentary is to introduce and provide an overview of some major national and administrative databases, highlight potential strengths and limitations of these data, and suggest applications for use in advancing the care of our patients in otolaryngology.</p>

<body>
<p>Producing high quality clinical research in surgical specialties is an ongoing challenge. There are many limitations related to cost, ethics, and recruitment in performing traditional randomized controlled or even prospective trials to evaluate the overall efficacy of surgical procedures. Within otolaryngology, much of the current evidence base relies on observational cohort studies, sometimes retrospective, which are most frequently conducted within single institutions using relatively small and local patient populations. Although these studies offer important individual contributions to our knowledge of otolaryngic diseases, the pursuit for more collective, higher-powered, and better quality research for our field remains at times elusive. This pursuit is strengthened by the current health care climate’s push to reward patient-centered, evidence-based medicine delivered by subspecialists.</p>
<p>To study disease and surgical procedures on a population level, researchers in many specialties employ detailed health services research analyses to investigate effects that cannot be clearly measured through traditional patient-based clinical research. There are a multitude of publicly available databases that may be used toward this end, some of which could have particular relevance for research in otolaryngology and surgery. These databases may rely on nationally distributed surveys or administrative data collected by a variety of methods. Although useful and informative, these data may often seem inaccessible and overwhelming. The objectives of this commentary are to describe key uses of national and administrative data in clinical research, provide an overview of some commonly used pediatric databases, and highlight strengths and limitations of using these data to answer clinical questions. This commentary is meant to serve as an overview and not a comprehensive review; interested investigators are encouraged to directly contact the authors or database administrators for specific questions regarding their own research. Furthermore, this brief introduction is derived from the authors’ experience, and we caution that the content and governance of these databases are often times in flux and evolving.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599813479555">
<title>Why Do We Use Survey or Administrative Data?</title>
<p>Administrative data have several unique and powerful applications in both health services research and also in clinical quality improvement. In contrast to single-institution cohort studies, these data can be used toward epidemiologic investigations, where disease prevalence, procedural incidence, or geographical variation is more broadly investigated. Several sources use national surveys that are weighted to represent either the overall US child and adolescent population or the overall US health care visit/encounter distribution, thus allowing nationwide estimations. Other sources rely on administrative data reported by a collective group of hospitals.</p>
<p>National or administrative data can be used to more closely study health service utilization. An investigator may evaluate quantity of ordered laboratory/radiographic tests or procedures performed per discharge, perhaps specifically to look at overuse or variability among providers, institutions, and regions. Similarly, these data can be powerful for investigation into health disparities pertaining to utilization of services, as basic demographics for each patient discharged are often provided at some level, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and insurance. Administrative data can evaluate relationships of these different variables, for example, how specific demographics, diagnoses, or procedures are related to resource utilization.</p>
<p>Administrative databases often include variables related to comorbid conditions or outcomes. Through these data, an investigator might identify macro-level trends that cannot simply be identified in single institution studies. Furthermore, aggregate data can help with magnifying disease trends from an epidemiologic standpoint.</p>
<p>Administrative data may also help identify important mechanisms related to clinical quality improvement. They may allow research into adherence to evidence-based clinical care guidelines. Administrative data are a common source of investigation into health care costs. However, databases typically supply actual charges with perhaps a cost-to-charge ratio for the facility. Additional quality indicators that may be identified through various national or administrative data include variables such as length of stay, length of procedure/recovery, or readmission for a particular diagnosis.</p>

</title>
<p>Included in this broad aggregation of hospital administrative data, which is sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), are the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), which includes inpatient data (all ages) from a national sample of over 1000 hospitals, and the Kids Inpatient Database (KID), which is a nationwide sample of pediatric discharges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813479555">1</xref></sup> These databases are perhaps the most commonly used in surgical specialties. The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) is another HCUP national database. In addition, HCUP is inclusive of several other databases, often state specific, such as the State Ambulatory Surgery Databases (SASD) or State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD).</p>
<p>Data elements included in NIS, KID, and other HCUP databases are extremely detailed and expansive. Data are collected based on hospital encounters or visits and do not include individual patient identifiers. Use of these data is strongly enhanced with statistical consultation to appropriately access the data and to help provide an understanding of the implications of the data. Many varying hypotheses can be tested, and longitudinal trends in cost and resource utilization can be examined for specific disease codes. A notable advantage in use of HCUP databases is that data from the national sites (NIS, KID, NEDS) are weighted so that national estimates can be performed.</p>

<title>Medicaid: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medicaid.gov">http://www.medicaid.gov</ext-link>
</title>
<p>Medicaid, in addition to the expanded Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), provides health care to over 40 million children in the United States, over half of whom live in low-income settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813479555">2</xref></sup> Medicaid and CHIP are programs of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Analysis of Medicaid and CHIP claims data can provide insightful, patient-specific analyses for children with preidentified diagnoses. Medicaid claims data are powerful for longitudinally assessing health service utilization and medication usage for low-income children, potentially before or after a specific procedure, but they cannot easily be used to interpret clinical decision making or health outcomes. Medicaid and CHIP data are typically accessed at the state level. The ResDAC (Research Data Assistance Center) is available for detailed questions regarding use, administration, and access to Medicaid and individual state CHIP data. The ResDAC also provides the Medicaid Analytic eXtract data files (MAX), which are national versions of the Medicaid data.</p>

<sec id="section6-0194599813479555">
<title>Pediatric Health Information System</title>
<p>The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) is produced by the Children’s Hospital Association (formerly named the Child Health Corporation of America). The PHIS contains data from 43 large freestanding children’s hospitals across North America, detailing records of a variety of encounters such as inpatient admissions, ambulatory surgical cases, or emergency department visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813479555">3</xref></sup> Data are entered from medical records and billing systems on a quarterly basis. A particular advantage to use of PHIS data is that investigators can perform longitudinal data analysis using unique patient identifiers. A limitation of PHIS data is that it represents a “convenience sample” and is not weighted or nationally representative. Moreover, use is limited only to employees of the 43 participating hospitals (contact <email>phis@childrenshospital.org</email>).</p>

</title>
<p>This registry of perhaps the most comprehensive collection of trauma data in our country provides tremendous opportunity for our specialty to use a longstanding, sophisticated database to analyze trends in trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813479555">4</xref></sup> Data are collected through specific abstraction forms specifically created for the purpose of this registry; these data are not used for administrative purposes.

</title>
<p>This extensive database has emerged as a powerful platform to aggregate patient outcomes and to identify quality improvement opportunities. Sentinel successful work in the Veterans Administration hospitals almost 2 decades prior demonstrating improvement in hospitals that were outliers based on the NSQIP methodology led to the extrapolation of this platform to adults and now to pediatric hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813479555">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813479555"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813479555">7</xref></sup> ACS NSQIP is actually a quality abstraction program where data is abstracted from cases of participating hospitals, and is not designed per se for administrative use. Access to the data from NSQIP is coordinated and can be approached via contacting the NSQIP administrators. Of note, otolaryngology is the first surgical specialty to launch a pilot data collection within the NSQIP Pediatric program. In addition to collecting standard quality, morbidity, and mortality outcomes related to otolaryngic procedures, the pediatric otolaryngology pilot assesses specialty-specific outcomes related to airway reconstruction, otologic procedures, neck abscesses, and tracheotomy. Preliminary data will be available from this pilot in July 2013.</p>

</title>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics is the principal agency monitoring health statistics in the United States. The NCHS acquires data using multiple methods, including personal/household survey or interviews, provider interviews, acquisition of birth and death certificates, standardized physical examinations, and use of medical and laboratory records. The NCHS data are markedly different from what is acquired through administrative claims or registry data. The NCHS collects information on a wide array of health indicators and patient populations to inform current public health priorities and initiatives. Data collected by the NCHS are strategically sampled to broadly and equally sample either the US population or US distribution of health care visits/encounters, and therefore are weighted to be nationally representative.</p>
<p>The NCHS sponsors a variety of surveys; some surveys are still active, and some are complete but still useful and accessible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813479555">8</xref></sup> Certain provider-based surveys (which evaluate medical visits/encounters), such as the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) or the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), may be more useful for surgical specialists. In addition, the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (NSAS) has provided national data on ambulatory surgical encounters in the United States (1994-1996 and 2006).</p>

Moreover, the broader goal of Hospital Compare is to provide impetus for inclusive hospitals to improve the quality of care they deliver and ultimately to improve outcomes for patients. The metrics that are tracked and reported upon are varied and run the spectrum of care from process-of-care measures to complications to spending per admission.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This commentary summarizes commonly used major administrative and national survey databases that could be applicable for use in otolaryngology research; indeed, a search by the reader will reveal that the majority of the databases discussed herein have been used for otolaryngology research. Prior to use of any of these databases, we encourage the investigator to contact the source data administrators to understand strengths and limitations as well as analytic considerations specific to the data in question. Appropriate application of these data in clinical research can provide important macro-level contributions that will further the quality of research in our specialty.</p>
