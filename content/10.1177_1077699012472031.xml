<p>Every journalism student and reporting teacher should study <italic>Getting It Wrong</italic>, in which Joseph Campbell, a professor in the School of Communications at American University, separates the myth and legend from reality in ten legendary news stories. He presents extensive documentation to support his analysis.</p>
<p>He begins with the supposed telegraph exchange between Frederic Remington and William Randolph Hearst. Remington, a famous artist, was sent by Hearst to Cuba in 1897 to cover the Spanish-American War. Legend has it that Remington wired Hearst that there was no war, and Hearst wired back, “You furnish the pictures, and I’ll furnish the war.”</p>
<p>There is no supporting evidence for this anecdote, which Campbell calls “perhaps the hardiest myth in American journalism.” Copies of the supposed telegrams are not known to exist. Of course, the anecdote was partly believable because Hearst did, indeed, promote the war with Cuba.</p>
<p>Campbell moves on through nine other well-known stories that are somewhere between myths and hoaxes. The one that seems to qualify clearly as a hoax is the story of Private Jessica Lynch, the captured supply clerk with the U.S. Army in Iraq. Her unit made a wrong turn and ended up in hostile territory on March 23, 2003; her Humvee was ambushed and shelled, and crashed. She was seriously injured in the crash and taken to a hospital by the Iraqis. She was rescued from the hospital nine days later by a U.S. Special Operations unit.</p>
<p>This much was true, but little of what the media offered after that was. Lynch became the great hero of the Iraq War, compared to Annie Oakley and Sgt. York. It started with a <italic>Washington Post</italic> story two days after her rescue that said she had shot several Iraqi and “fired her weapon until she ran out of ammunition.” The <italic>Post</italic> story cited unidentified U.S. officials who said Lynch had continued firing after she had been wounded. If the <italic>Post</italic> said all this on the basis of what government officials said, that was good enough for other media, which blew Pvt. Lynch into a full-blown American hero. Lynch became at that point the most widely publicized member of the U.S. armed forces.</p>
<p>Yet, the fact was that Lynch had not been wounded, and did not fire her weapon because it jammed. It was true that she was very seriously injured in the Humvee crash. The <italic>Post</italic>’s sources have never been identified, but Campbell believes it was not people in the Pentagon. He also points out that her celebrity status did not end when the truth was disclosed.</p>
<p>The other eight stories he mentions also involve overstating the significance of an event because of the failure to report and the willingness to accept somebody else’s answer. The stories:</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012472031" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Orson Welles’s Halloween “War of the Worlds” broadcast did not create national panic. Evidence of the panic was largely anecdotal and limited.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Edward R. Murrow was not the first journalist to challenge U.S. senator Joseph McCarthy, and by the time he did, McCarthy’s favorability ratings had been sliding for three months.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The <italic>New York Times</italic> did not suppress a story about the planned invasion of Cuba at the request of President John F. Kennedy. The <italic>Times</italic> ran a story about it ten days before the invasion, and at least a handful of stories and columns after that before the invasion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Walter Cronkite’s closing comment on a February 1968 broadcast that the Vietnam War was “mired in stalemate” and that the United States should seek a negotiated settlement did not lead President Lyndon B. Johnson to say, “If I’ve lost Cronkite I’ve lost Middle America.” It also did not cause a massive shift in public opinion about the war. That shift was already in motion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There was more to Watergate than Woodward and Bernstein. Other reporters wrote significant stories, and the work of the FBI, prosecutors, congressional investigators, and the judicial system all played a part.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The national panic in the 1980s about an assumed epidemic with babies whose mothers had been using crack cocaine assumed effects on the babies that were never proven. It led the <italic>Journal of the American Medical Association</italic> to publish a commentary deploring the rush to judgment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Coverage of Hurricane Katrina was seriously flawed by uncorroborated stories about snipers firing at medical personnel and helicopters, roving gangs, and sexual assaults on children. Once published, these erroneous reports were picked up by other media.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Campbell’s overall message is that better reporting would have avoided misinforming the public on these stories. All journalists should heed that message.</p>
