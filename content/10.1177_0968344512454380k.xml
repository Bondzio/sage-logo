<p>The Middle East owing to its oil reserves has always been one of the hot spots of modern history. Any inter-state war in this region, because of its effect on the global oil market, is bound to bring the extra-regional big powers into the fray. The Iran-Iraq War (1980–8) was a case of inter-state war at one level and at another level an indirect duel between the two big powers of the Cold War era. And these two levels occasionally interacted with each other. The regional ramifications of this decade-long conflict, the nature of politics involved, and the diplomatic fallout are studied in the volume under review by the British historian Rob Johnson.</p>
<p>The initial Iraqi offensive in late 1981 and early 1982 failed not only because of tactical inadequacies of the Iraqi armour and air force but also because of Saddam Hussein’s faulty strategic thinking. Saddam thought that once Iraq occupied parts of south-west Iran, Tehran would be willing to come to the negotiating table. Instead, Tehran gave the call for a long war and spurned Saddam’s offer of peace in 1982.</p>
<p>This attritional conventional war also involved unconventional warfare. For instance, the Kurds demanded independence from the Sunni Iraqi Ba’athist Party. And the Kurdish insurgency in northern Iraq tied up a large number of Iraqi military assets. Baghdad could not forgo this region because three-fifths of its oil revenue came from northern Iraq. In addition, Iran provided financial and military aid to the Kurdish guerrillas. Iran wrongly assumed that the Iraqi Shias (who constituted 55% of the population) would support Shia Iran. Iran sponsored the Jaish-i-Mahdi in southern Iraq. In the end, nationalism proved to be more important for the Iraqi Shias.</p>
<p>Johnson rightly notes that the Iran-Iraq War was a broken-backed war with alternating periods of stalemate and high-intensity confrontations. While the Iraqi armed forces had a technological lead, the Iranians had the advantage of a greater demographic base and to an extent revolutionary enthusiasm which motivated many young Iranians to fight and die for the greater cause of Islam. Many Iranians regarded Ayatollah Khomeini as a Mahdi (a messenger of God). Against the ‘human wave’ assaults by the Iranians, the Iraqis depended on air power, armoured vehicles, and artillery strikes. Later, in an attempt to break the ‘will to war’ of the Iranians, Saddam resorted to Frog-7 and Scud missile strikes (some even with chemical weapons) against Iran’s cities. While the USA supplied Iraq, China supplied Iran. And the USSR supplied both combatants as it suited Moscow. In the end, mutual exhaustion of both belligerents and a strong stand taken by the USA and its west European allies to protect the Persian Gulf region to ensure the west’s oil supply brought the war to a close.</p>
<p>Johnson categorizes the Iran-Iraq War as a limited conflict which later escalated into total war. ‘Total war’ is an ideal term. But let us see how far the indices of <italic>totale Krieg</italic> apply in the case of the Iran-Iraq War. The casualties of this conflict were about 1 million people and the financial cost came to about $1190 billion. Iraq spent 50% of its GDP on the war, and one-tenth of the Iraqi male population was mobilized for the armed forces. Tehran even recruited child soldiers. In fact, the debilitating financial burden of the war forced Saddam to invade Kuwait later in order to acquire its oil reserves.</p>
<p>One of the principal aspects of total war is complete destruction of the enemy state. Iran’s objective was truly revolutionary. It aimed to get rid of secular leaders such as Saddam Hussein from the Islamic world. However, at least on Saddam’s part, his goals were limited. He never visualized total destruction of Iran. His aim was to annex the oil-rich Khuzestan province with its Arab population in south-west Iran.</p>
<p>To sum up, Johnson rightly says that the Iran-Iraq War was a war of illusions. Moreover, the author correctly shows that the land war was more important than the sporadic conflict in the Persian Gulf. Since mining of the Persian Gulf by the Iranians threatened the west’s oil supply, hitherto western commentators have given undue importance to the fighting in the Gulf sector. Credit is due to Johnson for writing an information-rich narrative of one of the greatest conflicts of the post-Second World War era.</p>
