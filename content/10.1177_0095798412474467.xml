<p>Many Black boys in the United States live in communities teeming with violence, drugs, and other risk factors seemingly endemic to low-income and low-resource neighborhoods. The impediments to their success are multifaceted, as they must cope with the lingering effects of historical racism, both overt and institutional, along with the threats of death and incarceration. However, the historical legacy of African American resilience combines with these phenomena to create unique cultural and societal experiences that help shape Black boys’ lives and worldviews. While the impediments listed have created an image of Black males as an “endangered species,” it is important to recognize that in some cases these cultural experiences can serve as a protective factor against negative outcomes. Consequently, enrichment programs that target or enroll African American boys should, by design, acknowledge and celebrate these distinguishing experiences. Over the years, many cultural programs have been introduced to prepare Black boys for the challenges they will face as men and to prevent them from experiencing negative life outcomes. This is the goal of <italic>Brothers of Ujima</italic>, an insightful book detailing a cultural enrichment program for adolescent and preadolescent African American boys (ages 10-14 years). This age range stands as a particularly important developmental stage, coinciding with other life changes such as transitioning from elementary to middle school or from middle to high school.</p>
<p><italic>Ujima</italic> is a Kiswahili word that means “collective work and responsibility.” A central aspect of <italic>Brothers of Ujima</italic> is helping African American boys realize their goals. Through the concept of <italic>Ujima</italic>, this program stresses the importance of teaching young Black males to work together to achieve goals for not only themselves but for their families and communities as well. <italic>Brothers of Ujima</italic> uses the principles of <italic>Nguzo Nane</italic> (the seven principles of Kwanzaa coupled with <italic>Heshema</italic>—respect) to facilitate the healthy transition of African American adolescents from boys to men. The principles specified below provide the foundation for this transformative cultural enrichment program.</p>

<p>One of the most important benefits of this program is that it affords African American boys the opportunity to discover new talents and interests. During the program’s sessions, boys are organized into <italic>jamaas</italic> (small groups), which are designed to symbolize a family unit. A <italic>mzee</italic> (respected elder) facilitates each <italic>jamaa</italic>. For 2 hours, the <italic>mzee</italic> leads his <italic>jamaa</italic> and addresses varied topics and risk factors that potentially impede success, including low academic achievement and life course expectations, exposure to drugs, and involvement in delinquent activities. These sessions are also guided by various themes such as <italic>jamaa</italic> building, health and fitness, community, myths, history, life goals, challenging situations, conflict management, and leadership.</p>
<p>The program has several objectives, including the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0095798412474467" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To increase knowledge and appreciation for African and African American culture</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To encourage critical awareness of myths and stereotypes of African Americans presented in the media</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To develop positive ways of coping and handling conflict</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To increase awareness of adult role models within the African American community</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To accomplish these objectives, the program helps participants</p>
<list id="list3-0095798412474467" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Learn about and from successful African American male role models</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Learn about and participate in African cultural activities and traditions</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Become aware of stereotypes and racism and how to deal with them in community and media messages</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Become aware of negative behaviors and their consequences</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Engage in team building activities and discussions designed to promote positive relationships with other males</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Learn the Eight Principles for African American living (<italic>Nguzo Nane</italic>) and discover how they can be applied to one’s functioning in everyday life in home, school, and community</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The book is a comprehensive step-by-step facilitator’s guide on how to institute <italic>Brothers of Ujima</italic>. It includes guidance on program logistics, personnel selection, and community buy-in. Each session starts by paying homage to African traditions, in part by evaluating a thought-provoking African proverb. Additionally, the corresponding section in the facilitator’s guide includes well-defined goals, material lists, and procedural notes. Black boys enrolled in this program will have an opportunity to develop conflict mediation skills, health and fitness routines, and creative analytical skills, to enumerate a few. Role-playing scenarios embedded within this cultural enrichment program evidence astute understanding of the challenges facing Black boys. These scenarios predispose Black boys to conflict between peers and authority figures, which in turn helps fortify them against those challenges they will face as young men.</p>
<p>The program also provides a platform for African American boys to critically assess their community and, when appropriate, encourages actions that positively affect the community. The design and duration of the program is well suited to be instituted as an estival rite of passage, but flexible enough to be used in conjunction with established after-school curricula. The culturally relevant and adaptable activities included in this facilitator’s guide dispel myths and empower future leaders, simultaneously binding the youth to each other, their communities, and their history. The authors of <italic>Brothers of Ujima</italic> elucidate the nexus of individual and community successes and in doing so, coupled with their Afro-centric program content, offer an actionable remedy for the undesirable effects of drugs, violence, and hopelessness currently affecting far too many African American communities.</p>
