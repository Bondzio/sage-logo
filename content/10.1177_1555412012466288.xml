This project traces two fantasies (tether and accretions) that combine into the genre of the role-playing game, providing a rough timeline for the evolution of these fantasies in videogames. It also engages in close readings of individual works that highlight important aspects of each fantasy. This study can serve as the basis for a formal analysis of games that is reinforced by their divided nature (game and story). Fantasy can serve as an intermediate term between game and story, and as such can incorporate the player into a game’s formal analysis. I also argue that videogames teach us that fantasy is a better term for describing media convergence than story. Note that “fantasy” here does not refer to the literary genre but rather to a dynamic psychological concept related to play.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fantasy</kwd><kwd>videogames</kwd><kwd>genre</kwd><kwd>RPG</kwd><kwd>history</kwd><kwd>theory</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>When the <italic>Steam Addicts</italic> website prompted game developer Andrew Spinks to react to claims that his game, <italic>Terraria </italic>(2011), was a rip-off of <italic>Minecraft</italic> (2010), Spinks responded: “People need to understand that <italic>Minecraft</italic> isn’t a game anymore, it’s a genre” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555412012466288">Terraria Mania, 2011</xref>). Spinks suggested the games had “gameplay mechanics” in common but did not otherwise articulate the shared generic boundaries—nor has much precision been offered by other publications circulating this interview.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1555412012466288">1</xref></sup> Perhaps, this elliptical moment was no more than part of a broader tradition of discomfort over thinking and talking critically about entertainment media. But perhaps there is something about the shared features of any two games that resists expression. <italic>Game Informer</italic> called both games “addictive world-building sims,” echoing the notion that their chief shared feature is gameplay. To an extent, this is true. Even though one game is three-dimensional and employs a first-person camera while the other looks like a 16-bit-era side-scroller, playing both games involves the modification of a virtual environment—digging, chipping, cutting, and building structures using items, tools, weapons, and armor all crafted from the game world’s own harvested materials. The case could be made, however, that each game’s gameplay differs drastically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1555412012466288">2</xref></sup> Nevertheless, some key feature connecting these games encourages us to look past differences in both gameplay and the games’ surface-appearance—something, as the games’ press coverage implies, that is easy to sense but difficult to put into words. Curious readers are left wondering which aspects of a genre, if any, <italic>Minecraft</italic> and <italic>Terraria</italic> share, and whether that genre began with <italic>Minecraft</italic>. Playing both games will allay most curiosity, while still leaving unarticulated that which makes these games so similar. The discrepancy between what is felt and what is said here provides an opportunity to explore the role fantasy plays in the structure of videogames.</p><p>This article argues that two play fantasies—one a “tether” and the other an “accretions” fantasy—bind <italic>Terraria </italic>and <italic>Minecraft</italic> together and set them apart from other “sandbox”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1555412012466288">3</xref></sup> games. Let me provisionally define a tether fantasy as the pleasurable process of oscillating between feeling safe and feeling exposed, dwelling on the boundaries that separate the two. In turn, an accretions fantasy can be defined as the pleasurable process of correcting a weak or vulnerable body by accruing objects from the world of gameplay. <italic>Minecraft</italic> and <italic>Terraria</italic> are unique because they are currently on the vanguard of games designed primarily around tether and accretions fantasies. But while recent games are making these fantasies visible in new ways, both the tether and accretions fantasies have played important roles in videogames for most of gaming’s history. The two fantasies usually combine to form the rough “genre” of the “role-playing game” (RPG),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1555412012466288">4</xref></sup> which, in recent years, has taken on new, hybrid forms that are increasingly difficult to categorize. This article introduces new terminology in the field of videogame studies that will provide new ways to think and talk about games.</p><p>As part of a larger project on fantasy, technology, and play, tether and accretions fantasies are key to developing a language for talking about videogames both in isolation and in relation to one another. The terms can explain the ease with which players move from one game to the next, as well as from one medium to another—transitions that pose intellectual problems for scholars who remain unacquainted with a game’s central fantasies through play. Fantasy is the means by which the game transcends its dividedness as an object of representation and simulation. It is also the mode of the player in play. Perhaps most significantly for the study of games, I argue that a fantasy, which can exist discursively, socially, and can flow between media, can be described and recognized as a formal structure, to allow game analysis to incorporate play into the study of the text.</p><sec id="section1-1555412012466288"><title>The Debate</title><p>In the past decade, emerging theories for new media, such as discussions about network technology, new forms of sociality, digital art, and the connectedness of all digital media, have had the effect of sometimes eclipsing conversations about how to define the videogame, such as the ludology–narratology debates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1555412012466288">5</xref></sup> By considering tether and accretions fantasies, this article will add to the still crucial line of inquiry into those features of videogames that make them interesting and unique. This move occasions a brief return to conversations about game, story, and play.</p><p>The most compelling proponent of the study of narrative in games is Henry Jenkins, whose term, “transmedia storytelling,” is both insightful and flawed in its presentation of narrative as the force that binds media together in a convergence culture. In 1995, Jenkins and Fuller freed the term “narrative” from conventional novelistic and cinematic associations by noting that a game’s surface narrative is usually detached from the situation of gameplay—such as the “Princess-rescue plots” in <italic>Super Mario Bros.</italic> games. Jenkins and Fuller pointed to an underlying narrative of exploring a new world’s dangerous exoticism, breached by the “frontier” of the right-side of the scrolling screen. This story of travel into unknown space remained significant throughout play while the rescue plot faded away.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1555412012466288">6</xref></sup> But whereas Jenkins and Fuller pared down the diegetic dimension of the videogame in pursuit of medium-specificity, Jenkins’ more recent work, <italic>Convergence Cultures</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555412012466288">2006</xref>), de-emphasizes differences across media by noting narrative’s pervasiveness. For Jenkins, <italic>Enter the Matrix</italic> (2003) rather uniquely told aspects of the transmedia story left untold by the film trilogy and the comic book. This shift toward seeing continuity between game and story, a neo-narratology, returns to a time when the surface narrative passed for the only narrative of play. The narratological argument is emboldened today by the game industry’s formal efforts to merge cinema and videogames (see the <italic>God of War</italic> series, the <italic>Uncharted</italic> series, <italic>L.A. Noire</italic>, <italic>Mass Effect I &amp; II</italic>, <italic>Dragon Age II</italic>, and so on). My own paper is partly an intervention on this trend toward putting “story” in the production and study of videogames. I argue that while story sometimes frames and thereby serves fantasy (and fantasy governs play and the consumption of videogames) most narration is extraneous and can often impede or even undermine the fantasy.</p><p>A second line of inquiry, perhaps best represented by Juul (<italic>Half-Real</italic>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555412012466288">Galloway (2006</xref>; <italic>Gaming</italic>), incorporates into its logic the division between play and story that neo-ludologist arguments perceive in their object. The narratology/ludology debate is resolved by claiming that both sides have held some truth. Videogames are both story and game, both “ruled” and “fictional,” and in them we find both “diegetic machine acts” and “non-diegetic operator acts,” as well as other permutations that never cohere into a whole. Galloway’s professed purpose was to cast as wide a net as possible for considering videogames—and indeed, games are so varied technologically, visually, culturally, and in terms of their conception of the player, that to attempt to speak for all of them at once is an unfathomable challenge that inevitably results in a divided approach the terms of which remain stuck in their respective academic corners.</p><p>Proto-ludologist, Dan Fleming (<italic>Powerplay: Toys as Popular Culture</italic>), a decade earlier, also tackled videogames as divided texts. Following Marsha Kinder's (<italic>Playing with Power</italic>) path, which approached games through both cognitive psychology and cinema-psychoanalysis, Fleming posited an audience divided along lines of spectator/player, a division that itself reflected an object divided as both representation and geometry (or play). The trajectory of these particular works, left largely undeveloped since, strove to conceive of the videogame as a reunified object, to think about both halves at once by imagining play as a rapid oscillation between the two poles of fiction and underlying geometry (rules, physics, and so on). In these accounts, the player spends most of her time in the “extended middle”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1555412012466288">7</xref></sup> of the oscillation. This article gives a name to that oscillation, proposing conscious fantasy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1555412012466288">8</xref></sup> as the term that can mediate between game (rules, challenge, pattern, and serendipity) and story (causality, progression, and identification).</p><sec id="section2-1555412012466288"><title>The Tether Fantasy</title><disp-quote><p>There is a rhythm in experience that can easily be observed, the rhythm of concentrated and dispersed attention, of directed and undirected thought, of objective and subjective experience…. Like those simple animalculae that stretch out long pseudopodia into the surrounding water in search of food, retiring afterwards into a state of apparent passivity while digestion takes place, so does the child seek experience, and, having come into contact with reality in some form, retires within himself to understand and consolidate what he has acquired. (Dr. Ruth Griffiths, 1935, quoted in Klinger, <italic>Structure and Functions of Fantasy</italic>, 47)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1555412012466288">9</xref></sup></p></disp-quote><p>There is a pleasure in extending and contracting the self across space. McLuhan, of course, famously conceived of media as extensions of the body—“autoamputation” is a word that incorporates a contraction into the extension. But this pleasure also lies in moments that stretch our conception of the word “medium,” such as the diurnal ebbs and flows of sleeping and waking, the expansionist colonial drive to discover, conquer, and control the unexplored world, or even the emotional power of an improvised shelter during a freak thunder storm. Seen as an activity that structures play, gratifying oscillations of this kind constitute a “tether” fantasy, which stages encounters with boundaries separating a series of meaningful binaries: the known and the unknown, the safe and the unsafe, the friendly and the hostile, the light and the dark, and life and death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1555412012466288">10</xref></sup> I have chosen the term “tether” for its plurality of meanings: it is the device that keeps a pet fixed to a home space, the astronaut fixed to the space station, or, in psychological terms, the child emotionally fixed to the parent. The word invokes the umbilical as much as the electrical cord—and videogames, I suppose, are midway between these two sites. “Tether” ultimately describes the importance in fantasy of maintaining some sort of a connection (regardless of the form it takes) with a feeling of safety associated with a place where one withdraws from a harsh, critical, or dangerous world. There is pleasure in anticipation for both sides of the fantasy so that the thrill of an exposure is balanced with the reward of respite. Being “caught” in a state of exposure becomes a playful act—even if this play is repetitious of an originally horrifying event.</p><p>In geographical terms, the fantasy often involves the notion of frontier. In domestic terms, it invokes Jenkins’ use of “home base” and “home region,” the spaces children explore from the safety (and constraints) of home.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1555412012466288">11</xref></sup> In psychological terms, this play stretches back before subjectivity—it could even be called a “womb fantasy,” the desire to return to that autotelic encapsulation prior to birth, or to the womb-like continuity with the bosom of the mother.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1555412012466288">12</xref></sup> While once a crisis of identity and exposure, the threat of separation is, in a tether fantasy, a reliable, infinitely repeatable source of pleasure. D. W. Winnicott and Melanie Kline theorized the importance of transitional objects, those first partial objects that allow a developing psyche to avoid confronting me/not-me divisions. The transitional object is supposed to be outgrown, “decathected,” even though it stands as the model for play and creativity in adulthood (the safe space where the ego is allowed to be what it wants without questions about what it is). Thinking about a tether fantasy encourages us to consider everyday routines<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1555412012466288">13</xref></sup> as creative acts permeated by a playful impulse: as we leave one site of adult identity for the next—whether it is bed, the cubicle at work, a car, or home—we are leaping from stabilization into a space of expanded possibilities, and back toward unifying encapsulation. The tether fantasy is a transitional behavior that no individual outgrows.</p><p>The tether fantasy finds elaboration in a range of videogames. Such games include those that offer players the ability to adopt the perspective of a small, enclosed space that looks out onto (is connected with) the world from a secure viewpoint. A second group of tether games orients action around a domestic hub players move away from and return to repeatedly throughout play. Perhaps most common, a third group of games involves stretching out compulsively into dangerous and exotic spaces and testing the elasticity of that tether. In such games, the safe place of withdrawal takes on many substitutive forms and is sometimes reduced to abstract oscillations between the field of play and a customizable menu of “stats.”</p></sec><sec id="section3-1555412012466288"><title>Little Corners and “Home-Base” Tether Fantasies</title><p>Nintendo’s <italic>Chibi Robo</italic> (2006) transforms a suburban house into a vast exotic space for exploration. In the diegesis, a small, metallic robot (several virtual inches tall) explores the seemingly massive home of a quirky, middle-class family. In play, players pick up trash, clean stains, and collect objects around the home, slowly seeing more of its spaces and unlocking moments that signal narrative progression. This game provides a unique and pointed example of a tether fantasy because of the black electrical plug the mechanized protagonist drags behind his body (the plug is half the size of the robot’s entire form). Every robot action requires energy—walking, running, climbing, spraying water, or gliding with a helicopter blade across gaps between furniture—and players, through Chibi, must manually insert the plug into outlets to recharge power before running out entirely. The plug is a literal tether Chibi carries around to signify dependence on electricity—a burden that stretches the division between rules as limitations and as affordances in play. The game’s tether fantasy is a valence, a charge that play acquires in those final few steps taken toward that distant outlet, nearly exhausted. This charge is the exhilaration at feeling restored very near the point of total fatigue and then oriented again toward the horizon of new spaces beyond what is known. Like the plug always trailing behind Chibi, this ebb and flow of the tether underlies all other activities in the game.</p><p>The robot slowly acquires better “batteries” and other items so that the range of explorable space (and power-consuming actions) expands. But at the end of each day he must always return to his own tiny “Chibi House,” a small dwelling for the robot where he recharges, purchases body upgrades, and plans the next day’s activities. Exploring the family’s living room from the Chibi House becomes like investigating the outside world through the security of a small corner of space. Inside the house, Chibi is always plugged in—safe but immobile. Outside, Chibi is free but tethered: the harsh world contains threats, puzzles, and constant demands for energy that send players back to home base. The home-base tether fantasy connects what happens outside the Chibi House with the restorative endeavors inside—a permeability of boundaries that is always part of the fantasy. One can find a similar permeability in games like <italic>Beyond Good and Evil </italic>(2003), <italic>The Legend of Zelda: the Wind Waker</italic> (2003), <italic>Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime</italic> (2005), and others that manage to offer up a home-base tether from within a set of constraining industry practices that undercut this fantasy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1555412012466288">14</xref></sup></p><p>The first such constraining practice could be cast in technological terms: the tendency to load discrete areas like the insides and outsides of houses separately, a prioritization of photorealistic graphics over the continuity of play. This approach leaves the boundaries separating inside and outside absolute and unassailable, totally detached from the rest of the world. In order to pass through them, one must suffer montage. Home-base in a tether fantasy must offer potential exposure but safely and manageably—this is why few zombie games offer a home-base tether fantasy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1555412012466288">15</xref></sup> In a home-base tether, enemies can still attack but must first filter through a bottleneck, come through a gate or doorway—players of cooperative first-person shooters automatically understand how a game’s spaces exert a pressure on the action they stage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1555412012466288">16</xref></sup></p><p>The second constraining practice is the convention of narrative progression in quest games, where home is a representational space left behind very early in play. Driven forward by plot, players are not given reason or opportunity to dwell in any one space for very long. In order to sustain the home tether fantasy, a game must, as in <italic>Chibi</italic>, give players frequent incentive to leave and return. Independent projects, <italic>Minecraft</italic> and <italic>Terraria</italic>, eschew both graphical and narrative conventions in favor of play designed around a home-base tether fantasy.</p><p>In <italic>Minecraft</italic>, simply being inside a structure looking out can activate a tether fantasy (not so for <italic>Terraria</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1555412012466288">17</xref></sup>). Players can watch the sun set over explorable and modifiable terrain through a window that becomes opaque after dark, as home base comes to rely on artificial, internal lighting like torches or a burning oven. If players are caught outside after sunset, they might spot torchlight through those same home-base windows as they scurry back to safety. Players can install external lighting along a walkway, perhaps, so that “home region” is lit as well—but darkness inevitably encroaches dangerously around built structures, and along with it comes monsters that can be heard stalking the player through walls even when not visible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1555412012466288">18</xref></sup> One monster can explode and tear holes in the player’s base, providing incentive for walls to be thick or made of brick to resist the explosion. The presence of monsters is part of play’s ebb and flow in <italic>Minecraft</italic>: work in the field under sunlight, gathering and exploring, gives way at sunset to a withdrawal inside, to fortification and crafting (at the ovens and workshop tables players are smart to place safely indoors). Once inventory screens are sorted, night play can take the form of internal home renovation or mining deep into the world’s underground cavities for rare ores. There is no tiny black plug in <italic>Minecraft</italic>, but players are loath to wander too far from safety near sunset. The need to return home, for play’s activity to shift focus, inaugurates a tether fantasy. But the continuity of space between inside and outside heightened by the use of dynamic lighting and an acoustic point of view raise the tether fantasy to its apogee.</p><p>What is fascinating about <italic>Terraria</italic> is that it manifests the same tether fantasy as <italic>Minecraft</italic> but with very different formal techniques. <italic>Terraria’</italic>s home base is made meaningful not through a spatial point of view but through game events that force players to defend their territory. Nightfall exerts pressure when, like <italic>Minecraft</italic>, zombies and other monsters attack; home is still a safe place where one can wait out the night. But on some nights there is a “blood moon,” meaning zombies can open doors and come inside. Eventually a massive “goblin army” converges on home base, attacking players and looting hard-won materials. Home is something players must protect as much as home protects them. As the game progresses (narratively), home is less where players withdraw for safety and more a convenient site for storing and crafting important items. The player still acquires a charge when leaving home freshly equipped, oriented toward dangerous, new spaces. But, as a function of play, home wanes in relevance as players acquire powerful new equipment that serves the same insulating function.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1555412012466288">19</xref></sup> The feeling of progress the game offers seems to contend with the pleasure of feeling protected and exposed by returning to and reaching away from home.</p><p>As sandbox games, <italic>Minecraft</italic> and <italic>Terraria</italic> offer players the freedom to either build a home and identify it as such, or else do no such thing. There are built-in incentives in the games’ rules, but many aspects of home seem to emerge naturally, as a negotiation between the player’s expression of taste and the game’s pragmatic requirements. And this negotiation might be, for some, the very point of playing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1555412012466288">20</xref></sup> Zombies that kill the player and the need for ovens and work tables to craft new items (which you can lose if you die) create the need for enclosure and incentivize the placement of a crafting space near by a “spawning” point. But these aspects of the game do not fully dictate how a home is designed, how high (or low) its chambers rest from the ground. YouTube videos display <italic>Minecraft</italic> maps that model famous fictional places from medieval or <italic>Lord of the Rings</italic> universes—massive, walled cities lit brightly and meticulously fortified to keep out malignant lurkers. In my own maps, I tend to build structures that emerge in and through already-existing geographic formations: castle set in mountains, doors on grassy hills leading to an underground bunker, and so on. It is not the case that a home tether fantasy requires customization—but designing your home is an occasion for dwelling on the boundaries that separate it from the world outside. It must be noted that the home’s boundaries take on their meaning not just through customization but by dint of rules (the monsters, dynamic lighting, and physics) governing a game’s spaces. Hostilities manifest themselves in the design of the base built to resist them. In a tether fantasy, the protagonist’s body, rather than serving as the sole site of identification, becomes a vehicle for experiencing the bifurcating boundaries of play.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1555412012466288"><title>Tethers and Accretions in Exotic Spaces</title><p>In each of the games discussed above, the tether fantasy makes use of a domestic hub for reaching out across and withdrawing from the world. But most games built around a tether fantasy do not employ a stable home base. Instead, home is a matter of substitution. Journeys into exotic spaces are framed by sabbaticals into nearby villages, campsites, or save points, where nomadic explorers can train, take stock, and recuperate before setting out again toward the horizon of adventure. The quest narrative compels play to give up the emotionally resonant space of home, leading the player to a series of disposable surrogates. But why is one lured from home in the first place—why embrace the quest? Orrin Klapp would suggest that one embraces the notion of a new “opening” because of boredom, a thirst for challenge, stimulation, and difference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1555412012466288">21</xref></sup> Staying at home can be stultifying—and leaving can change home into something nostalgic. D. J. Porteous suggested that “home, in fact, cannot be understood except in terms of journey” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555412012466288">Porteous, 1976</xref>, p. 387). But tether fantasies in videogames almost always reach out toward something more particular than that open space of the journey.</p><p>The tether’s back-and-forth is usually woven into the fabric of some other material, achieving new valence and the possibility of respite through an intersection with another fantasy: a fantasy of accretions. In the generic format of the RPG, a tether fantasy is best expressed at the moment when the player must momentarily put off the extension into hostile terrain and return to a safe space—this moment expresses the tether’s limit, the greatest distance from safety the protagonist can effect. At the limit of this stretching out, RPGs usually reward players with new accretions that, in turn, augment the capacity of the tether to extend outward. The accretion makes the player feel more powerful, correcting a weakness or limitation, and so stands as a compelling reason why (as well as the means by which) one leaves home. At the same time, the tether is the journey that defers the point of arrival—Jenkins and Fuller note that exploration documentation always spoke of immanent treasure which was never found, the drive to explore trumping the finality of a destination. And one could argue that the ultimate object of any new accretion is the new ventures it occasions. In the RPG, both the tether and the accretion are, to an extent, convertible into the same currency, and it becomes difficult to discuss one fantasy without the other.</p><p>I define an accretions fantasy as the playful reconstitution of an ideal self. In the adult world, the fantasy can touch upon and help motivate self-improvement at the gym, when one identifies with a mirror image reflecting a positive change in the body: muscles conveying strength and movement (dance, martial arts, and new bodily capacities). An accretions fantasy could also mean the accumulation of prestige or wealth, taking solace in one’s social standing. It could be described as the feeling of confidence out of which a tether fantasy can confidently begin—confidence psychologists believe begins in childhood, in play. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555412012466288">Caillois (1958</xref>) has written about childhood games of persevering against difficult odds and finding, in “the depths of grottoes,” treasure in the form of shiny, brilliant metals, resembling toys like the “steelie marble,” or mercury, the “liquid destroyer of substances,” which is stolen “drop by drop, during physics class, risking dread punishment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555412012466288">Caillois, 1942</xref>, pp. 255–256). “These bits of glass, these drops of mercury, these rolling dice, simple images of chance, these tiny and ridiculous windfalls, these valueless vials of waste and odd-ends of adult occupations, but brilliant, rare, difficult to acquire”—reflect, in their form and emotional energy, both the effort exerted to win them, as well as parental prohibitions regarding the boundaries of play. And perhaps most importantly, by hiding treasured objects, the playing child “assures his own life and stows it safely away,” “[basing] his personality on the possession of this imaginary secret” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555412012466288">Caillois, 1942</xref>, p. 258). The hidden treasure augments the child’s sense of self in play, representing power not only in secrets and the autonomy they signify but also through the magical affordances they bring to the body in play.</p><p>Caillois notes about the act of hiding that “the power invested in these objects enables you to go beyond what is normally possible: it permits you to disappear at will, to paralyze from a distance, to subdue without a struggle, to read thoughts, and to be carried in an instant wherever you want to go” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555412012466288">Caillois, 1942</xref>, p. 257). Hiding treasure conceals a piece of the child’s fledgling identity so that fantasies of empowerment can be occasioned through play, based in the possession of a secret space freed from adult oversight, a consolidation of the self that is protected from external scrutiny—or that, in its magical function, subdues such scrutiny. The hiding game where a forbidden object is “guarded in the crook of a tree or locked in a sunken vessel” can serve as the basis for a tether fantasy about making brave ventures into the adult realm from a point of security. And yet, the treasure resists being reduced to an instrument in games of autonomy. In its luster and power to enthrall, the treasure represents thrill and taboo, magic and escape, and becomes a powerful goal in play.</p><p>Tether and accretions games frequently stage ventures into exotic and dangerous spaces in search of treasure that adheres to the player’s sense of self. These accretions projects have many narrative motivations but are consistently fantasies about empowering the protagonist, making his or her body into a weapon and a shield. The body shines with a totemic appeal that aids empowering identifications and becomes the very treasure the player protects and which, in turn, offers fantasies that “go beyond what is normally possible.” Accretions videogames reward play (exploration and combat) with serendipitous “drops,” treasure, magical items, and experience (or ability) points that accrue to the player’s feeling of omnipotence by increasing his or her influence over the game’s spaces. Play becomes tangibly modified by the play that has come before. The “level-up” in the RPG is a controlled release of a feeling of power that the game relinquishes to the player in small amounts, lessening its total store of this sole currency in the world of the videogame.</p></sec><sec id="section5-1555412012466288"><title>Identification in Accretion Fantasies: The Decorator Crab, the Corvette, and the Dispersal of the Self</title><p>Fleming, Kinder, and Jenkins all challenged the notion that players identify with the fictional representation of their avatar. In the same spirit, this article argues that identification is spread out over long durations of play, sometimes relating to depictions of bodies, but sometimes eschewing them altogether. In a tether fantasy, the body is threatened and safe; one identifies with the oscillation between these states. In an accretions fantasy, the body makes good a lack by accruing power from the world; one identifies with the process of becoming powerful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1555412012466288">22</xref></sup> This process is often concentrated in the avatar’s body, a convergence site for a cluster of game mechanisms that channel the player’s intervention into diegetic space. These games that concentrate identification can be broken down into two categories: objects accrue to bodies according to the outside world’s logic or they accrue to a logic implicit in the body itself. But power is not always expressed as a function of the hero’s body. In accretion fantasies that distribute power over a series of menus or many bodies in play, one could say that player identification is dispersed.</p><p>I call accretions games employing concentrated identification according to an external logic “decorator crab” fantasies. It is as if the space of the game exerts a pressure on its ambulatory protagonist, who becomes like a vulnerable sea creature affixing anemones, sponges, and rocks to its shell, acquiring the characteristics of surrounding environments to guard against predators like the octopus, which the anemone will sting. Play brings about diverse accretions that never really assemble into a coherent whole. These objects may reflect their environments of origin or different gameplay mechanisms assembled in a way that cannot cohere into a unified play-identity. A famous example is Link, from the <italic>Legend of Zelda</italic> series. Each venture into a dungeon garners souvenirs that pile up on an inventory screen. At times, Link is a sort of relay for these items, a jack-of-all-trades who represents a vast array of capacities for tackling the puzzles of the game’s dungeons. At other times, he is unified with sword and shield, attacking enemies or roaming the field. The player moves through diegetic space as Link, but all the while holds secret power tucked away somewhere else, like a concealed weapon that belies Link’s generally unassuming exterior. From humble beginnings and empty inventory screens—contrasted by premature encounters with the game’s antagonist—players are hurled by a sense of lack into an extensive collection quest contributing to an image of the body that takes on the power of the spaces it encounters. It is as if the decorator crab fantasy is a way of achieving a feeling of confidence about going out into the world by forging harmony with it. The “Corvette” accretions fantasy, on the other hand, involves negating the world as resistance.</p><p>In the Corvette fantasy, objects are pulled from the game-world and assembled upon (and stylistically integrated with) the avatar’s body. The best example may be Samus Aran (<italic>Metroid</italic>) and her shiny suit of armor. If Link is an eclectic crustacean, then Samus is a well-oiled machine, a tank. Instead of hiding treasure in a menu (<italic>Zelda</italic>) or in a chest inside your base (<italic>Minecraft</italic> and <italic>Terraria</italic>), in the Corvette fantasy the body itself becomes a treasure, a fetishized emblem of power that stands apart from the surrounding world. All of Samus’s treasures mesh neatly in the “Chozo” armor system, accruing to the player’s aesthetic sense of self both in the body’s image and in a matching set of gameplay mechanisms—all of which relate to (reinforce, augment) one another according to a preplanned and cohesive strategy. Occasionally, games employing this fantasy contrive to explain how such perfectly suited items that fit exactly onto the protagonist’s body can be scattered around the world just waiting to be recovered in a collection quest. In <italic>Metroid Prime</italic> (2002), for example, Samus loses several suit functions in an explosion during the prologue and the rest of the game is largely about reestablishing that initial state. Samus must reconstitute her former, ideal self through play.</p><p>Whereas Link bears traces of the worlds he explores, Samus’s quest to acquire her ideal self reveals the extent to which the world was designed for her. Samus’s body becomes a key, her morph ball sliding perfectly into mechanisms that seem to have no diegetic motivation. The game’s world and its play are bent to the demands of an accretions fantasy. When players are not encountering themselves in the environment, <italic>Metroid Prime </italic>takes every chance it can to show Samus’s glossy suit (elevator rides, morph-ball transition animations, and suit upgrades) so that for moments in the game, players float outside of Samus’ first-person point of view (POV) to marvel at the spectacle of her armor. The body is lost to visual possession when control is regained (and the body shifts from a glossy emblem to an unseen but unstoppable combustive force)—and players seek that lost object perpetually, piece by piece, in the game’s many exotic spaces.</p><p>The distinction between “decorator crab” and “Corvette” is subtle but important for game fantasies. It is almost exactly the difference, respectively, between the original <italic>Mega Man</italic> series and the <italic>Mega Man X</italic> spin-off. The original Mega Man famously acquires the weapon of each boss he defeats. While some weapons are useful throughout, each is intended as a weakness for one of the eight unique bosses. Switching weapons changes the color of Mega Man’s outfit from blue to a variety of pastel colors, but the list of weapons do more to mark the places Mega Man has visited than to accrue to his core image—their power is a diversity spread over the game’s weapon menus. As in <italic>Zelda</italic> games, bosses are puzzles the solution to which lies in the tactical deployment of one weapon among many. In the <italic>Mega Man X</italic> series, however, in addition to the collection of boss weapons, players find upgrades predestined for Mega Man X—hidden long ago by his inventor—that significantly alter X’s ability to act in the world. From reducing damage received to altering the frequency with which he can dash or jump in the air, these upgrades accrue directly to the hero’s body in play as well as in appearance. X does not so much reflect his past environments as he builds an idealized version of himself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1555412012466288">23</xref></sup></p><p>While the accretions game can fixate on the virtual body as an image of power, it does not always do so. In most RPGs, an abstract and quantifiable substance mediates between the player and the game world, appropriating identification by progressing over time while the hero’s body remains unchanged. When a character levels up or finds an equipable item, the new accretion prompts a visit to a menu where the modification of power can be visualized, weighed, and organized in relation to other items and stats. A player withdrawing to the menu from the game’s three-dimensional, diegetic space, encounters himself in a kind of numerical specularization. Identification is caught in that relay between the diegetic field of play (withholding accretions) and the menu where players squirrel away what has been won. These trips are often the most exciting and rewarding part of the accretions game—into the menu to unlock an anticipated ability, and back again to the field, for playful, undirected experimentation, which is never fully divorced from those first steps toward the next accretion. Games like <italic>Dungeon Hunter: Alliance</italic> (2009), <italic>X-Men Legends</italic> (2004), <italic>Marvel Ultimate Alliance</italic> (2006), <italic>Castle Crashers</italic> (2008), <italic>Dungeon Siege</italic> (2002), and even <italic>Paper Mario</italic> (2001) use an attribute-point system to coerce players into the menus, again and again, to participate in the modification of their avatar’s burgeoning body.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1555412012466288">24</xref></sup> While not all genres of games use menu screens in this manner,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1555412012466288">25</xref></sup> RPGs subsist on the menu oscillation. Were the project of merging cinema with videogames the sole drive in the industry, one would expect the most cinematic games to dispense with menu systems altogether. The reverse seems to be the case in several of today’s most film-like games, such as <italic>Mass Effect</italic> (2007) or <italic>Dragon Age II </italic>(2011), where narrative shares the stage with the accretions fantasy’s inventory lists and statistics.</p><p>In an RPG, the player’s energy spreads itself across the game’s geography during the many hours that make up the tether and accretions project. But some games articulate this dispersion more directly than others, by replacing the solitary avatar with an unadulterated fantasy of power spreading over space. In Risk-like games, such as <italic>Galcon </italic>(2009), virtual territory is disputed, captured, and applied to the player’s sense of self, which grows in strength as it spreads over the screen. Occupying more territory means one’s armies generate more quickly. Players issue instructions to mobs of forces, such as the plant creatures in <italic>Pikmin</italic> (2001) that swarm whatever lies in their path. Tower defense games like <italic>Plants Vs. Zombies</italic> (2009) or <italic>Tower Madness </italic>(2010) involve stationing a variety of sentries on a map to prevent invasive forces from reaching their goal. Defense games may seem like the inverse of a fantasy of becoming more powerful by spreading out, but as more weapons are assembled, the player’s gauntlet often touches every corner of the map, built outward from a central space of vulnerability. The same dispersal of power across space founds the tactical RPG, such as <italic>Final Fantasy Tactics </italic>(1998) or <italic>Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</italic> (2007). Both games place significant emphasis on the modification of the bodies of heroes, but since there are many bodies (each allowed only one turn per round), players are forced to identify with an interface that directs large groups of bodies to deliberate points on the map. In the beginning, perhaps, the team is concentrated in one corner of the battlefield—but maximizing control over space means spreading out to meet the exigencies of battle.</p><p>And the strategy genre, including “real-time tactics” (RTT) and “real-time strategy” (RTS) games, perhaps as effective as any set of games so far mentioned, subordinates space to an expression of accrued power. Players conquer the map, striving for bigger cities, vaster civilizations, and more armies. The more land a player occupies, the faster resources flow into the coffers, and the more the player is in control. For this reason it is difficult to see a tether fantasy in RTS games. What might be the tentative expansion of a home-base initially—deciding to cut down a nearby forest or build a bridge to explore resources across a river—eventually gives way to a steamroller accretions project that can never again contemplate its own smallness or tolerate any limitations to its expansion. In the beginning, a feeling of vulnerability simultaneously inaugurates a tether and an accretions project. But, as the game progresses, the accretions project compels play to the ends of the map so that the self (through a dispersal of identification) is once again spread over and continuous with all that is known. This fantasy is only reined in by starting a new round of play.</p><p>While accretions games employ a variety of strategies for arranging and using accrued objects, they share in common the pursuit of a feeling of power. This enterprise is set in motion by weak, vulnerable bodies, falls from grace, empty inventory screens, and vast stretches of unclaimed territory looming before a solitary settlement or a tightly bunched group of soldiers. But the fantasy rarely operates alone—instead, it usually enters into a relay with a tether fantasy. In a game like <italic>Pikmin 2</italic> (2004), it is difficult to say whether players dive into dangerous subterranean caverns in search of treasure or simply for the pleasure of being exposed and stretched to the limit. That the game requires spelunking could be enough to justify the anxious, opening phase of the tether fantasy—but the promise of a powerful new accretion sweetens the deal. Perhaps the giant creature guarding the upgrade at the “final floor” of each cave somehow expresses both fantasies simultaneously. The trope of new accretions as reward for overcoming significant challenges, whether these challenges are thought of as tether fantasies or not, is pervasive in the videogame industry: it spans the divide between “hard core” and casual games, as well as between home consoles and iPhone apps. And it crosses the generic boundaries of first-person shooters, action-adventure games, hack-and-slash games, zombie shooters, platformers, and puzzle games. While tether and accretions fantasies were present in those oft-cited progenitors of the fantasy videogame (such as the works of J. R. R. Tolkien or Robert Louis Stevenson), these fantasies are becoming newly visible in recent videogames that seek ways to carry play forward.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1555412012466288">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1555412012466288">29</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec id="section6-1555412012466288"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is a compelling case to be made that games have been influenced, since their beginning, by cinema. But games like <italic>Minecraft</italic> and <italic>Terraria</italic> break with cinematic tradition in the elaboration of a set of fantasies that, historically, stretch back before cinema’s own beginning. These fantasies figured prominently in siege narratives, such as Tudor Jenks’ <italic>The Defense of the Castle</italic>, and in stories about encountering dangerous, new spaces from the safe harbor of some vessel, such as in the works of Jules Verne. One could say the fantasies were spun in the architecture of the medieval fortress itself, in the insular design of settlements constructed in the turbulent times following the fall of the Roman Empire, or in the tensions of frontier life. Perhaps tether and accretions fantasies served as a way to address anxieties over social change stemming from the industrial revolution, especially concerning new communications technology that opened channels into (and thus altered the dynamics of) domestic space. This is one way of understanding “captivity” narratives, like D. W. Griffith’s <italic>The Lonely Villa</italic> (1909).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1555412012466288">26</xref></sup> Staging this film’s traumatic home invasion for pleasure constituted a tether fantasy, and our culture has far from outgrown concerns over the integrity of domestic space. In this sense, the nuclear era and its backyard bomb shelter could be viewed as an occasion for a tether fantasy with wide cultural circulation. Present-day correlates include the design of panic rooms, the dissemination of apocalypse survival guides, gated communities, the burglar-proofing of suburban homes, and, of course, a variety of media (cinema, television, literature, and videogames) with which to entertain the play of exposure and withdrawal.</p><p>While the emergence of videogame technology coincided with this modern nexus of domestic fantasies, videogames would not become “domesticated” until several decades after their invention. And, yet, an “Adventure Island” tether fantasy played a role in the immediate prehistory of videogames. Scholars identify the <italic>Skylark </italic>series of action/adventure novels about exploring outer space as a major motivation for the design of one of the first games, <italic>Spacewar!</italic> (1962).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1555412012466288">27</xref></sup> The budding videogame technology instantiated in <italic>Spacewar! </italic>was shaped by enthusiasts looking for new ways to extend <italic>Skylark</italic>’s fantasy of reaching out into the unknown. And this enthusiasm was far from isolated in the early history of videogames. From text-based adventure games, MUDs, and D&amp;D ports, to the modern RPG, videogames have served as a site where tether and accretions fantasies perpetually seek more compelling forms. Even when the industry began a series of flirtations with film adaptations, the tether and accretions fantasies did not disappear; they merely persisted (in games like <italic>Earthbound</italic>, <italic>Mega Man</italic>, <italic>The Legend of Zelda</italic>, and <italic>Final Fantasy</italic>) alongside their cinematic, kinetic brethren. And the prevalence of the fantasies in a host of recent games challenges the notion that cinematic convergence is driving the industry. But, perhaps more importantly, an emphasis on fantasy in the study of videogames elaborates affinities between games and older cultural forms, connecting games to changing notions of gender, race, childhood, leisure, and home. Fantasy pulls the study of videogames into the domain of everyday life, where the banal and the meaningful collide, and where it really matters whether all people have access to the same kinds of hopes, desires, and guilty pleasures.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn30-1555412012466288"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn31-1555412012466288"><label>Funding</label><p>The author received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-1555412012466288"><label>1.</label><p><italic>Game Informer</italic> magazine, for example, referenced the Spinks interview in a story on <italic>Terraria</italic>, with an ellipsis: “The similarities are immediately apparent, so I won’t bother dancing around them: Terraria is a lot like a 2D Minecraft” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555412012466288">Turi, 2011</xref>, p. 41).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-1555412012466288"><label>2.</label><p><italic>Minecraft</italic> involves taking control of a virtual camera, looking around, and exploring.

When the RPG became a popular fixture of console gaming in the 1980s, it was largely associated with Japanese developers and audiences, despite many of its roots lying in Western games and literature. RPG games tend to adopt a quest narrative, often with nostalgic, medieval overtones. Gameplay consists of exploring vast worlds, looting castles or dungeons, battling supernatural forces through indirect control, collecting armor, currency and “experience points,” leveling-up, and managing a team of protagonists representing different “classes” (e.g., rogue, mage, and warrior). Since the heyday of this traditional format in the 1980s and 1990s, however, the RPG has become increasingly hybrid—sometimes totally abandoning its narrative signifiers (the medieval setting, dungeon looting, and so on). Today, puzzle games, first-person shooters, zombie games, and world-building simulations all employ RPG elements like leveling-up, item equipping, and character customization. This fact has posed problems for generic definition.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-1555412012466288"><label>5.</label><p>Very roughly, the “narratologists” (scholars looking at games as interactive stories) argued that games were the next platform for storytelling, perhaps one step closer to a totally immersive virtual, diegetic reality (see Murray’s <italic>Hamlet on the Holodeck</italic>).

A tether fantasy is one rhythm among many that recur daily—but one that plays an important role in the pleasure of videogames.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-1555412012466288"><label>14.</label><p><italic>BG&amp;</italic>E’s protagonist defends her home and its inhabitants from an attack—inside and outside are made to appear as though they are in an exchange of forces, even though no such exchange is possible. <italic>Rocket Slime</italic>’s protagonist moves around freely inside a giant robot on the lower screen (of the Nintendo DS), while massive combat between this and another robot is depicted on the upper-screen, so that both an internal and external point of view are made available simultaneously, in “live” action. The two orders of space are connected causally: items loaded into the cannon on the lower screen can, moments later, be seen soaring through the air on the upper screen. In <italic>Wind Waker</italic>, Link’s ship acts as a kind of home-away-from-home as he explores the ocean on his quest to save the princess. Like in <italic>Rogue Galaxy</italic>, <italic>Wind Waker</italic>’s spatial transitions are often seamless, which helps invest the boat with a psychic energy as a vessel that carries Link into and away from dangerous spaces, as the player chooses. <italic>Star Fox: Assault</italic> experiments with smooth and player-determined transitions between space craft and on-foot gameplay, but to limited effect due to fast-paced, plot-driven missions that leave no time to play with these boundaries.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn15-1555412012466288"><label>15.</label><p>Zombie games are interestingly at odds with traditions in zombie cinema. Movies like <italic>I Am Legend</italic> and <italic>28 Days Later</italic> utilize home-base tether fantasies in a dynamic interplay of exposure and withdrawal set in domestic spaces. Even <italic>The Walking Dead</italic>, a serialized television show, structures its plot’s major events around the oscillations of a tether fantasy. But zombie videogames are usually stuck in the open (exposed) position, seldom offering any kind of solace or escape, compelling players forward with a sustained uneasiness and the perpetual threat of death—this includes arcade shooters like the <italic>House of the Dead </italic>series, the <italic>Left 4 Dead</italic> series, <italic>Dead Island</italic>, and the <italic>Resident Evil</italic> series. <italic>Resident Evil 4</italic> is a “progression” game containing highly permeable shacks the protagonist holds up in early in the game to evade an attacking mob of villagers. But these flimsy houses are better death traps than safe spaces of withdrawal. The limitation of a character-bound point of view, in a broader sense, is the basis of the game’s constant feeling of vulnerability, which renders its permeable domestic spaces totally unsuitable for a home tether fantasy.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn16-1555412012466288"><label>16.</label><p>An excellent example is the Facility level in <italic>GoldenEye</italic>’s multiplayer mode. Players can hole up in this level’s bathroom, an elevated area that has only one point of entry, blocked by a swinging door, so that anyone invading the space must come dangerously close to an easily fortifiable barrier. Intense agonistic exchanges in play focus on guarding or pushing past that door, banking grenades, or spraying bullets in well-timed strafe-attacks. Should a player defending the space die, then the game becomes a race. Exposed, vulnerable, isolated from teammates, the spawned player must return to the bathroom and arrange for safe entry. The defended space becomes a mechanism for accepting a friendly force while rejecting hostile ones—a process governed by a tether fantasy in play.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-1555412012466288"><label>17.</label><p><italic>Terraria’</italic>s virtual camera sees through walls, effectively undermining the wall’s capacity to bring about an optical differentiation of space. Surrounding oneself with walls in <italic>Terraria</italic> has more of an effect upon movement than on vision, so that players are confined to a small box while the rest of the screen and its contents remain visible as before. Players can swing swords through the walls, so that blows appear to land on enemies on the other side—but the game refuses to acknowledge attacks launched from the other side of a solid barrier.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn18-1555412012466288"><label>18.</label><p>The game’s use of off-screen sound to convey a hostile, invasive force that is only tenuously kept at bay helps make boundaries emotionally significant in play. In this way the game reaches out to zombie films like <italic>I am Legend</italic>, which employs an acoustic point of view to a similar end.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn19-1555412012466288"><label>19.</label><p>Perhaps in response to the challenge posed to the tether fantasy by <italic>Terraria’s</italic> progression system, the <italic>Steam Addicts</italic> interview with Spinks conveys a question from fans about whether new versions will include “capture the flag” or “survival” mode “against one zombie player” (<italic>Steam Addicts</italic>). These modes would allow the tether fantasy to recur indefinitely even after the game’s progression mode is exhausted.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn20-1555412012466288"><label>20.</label><p>Gaston Bachelard’s famous phenomenological study of domestic space is, in many ways, a proliferation of metaphors for a tether fantasy: home is a nest, home is a shell, home is a private corner for imagination. He notes the storm’s effect of reinforcing the hearth’s feeling of warmth. Scholars of home spaces, such as Morley, take issue with Bachelard’s “patriarchal” and “happy” account of home, which effaces the many struggles that take place there. Bachelard’s work, despite these criticisms, offers a powerful depiction of the psychic dimension of home, the relation of space to fantasy. In a way, <italic>Minecraft</italic>, was the game Bachelard suggested we all play when he recommended imagining a perpetually future home: “In the last house as well as in the actual house the day-dream of inhabiting is thwarted. A daydream of elsewhere should be left open therefore, at all times” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555412012466288">Bachelard, 1958</xref>, p. 62).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn21-1555412012466288"><label>21.</label><p>See foot note 9 above.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn22-1555412012466288"><label>22.</label><p>Shigeru Miyamoto characterized the RPG as a “system” in which “you are completely bound hand and foot and can’t move” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555412012466288">Kohler, 2005</xref>, p. 88). Miyamoto viewed the initial helplessness of the protagonist and the lack of options generally available at the beginning of RPGs as harsh and arbitrary constraints; “only gradually, as your character gains powers, do you become able to move your hands, your feet . . . you come untied slowly. And in the end, you feel powerful” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555412012466288">Kohler, 2005</xref>). This conception of the RPG, in which a weak protagonist slowly becomes unshackled according to a predetermined and external process, tests Dan Fleming’s argument about videogame identification: “it is not that one identifies with Mario (he’s too minimal a figure) so much as that one begins to feel like a powerful intervening force on his behalf” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555412012466288">Fleming, 1996</xref>, p. 190). The RPG player is not an acrobatic force that, all-at-once, rescues the game’s protagonist from death in a bottomless pit. Instead, identification in an RPG lies with the process of becoming powerful: one identifies with the extended project of repairing weakness, winning freedom, and slowly finding confidence in the body to encounter the harsh world outside.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn23-1555412012466288"><label>23.</label><p>It is worth noting that <italic>Mega Man X</italic> makes becoming more powerful a central theme in its narrative as well as its gameplay. By beginning the game with a premature encounter with a major antagonist (Vile), in which a still more powerful ally (Zero) intervenes on your behalf (in a cut-scene), the game uses its sparse narrative exposition to establish an accretions fantasy based on this initial feeling of weakness. This scenario also marks Zero as the ideal image X slowly reflects as his own body becomes an icon of power.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn24-1555412012466288"><label>24.</label><p><italic>Dungeon Hunter: Alliance</italic>’s insistence that players sift through and exchange a mountain of menu items (which arbitrarily fill up inventory capacity) seems absurd unless viewed as one of the game’s central pleasures: dwelling on the project of accruing powerful objects. But this sorting also highlights how role differentiation is an important part of identification: rogue, warrior, and magician—each class has different attributes in battle. Sorting menu items becomes a way of negotiating each player’s function in the game. New upgrades accrue, it might be said, to this feeling of usefulness, to the player’s identity stemming from a unique play function. The desire to feel powerful cedes some ground to the need to feel useful to one’s team. And the players become tethered to one another for security, a connection that is strengthened during intense battles, and far from the safety of conventional “tether” points.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn25-1555412012466288"><label>25.</label><p>Not all games containing menu systems involve tether or accretions fantasies. What makes the RPG menu unique is that a player is drawn into identifying with the menu as a site of power. Time spent there is caught up with feelings of strength and growth. Menu systems in platformer games or first-person shooters rarely function in this manner. Consequently, platformer/FPS players are rarely mired in the menu for as much time as RPG players.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn26-1555412012466288"><label>26.</label><p><italic>The Lonely Villa</italic> is today studied as an early filmic example of cross-cutting, a narrative technique for conveying simultaneous action in separate locations. The locations combined here are the inside of the bourgeois home, with wife and daughters holed up, and the dangerous space of the outside (masculine) world, where rapacious elements challenge domestic boundaries. As a group of robbers forces its way inside, the father (alerted over the telephone) rushes home. The new narrative technique for connecting disparate spaces was used to elaborate dangerous encounters infringing the boundaries of home.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn27-1555412012466288"><label>27.</label><p>Matteo Bittanti (“From GunPlay to GunPorn”) and Steven Levy (<italic>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</italic>) both discuss <italic>Skylark</italic> as an inspiration to Steve Russell and his peers.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn28-1555412012466288"><label>28.</label><p>In <italic>Computer Games: Text, Narrative, and Play</italic>, Andrew Burn and Diane Carr trace a lineage from adventure novels like Tolkien's <italic>Lord of the Rings</italic>, through tabletop board games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, into role-playing videogames like <italic>Baldur's Gate.</italic> While this connection is frequently invoked in conversations about the influences of the RPG, Burn and Carr go beyond asserting that the RPG borrows “the inhabitants, flora and fauna of Middle Earth” and also make the case that “less obvious” aspects of the novels survived: “In <italic>Baldur's Gate,</italic> characters become fatigued and ineffective if they do not get regular sleep. Sleeping for “8 hours” (which takes a few seconds of the player's time) restores the team's health and heals any injuries” (Burn &amp; Carr, 23). The scholars extend to games an argument made by Jennifer Turner in a review of Tom Shippey's <italic>Author of the Century</italic> (a monogram on Tolkien). Turner suggests a broad tendency in adventure novels, to adopt temporal patterns of action and rest. Burn and Carr's formulation needs to be noted here because –though it is mentioned only briefly and left largely apart from their wider analysis of the games –these scholars deserve credit for crucial insights, such as the “sudden relief afforded by the pause button” (Ibid.) in the game's oscillations between the “sublime and the cozy,” or between “Scary, safe again.” (Turner).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn29-1555412012466288"><label>29.</label><p>Turner's own analysis also requires mentioning for the connections it raises. Turner strings together disparate novelistic genres (“explorers' tragedies, Westerns, space operas”) on the basis of the “compulsively repetitive rhythm Freud writes about in <italic>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</italic> (1920), and which he links to the `death instinct', the desire to be free of all tension for ever (cf the `And they lived happily ever after' of the traditional fairytale)” (Ibid.). Freud's death drive is perhaps not the best lens for thinking about tether rhythms; rather, the push towards quiescence may be more useful for thinking about the accretions fantasy, since collection quests tend (in the end) to produce avatars unassailable by external threats and who are thus, in a way, shielded from outside stimulus, made into the kind of inorganic substances Freud discusses in connection with the death drive. While the lineage of texts raised by Burn, Carr, and Turner is significant, it lacks a coherent theoretical frame. It shifts without warning from notions of the sublime to Schadenfreude, Freud, and mimesis –flipping back and forth between accounting for play and narrative structure. And it is only applied in a piecemeal fashion to videogames. The tether fantasy is part of a broad theoretical frame for player engagement with games, the connection forged between popular texts by participating audiences, and the design of interactive systems.</p></fn></fn-group></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1555412012466288"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Apperley</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2010</year>). <source>Gaming rhythms: Play and counterplay from the situated to the global</source>. <publisher-loc>Amsterdam, the Netherlands</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Institute of Network Cultures</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-1555412012466288"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bachelard</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1958</year>). <source>The poetics of space</source>. <publisher-loc>Boston, MA</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Beacon Press</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-1555412012466288"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brooker</surname><given-names>W.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2009</year>). <article-title>Camera-eye, cg-eye: Videogames and the ‘Cinematic.’</article-title> <source>Cinema Journal</source>, <volume>48</volume>, <fpage>122</fpage>–<lpage>128</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3a-1555412012466288"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Burn</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Carr</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group>, (<year>2006</year>). “<article-title>Defining Game Genres</article-title>,” In <person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Carr</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Buckingham</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Burn</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Schott</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group> (Ed.), <source>Computer Games: Text, Narrative, and Play</source> (pp. <fpage>14</fpage>–<lpage>29</lpage>). <publisher-loc>Cambridge, MA</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Polity Press</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr4-1555412012466288"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Caillois</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1942</year>). <article-title>The myth of secret treasures in childhood (C.
