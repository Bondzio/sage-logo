<p>South Asia is in the midst of significant change. Spearheaded by the region’s superpower, South Asia is experiencing key transformations in the form of demographic change, a rising middle class, expanding regional and global integration, blooming entrepreneurship, and growing urbanization. These and other issues are examined in <italic>Reshaping Tomorrow: Is South Asia Ready for the Big Leap?</italic></p>
<p>The volume is a collection of essays that attempt to examine the course of South Asia’s future in the coming decades. It does so by considering two scenarios for the region: an optimistic view and a pessimistic view, with a section of the book devoted to each. Both views are supported by extensive empirical evidence and offer compelling arguments.</p>
<sec id="section1-1391561412457285">
<title>Optimistic View</title>
<p>The first essay, authored by David E. Bloom, David Canning and Larry Rosenberg, takes a look at demographic change in South Asia and its impact on the region’s economies. The chapter commences with a discussion of the various factors that link demographic change with economic growth, addressing an improvement in health standards across the region, using indicators such as infant mortality rate (IMR) and total fertility rate (TFR), while also considering other factors like the working-age share of the population. The authors then focus on the discussion on how best to harness the demographic dividend, highlighting key issues like the quality of governmental institutions, labour legislation, macroeconomic management, trade policy, and education policy. The chapter is rounded off with a look at potential challenges that a demographic transition may bring. Concerns like a country’s ageing population, inequality in dimensions such as income and education, and possible consequences of inaction are brought up, leaving the reader with a comprehensive snapshot of the potential impacts of the region’s demographic changes.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, Homi Kharas addresses the rising middle class in South Asia. The author leaves little doubt in the reader’s mind that India is the key player to watch, with the country expected to contribute over 90 per cent of the region’s middle class by 2025 and close to 25 per cent of the global share. By then, over a billion people in India are predicted to belong to this group. The author points out that it was private consumption, led by the middle class, that drove India’s economic growth in the past decade. He goes on to highlight ways in which the group may sustain growth, including strengthening the link between the middle class and democracy, fostering the middle class as a source of entrepreneurs, and realizing the middle class’ potential contribution to human capital and saving. Kharas also points out that the purchasing power of India’s middle class is leading to a surge in activity in the country’s manufacturing industries, with the group’s consumption preferences fuelling product differentiation, larger business profits, higher savings and investment, and in turn, more economic growth. Nonetheless, the author makes a note of the changing values and behaviours of the middle class, with more people now paying more attention to the political system, availability of jobs, and welfare for their children than before.</p>
<p>The third essay that focuses on the optimistic scenario, written by Weishi Grace Gu and Eswar Prasad, examines the impacts of globalization on South Asia. The authors take a multi-faceted look at the effects of globalization, beginning their examination with an analysis of growth patterns across the region, using data on gross domestic product (GDP) and individual components of growth. They suggest that consumption is the main driver of growth, while trade balances are generally negative, underlining the point that economic growth is less dependent on external demand compared to some East Asian economies like China. The authors then take a look at the levels of trade in services in the region, highlighting the importance of the services sector and showing that the growth of the sector has surpassed that of many other emerging economies, taking it on a different growth path from its Asian neighbours. The next section discusses national savings and investment patterns and their implications on global imbalances, after which follows a review of capital inflows to the region and its stock of foreign exchange reserves, taking into account the costs and benefits of greater financial integration with the rest of the world. The authors round off their discussion with a brief look at policy implications and how best to manage increasing capital account openness.</p>
<p>In the following chapter, Caglar Ozden and Christopher Robert Parsons examine international migration and the impacts of the demographic divergence between South Asia and the West. They argue that as certain advanced countries like those in Western Europe are experiencing low fertility rates and increasing dependency ratios, the demographic changes in South Asia place it in a favourable position to supply the necessary labour needed in these advanced markets. However, the authors are keen to point out that this demographic match-up is only expected to last one generation, and therefore it is imperative that any migration agreements aimed at promoting labour mobility between the two regions must be drawn up without delay. The authors go on to suggest that public and political opposition to migration in more developed countries may be tackled through temporary migration schemes featuring incentive mechanisms for migrants to return to their home countries. These incentives are listed towards the end of the chapter but the authors unfortunately do not provide an in-depth discussion of such a mechanism.</p>

<title>Pessimistic View</title>
<p>The next essay marks the beginning of the book’s focus on the challenges that lie ahead for South Asia.</p>
<p>Arvind Panagariya tackles the question of how to avoid lopsided spatial transformation as the region forges ahead in economic development. Unlike some East Asian economies that experienced a rapid movement of labour supply from the agricultural sector to those of manufacturing and services during their transformation into middle-income countries, South Asia does not seem to be following the same path. Panagariya goes on to suggest that this transformation problem, at least in India, is manifested in three forms, namely, the persistently large share of employment in the agricultural sector, the prevalence of informal employment, and the slow rate of urbanization. In the section that follows, the author discusses why India’s growth path is different from that of other emerging economies of the past, outlining factors such as a persistently low share of manufacturing in GDP, a small share of labour-intensive products in manufacturing, an increasing capital–labour ratio in the manufacturing sector, and the absence of large-scale firms in labour-intensive industries. The author concludes the chapter by introducing some policy reforms needed for India to achieve the proper type of transformation, including more flexible labour market regulations, transparent bankruptcy laws, educational reforms, and modernization of social safety nets, among others.</p>
<p>In the essay that follows, Ejaz Ghani, William R. Kerr and Stephen O’Connell discuss the challenges of promoting entrepreneurship, growth and job creation. The authors begin their analysis by discussing the theoretical and empirical relationships between entrepreneurship and economic growth, highlighting a strong positive correlation between the two. The following section attempts to define and measure entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on the manufacturing sector in India. The authors expand their discussion to look at the link between entrepreneurship and industry growth across regions within India, comparing this positive relationship to that found among cities across the United States and suggest that entrepreneurship rates are strongly indicative of employment and industry growth in India. The subsequent section addresses the spatial disparities of the prevalence of entrepreneurship within India, proposing that the Chinitz effect (relating to cost factors) has a strong influence on regional rates. In the final section of the paper, the authors bring up some important policy implications and recommendations for harnessing the power of entrepreneurship in India and the rest of South Asia.</p>
<p>The following chapter, written by Barry Eichengreen, examines the potential problems of managing capital flows. The author explains the difficulty confronting monetary policy-makers in emerging economies, with regard to managing capital accounts in the face of a disconnect in interest rates between advanced and developing countries. This disjuncture arises from developed economies adopting low interest rates to accommodate slow growth and financial weakness, while emerging economies are implementing higher rates to accommodate faster growth, rising inflation and potential overheating. As capital flows from low-interest economies, like those in the US, Japan and the Eurozone, to high-return economies like those in South Asia, policies of restraint in emerging economies will need to be re-examined. The author goes on to discuss the approach that India’s policy-makers have taken in response to this imbalance, highlighting the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) requirements that banks limit their exposure to sensitive sectors and rebalance their risk weights of different assets. In the final section of the chapter, Eichengreen examines the implications for the conduct of monetary policy, pointing out that the best defence against capital flow imbalances is more inclusive financial markets through institutional and regulatory reforms, including more transparency, improved contract enforcement and greater market liquidity, while also advocating better market integration and regulatory harmonization within the region.</p>
<p>In the following chapter, Rakesh Mohan takes a look at the challenges faced with managing efficient urbanization in South Asia. Despite projected figures for South Asia to reach a level of urbanization of roughly 50 per cent by 2040, the region has been relatively slow in attracting urban growth. The author presents several reasons for this sluggishness, including an insufficient growth in rural productivity and thus, an inability to release labour from rural areas, tightening of labour legislation, inadequate investment in urban infrastructure, and restrictions on urban land availability. Mohan goes on to explore the likely changes in South Asia’s urbanization within the coming decades, arguing that cities will need to be more competitive to keep up with increasing globalization and trade, labour force skills will need to be enhanced, and manufacturing costs will need to be reduced through methods such as local outsourcing. The author devotes a section to effective city management, which must be improved through better leadership, easier access to finance and a greater degree of decentralization so that urban municipal councils have more influence over the planning of their cities. The final section of the essay discusses ways of drawing more investment to fund urban infrastructure projects, including the availability of ‘free’ equity for project agencies, offering guarantee mechanisms to reduce risk associated with urban development, setting up appraisal agencies to encourage investors, and improving staff training programmes.</p>
<p>The penultimate chapter features Ravi Kanbur tackling the issue of informality traps. The author begins the discourse by first defining what informality is, noting that there is a range of interpretations of the term. The discussion then turns to the question of why informality is harmful, going through an extensive literature review to support the author’s argument, citing reasons such as the correlation with poverty and low incomes, inferior product quality, low productivity and the inability to capture economies of scale due to small firm size. Kanbur then extends the discussion to tackle ways in which informality traps may be avoided, pointing out that small firms may decide to remain small and thereby stop short of reaping the gains from efficiency in order to avoid the costs associated with regulations imposed on the formal sector. The author also addresses other methods of avoiding informality traps, including the improved enforcement of regulations, a review of existing regulations and an expansion of states’ services to encourage small firms to increase in size and shift to the formal sector.</p>
<p>In the final chapter of the book, Lakshmi Iyer takes a look at the internal conflicts that have plagued the region. The chapter provides a discussion of data trends for various countries in South Asia, revealing that economically lagging areas have experienced a higher incidence of conflict, both across the region and within countries. The author then goes on to suggest ways in which conflict can be managed, highlighting strategies such as adopting a security-related approach using police, a military-led approach in cases where police forces are insufficient, a political approach that employs negotiations and peace agreements, and an economic approach that attempts to cut support for insurgencies by providing economic incentives and services to people in conflict-affected areas. The author rounds off the chapter by examining the policy challenges faced by countries in conflict, including drawing private sector investment to conflict zones, connecting communities to markets after physical infrastructure has been damaged, and increasing employment during and after a conflict. Suggestions to counter these challenges are made, with disarmament, demobilization, and rehabilitation (DDR) programmes, cash-for-work programmes, and project devolution to local communities among the ideas offered.</p>
<p>In summing up, the volume contains a comprehensive collection of essays that examine the future of South Asia, recognizing the region’s key advantages while taking note of the challenges that lie ahead. However, there are some areas which lack sufficient focus. These include the limited attention devoted to the political process within countries and its impact on the course of economic growth. Ozden’s and Parsons’ work on international migration, for example, lacks an extensive discussion of the politics of migration. Not enough weight is given to political influence on migration policy in advanced economies, and there is little discourse on the political situations in source countries that drive migration outflows.</p>
<p>It may also be useful for the reader if more in-depth comparisons were made to other emerging markets in Asia, particularly those in South-east Asia. As it is, little attention is paid to dynamic and rapidly-growing economies like Malaysia. Such a comparison in Gu’s and Prasad’s chapter on globalization would benefit the reader by providing more context to South Asia’s position in the global economy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the volume is an engaging read, particularly for those interested in the course of South Asia’s development potential. It takes into account robust statistical analysis to develop the arguments presented in the volume, while maintaining a style that is easily accessible. Altogether, it can be considered a valuable contribution to the debate that surrounds South Asia’s future and is likely to benefit policy-makers and academics alike.</p>
