<abstract>
<p>The present research extends the self-concept literature by examining the self-brand congruity hypothesis in two different cultures: the United States as an example of an individualistic culture and Korea as a collectivistic culture. The results of this research demonstrate that brands with distinct personality traits that are congruent with consumers’ self-concepts are evaluated more positively than brands with incongruent personality traits across cultures. More important, the findings suggest that the self-brand congruity effects are more evident in the United States than in Korea, lending empirical evidence that self-consistency is less emphasized and salient in East Asian cultures than in Western cultures.</p>

<p>Over the last several decades, there has been an increased focus on the concept of self among scholars in diverse disciplines. Among philosophers and psychologists, the self-concept is often viewed as a powerful regulator of many aspects of human behavior and an important driver of how individuals perceive others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022110383318">Cross &amp; Madson, 1997</xref>). In consumer research, understanding the self-concept is important because many consumer attitudes and behaviors are significantly influenced by the images consumers have of themselves. One such line of research involves analyzing the relationship between consumer self-concept and brand personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022022110383318">Sirgy, 1982</xref>). Specifically, consumer researchers have investigated the extent to which brand image is associated with consumer self-concept and suggested that consumers use brands to create, reinforce, and communicate their self-concepts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022110383318">Belk, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022110383318">Escalas &amp; Bettman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022022110383318">Sirgy, 1982</xref>). These studies revolve around the notion that consumers prefer brands with personalities that are congruent with their self-concepts (often called <italic>self-brand congruity</italic>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this seemingly compelling idea and some evidence for it, a considerable number of studies have failed to lend empirical support and the explanatory power of self-brand congruity has been equivocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022022110383318">Hughes and Guerrero (1971)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022022110383318">P. E. Green, Maheshwari, and Rao (1969)</xref> found no significant association between actual self-concept/product image congruity and product preference, purchase intention, or brand loyalty; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022022110383318">Landon (1974)</xref> similarly obtained no evidence in support of the hypothesis that ideal rather than actual self-concept predicts brand preference. One possible reason for these incoherent results is the absence of a reliable, valid, and generalizable scale that assesses the related constructs in a consistent and parsimonious manner within an integrative framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, however, the self-brand congruity premise should be questioned as to whether identity consistency or stability is a universally essential condition of psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022022110383318">Suh, 2002</xref>). As suggested in prior cross-cultural research, the nature and structure of the self is more variable than is commonly assumed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022110383318">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). For example, cross-cultural psychologists suggest that individuals in a collectivistic culture construct a self that is far more interdependent than those constructed in an individualistic culture and that the two distinct views of the self influence a broad range of social and cognitive processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022110383318">Cross &amp; Madson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022110383318">Derlega, Cukur, Kuang, &amp; Forsyth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022110383318">Hong, Benet-Martinez, Chiu, &amp; Morris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022110383318">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022022110383318">Suh, Diener, &amp; Updegraff, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, most empirical research on self-brand congruity has been conducted in Western cultural settings with a heavy focus on the United States, whereas little research has explored how brand personality affects brand preferences and choices nor examined the self-brand congruity effect in other cultures. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022022110383318">Triandis (2001)</xref> noted, since cognitive consistency is less important in collectivistic than in individualistic cultures, the degree of self-brand congruity may also be subject to the culture to which individuals belong such that the self-brand congruity effects are limited or irrelevant in collectivistic cultures.</p>
<p>In the present research, therefore, we investigate the extent to which self-brand congruity effects are contingent upon the culturally bound self-view. More specifically, we predict that an individual’s self-construal will moderate his or her sensitivity to self-brand fit in representing self-concept in brand evaluations. Individuals with a dominant independent self-construal value self-government and prefer consistency irrespective of social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022022110383318">Suh, 2002</xref>), whereas people with a prevailing interdependent self-construal respect social norms and tend to be flexible and adapt to differing social contexts and roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022110383318">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022110383318">Singelis, 1994</xref>). In this light, consumers with an independent self-construal may show greater preference for brands consistent with their self-image than do those with an interdependent self-construal. To empirically investigate the interplay of self-brand congruity and self-construal in brand evaluation, the present research employs the formally validated, systematic measurement of brand personality dimensions and traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>) and explores the relationship cross-culturally: in the United States as well as in Korea, as an exemplar of one of the East Asian cultures. In line with the aforementioned cross-cultural research, it is assumed that American consumers’ self-construal is more likely to be independent, and highly collectivistic Korean consumers are more likely to have an interdependent view of the self. As prior consumer research efforts have been largely focused on the psychological mechanism of self-brand connection in Western countries, particularly the United States, and little attention has been given to the applicability of the theoretical configuration in East Asian cultures, this study provides theoretical and managerial insights into cultural similarities and differences in the roles of self and brand personality in influencing brand attitudes. Additionally, from a methodological perspective, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of the brand personality measurement in estimating the self-brand relationship in a cross-cultural context.</p>

<title>Brands as Extended Self</title>
<p>The self-concept plays a critical role not only in how individuals perceive others but in how they perceive objects or social information such as institutions, organizations, messages, and commercial brands. A considerable body of empirical research supports the human tendency to attribute human personality characteristics to nonhuman entities ranging from animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022110383318">Belk, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022110383318">Hirschman, 1994</xref>) to automobiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022022110383318">Levy, 1985</xref>) and computers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022022110383318">Weizenbaum, 1976</xref>). For instance, animals serve utilitarian and aesthetic functions in one’s life as ornaments, status symbols, and accessories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022110383318">Hirschman, 1994</xref>). Animals also act as extensions of the person’s self and reflect the owner’s identity, personality, and characteristics, suggesting that a relationship between personality and choice of pets exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022110383318">Kidd &amp; Kidd, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022022110383318">Savishinsky, 1986</xref>). Although anthropomorphic qualities are most commonly associated with living creatures, consumers also imbue brands with similar human personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022022110383318">Levy, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>The self-brand congruity hypothesis is founded upon the premise that consumers use brands to communicate their self-concepts and show a tendency to make inferences about others based on the brands that they observe others using (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022110383318">Belk, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022110383318">Escalas &amp; Bettman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022022110383318">Sirgy, 1982</xref>). Fundamental to this notion is that material objects and possessions such as brands can serve as symbols or signs that represent socially constructed meanings and effectively reflect the owners’ self-identity and relations to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022110383318">Csikszentimihalyi &amp; Rochberg-Halton, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022022110383318">Dittmar, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022110383318">Douglas &amp; Isherwood, 1979</xref>). From a semiotic perspective, the expressive properties and meaning of brands are central to the symbolic manifestation of identity via brand possession and consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022022110383318">Richins, 1994</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022022110383318">Saussure’s (1974)</xref> two-part theory of the sign, a sign is composed of a signifier (the form which the sign takes) and the signified (the concept it represents) and the link between them is referred to as “signification.” In his theory, the conception of signification is relational as meaning of a sign is entirely dependent upon the context in relation to other signs. In this theoretical light, brands are kinds of signs and the construction and interpretation of brand meaning is contextual and dynamic as a sign is bestowed provisional significance by participants in an exchange of the sign. Consumers may be active participants in brand meaning development as they can ascribe their own meanings to brands.</p>
<p>In brief, a brand’s value derives from its meaning as well as its physical qualities and the emblematic nature of the brand is the key to the self-brand relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022110383318">Baudrillard, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022110383318">Belk, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022022110383318">Kilbourne, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022022110383318">Richins, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022022110383318">Solomon, 1983</xref>). Meaning of brands, once crafted and developed by marketers, is understood and reconstructed by individual consumers (private meaning) and by society at large (public meaning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022022110383318">Richins, 1994</xref>). The symbolic properties of brands allow them to function as an instrument in enhancing self-concept by projecting socially attributed meanings of the brands onto oneself. The “value” of this self-enhancement depends on the brand being a publicly recognized symbol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022110383318">Belk, 1988</xref>). As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022110383318">Escalas and Bettman (2003)</xref>, consumers use brands to meet self-needs and form associations between their self-concept and brand personalities, referred to as self-brand connections. Consumers value the psychological benefits derived from associating themselves with brands because they can construct, define, and enhance their self-concept and express themselves to others in various social contexts by using the brands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022110383318">Escalas &amp; Bettman, 2003</xref>). Because brands acquire and represent symbolic properties (beyond “mere” popularity) that are of significance to a consumer, they can add meaning to the consumer’s life. Furthermore, consumers form meaningful relationships with brands wherein the brands serve as partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022110383318">Caprara, Barbaranelli, &amp; Guido, 2001</xref>). Along this line, the brands consumers own, use, and with which they surround themselves may fairly accurately reflect the central aspects of their self-concepts. All in all, the literature suggests that it is imperative for consumer researchers to investigate the personality-based meaning that consumers attach to brands for an extended understanding of self-brand connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022110383318">Belk, 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Brand Personality</title>
<p>Recently, the application of human personality models (e.g., Big Five Model) to the study of consumers’ brand evaluations has become increasingly common (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022110383318">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022022110383318">Sung &amp; Tinkham, 2005</xref>). In particular, the notion that inanimate objects such as commercial brands can become associated with human characteristics and personality traits has received a considerable amount of research attention. The symbolic, humanlike quality attached to brands is called <italic>brand personality</italic>, defined as “the set of human characteristics associated with a brand” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>). Physical, psychological, and social attributes and functions of a brand contribute to the brand’s personality. Other components of the personality are attributable to characteristics of the individuals who own and use the brand and the social or physical occasions in which the brand is consumed. While marketing and promotions attempt to mold the intended meaning of a brand, brand personality is a psychological construct shaped by a consumer’s personal perception and experience and exists in the mind of the consumer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022022110383318">Sung &amp; Tinkham, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker’s (1997)</xref> pioneering work attested that consumers do assign human characters to brands and presented a framework of brand personality structure with five dimensions identified and validated with rigorous testing: Sincerity (e.g., down-to earth, honest), Excitement (e.g., trendy, exciting, young), Competence (e.g., reliable, confident, leading), Sophistication (e.g., upper class, glamorous, charming), and Ruggedness (e.g., outdoorsy, masculine, tough). Three of the brand personality dimensions (Sincerity, Excitement, and Competence) emulate human personality models such as the Big Five. Yet the other dimensions (Sophistication and Ruggedness) are unique to brand personality and, as compared with Sincerity, Excitement, and Competence, they capture more aspirational images associated with wealth and status (e.g., Lexus, Mercedes) or American individualism (e.g., Levi’s jeans, Harley-Davidson) that may be more directly relevant to commercial brands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>). Additional research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022110383318">Aaker, Benet-Martinez, &amp; Garolera, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022022110383318">Sung &amp; Tinkham, 2005</xref>) replicated previous work and applied the framework in different cultures. The findings demonstrated that the structure of brand personality and its measurement scheme are largely robust across cultures with slightly varied cultural nuances.</p>

<title>Self-Congruity Theory</title>
<p>Early social psychologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022022110383318">Krech and Crutchfield (1948)</xref> noted that</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>the nature of the relationships of the self to other parts of the field—to other objects, to people, to groups, to social organizations—is of critical importance in understanding the individual’s perception of a connection between various objects, individuals, and groups and himself. (p. 69)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Across many different populations and manipulations of similarity, numerous studies have found that during interpersonal interaction, people are not only more attracted to others who are perceived to share their personality, but they also tend to be more influenced by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022110383318">Ajzen, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022110383318">Byrne, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with the prior literature in social and personality psychology, consumer researchers have proposed that consumers prefer products with images that are congruent with their self-image (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022110383318">Grubb &amp; Hupp, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022022110383318">Sirgy, 1982</xref>). The most well-accepted theoretical explanation for the self-congruity hypothesis is derived from a distinct social psychological dynamic: that is, individuals strive to resolve disagreeing psychological experiences and maintain cognitive consistency in their beliefs and behaviors. The development of “cognitive consistency theories” was rooted primarily in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022110383318">Festinger’s (1957)</xref> cognitive dissonance theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022022110383318">Heider’s (1946</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022110383318">1958)</xref> balance theory, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022110383318">Aronson’s (1968)</xref> self-consistency theory. For example, cognitive dissonance theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022110383318">Festinger, 1957</xref>) postulates that individuals tend to seek consistency among their cognitions as dissonance results in a feeling that is psychologically aversive or unpleasant. There are numerous ways to reduce dissonance, for example, by decreasing the importance of the dissonant beliefs, changing one of the dissonant beliefs, and adding more consonant beliefs to outweigh or offset the dissonant beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022110383318">Festinger, 1957</xref>). More recent research on self-verification theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022022110383318">Swann &amp; Read, 1981</xref>) pointed to the importance of consistency as a foundation of psychological well-being. Individuals try to verify and maintain their existing self-concepts in social contexts and interact with others who see them as they view themselves and provide feedback that is congruent with their self-views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022022110383318">Swann &amp; Read, 1981</xref>). Similarly, identity consistency was evidenced as a key psychological variable that predicts well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022110383318">Donahue, Robins, Roberts, &amp; John, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022110383318">Roberts &amp; Donahue, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Self-Construal and Individualism-Collectivism</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022022110383318">Triandis (2001)</xref> suggested that subjective culture, representing the categorizations, associations, norms, roles, and values in a culture, is a fundamental factor that shapes social behaviors. In this light, cross-cultural comparisons can reveal meaningful insight into the psychological theories, assumptions, and consumer behaviors that may vary from culture to culture. Individualism-collectivism is one of the most cited dimensions of cultural variability identified in cross-cultural psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022110383318">E. G. T. Green, Deschamps, &amp; Páez, 2005</xref>). Individualism is defined as a social pattern that consists of individuals who see themselves as autonomous and independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022022110383318">Triandis, 2001</xref>). Individualistic cultures emphasize autonomy, emotional independence, and privacy and give priority to personal goals over collective concerns. In contrast, collectivism denotes a social configuration represented by individuals who see themselves as a part of collectives such as family and community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022022110383318">Triandis, 2001</xref>). Collectivistic cultures stress emotional dependence, group harmony, cohesion, and cooperation and value the collective over the individual.</p>
<p>Closely tied to the culture-level, individualism-collectivism classification, research suggests two distinctive ways each individual, in any culture, may construe the self: <italic>independent</italic> and <italic>interdependent</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022110383318">Hardin, Leong, &amp; Bhagwat, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022110383318">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022110383318">Markus, Kitayama, &amp; Heiman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022110383318">Singelis, 1994</xref>). Self-construal refers to an individual’s sense of self in relation to others, reflecting the extent to which the individual views himself or herself either as an independent entity or as an entity dependent on others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022110383318">Agrawal &amp; Maheswaran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022110383318">Hardin et al., 2004</xref>). Although both aspects of self-construal coexist within a single individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022110383318">Kolstad &amp; Horpestad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022110383318">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022022110383318">Singelis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022022110383318">Singelis, Bond, Sharkey, &amp; Siu Yiu Lai, 1999</xref>), the chronic level of accessibility of the independent and interdependent self-views, which is more dominant, tends to be determined by social or cultural surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022110383318">Aaker &amp; Schmitt, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In Western cultural contexts, individuals who are independent and show behavioral consistency are evaluated more positively than those who display inconsistency across different situations since consistency is suggestive of maturity, self-integrity, and unity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022110383318">Cross, Gore, &amp; Morris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022022110383318">Suh, 2002</xref>). Therefore, consistent expression of stable personality traits, motives, attitudes, and other personal characteristics develops an essential foundation for constructing the self, whereas inconsistency is considered a threat to the core self and its stability and thus results in self-concept confusion and ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022110383318">Cross et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, in East Asian cultures, where relational interdependence and accord are key elements in fostering a collectivistic culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022022110383318">Hofstede, 1991</xref>), individuals tend to seek situations that produce a harmonious interpersonal atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022022110383318">Sung &amp; Tinkham, 2005</xref>). Consequently, flexibility and adaptation to social contexts are more valued, while consistency is less underscored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022110383318">Cross et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022110383318">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022110383318">Singelis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022022110383318">Suh, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, Western and East Asian cultures nurture different values and self-construal and thus lead individuals therein to regard consistency in dissimilar ways: Consistency is indicative of positive attributes such as maturity, dependability, and integrity in Western cultures, whereas East Asian cultures view the self as relatively malleable and highly context sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022110383318">Cross et al., 2003</xref>). This overall pattern suggests that the self-congruity effects should be stronger in the United States than in Korea.</p>

<title>Overview of the Study</title>
<p>Two experimental studies were conducted. In Experiment 1, the proposition that self-brand congruity would be a better predictor of consumer attitudes in the United States than in Korea was tested with a set of fictitious brands. The same procedure and design of Experiment 1 were used in Experiment 2 but with a set of real brands. The current research focused on personality at the trait level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1999</xref>) in its empirical investigation, thus employing personality dimensions and traits to examine both constructs: self-concept and brand personality. By relying on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker’s (1997)</xref> five brand personality model, Experiment 1 assessed three dimensions (Sincerity, Excitement, and Competence) and Experiment 2 applied the other two dimensions (Sophistication and Ruggedness).</p>

<title>Experiment 1</title>
<sec id="section7-0022022110383318">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>In the United States, 204 undergraduate students (69% female; mean age = 20.5) from a large southeastern university participated in the study. The Korean sample consisted of 215 undergraduate students from two major universities in Korea (60.9% female, mean age = 21).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022022110383318">
<title>Stimuli With Fictitious Brands</title>
<p>For stimulus development, first, two self-expressive product categories (apparel and watches) were chosen because (a) they tend to have different brand personalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1999</xref>) and (b) they are not gender-specific. Second, to name the fictitious brands with distinct personalities in terms of the three personality dimensions (Sincerity, Excitement, and Competence), 24 student members of the advertising club at a large southeastern university in the United States were asked to invent brand names corresponding to the three dimensions. Third, a focus group with six American and four English-speaking Korean undergraduate students helped select two fictitious names that most effectively communicated each of the three dimensions for the two product categories, resulting in 12 brand names. Finally, another group of 20 participants in each culture was asked to rate the extent to which the fictitious brands could be described by the three brand personality dimensions, and as a result, six names were selected for the final set and used in both cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>). To illustrate, the six fictitious brands were Kicks apparel and True watches (Sincerity), Chaos apparel and Tocks watches (Excitement), and Colors International apparel and Technologe watches (Competence). Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022110383318">Aaker’s (1999)</xref> procedure, participants were given limited information about the brand for brand personality manipulation. That is, the personality of each fictitious brand was manipulated through (a) an invented brand name and (b) several personality trait associations.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section10-0022022110383318">
<title>Self-concept</title>
<p>Participants were asked to describe their self-concept based on a set of 31 personality traits on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>not at all descriptive</italic>, 7 = <italic>extremely descriptive</italic>), which were identified as the Sincerity (11 traits; α = .79), Excitement (11 traits; α = .83), and Competence (9 traits; α = .88) dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>). Participants in Korea were given the same set of personality traits in Korean that had been created through the translation/back-translation procedure and validated in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022022110383318">Sung &amp; Tinkham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022022110383318">Sung, Kim, &amp; Jung, 2010</xref>). For each self-concept dimension, a single index was formed by averaging the corresponding items, and two groups (i.e., low vs. high) were identified using a mean split. Thus, each participant was assigned to either a high or low self-concept group for each dimension, which served as a between-subjects factor in the subsequent hypothesis-testing analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022022110383318">
<title>Self-construal</title>
<p>Participants’ self-construal was assessed using the 24-item Self-Construal Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022110383318">Singelis, 1994</xref>), with each item measured on a 7-point, Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). As a first step toward measure equivalence between the two cultures, the self-construal items, originally in English, were translated into Korean by two Korean Americans fluent in both languages and then translated back into English by another pair of Korean Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022110383318">Brislin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022022110383318">Marsella, Dubanoski, Hamada, &amp; Morse, 2000</xref>). Next, multiple-group, confirmatory factor analysis ensured metric invariance between the two samples. Specifically, the χ<sup>2</sup> values of the unconstrained model and the constrained model, in which equivalencies of factor loadings were imposed, were compared for independent and interdependent self-construals, respectively. The comparative procedure led to nonsignificant χ<sup>2</sup> difference values (14.14 for independence and 15.43 for interdependence, <italic>df</italic> = 11, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). The results suggested that the factor loading equality constraints held well across the two groups and thus metric equivalency between the U.S. and Korean samples was established.</p>
<p>The 12 items were averaged to form an independent self-construal index (U.S. α = .69; Korea α = .70), and the remaining 12 items were averaged to create an interdependent self-construal index (U.S. α = .70; Korea α = .72). The difference in independent self-construal between the U.S. sample (<italic>M</italic> = 4.86, <italic>SD</italic> = .60) and the Korean sample (<italic>M</italic> = 4.60, <italic>SD</italic> = .65) was statistically significant, <italic>t</italic>(417) = 4.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. However, although Korean participants reported a marginally higher mean score for interdependent self-construal (<italic>M</italic> = 4.71, <italic>SD</italic> = .63) than their American counterparts (<italic>M</italic> = 4.64, <italic>SD</italic> = .60), the difference was not statistically significant, <italic>t</italic>(417) = −1.11, <italic>p</italic> = .27.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022022110383318">
<title>Brand attitude</title>
<p>Brand attitude was gauged along a 7-point, semantic differential scale with 4 items: (a) dislike/like, (b) negative/positive, (c) bad/good, and (d) unfavorable/favorable. Following the same procedure used for self-construal measures, metric equivalence of brand attitude was ensured. First, the translation/back-translation practice was applied. Second, the comparison between the two multiple groups confirmatory factor models, unconstrained and constrained, yielded the nonsignificant, χ<sup>2</sup> difference value of .684 (<italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), indicating that the measurement model was reasonably invariant between the United States and Korea.</p>
<p>Reliability estimates were computed and Cronbach’s alphas of all fictitious brand attitudes were high: True and Kicks (α = .89 and .90), Tocks and Chaos (α = .90 and .92), and Technologe and Colors International (α = .87 and .88). For each brand, a brand attitude index was created by averaging the ratings of the four items. These brand attitude indices were used as dependent variables for testing the self-brand congruity hypothesis.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0022022110383318">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were asked to rate a set of fictitious brands. They were told that these new brands were being considered for introduction and were asked to rate them with limited information. Accordingly, they were given a “Brand Concept Statement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1999</xref>), which included an invented brand name and some personality trait associations for each of the fictitious brands. To control and minimize order bias from maturation or possible primacy/recency effects, the order in which the brands were presented in the questionnaire was systematically rotated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022022110383318">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A 2 (Culture) × 2 (Self-Concept) between-subjects ANOVA was conducted for each of the three brand personality dimensions. Because the objective of the study was to test the self-brand congruity effect at personality-dimension levels, rather than a single product category or brand level, the two product categories were averaged in the subsequent hypothesis-testing analyses.</p>
<p>An ANOVA on the attitudes toward the fictitious brands yielded significant main effects for self-concept across the three dimensions, Sincerity: <italic>F</italic>(1, 415) = 18.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Excitement: <italic>F</italic>(1, 415) = 22.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Competence: <italic>F</italic>(1, 414) = 15.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, but the effect of culture was not significant (<italic>Fs</italic> &lt; 1). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022110383318">Table 1</xref>, both American and Korean participants with high sincere, exciting, and competent self-concepts showed more positive attitudes toward the sincere, exciting, and competent fictitious brands, respectively, than did participants with low self-concepts for the dimensions. As qualified by the Culture × Self-Concept interaction, Sincerity: <italic>F</italic>(1, 415) = 5.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; Excitement: <italic>F</italic>(1, 415) = 4.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, the self-brand congruity effects were more evident in the United States, except for the Competence dimension (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .68) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022022110383318">Figure 1</xref>). To further examine the interaction effect directly, planned one-tailed contrasts were performed. The results revealed that when the personality of the brands was consistent with the participants’ self-concept, the participants in the United States showed more positive attitude towards the brands (Sincerity: <italic>M</italic> = 5.26; Excitement: <italic>M</italic> = 5.37; Competence: <italic>M</italic> = 5.11) than did their Korean counterparts (Sincerity: <italic>M</italic> = 4.88, <italic>t</italic>(192) = 1.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; Excitement: <italic>M</italic> = 4.89, <italic>t</italic>(208) = 2.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). However, the same pattern was not observed when the brand personality was inconsistent with the participants’ self-concepts (Sincerity U.S. <italic>M</italic> = 4.41 vs. Korea <italic>M</italic> = 4.44, <italic>t</italic>(223) = −1.36, <italic>p</italic> = .17; Excitement U.S. <italic>M</italic> = 4.40 vs. Korea <italic>M</italic> = 4.54, <italic>t</italic>(207) = −.67, <italic>p</italic> = .50). Although American participants with competent self-concepts showed more favorable attitudes toward the competent brands than did those in Korea, the difference was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the results on the whole still suggested that the greater the congruity of self-concept with the personality traits of the brands, the greater the likelihood that consumers will prefer the brands. As predicted, the results also supported that self-brand congruity effects were more evident in the United States than in Korea.</p>

<p>In summary, the overall results were supportive of the self-brand congruity hypothesis in both cultures: consumers’ attitudes toward the brands were more positive when their self-concepts were congruent, versus incongruent, with the personality traits of the brands. Regardless of cultural orientation, self-concept was a significant factor in influencing consumers’ attitudes toward the brands, and consumers form positive attitudes toward the brands that possess personality traits congruent with their self-concepts. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the cultural variation in the extent of self-brand congruity effects: more pronounced self-brand congruity effects in the United States than in Korea. To replicate and further support these results, the same procedures and design used in Experiment 1 were employed in Experiment 2, but with two notable changes. First, real brands were adopted to improve external validity. Second, two new dimensions (Sophistication and Ruggedness) were applied in Experiment 2 to enhance generalizability of the findings.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The American sample consisted of 218 undergraduate students enrolled in introductory courses at a large southeastern university in the United States (70% female; mean age = 20.4). In Korea, 196 undergraduate students from two universities (51% female; mean age = 22) participated.</p>

<title>Stimuli With Real Brands</title>
<p>The selection of real brands with distinct personalities followed a two-step process. First, 10 familiar brands for each of the two product categories (apparel and watches) were identified. To find well-known brands for the sample in each culture, 45 American (54% female, age <italic>M</italic> = 21) and 38 Korean undergraduates (49% female, age <italic>M</italic> = 23) were asked to provide any brands they were familiar with, or had experience with, in two product categories. This procedure led to 20 brands (10 for each product) in each culture. Second, brands having distinct personalities were identified. That is, brands that scored highest on one of the two dimensions (Sophistication and Ruggedness) but scored low on the other (unintended) dimension were sought. Another group of 135 American (67% female, <italic>M</italic> = 21) and 98 Korean students (52% female, <italic>M</italic> = 23) rated the 20 brands along the six and five personality traits for the Sophistication and Ruggedness dimensions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker, 1997</xref>), on a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>not at all describes</italic>, 7 = <italic>perfectly describes</italic>). In the United States, Ralph Lauren apparel (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Rolex watches (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were rated significantly higher on Sophistication, and Timberland apparel (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Swiss Army watches (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) scored high on Ruggedness. As in the United States, Ralph Lauren apparel (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and Rolex watches (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were high on Sophistication in Korea, and North Face apparel (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and Tag Heuer watches (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) obtained higher ratings on Ruggedness. Accordingly, the four identified real brands were utilized in each country (Ralph Lauren, Rolex, Timberland, and Swiss Army in the United States and Ralph Lauren, Rolex, North Face, and Tag Heuer in Korea).</p>

An ANOVA on the attitudes toward the brands yielded a significant main effect for self-concept, Sophistication: <italic>F</italic>(1, 410) = 89.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Ruggedness: <italic>F</italic>(1, 397) = 39.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. However, the results indicated that a main effect of culture was not statistically significant, Sophistication: <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .44; Ruggedness: <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .12. Regardless of cultural backgrounds, participants who rated themselves high on the self-concept traits were more likely to show positive attitudes toward the brands than those with low self-concept on the dimensions. More importantly, the Self-Concept × Culture interaction was significant, Sophistication: <italic>F</italic>(1, 410) = 4.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; Ruggedness: <italic>F</italic>(1, 397) = 6.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Additionally, the results of planned one-tailed contrasts revealed that when personality of the brands was consistent with participants’ self-concept, the participants in the United States showed more positive attitude towards the brands (Sophistication: <italic>M</italic> = 5.27; Ruggedness: <italic>M</italic> = 4.74) than did those in Korea (Sophistication: <italic>M</italic> = 4.94, <italic>t</italic>(182) = 2.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; Ruggedness: <italic>M</italic> = 4.29, <italic>t</italic>(191) = 2.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). However, the same pattern was not observed when brand personality was not matched with the participants’ self-concept (Sophistication: U.S. <italic>M</italic> = 3.99 vs. Korea <italic>M</italic> = 4.14, <italic>t</italic>(228) = −.93, <italic>p</italic> = .35; Ruggedness: U.S. <italic>M</italic> = 3.76 vs. Korea <italic>M</italic> = 3.87, <italic>t</italic>(206) = −.74, <italic>p</italic> = .35) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022110383318">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022022110383318">Figure 2</xref>). These results replicated those of Experiment 1 and further supported the prediction of more apparent self-brand congruity effects in the United States than in Korea.</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>Over the past five decades, there has been an ongoing discussion of self-brand congruity among consumer psychologists. Although prior literature has been generally supportive of a positive relationship between self-brand congruity and brand preference, virtually all of the empirical studies have focused on consumers in the United States. Very little is known about the role of brand personality in defining, expressing, and communicating self-concept among consumers in East Asian cultures. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022022110383318">Suh (2002)</xref>, the idea of self-consistency needs to be further tested and studied in different cultural contexts, such as collectivistic cultures. The current research, therefore, examined the self-congruity hypothesis in Korea, a collectivistic culture, in comparison with the United States, an individualistic culture, and provided empirical support for the applicability of the self-brand congruity hypothesis across cultures.</p>
<p>In both experiments, the self-brand congruity hypothesis was generally confirmed across personality dimensions and cultures, demonstrating the universal tendency among consumers to use brands that are congruent with their self-image to create and communicate their self-concepts. Brands with distinct personality traits on a particular dimension are more favorably evaluated by consumers who perceive themselves to be schematic rather than aschematic on that personality dimension in both cultures. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022110383318">Aaker (1997)</xref> noted, one of the reasons for the relatively weak empirical support in previous research for self-brand congruity effects is that the hypothesis was examined at the aggregate level rather than at the dimensional level. By testing the self-brand congruity hypothesis at the personality dimensional level with an established scale, the present study lends further support for the self-brand congruity effects that appear robust across cultures.</p>
<p>As predicted by the self-congruity theory as well as a broader class of cognitive-consistency theories, the findings of this study suggest that individuals strive to maintain cognitive consistency in their beliefs and behaviors and that consistency is an essential condition that predicts psychological well-being not only in Western cultures but also in East Asian cultures. Despite such similarities, several meaningful cross-cultural differences observed in this study attest to the importance of taking cultural influence into account in self-congruity research. In line with the prediction, this study with two experiments documents that self-brand congruity effects are more evident in the United States than in Korea across brand personality dimensions, suggesting that consistency is less emphasized and salient in East Asian cultures than in Western cultures. Individuals in the United States view the self as stable and consistent and value self-promotion, autonomy, and uniqueness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022110383318">Cross et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022110383318">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). In contrast, individuals in collectivist cultures (e.g., Korea) regard the self as part of their social context and believe that the self becomes most meaningful and complete when connected to others in social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022110383318">Cross et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022110383318">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022022110383318">Markus and Kitayama (1994)</xref> argued that an extreme form of self-consistency in collectivist cultures may be perceived as a “lack of flexibility, rigidity, or even immaturity” (p. 576). Our findings echo the conceptualization of self-construal that differs in Western and East Asian cultures and extend empirical support for the varied self-congruity effects across cultures to the brand evaluation contexts.</p>
<p>Our general interpretation of the findings rests partly on the assumption that both differences and similarities in the self-brand congruity effects can potentially be accounted for by cultural values and meanings. In this study, we conceptualized individualistic and collectivistic cultures in terms of the predisposition to think of oneself as a unique individual or as part of a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022110383318">Briley &amp; Wyer, 2001</xref>). While our data in Experiments 1 and 2 revealed a cross-cultural difference in independent self-construal as suggested by prior cross-cultural research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022110383318">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>), the interdependent self-construal values reported by the U.S. and Korean samples did not differ significantly in the way that is often assumed to reflect the dichotomous conceptualization of individualism and collectivism, though our findings still suggest that the Korean sample was higher than the U.S. sample on interdependent self-construal. Perhaps the lack of substantial difference in interdependence between the two cultures relates to contextuality of self-concept. Previous research suggested that Koreans are more collectivistic than European Americans in their self-reported behavior toward family members but less collectivistic than European Americans in their behavior toward nonmembers as they make finer distinctions between in-group and out-group members than do their American counterparts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022022110383318">Rhee, Uleman, &amp; Lee, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternatively, our data may indicate that there have been shifts toward individualism in collectivistic cultures since Hofstede’s study due to affluence, mass media, globalization, and modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022110383318">Fernandez &amp; Carlson, 1997</xref>). The independent-interdependent self-construal scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022110383318">Singelis, 1994</xref>) employed in the present research is only one of the many that are available to infer cultural variations. The manifestation and dynamic transformations of cultural orientations and values may not be fully captured by the conception of independent and interdependent self-construal alone. Furthermore, while the self-construal-based cultural assumption was assessed at the aggregate level and cross-cultural differences were examined, individual variations may exist within a single culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022110383318">Dutta-Bergman &amp; Wells, 2002</xref>). Individual-level analysis of cultural orientations and self-construal may add to our knowledge of cultural influences on brand preference and evaluation.</p>
<p>Although marketers have claimed the importance of brand personality in the persuasion process, academic research has made little effort and progress in empirically assessing this intuitive view. Our results suggest that brand personality traits, which marketers can carefully craft and promote, can be the central driver of persuasion and brand preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022110383318">Biel, 1993</xref>) and can be used to market a brand across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022022110383318">Plummer, 1985</xref>). By designing marketing campaigns consistent with the intended personality traits at a dimensional level, marketers may increase the initial preferences of the target market for newly developed brands, thereby enhancing persuasion. In fact, the findings of the present study indicate that consumers can infer the personalities of brands despite their having very limited information. That is, although participants in Experiment 1 were given limited information on fictitious brands, the results demonstrate that even with such little and rather obscure information, a brand personality could be created in consumers’ minds.</p>
<p>Several limitations of this study should be discussed toward directions for future research. First, this study relied on a limited number of real brands and product categories (i.e., apparel and watches). Further research with a larger set of self-expressive product categories is needed to identify the degree of generalizability of the results across contexts, persons, and brands. From another methodological perspective, the participants (i.e., college students) and measures that confined to the college setting can be limited in expression of the specific attributes of each type of cultural influence. Certainly, more work is needed to examine whether the results of this research translate to nonstudent samples before any definitive conclusions are drawn. Also unexplored in this research is idiosyncratic aspects of brand meaning. Although this study found robust self-brand congruity effects across the established brand personality dimensions at the collective level, the nature of one’s connection to a brand may not be fully captured without knowledge of personal significance and symbolic nuances of the brand recognized by the individual himself or herself. Future research should investigate the potentially differential self-brand congruity effects associated with subjective characteristics of brand meaning.</p>
<p>Another avenue that merits future exploration is to identify other variables that might further explain or change the results found in the two experiments presented herein. Some of the variables might reflect cultural differences. Also, such variables as product involvement, brand loyalty and commitment, and past experience with brands may be relevant. Questions of interest include the following: Will individuals with a highly rugged self-concept be more heavily influenced by a rugged message style? Will sophisticated individuals be more accepting of advertising with a focus on the sophisticated image of the brand? Would the same pattern of results occur across different levels of product involvement? Would similar findings be observed across differing extents of brand loyalty? Individuals with different self-concepts may respond differently to the same messages and the pattern of message effectiveness may vary from culture to culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022022110383318">Lorr, 1991</xref>). Further research addressing these questions should provide additional insight into the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and the potential message customization criteria in a cross-cultural context.</p>
