<abstract>
<p>Cancer services in India have evolved and expanded significantly in recent years, with a surge in the availability of biomedical oncological treatment facilities for certain cohorts of the Indian population in urban areas. Despite significant and sustained economic development in many areas of India, major issues persist in the delivery of cancer care, even in the context of relatively prosperous urban populations. This article explores the dilemmas evident in Indian cancer care as perceived by a group of Indian oncology clinicians. Specifically, the interviews focused on their perspectives on the key challenges facing cancer patients, particularly in relation to help-seeking and access to care. The main concerns that emerged in the interviews were: (a) <italic>practical constraint</italic> (i.e. access and treatment); (b) <italic>cultural values</italic> (i.e. communication, stigma and the clinic); and (c) <italic>structural conditions</italic> (i.e. inequalities related to place, gender and class). We unpack these as important elements of cancer care in contemporary India, and present Farmer’s notion of structural violence, among other concepts, as potentially useful for understanding some facets of this social problem. We conclude that without a greater understanding of social and cultural issues shaping cancer care in India, little progress will be made in coping with a disease that is set to become a major burden within an increasingly prosperous and ageing population.</p>

<sec id="section2-1363459311403949">
<title>An artefact of the ‘modern’ condition: cancer gains momentum in India</title>
<p>At a population health level, cancer in India has been of relatively little concern and it has remained a relatively low priority in health policy terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311403949">Reddy et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, cancer has not been viewed as a priority for the developing world more broadly. In India, infectious diseases, poverty and malnutrition remain the primary causes of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459311403949">WHO, 2005</xref>). Yet, it is increasingly evident that this focus is narrow and unsustainable given the shifting burden of disease in India. Cancer is becoming an increasingly critical and visible problem and one that is worthy of significant sociological investigation for several reasons. The first has to do with the current socio-economic transformations taking place in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311403949">Kohli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311403949">Sharma, 1999</xref>). India’s neo-liberal programme of economic reform and development over the two last decades has been transformative, producing a burgeoning urban middle class who live longer under the auspices of India’s strengthening economic position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311403949">Cohen, 1998</xref>; Kholi, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311403949">Mawdsley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459311403949">Varma, 1998</xref>). The newly privileged echelons of Indian (urban) society now operate in an increasingly modernized setting, where access to knowledge, and expectations around quality in health services are on par with those of populations in western contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311403949">Desai, 2002</xref>). Under such changing circumstances, cancer is not only more prevalent, but community awareness continues to rise, and there has been a surge in the training of biomedical oncology professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311403949">Desai, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, while awareness of cancer and rates of biomedical diagnosis/treatment are improving in urban settings, the ability of health and social services to cope with the existing cancer burden, let alone increasing rates of morbidity/mortality, is limited if not non-existent in many rural and remote areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311403949">Datta, 2010</xref>). As reflected in accounts presented below by those at the forefront of cancer care in Delhi, the challenges India faces in regards to oncology services are complex and multi-faceted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311403949">Desai, 2002</xref>). While cancer may seem to be a less urgent concern to public health stakeholders, we argue that its fast expanding reach requires significant investigation. Moreover, by examining cancer care and those who are treating cancer patients, we can explore more widely the tensions in contemporary Indian society, including those of economic liberalization/social inequality and precarious balance of ‘tradition’ vis-à-vis ‘modernity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403949">Broom et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1363459311403949">
<title>A snapshot of cancer in India</title>
<p>The World Health Organization has predicted that by the year 2020, almost 70 per cent of the world’s cancer patients will be in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459311403949">WHO, 2008</xref>). Currently, the Indian subcontinent is home to 17 per cent of the world’s population and at any one time it is estimated that there are over 2 million people with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311403949">Kishore et al., 2008</xref>). Between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of Indian cancer patients have late stage incurable disease when first diagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311403949">Pal and Mittal, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311403949">2004b</xref>). At present in India, out of a million newly diagnosed cancer patients each year, more than 50 per cent will die within 12 months of diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311403949">Pal and Mittal, 2004b</xref>). In 2005, cancer was <italic>reported</italic> to have killed approximately 826,000 people in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459311403949">WHO, 2005</xref>) – approximately five out of every 1000 of the population. While these numbers are not accurate in terms of the number who actually die of cancer (given those who remain undiagnosed) the upward shift in reported cases is revealing. For example, cancer diagnoses are predicted to rise disproportionally as compared with cardiovascular and communicable diseases by 2030, to nearly 1.5 million deaths annually (approximately 10 out of every 1000 of the population). This is a very conservative estimation and moreover the figure takes no account of those who die of cancer without actually being diagnosed.</p>
<p>India, in many respects reflects wider issues facing developing countries including limited CT, PET and radiotherapy facilities and insufficient oncology-trained clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311403949">Pal and Mittal, 2004b</xref>). Even in major urban centres, such as the capital Delhi – the focus of the current study – there are inadequate resources to cover the needs of the populations of cancer patients in their <italic>immediate</italic> vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403949">Broom et al., 2009</xref>). Resource issues are not limited to strictly economic factors with local belief systems and socioeconomic structures critically influencing access to cancer care and help-seeking behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403949">Broom et al., 2009</xref>). This includes poor reporting of pain/symptoms, delayed help seeking and dropout once treatment has begun. In this article we focus on some of the socio-cultural influences operating within contemporary Indian cancer care – a focus that necessitates a rethinking of the sociology of cancer that allows for, and captures, facets of Indian culture and identity work.</p>

<title>Towards a sociology of cancer care in India</title>
<p>The sociology of cancer and cancer care as manifested in western contexts has produced a significant body of conceptual work. In particular there has been a focus on issues related to the body (i.e. bodily disintegration, mutation and reconfigurations) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311403949">Chapple and Ziebland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311403949">Nettleton and Watson, 1998</xref>); identity disruptions and reconstructions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459311403949">Mathieson and Stam, 1995</xref>); giving and receiving care (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363459311403949">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>); the politics of care (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363459311403949">Tritter et al., 2003</xref>); and, the biographical mediations of experiences of cancer (i.e. gender, age, class and sexuality) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459311403949">Emslie et al., 2009</xref>). This has included rich examinations of the social mediation and expression of suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311403949">Kellehear, 2009</xref>); lay/professional power dynamics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311403949">Gross, 2009</xref>); and the emergence of cancer as chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459311403949">Tritter and Calnan, 2002</xref>). Yet, sociologists interested in cancer care have focused almost exclusively on the developed world, with those researching economically poorer countries examining such problems as HIV, infectious diseases and violence (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311403949">Heimer, 2007</xref>). We argue that existing work in sociology could be meaningfully extended to contribute to, but also in turn be refined by, the study of cancer care in developing countries such as India.</p>
<p>On a very basic level, the Indian cultural landscape reinforces <italic>and</italic> subverts normative biomedical conceptions of cancer and cancer care. It reinforces western (often hegemonic) ideas and practices through the proliferation of biomedical institutions and clinicians providing diagnoses and techno-scientific forms of cancer care. At the same time, such techno-scientific techniques of diagnosis available at urban cancer centres often jar with ‘everyday’ understanding of health, illness and disease. Multiple forms of ‘care’ exist and complete in the Indian cultural landscape and thus cancer care trajectories are often rooted in the politics of social value (i.e. related to caste, class, gender and age) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403949">Broom et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, people’s very understandings of cancer, as the clinicians’ accounts we analyse below illustrate, are rooted in socio-economic considerations, and underpinned by culturally meaningful ideologies and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311403949">Kakar, 1982</xref>; and also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311403949">Badami, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311403949">Kishore et al., 2008</xref>). Of course, India is not a homogenous entity, and questions of violence and sufferings are historically contingent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311403949">Pati and Harrison, 2006</xref>), and vary across class, caste, gender and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311403949">Ram, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the themes and issues that the clinicians raised in the course of our research point to the saliency of certain aspects associated with the Indian socio-economic environment that both frame the way the disease is experienced and perceived, which in turn, structure the delivery of cancer care to patients.</p>

<sec id="section5-1363459311403949">
<title>Stigma, tradition and the clinic</title>
<p>The stigma of the ‘unknown’ (or perhaps unknowable) is a central theme when examining the lay/biomedical interface in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459311403949">Unnithan, 2010</xref>). The prevalence of cancer and the extent of biomedical oncological services are relatively new features of the India medical landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311403949">Pal and Mittal, 2004b</xref>). The proliferation of biomedical clinics has contributed to tensions between ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403949">Broom et al., 2009</xref>). Such dynamics have also emerged as deeply embedded in social cleavages around class, caste, place and gender. The (biomedical) clinic is often a site of struggle over the meanings of illness and approaches to care, presenting both opportunities for patients as well as restrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459311403949">Loblay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311403949">Ram, 2010</xref>). It provides hope for treatment and recovery but also harbours the potential for alienation in biomedical encounters where traditional beliefs and practices around the body and illness are being challenged by techno-scientific forms of health practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403949">Broom et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, western biomedical notions of disclosure, informed consent and informed decision making accompany the expansion of biomedical services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459311403949">Lupton, 1997</xref>), yet they do not necessarily sit comfortably with local cultural sensibilities that vary greatly across regions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311403949">Badami, 2010</xref>). People other than cancer patients themselves – generally members of the immediate family – may in fact make treatment decisions and negotiate care with health professionals. As such, the notion of the lay–expert discussion within a medical consultation about prognosis or diagnosis may be incompatible with the needs and perceptions of some Indian families.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1363459311403949">
<title>Structural inequalities and cancer care</title>
<p>A focus on social inequalities is critical in developing an understanding of cancer care in India. Biomedical cancer services are largely available to the wealthier cohorts of urban Indian populations, whereas in rural areas there are often neither treatment facilities nor biomedical oncological expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311403949">Pal and Mittal, 2004b</xref>). This is to some degree being challenged by the rather dramatic expansion of India’s private health care sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459311403949">Ranson, 2001</xref>). In India public spending on health care is among the lowest in the world with 80 per cent private expenditure including insurance, employee schemes and out-of-pocket (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311403949">Jilani et al., 2009</xref>). Public spending on health care is precarious at 0.9 per cent of gross domestic product with only Burundi, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sudan and Cambodia spending less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311403949">Sengupta and Nundy, 2005</xref>). This proportion of GDP has fallen since the neoliberal economic reforms of 1991 when it was 1.3 per cent of GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311403949">Sengupta and Nundy, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, access to biomedical cancer care is still difficult if not impossible for the Indian underclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311403949">Pal and Mittal, 2004b</xref>) and most cancer patients do not have private health insurance. One admission to hospital will often lead to financial crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311403949">Pal and Mittal, 2004b</xref>). Private for-profit insurers recently allowed to prosper in India target the wealthier echelons of Indian society but they offer little to India’s poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459311403949">Ranson, 2001</xref>). The gendered character of the health care workforce in India also contributes to the inequalities in access to care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311403949">Healy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311403949">Ram, 2010</xref>). There is a paucity of female doctors, which can perpetuate a resistance to help-seeking among Indian women, particularly in the context of breast and ovarian malignancies. The lower status of many women in India and their role expectations can also contribute to delays in seeking treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459311403949">Parikh and Garg, 1989</xref>). Previous research has shown that many Indian women hide their symptoms as long as possible and to some degree expect to suffer (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459311403949">Bhave, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403949">Broom et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Such considerations add further weight to arguments regarding the need to consider larger social, political and economic inequalities and forms of social suffering when attempting to understand experiences of illness and care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311403949">Kleinman et al., 1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311403949">Farmer, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311403949">2003</xref>). In particular, we find Paul Farmer’s development of the concept of structural violence useful to highlight the organizational and institutional structures that inhibit marginalized populations from ready access to health care in India. Such forms of structural violence operate through normative systems of exclusion, tied to gender, caste, political and material interests and ideologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459311403949">Bourgois and Scheper-Hughes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403949">Ecks and Sax, 2005</xref>). Such considerations frame and are implied in many of the accounts detailed below. They highlight the ‘centre–periphery’ divide as an important variable that reflects and reproduces forms of exclusion and marginalization.</p>
<p>While many studies of cancer in western contexts have illustrated social cleavages in access to and quality of care (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311403949">Faggiano et al., 1997</xref>), the situation in developing countries is far more acute, and as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459311403949">Bourgois and Scheper-Hughes (2004)</xref> observe, considerably more research is required to render visible these linkages between violence, suffering and power. This study reported on here is an initial attempt to fill this gap.</p>
<p>As such, in this article we aim to contribute to emergent understandings of cancer care in India through an in-depth analysis of the perspectives of a group of Delhi-based clinicians. That is, we present a range of practitioner accounts of issues related to access to, and the context of, cancer care in northern urban India. Their accounts are merely <italic>one set</italic> of situated perspectives on the social life of cancer in contemporary India. They provide insights into how urban Indians may be experiencing biomedical cancer care and the stigma of disease; identify those who may be falling through the gaps; and the respective roles of gender, age and class in shaping experiences of disease and treatment processes.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We selected three hospitals and one palliative care service that provide cancer and end-of-life services in Delhi, India. After ethics approval was secured from the lead author’s university and researchers sought approval from the local organizations via their research representatives. After formal approval was obtained, we approached hospital management regarding participation of the oncology/haematology consultants and nurses. Agreement was reached and clinicians in each hospital were informed about the study via senior management and asked if they were willing to take part in an interview. Participation was voluntary and informed consent was gained prior to the interview process. In total, 22 clinicians participated in a 30–60-minute in-depth interview. The authors had no previous relationship/interactions with the participants prior to the study. We interviewed 16 medical specialists (medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, palliative care specialists, surgeons, haematological oncologists, paediatric haematologists) and five oncology nurses and one oncology clinical psychologist. We included a mix of ages, gender (12 male and 10 female) and seniority to ensure heterogeneity in the sample. The interviews explored a range of issues including: the impacts of cancer in India from the perspectives of cancer clinicians; access to care and structural issues facing oncologists in treating people with cancer; and discussing cancer with patients and the cultural issues related to disclosure. Examples of interview questions are as follows: what cultural and economic factors do you see as shaping experiences of, and access to, cancer care in India? How do you communicate the nature of a cancer diagnosis to your patients? How do you perceive your patients as viewing a cancer diagnosis and their experience of the clinical environment? What broader issues shape the delivery of cancer care in urban India? The interviews were digitally recorded and subsequently fully transcribed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1363459311403949">
<title>Clinical contexts</title>
<p>Two of the hospitals we recruited from for this study were public, teaching hospitals that provide cancer care for a relatively small (but still significant) fee to the Delhi population and for those able to travel from other regions of North India. It is important to note that these two public hospitals are relatively well funded and certainly technologically advanced in comparison to cancer services throughout India. The third was a private cancer centre and provided high-end cancer services for the middle class, North Indian population. The palliative care service is a community organization/clinic that provides home-based palliative care.</p>

<sec id="section9-1363459311403949">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The methodology for this project draws on the interpretive traditions within qualitative research. This involved taking an in-depth exploratory approach to data collection, aimed at documenting the subjective and complex experiences of the respondents. The aim was to achieve a detailed understanding of the varying positions adhered to, and to locate these within a spectrum broader underlying beliefs and/or agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311403949">Charmaz, 1990</xref>). The approach used was developmental, in that knowledge generated in the early interviews was challenged, compared with and built upon by later ones. The process of analysis began during data collection. This provided an opportunity to establish initial themes and then to look for deviant or negative cases, complicating our observations and retaining the complexity of the data. We approached the analysis by systematically reading through each interview several times, writing notes, discussing ideas with one another and other colleagues, and searching for any patterns within the data collected. Within this process, we continually sought to retain the richness of the respondents’ experiences, documenting atypical cases, conflicts and contradictions within the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311403949">Ezzy, 2002</xref>). Following this initial analysis, we looked back through these notes in order to establish themes emerging across the diaries and the subsequent interviews. Within this process, once we had identified a theme, we would search through the interviews for other related comments, employing constant comparison to develop or complicate these themes further. This process meant that events that we initially viewed as unrelated could be grouped together as their interconnectedness became apparent. The final step involved revisiting the literature and seeking out conceptual tools that we could use to make sense of the patterns that had emerged from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311403949">Ezzy, 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>As a broad context to the data presented below, we should emphasize that this article unpacks and reveals <italic>clinician perspectives</italic> on the structural context of cancer care in urban India. These accounts represent a certain perspective on the social life of cancer; a view bound by professional objectives, clinical environments and individual biographies. Yet, we view this as an important first step towards documenting a wider range of stakeholder perspectives in India.</p>

<title>Practical issues: getting to hospital and getting treated</title>
<p>A consistent theme in each of the clinician’s accounts was that of access to treatment and the availability of cancer services for the <italic>aam aadmi</italic> (the common man) in India. The processes of, and pathways to, accessing care for the majority of the population were viewed as flawed and generally resulting in significant confusion for the patient and their family:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participant 4: … like head and neck cancer … generally people take tobacco, they eventually find a big ulcer. And what happens when [they’ve got] initial ulcer below the lower lip, they contact local physician … the [local physicians] are untrained. And because lack of experience, those people just treat them with very simple medicine … Generally what happens, like when the ulcer is getting large, popping out of the big lymph nodes out of there, then somebody will advise them that you are not supposed to take such kind of treatment, [they] report to bigger hospital … Then only then they come out from their village and come to such centres. Here there is a lot of confusion, they will go to one hospital, to other hospital, because of lack of knowledge, because cancer hospitals are very limited [in India] … Then patient comes finally to the cancer hospital … So until that time there’s a lot of important time lost, and there, it is very difficult for us to take care of that patient. (Consultant Medical Oncologist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This quotation is illustrative of the frustrations voiced by each of the clinicians concerning the inaccessibility of cancer for the <italic>aam aadmi</italic>. For those of low socio-economic background, and particularly those from rural areas, even if they were eventually diagnosed, the time lapse meant the prospects of recovery were severely compromised. The clinicians’ accounts specifically highlighted the predicament faced by what the media often refer to as the ‘other’ India; that is the plight of the <italic>aam aadmi</italic> versus the wealthy middle class receiving increasingly high quality biomedical services. For these clinicians, their patients’ suffering (and that of those who do not reach their clinics) reflected wider tensions characterizing Indian society whereby modern, rational-technical and bureaucratic forms of knowledge and practice meet localized services and belief systems. This division emerged as the dominant trope underlying many of the issues discussed over the course of the interviews.</p>
<p>The clinicians regularly recounted stories of confusion within different Indian communities regarding the meanings and importance of the initial stages of cancer. Local physicians (not ‘formally’ trained), local pharmacists and/or traditional healers would take initial responsibility for treatment often reportedly not recognizing the presence of a malignancy. The subsequent delays in accessing specialized biomedical treatment were viewed as typical rather than extreme examples:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participant 7: In Delhi, generally I can say that starting off initial symptom, to [presentation] of disease is … something like six months to two to three years. So much of time … I give you an example of [village], which is 40, 50 kilometres away from Delhi. That’s a very hilly kind of [travel] and the population is also kind of scattered, and it’s a, like in one place you will find 50 houses, 30 houses, 20 houses, and absolutely no medical facilities … They have to travel really far to reach to the basic health facility level. So … say some lady has some lump [inside her breast] she will try to take the local help first, somebody will say to her, oh no, it will heal automatically, you take this um … this local plant … Once it pops out from the [very first] level it’s a fungating mass and it’s bleeding, oozing pus, something like that. Then only they are told that ok this is something that yes, cannot be controlled here. (Consultant Medical Oncologist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While we acknowledge the dynamics of elite medical professionals telling atrocity stories (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403949">Dingwall, 1977</xref>) and the potential denigration of traditional healing practices and local physicians through claims of incompetence, these accounts cannot be reduced to the articulation of professional legitimacy and practices of delineation. Delays in presenting to hospital were talked about as a widespread problem fundamentally mitigating their own capacity to care effectively for their patients. As outlined previously, research shows that the majority of Indian cancer patients have late stage incurable disease when first diagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311403949">Pal and Mittal, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311403949">2004b</xref>) and the accounts presented here point to some potentially important factors that contribute to this problem. Yet, access to care emerged in the interviews as not solely situated within issues of access, knowledge or remoteness. Even in contexts where people did gain access to biomedical oncology care, the clinicians observed a range of ‘cultural’ sensibilities intimately shaping the delivery of health care.</p>

<title>Foreignness, stigma and communicating prognosis</title>
<p>The relatively recent introduction of specialized biomedical cancer facilities and the novelty of a ‘cancer diagnosis’ within the community were relatively common points of discussion. In particular, the impact of the foreignness of the hospital and the unknown character of cancer symtomatology/diagnoses:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participant 14: … howsoever good I may be, howsoever communicative I may be, howsoever caring I may be, this building by itself is intimidating to a patient. The concept of nurses, and of injections, is intimidating to a patient. Half the time they run off because of that intimidation. Whereas, a traditional [healer] is sitting in the shop, in a village, under a tree, there is no intimidating instrument with him there are no machines which are intimidating for that poor man. He [the healer] is a part of that society, he has risen from within that society, so he is more acceptable to that person. And that is why they are able to communicate with their patients much better than we are … because that man was able to relate to him, he [the patient] is not able to relate to me … So I feel that although these many faces of modern medicine are needed, they are very intimidating for a person. (Consultant Haematologist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even for those patients who eventually accessed biomedical cancer treatments, which immediately situates them within the more privileged echelons of Indian society, their lack of previous exposure to hospital environments was described by these clinicians as often resulting in negative, alienating experiences. Moreover, the observation made by the above clinician also speaks volumes to the daunting effects of the metropolis on the rural individual or family seeking urban-based health care. As alluded to by several of the clinicians interviewed, the medical encounter can be mystifying and confronting for many Indian cancer patients in terms of the specificities and foreignness of this material space (i.e. modern architecture, technologies, etc.). There is also an appreciation of what might be viewed as ‘epistemological violence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311403949">Shiva, 1990</xref>) embedded in their accounts. Similar to structural violence, this is an indirect, non-physical form of violence, highlighting the subordination of alternative modes of knowledge (and being in the world) to the scientific, rational imperatives of modernity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311403949">Shiva, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent anthropological research in India has illustrated how the medical encounter can also be socially and interpersonally unsettling for those accustomed to certain gender norms and authority structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459311403949">Loblay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311403949">Ram, 2010</xref>). The medical division of labour, while also highly gendered in its own right, redistributes power according to organizational principles rather than ‘normal’ socio-cultural relations; a potentially unnerving dislocation from familiar social hierarchies. Such experiences are enhanced by an alien language and not simply that of the biomedical lexicon. Even standard Hindi is foreign to many of those from the rural areas of India. These factors, among others, contribute to a potentially socially and culturally dissembled experience, where people may feel disoriented at best.</p>
<p>Such experiences of disorientation and alienation were discussed at length as key to patients refusing or discontinuing treatment. This was viewed as partially related to the character of cancer itself and a reported lack of community knowledge of, or acceptance of, the disease. Even within communities where cancer was in fact recognized as a health concern, a cultural stigma was reflected on by the consultants, often talked about as resulting in a lack of willingness to get help:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participant 7: They [patients] see cancer as a killer disease, and once you’re declared [to have] cancer, that was end of life. So that fear prevents them to go to the centre and get admitted here. Once you are a little bit convinced that this is cancer and nothing else, at their own level, just based on the symptom or suspicion or maybe the surrounding feedback, they decide themselves and they don’t like to go there [to a hospital]. (Consultant Medical Oncologist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The clinicians’ accounts of their cancer patients as often previously unaware of cancer and as carrying significant stigma and fear, is revealing of the lack of penetration of public health information/messages regarding cancer across India. Such social stigmas and misunderstandings were further compounded by the fact that it was often assumed that cancer was contagious, much like a large number of other common diseases in India:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participant 3: … many people think cancer is infectious … So they will ask us, can we keep our, should we keep our children out of his or her room? Or … is it possible we will also get infected by cancer if we care for him or her? So we tell them, ok, I have been doing this thing since nine years, and we are not getting infected, how can you? The stigma is very much there … they sometimes ask us not to come to their home. (Clinical Psychologist)</p>
<p>Participant 10: … sometimes it happens, like, ok, patient is aware he has lung cancer, and family is also aware he has lung cancer, but they don’t disclose it to each other … or they will try to hide it from him [the patient]. (Oncology Nurse)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The stigma and uncertainties surrounding a cancer diagnosis were reported as being particularly problematic in delaying patients seeking help initially and then in restricting access to supportive care within the community. While community visits were sometimes allowed by psychologists and palliative care nurses, these clinicians regularly found that their patients did not want hospital cars (particularly when it was a vehicle clearly identifiable as being from a specialist cancer hospital) parked outside their homes or to be seen as having hospital staff entering their home. These fears of being revealed as ill with a relatively unknown disease were seen to greatly feed into lack of access to, and willingness to seek, care. Moreover, as shown in the following section, the broad sense of cancer as a ‘terrifying disease’ fed into family and community expectations about what doctors could or should communicate to their patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1363459311403949">
<title>Communication about cancer: discussing diagnosis and prognosis</title>
<p>Research has shown approaches to disclosure of a cancer prognosis are highly variable across cultures, and the case of cancer diagnosis and subsequent disclosure (or lack thereof) in Japan is a particularly pertinent example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311403949">Seo et al., 2000</xref>). Linked to the sense of the wider cultural stigma associated with cancer, these clinicians recounted the tensions evident in disclosing a cancer diagnosis and prognosis, each reflecting on the cultural pressures and (often contradictory) expectations placed on biomedical oncology clinicians:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participant 8: False hope should not be given to a patient … Only thing is, things are often not discussed in front of him. And as he sees his deteriorating condition, he knows what is happening to him. He will not know from me, but he will come to know from relations and other people … You see, conventionally, this is what I do. I talk to the patient’s relations only. Because, our system is such. Our Indian system and culture is such, and relations force us not to talk and deliver the information to patient. (Head and Neck Surgeon)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another respondent comments:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participant 12: … it [how I disclose the diagnosis] depends upon how educated, how receptive the patient is … if the patient is educated, if he knows about [cancer], there is no harm talking about it to him. But sometimes the family doesn’t want, you know, for us to talk directly to them and they want to hush it. But this is not good, you know, suppose if he starts some oral chemotherapy, see he loses hairs, and says, [doctor] I have lost my hairs. What the hell is happening around me? So, at that point of time you tell. It’s better that you tell it in the very beginning, that ok, you are going to have these problems, and they [hairs] are all going to recover … but this is not often the Indian way. (Consultant Medical Oncologist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As shown in the above excerpts, and evident in the other clinicians’ accounts, a desire for diagnosis and prognosis to remain unspoken was common among the Indian families they interacted with. Families were reported to ‘hush hush’ the consultants if they attempted to discuss cancer in the patient’s presence, and families would take the patient out of the room while they remained to discuss the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options. The consultants viewed this as a feature of Indian society that is at odds with best oncology practice in terms facilitating ethical and informed decision making. Furthermore, while talked about as ‘distinctly Indian’ in character, the consultants also emphasized the fact that these interpersonal dynamics are also intimately linked to the social stigma of cancer and a broader sense of hopelessness around the disease. Thus, disclosure of a cancer diagnosis to the patient, from a family perspective, would do little to help the situation. <italic>Knowing</italic> was only viewed as useful insofar as there remained a solution or ‘cure’ – something many families considered doubtful.</p>
<p>Western sensibilities underpin such reflections, including those of informed consent, consumerism, patient choice and so on (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459311403949">Lupton, 1997</xref>), but yet there also emerged an interesting ambivalence in their accounts regarding the value of Indian practices of collective burden. While the consultants’ accounts contained numerous critiques of the way Indian cultural beliefs and family dynamics problematize the timely and effective delivery of care, there was also a strong sense of the benefits of collectivist values prominent within Indian society. A key theme was the collectivist approach to solving or managing problems in Indian society; the family as shouldering the burden together with the person with cancer:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participant 5: … whatever the family cannot do in terms of financial inputs for the patient care, they more than make up for it by just being the family that they are, you know, somehow that, the bonding and the care that is otherwise given to the patient. I feel really that [it] is a strength, as far as the Indian family struck with cancer deals with it … and everybody is there taking care of all, you know, the whole family, the larger extended family, pitching in. (Consultant Medical Oncologist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, while ‘hushing up’ a cancer diagnosis was viewed as a problematic dynamic, the willingness to deal with the diagnosis as a family unit (including the extended family) was viewed as a powerful form of social support and solidarity. Paradoxically, despite the tendency to conceal the cancer diagnosis from others within the community and even from patients themselves, the level of activity and support from the extended family, as perceived by the consultants, provided a positive cultural resource that should be valued rather then dismissed as antiquated.</p>

<title>Structural inequalities: gender, economics and the burden of disease</title>
<p>Recent economic development in many parts of urban India and processes of modernization have brought many advantages, none more apparent than the recent expansion of health care services. However, in our discussions with these clinicians, the technologies and expertise potentially life-saving for Indian communities, including those related to cancer, were reaching only a small proportion of the population. Structural inequalities and forms of health care polarization were viewed as quite dramatically shaping contemporary cancer care:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participant 5: … we see a large chunk [<italic>sic</italic>] of metastatic breast cancer, and stage three advanced, locally advanced cancers in women because I feel that ah … I think that the family economics has something to do with it. So, whoever is the breadwinner would be the more treasured person, that is one … women also tend to keep that away from the other members of the family, and tend to, because of their social upbringing, and because of inhibitions, related to that, they do tend to overlook that. One of the things we often find women saying is, ok, there was a lump. Yes, I noticed it a year ago, but it was not painful, in cancer, it is supposed to be painful, so that’s how they look at it. We have said so many umpteenth times that pain is one of the last symptoms to appear, you know, it is the other things that happen first. (Consultant Medical Oncologist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above observation emphasizes the most ubiquitous dimension shaping treatment decision making in India: gender structures. Because of their low status relative to men in many parts of India, both in terms of education/literacy as well as within family structures, Indian women may only feel they can ‘complain’ with the onset of severe pain. This is of course a general statement and we are acutely aware of regional differences, as well as the process by which a woman’s position within family structures changes markedly during her life-course (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311403949">Lamb, 2000</xref>). At a more general level, gender constitutes only one element in a wider cultural process influencing the capacity of people to acknowledge, endure, recognize and communicate pain and distress (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311403949">Kleinman et al., 1997</xref>). Other basic factors were also talked about as breaking down processes of biomedical diagnosis and treatment, including the queuing necessary for imaging and diagnostic radiography, and the pressures of a non-regulated work/life balance:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participant 7: … So, suppose you just have to get a chest x-ray here [in the public hospital] then there are 20 people standing in the queue. So like, you never know when your time will come. [Yet] you have to go back to a job … So these things influence whether people decide to take treatment. (Consultant Medical Oncologist)</p>
<p>Participant 14: … a lot of our patients, they come from very far away. So, they really won’t come here unless it is an absolute last resort and they’ve failed all their local treatment. The other problem is the tests are not available, so the local doctor will just have … a malaria test, or a few tests at his disposal, and they’ll often treat patients for TB and malaria and typhoid and usual stuff before they actually figure out that, ok, there could be something more serious than that. (Consultant Haematologist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gender, place and socio-economic status were each talked about by the clinicians interviewed as quite dramatically mediating access to and experiences of cancer care in India. Not being able to get time off work or not having enough money for food to eat while in hospital<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363459311403949">1</xref></sup> were examples of the seemingly ‘small’ factors that would shape whether people received biomedical treatment for cancer:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participant 13: I would say that in paediatric oncology, treatment is not available to majority of the cities, probably available only in 22 to 25 of the cities of India, not more than that. So what happens to the others? … So, now, if I am the father of the child, and I bring my child to Delhi, and I have to get treatment for leukaemia, I would probably have to leave my family and my job, and my way of earning, and stay in Delhi for at least for one-and-a-half to two months, before I can actually think of leaving. So … many days are lost for the father of the family, their whole family gets impacted, what about the other [siblings] in the family? (Consultant Haematologist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The urban/rural divide was often discussed within the interviews, particularly in regards to the quality of cancer care received and the experiences of those living in remote areas. The issues discussed were complex but the constraints posed by distance, cultural practices and ideologies, and economics were emphasized in particular. As part of these discussions, each of the clinicians talked about what they viewed as the systematic failure of the Indian state to ensure adequate technologies, skills and support in many rural communities. The state of cancer care in India, it was often argued in the interviews, was inextricably tied to contemporary (and increasing) forms of polarization evident in the rural/urban divide.</p>
</sec>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cancer is set to become a major public health and health services issue in India with an ageing population and a paucity of biomedical care available within many communities. Only very recently has there been a move to disseminate systematically basic information about cancer prevention/detection (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311403949">Gupta, 2010</xref>), with various strategic attempts to debunk common myths and cultural stigmas regarding cancer. But even these efforts are often privately funded or instigated by NGOs rather than the State. While developing and extending basic cancer services is increasingly viewed as important by the Indian government, there are still widespread public misunderstandings and extremely limited awareness of prevention, treatment and cancer symptomatology. We argue here, as part of a broader process of service development, sociology can make an important contribution in terms of revealing the social life of cancer, in a cultural context.</p>
<p>This study has been a foray into a wider set of public health, economic and socio-cultural concerns in contemporary India. What we have illustrated, through the accounts of those at the institutional forefront of cancer, is the potential influence of practical constraint, cultural values and structural conditions on cancer care. Specifically, the ways in which structural inequalities can influence and shape the delivery of care and the need for experiences of cancer to be placed within a wider socio-cultural context of class, geographical, age and gender structures.</p>
<p>The interviews reflected the predicaments faced by rural populations and the challenges presented by the clinical environment. The influence of collectivist cultural values and the idiosyncrasies of inter-personal diagnostic/prognostic communication revealed here warrant significant further investigation. While it is easy to view some of the communication practices recounted as ‘unethical’ and/or ‘backwards’, such views risk an oversimplified Eurocentric perspective. The practice of clinical non-disclosure and family dynamics protecting the individual, represent wider and important cultural sensibilities. Just as shown in other cultural contexts whereby simplistic notions of informed consent and patient-led decision making are difficult to apply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311403949">Seo et al., 2000</xref>), so too may these be within the Indian context. This is not to suggest such communication and decision-making techniques are not limiting in many contexts for clinicians and patients. However, what the results presented here illustrate is that the provision of biomedical oncology services must be sensitive to cultural ideas about individual and collective responsibility and patriarchal structures.</p>
<p>We are not suggesting that such cultural systems and ideologies associated with the ‘Indian family’ (i.e. patriarchal gender relations) are fixed in time or static. Indeed, there is ample research to suggest otherwise. However the resiliency of these patriarchal structures, evident in their accounts, is important because such statements indicate how economic modes of production that favour a gendered division of labour, and social stratification, are also sanctioned culturally. That is, they are mediated and reproduced through ‘modern’ institutions, biomedical categories and practices of care. Moreover, that such structures, to a degree, function and are reproduced through consensus and popular belief, rather than simply through overt violence and coercion.</p>
<p>We should emphasize that there is a degree of irony in these clinicians reporting of such interpersonal dynamics. On the one hand non-disclosure is represented by these clinicians as ‘backwards’, but on the other hand, this relational dynamic is situated within a wider framework of deference to high status community figures in Indian society (even more so than in western contexts). In western contexts, to an extent, the patient rights and consumer movements have ensured that disclosure is generally uniform and legally binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459311403949">Lupton, 1997</xref>). Such social movements have enabled a greater degree of agency on the part of the consumers/patients in regards to their health, and to an extent, a more balanced power-relation in medical encounters. In India, however, non-disclosure is associated with deference and the unquestioning authority of the medical expert. Thus, while these clinicians critique family preference for non-disclosure, such interpersonal dynamics must also be seen as embedded in asymmetrical power relations characterizing the Indian biomedical encounter.</p>
<p>The issues of practical constraint and structural inequalities emerged as critical for understanding experiences of cancer care in India, and the results resonate with much anthropological writing in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311403949">Farmer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311403949">Kleinman et al., 1997</xref>). Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311403949">Farmer’s (1996)</xref> concept of <italic>structural violence</italic> resonates with the accounts presented here – that is, the structures (e.g. economic, political, legal, religious and cultural) that prevent individuals, groups and societies from reaching their full potential (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459311403949">Galtung, 1969</xref>). Structural because they are embedded in the political and economic organization of a particular social context and violent because they cause harm directly or indirectly to people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311403949">Farmer et al., 2006</xref>). Farmer has emphasized the importance of ethnographic investigation of the local, involving in-depth analysis of individual and collective biographies (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459311403949">Galtung, 1969</xref>). This is work that will need to be completed to provide an embodied, subjective and more nuanced account of the themes examined here. But to render the local, subjective and embodied visible, there is also a need to reveal the broader structural issues raised here. Such forces, recounted by the clinicians interviewed here, range from gender, ethnicity, place, class and age among others, and they significantly influence the agency and well-being of Indian communities in culturally meaningful ways. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311403949">Farmer (1996</xref>: 272; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311403949">Pati and Harrison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311403949">Satya, 2008</xref>) maintains, when trying to represent ‘local’ modes of suffering, we must not lose sight of the larger matrix of culture, history and political economy. As seen in the data presented here, acts of ‘violence’, both structural and epistemological need not be explicitly deviant; they are implied in normative structures, ideologies and material interests (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459311403949">Bourgois and Scheper-Hughes, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>While structuralist accounts of health and illness have been less prominent in recent years in health sociology, the forms of inequality examined here necessarily shape subjective and lived experiences of illness and disease. To draw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311403949">Farmer’s (1996)</xref> words, our project sought to present the ‘view from above’: a series of perspectives that are shaped by an elite status. Moreover, we have presented clinician accounts of the social life of cancer in <italic>urban</italic> India, with substantial research now needed <italic>within</italic> communities, among patients, with carers and with clinicians working in resource poor environments. There remains an urgent need to address these vast social inequalities as part of a wider project designed to unravel the complexities associated with the social life of cancer. This, we envisage, will involve projects that explore the body, caste and notions of personhood, as well as local belief systems. These are facets of cancer well documented in developed nations, but as yet, largely unexplored in South Asia. Working with other stakeholders including patients and their carers will reveal in much more depth how forms of structural violence and social inequality are experienced and negotiated within diverse Indian communities. This may prepare us, at least to some extent, for the inevitable rise of cancer in contemporary India.</p>
