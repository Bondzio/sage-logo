<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 1994, a group of industry-based medical information specialists met to identify and define their core activities in practice. Two years later, the first annual DIA Medical Communication Workshop Core Curriculum was held.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512461442">1</xref>
</sup> Generally, medical information specialists serve as a key interface among internal business partners and external customers. With the most complete data available on their products, these professionals provide accurate, up-to-date product information in response to unsolicited external customer requests and collect information on adverse events and product complaints.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512461442">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512461442"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512461442"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512461442">4</xref>
</sup> For internal business partners, medical information specialists provide a variety of services including training, promotional review, and medical education. Over time, the core curriculum has evolved, incorporating new tasks and responsibilities in accordance with those gained by medical information specialists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512461442">2</xref>

<sec id="section2-0092861512461442">
<title>Other Professional Benchmarking Surveys</title>
<p>Medical liaisons and drug information pharmacists saw similar evolutions in their roles and core responsibilities. Benchmarking study data on current practices and training are available for both fields.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512461442">5</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512461442">6</xref>
</sup> The drug information pharmacists benchmark survey demonstrated that job responsibilities have changed little and that only 40% of respondents received specialized drug information training, although respondents felt that their postgraduate training adequately prepared them for most drug information practice responsibilities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512461442">5</xref>
</sup> The medical liaison benchmark survey demonstrated that there are similarities in medical liaison positions across the industry in areas such as organizational structure, job responsibilities, and credentials.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512461442">6</xref>
</sup> Both surveys provided further insights for their respective fields as well as valuable data about current trends in practice.</p>
<p>The literature provides no recently published global benchmarking data on medical information specialists. However, a study conducted in 2011 surveyed the handling of verbal inquiries by medical information departments within the industry. The survey found that the majority of first-line call centers were staffed by pharmacists (with or without nurses).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512461442">7</xref>
</sup> However, the study’s main focuses were on departmental structure and demographics as related to verbal inquiries. A gap exists for global benchmarking data on medical information specialists across the pharmaceutical industry. As such, the purpose of this study was to benchmark the practices and training of medical information specialists in the pharmaceutical industry. Results collected will be used to identify the type of training and background of current medical information specialists and to describe medical information–related responsibilities.</p>

<sec id="section3-0092861512461442" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A convenience sample of participants was identified through the DIA database. People with a primary or secondary interest area of medical communications; those with job titles within medical information, medical communications, or medical science liaison; and any previous attendees of the DIA Annual Medical Communications Workshop, medical science liaison forums, or related webinars were invited to participate. As an incentive, all survey respondents were entered into a drawing for a complimentary registration for the DIA annual Medical Communications Workshop to be held in Orlando, Florida, in 2012.</p>
<p>Concurrently, survey items were constructed by investigators to benchmark current practices and training of medical information specialists in the pharmaceutical industry. A 23-item survey instrument was developed containing questions designed to identify the type of training and background of current medical information specialists and to describe their medical information–related responsibilities (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0092861512461442">appendix</xref>). On November 4, 2011, an electronic invitation containing a direct hyperlink to the electronic, anonymous, and voluntary survey instrument was sent to the identified DIA members. To encourage an adequate response rate, a reminder e-mail was sent on November 14, 2011. The survey was open for a total of 2 weeks and closed on November 18, 2011. An online software was used to design and distribute the survey electronically as well as maintain confidentiality of all responses. Data are presented descriptively.</p>

<title>Company and Respondent Demographics</title>
<p>A total of 61 complete and 29 incomplete responses were received. The first question asked respondents about their company size (defined by the number of employees) and type (pharmaceutical or biotech). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512461442">Figure 1</xref>, the respondents’ employers ranged in size and type across the industry. Respondents varied in terms of years working as a medical information specialist, with 34% (23/68) having less than 1 year of experience, 19% (13/68) having 2 to 4 years, 32% (22/68) having 5 to 10 years, and 15% (10/68) having more than 10 years.</p>

<sec id="section6-0092861512461442">
<title>Medical Information Organization</title>
<p>Establishment of a medical information specialist role varied across companies, with the majority of such roles (31% [27/87]) having been in existence for more than 15 years, 18% (16/87) for 10 to 15 years, 29% (25/87) for 5 to 10 years, and 22% (19/87) for fewer than 5 years. The total number of employed medical information specialists varied across companies as well. The large majority of companies (68% [53/87]) employ 49 or fewer specialists, followed by 14% (11/87) employing 50 to 99, 9% (7/87) employing more than 200, 5% (4/87) employing 100 to 149, and 4% (3/87) employing 150 to 200.</p>
<p>Alignment of medical information specialist teams was queried. About 25% (20/80) of respondents stated that their companies align medical information specialist teams therapeutically with 1 to 3 teams, and 24% (19/80) align therapeutically with 4 to 6 teams; 12.5% (10/80) of respondents stated that all medical information specialists covered all products regardless of therapeutic area or geography. In regard to geography, 9% (7/80) of respondents stated that their companies align geographically covering 1 to 3 regions, 6% (5/80) cover 7 or more regions, and 2% (2/80) cover 4 to 6 regions; 15% (12/80) of respondents selected “other.” The large majority (71% [51/72]) of medical information organizations reported to the medical affairs department, with only 4% (3/72) reporting to sales/marketing and 4% (3/72) reporting to regulatory departments. Finally, information was collected about the presence of a medical information specialist technical career growth ladder, and 66% (47/71) of respondents reported yes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0092861512461442">
<title>Medical Information Specialist: Training and Requirements</title>
<p>Participants were asked about their companies’ education and training requirements for the medical specialist role. The majority of respondents’ companies require medical information specialists to hold an advanced degree such as MD, PharmD, or PhD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092861512461442">Figure 2</xref>). However, the vast majority of respondents’ companies (84% [59/70]) do not require postgraduate training of their medical information specialists; 7% (5/70) require other postgraduate training (eg, MBA, PhD), 6% (4/70) require at least a residency or fellowship, 1% (1/80) require a pharmacy practice residency/fellowship, and 1% (1/80) accept a drug information residency/fellowship only. Respondents were asked about minimum required work experience. Most respondents’ companies require either 1 to 2 years of drug information experience (34% [24/70]) or 1 to 2 years of general work experience (31% [22/70]); 14% (10/70) require 3 to 5 years of general work experience. Only 1% [1/70] required 1 to 2 years of hospital experience.</p>

</fig>
<p>Respondents were queried about their education and training. The large majority of respondents (60% [42/70]) hold a PharmD, followed by 11% (8/70) with a BPharm and 9% (6/70) with a PhD. This agrees with the 64% (44/69) reporting that the majority of medical information specialists within their company possess a PharmD. The majority of respondents (34%[24/70]) reported that they did not complete any postgraduate training, 27% (19/70) did complete other postgraduate training (eg, MBA, PhD, MS), 21% (15/70) completed a drug information residency/fellowship, 10% (7/70) completed a specialized pharmacy practice residency/fellowship, and 7% (5/70) completed another residency/fellowship. Respondents were asked about their previous roles. The majority (20% [16/82]) had had another medical role within the company, 18% [15/82]) had been in non–drug information practice, 18% [15/82]) had been in a residency/fellowship, and 11% (9/82) had been in the medical information call center. Fewer than 10% had been in an academic or hospital drug information role or had been completing a degree.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0092861512461442">
<title>Medical Information Specialist: Job Responsibilities</title>
<p>The majority of respondents (68% [41/60]) reported receiving on average more than 10 medical information requests in a week; 15% (9/60) reported receiving 7 to 10, 3% (2/60) reported receiving 4 to 6, and 3% (2/60) reported receiving 1 to 3. Ten percent (6/60) of respondents reported that they did not handle medical information. On average in a quarter (3-month period), 34% (20/58) of medical information specialists are responsible for more than 20 medical letters, 31% (18/58) are responsible for fewer than 10, 26% (15/58) are responsible for 10 to 15, and 9% (5/58) are responsible for 15 to 20. Respondents were also asked about their responsibilities for each medical letter, results of which are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0092861512461442">Figure 3</xref>. Almost all respondents conduct literature searches and/or write or update medical letters as part of their medical letter responsibilities. The large majority of respondents (78% [47/60]) reported that their companies do not outsource writing and/or updating of medical letters, 12% (7/60) reported outsourcing fewer than 25% of medical letters, 7% (4/60) reportedoutsourcing 25% to 49% of medical letters, 2% (1/60) reported outsourcing 100% of medical letters, and 2% (1/60) reported outsourcing 50% to 74% of medical letters.</p>

<sec id="section9-0092861512461442">
<title>Challenges Facing Medical Information Divisions</title>
<p>Last, respondents were asked to enter free text regarding the biggest challenges currently faced by their medical information division. The most frequent answers regarded increased responsibilities (eg, larger portfolio, added promotional review roles) with fewer staff. Other answers included ensuring consistent content provision among team members, contending with globalization of medical information services, and piloting and implementing new technologies to improve current medical information services.</p>

<sec id="section10-0092861512461442">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A response rate could not be calculated for the survey as the invitation was mailed to a wider audience than initially desired; as such, it cannot be guaranteed that all invitees were medical information specialists. However, our demographic data indicate that we have an adequate representation of different-sized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Additionally, we were pleased with the varied sizes and ages of medical information divisions represented.</p>
<p>This survey will help medical information specialist teams to benchmark their current practices across the industry. In terms of organization, the majority of medical information specialist teams are aligned therapeutically, report to medical affairs departments, and possess a specialist technical career growth ladder. The majority of respondents’ companies require medical information specialists to hold an advanced degree but not necessarily specialized postgraduate training. Work experience requirements are more flexible, with the majority of companies asking for 1 to 2 years of general work experience, not necessarily in drug information. As such, the general minimum requirement appears to be an advanced degree (eg, MD, PhD, PharmD) with at least 1 to 2 years of general work experience. We asked respondents about their completed education and training as compared with company requirements. The large majority hold a PharmD degree, which agrees with the 64% reporting that the majority of medical information specialists within their company hold such a degree. However, completion of postgraduate training varied among respondents.</p>
<p>Respondents were asked about their expected and performed core responsibilities. The majority of respondents receive on average more than 10 medical information requests a week. However, the number of medical letters for which respondents are responsible in a quarter varied. When asked about medical letter responsibilities, almost all respondents reported conducting literature searches and updating or writing medical letters. The large majority of respondents reported that their company does not outsource medical letters. Finally, the majority of respondents reported attending 1 or 2 scientific meetings a year.</p>
<p>When interpreting the survey results, we must consider several limitations. As this was a voluntary and anonymous survey, we cannot verify whether an unbalanced number of respondents represented one company compared with others. This could potentially bias the results and limit the study’s external validity. Moreover, there exists a potential selection bias in our sample population, as only medical information specialists with DIA memberships were invited to participate. Medical information specialists outside of DIA were not sought, which may further decrease external validity. Finally, the responses received cannot be objectively validated as respondents had to rely on their own memory and knowledge regarding the questions at hand. Varied interpretations of survey questions are possible, because medical information practices and terms may vary from one company to another.</p>
<p>In contrast to the medical science liaison survey conducted by Marrone et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512461442">6</xref>
</sup> our survey points to an increasing trend of contracting out medical information services to external vendors such as contract research organizations (CROs) and medical communications agencies (MCAs). Medical information specialists from CROs and MCAs were included in the survey population, further limiting generalizability of our results to obtain a benchmark of only pharmaceutical and biotechnology medical information practices. For example, the large majority of respondents (78% [4/60]) reported that their company does not outsource medical letters. CROs and MCAs by function do not outsource their medical information responsibilities. As such, the figure 78% may actually be higher than the true percentage of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that do not outsource medical letters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0092861512461442">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Many similarities exist in medical information specialists’ positions regarding organization and reporting structure, job requirements and credentials, core responsibilities, and even challenges. Results from this survey will give the industry a better benchmark in regard to current medical information practices to further improve and better the service. In addition, common challenges such as understaffing have been identified. This survey only sought to obtain a general overview of medical information practices across the industry. Future research can further explore the service in particular areas of significance.</p>
