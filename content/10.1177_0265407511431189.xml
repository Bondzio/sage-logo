<abstract>
<p>The current study examined the causal relationship between secure and anxious attachment orientations and pain sensitivity in a pain-free sample. In a double blind repeated measures study, a cold pressor task was used to induce acute pain in 95 participants before and after priming them with a secure or anxious attachment orientation or a neutral prime. Measures of pain threshold, tolerance, catastrophizing and intensity were taken. Compared to the neutral prime, secure and anxious primes resulted in higher tolerance and threshold. The experimental conditions did not differ in reported pain intensity or pain catastrophizing. These findings suggest a causal relationship between attachment experiences and pain sensitivity that may be of interest to those devising and researching pain management interventions.</p>

<p>Attachment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407511431189">Bowlby, 1973</xref>) holds that the quality of interactions with primary carers becomes internalized over time in the form of dispositional attachment orientations which guide affect regulation in situations of threat to the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407511431189">Bowlby, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265407511431189">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987</xref>). Attachment orientations are conceptualized along two dimensions: <italic>anxiety regarding abandonment</italic> and <italic>avoidance of intimacy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407511431189">Brennan, Clark, &amp; Shaver, 1998</xref>). Secure individuals (low on both dimensions) are effective at regulating affect in response to threat. Avoidance is associated with orienting away from threat cues, while anxiety is associated with exaggerated appraisals of and hypervigilance towards threat cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407511431189">McWilliams &amp; Asmundson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407511431189">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Theoretical models link attachment orientations to the ontogenesis and maintenance of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407511431189">Anderson &amp; Hines, 1994</xref>). These models are based on the idea that individuals learn to regulate their emotional and cognitive responses to distress on the basis of reactions from primary attachment figures to their distress and physical pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407511431189">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003</xref>). A primary caregiver’s sensitivity and ability to calm and soothe when pain is experienced is thought to become internalized over repeated and consistent experiences and to determine the ease with which an individual can self-soothe when distressed, as well as to influence feelings of self-efficacy in the face of threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407511431189">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003</xref>). Sensitive, reassuring and comforting responses to an individual’s pain on the part of a primary attachment figure are most likely to result in optimal regulation of negative emotions when pain is experienced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407511431189">Mikail, Henderson and Tasca (1994)</xref>, on this basis, suggest that securely attached individuals should be less susceptible to the development of chronic pain relative to insecure individuals. Indeed, animal models of early life repeated maternal separation (EMS) support this contention by showing that EMS adult rats show higher levels of pain affect in response to inescapable pain stimulation compared to non-EMS adult rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265407511431189">Uhelski &amp; Fuchs, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent empirical investigations of the relationship between adult attachment orientation and physical pain sensitivity (to chronic and acute induced pain) appear to support the above theoretical predictions. Secure attachment has been associated with greater levels of control over pain and lower catastrophizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407511431189">Meredith, Strong, &amp; Fenney, 2006a</xref>), while attachment anxiety has been related to greater pain intensity in pain-free samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431189">MacDonald &amp; Kingsbury, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407511431189">McWilliams &amp; Asmundson, 2007</xref>), and to pain-related fear and catastrophizing in chronic pain sufferer samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407511431189">Ciechanowski, Sullivan, Jensen, Romano, &amp; Summers, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, attachment anxiety has been found to be positively associated with experiencing pain as highly threatening and distressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407511431189">Mikulincer &amp; Florian, 1998</xref>) while negatively associated with pain-related self-efficacy in chronic pain sufferers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407511431189">Meredith et al., 2006a</xref>).</p>
<p>Most studies of the link between pain and attachment orientation to date have been based on prospective or retrospective accounts of participants’ pain experiences. One study, however, examined reactions to induced pain using a cold pressor task in a pain-free sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407511431189">Meredith et al., 2006a</xref>) and found attachment anxiety was associated with reduced pain thresholds, lower perceptions of control over pain, lower ability to control pain, more stress, depression, and catastrophizing. A further relevant study conducted with pain-free participants, found that holding the hand of a romantic partner (or viewing a photograph of a romantic partner) led to lower levels of reported pain under thermal stimulation compared to holding the hand of a stranger or holding an object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407511431189">Master et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, studies of psychological pain indirectly support the role of attachment orientations in pain sensitivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407511431189">Cassidy, Shaver, Mikulincer and Lavy (2009)</xref> examined the effects of enhancing felt security by priming on psychological pain (hurt feelings) and found that security priming interacted with dispositional attachment orientations to influence participants’ reactions to a socially hurtful event. While participants with high dispositional attachment anxiety showed intense feelings of rejection, reported more crying and negative emotions when in the neutral priming condition, if primed with security these effects were attenuated. In summary, it would seem that the theory and empirical findings reviewed above jointly support the view that pain sensitivity and adult attachment are related in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Due to their correlational designs, none of the above studies of attachment orientation and physical pain directly examined the causal direction of this relationship. The aim of the current experiment, therefore, was to directly examine the causal relationship between attachment orientation and physical pain. Pain was induced using a cold pressor task before and after priming either attachment security, anxiety, or a control prime. Research has established that making attachment orientations temporarily cognitively accessible via priming methods (by writing about attachment experiences associated with a particular orientation for a few minutes, for example) temporarily influences emotions, thoughts, and behaviours in similar ways to dispositional attachment orientations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407511431189">Cassidy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407511431189">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265407511431189">Rowe &amp; Carnelley, 2003</xref>). In the present study the first cold pressor task assessed baseline pain sensitivity (pre-priming) to examine whether the correlations found in previous studies between attachment orientations and pain sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407511431189">Ciechanowski, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431189">MacDonald &amp; Kingsbury, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407511431189">McWilliams &amp; Asmundson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407511431189">Meredith et al., 2006a</xref>) could be replicated. The second cold pressor was used to assess the main and interactive effects of priming attachment orientations on changes in pain sensitivity between pre- and post-priming, allowing us to directly examine the causal nature of this relationship. We obtained measures of pain threshold, tolerance, intensity and catastrophizing.</p>
<p>On the basis of previous research on attachment orientation and pain sensitivity, the secure prime was expected to buffer participants against pain reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265407511431189">Meredith, Ownsworth, &amp; Strong, 2008</xref>), producing less catastrophizing, higher threshold and tolerance, and less perceived pain intensity than the neutral-primed group. Primed attachment anxiety, on the other hand, was expected to result in increased pain sensitivity, higher catastrophizing and intensity, and lower threshold and tolerance than the secure- and neutral-primed conditions.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>To obtain a large sample and increase the external validity of the study, participants were recruited from two UK universities. Undergraduates and postgraduates from one university (<italic>n</italic> = 43) participated in exchange for course credits or entry into a £10 prize draw, and undergraduates from the other university (<italic>n</italic> = 52) participated for entry into a £50 prize draw. Of the 95 participants (<italic>Mean</italic> age = 22.1, <italic>sd</italic> = 4.8), 58 were female, most were single (<italic>n</italic> = 94) and White (<italic>n</italic> = 87). Participants were pre-screened for exclusion criteria adapted from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431189">von Baeyer, Piira, Chambers, Trapanotto, &amp; Zeltzer, 2005</xref>). Those who indicated cardiovascular disorder, fainting/seizures, Reynaud’s phenomenon, frostbite, open cut or sore on non-dominant hand, arm fracture on non-dominant hand, regular use of analgesic or psychotropic drugs, and those in chronic pain (longer than three months) were excluded. Also, participants were excluded if they had clinically high levels of depression (<italic>n</italic> = 1) or anxiety (<italic>n</italic> = 11), defined as scoring 11 or higher on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0265407511431189">Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983</xref>). No meaningful differences in the key variables of interest were observed between the participants recruited through the two universities.<sup>

<p>The Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407511431189">Brennan et al., 1998</xref>) questionnaire assessed adult romantic attachment dimensions of anxiety (18 items, α = .92) and avoidance (18 items, α = .93). Participants rated on a seven-point scale ranging from “<italic>disagree strongly</italic>” (1) to “<italic>agree strongly</italic>” (7) their level of agreement with statements about their romantic relationship experiences in general, for example “I worry a lot about my relationships” (anxiety dimension) and “I find it difficult to allow myself to depend on my partner” (avoidance dimension).</p>

<p>Participants completed the pain Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407511431189">Rosentiel &amp; Keefe, 1983</xref>). The six-item catastrophizing subscale (α = .84) was used to assess the extent to which the respondents engaged in catastrophic thinking when experiencing pain, for example “I worry all the time about whether it will end”. Responses were on a seven-point scale ranging from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 6 (<italic>all the time</italic>).</p>

<sec id="section7-0265407511431189">
<title>Anxiety and depression</title>
<p>Anxiety and depression were measured with the HADS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0265407511431189">Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983</xref>), which is a 14-item measure of the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms in the past week frequently used in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265407511431189">Crawford, Henry, Crombie, &amp; Taylor, 2001</xref>) and clinical populations. This was used to screen out clinical levels of depression or anxiety. The anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) subscales (seven items each, anxiety α = .56; depression α = .55) were rated on a four-point scale from 0 to 3. The alphas for the anxiety and depression subscales were relatively low compared to most studies that regularly report alphas of .80 and .76 (respectively) in the general and clinical populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407511431189">Mykletun, Stordal, &amp; Dahl, 2001</xref>). Participants choose between four responses for each; for example, an anxiety item is: “I get sudden feelings of panic” with response choices of “very often indeed”, “quite often”, “not very often” and “not at all”. High scores indicate high anxiety or depression. The anxiety and depression subscales have a maximum possible score of 21. Scores between 0 and 7 are typically in the normal range, 8 to 10 are in the borderline range, and scores of 11 or higher indicate probable presence of a mood disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407511431189">Snaith, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Attachment and control primes</title>
<p>The attachment security and anxiety primes were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407511431189">Bartz and Lydon (2004)</xref>. The secure prime instructed participants to visualise and write for 10 minutes about a close relationship where they felt as though it was “relatively easy to get close to the other person” and in which they “didn’t often worry about being abandoned by the other person”. The anxiety prime instructed participants to visualise and write about a relationship in which “you have felt like the other person was reluctant to get as close as you would have liked” and “you worried that they wouldn’t want to stay with you”. The neutral (control) prime instructed participants to write about a recent trip to a supermarket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407511431189">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2001</xref>).</p>

This was an eight-item questionnaire measuring two dimensions: valence (positivity vs. negativity) and emotionality (i.e., emotional anxiety: anxious/relaxed; warmth: warm/cold; and emotionality: emotional/numb). Items across valence dimensions were collapsed into: positive (α = .85) and negative affect (α = .84). Example items included “To what extent do you feel positive or good after the visualisation task?” and “To what extent do you feel relaxed after the visualisation task?” Responses were given on a 10 cm VAS anchored “<italic>not at all</italic>” and “<italic>extremely</italic>”.</p>

<title>The cold pressor task</title>
<p>To ensure that hand temperatures were all equivalent prior to submersion in the cold pressor, a warm water bath was used. This was important in maintaining between-participant and also within-participant (between baseline and experimental cold pressor) consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407511431189">Mitchell, MacDonald, &amp; Brodie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431189">von Baeyer et al., 2005</xref>). Baths at Bristol and Southampton maintained a temperature of 32 degrees Celsius. Bristol researchers used a model “ZD” water bath manufactured by Grant which they switched off during hand immersion for safety reasons. Southampton researchers used a large bowl of water maintained at 32 degrees Celsius, insulated with aluminum foil and covered with cling-film to retain heat. An electronic thermometer was used to measure the temperature and ensure it remained constant. Fluctuations of up to 1.5°C in either direction were accepted as fluctuations under 2°C in the cold pressor task produce no significant differences in pain performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407511431189">Mitchell et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The cold pressor tasks at both sites were functionally equivalent and kept the water to the same temperature; however, they were structurally slightly different. Researchers at Bristol used a large water bath manufactured by BTL, with an attached Techne heater and water circulator (model: FTE 10AD). Due to the large size of the bath and the volume of water that required cooling, a Grant Immersion cooler (model: C1G) was also used to provide extra cooling power. For safety reasons the Techne heater and circulator were switched off during periods of hand immersion, which meant that a wooden ladle had to be used to stir the water every few minutes. Keeping the water circulating is important as this prevents it from forming a warm “cushion” around the participant’s hand that might decrease the effectiveness of the pain elicitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407511431189">Mitchell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431189">von Baeyer et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The cold pressor at Southampton was a custom-made machine (VTCR 620) containing a thermostat-controlled electric pump – this allowed the water to be maintained at more or less a constant water temperature of 2°C (temperature varied between 1.9°C and 2.1°C). The water was circulated around the participant’s hand to prevent the water from warming. The compartment was 10 cm deep allowing the participant to fit both their hand and wrist into the cold water.</p>

A video recording of all Time 2 procedures was made by the Southampton University experimenters as a training aid for the experimenters at both locations to ensure that all experimenters followed the exact same procedure. The study employed a double blind design. Upon arrival participants washed their hands and wrists with soap. Next they placed their non-dominant hand into the warm water bath up to the wrist for five minutes. During this period they completed the HADS and were given standardized verbal instructions for the cold pressor task. Participants were instructed to loudly say “now” when they first started to feel pain (the measure of pain threshold), and also to say “now” at the point when they wanted to take their hand out (the measure of pain tolerance).</p>
<p>Next, participants were asked to sit next to the cold pressor and to put their hand into the water. There was a three minute ceiling for immersion that the participants were not informed of, at which point they were asked to take their hands out. After removal of the hand, either due to reaching the ceiling or being too uncomfortable to leave it in any longer, participants reported the overall pain intensity experienced throughout the task using a visual analogue scale. During the cold pressor task the experimenters stood behind the participants and did not communicate verbally with them. Experimenters used a stopwatch to record the timings for threshold and tolerance.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Following this first cold pressor task, the participants were moved back to their original position and given the envelope containing their prime and a sheet of paper to write on. They were told to read the instructions inside the envelope and to keep writing for ten minutes about the scenario presented. To encourage participants to be uninhibited in what they wrote they were told it would not be read by anyone and that they could take it with them.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265407511431189">3</xref>
</sup> During the priming task participants immersed their non-dominant hand in the warm water bath for 5–10 minutes to return their hand to the baseline temperature. Once the 10-minute priming procedure was finished they were told to stop writing and remove their hand from the warm water bath. They were then given the felt security scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407511431189">Luke et al., in press</xref>) and the mood measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265407511431189">Rowe &amp; Carnelley, 2003</xref>) to complete (in counterbalanced order). The cold pressor task was then repeated and times for threshold and tolerance were measured. After the cold pressor task, participants reported overall pain intensity and post-prime pain catastrophizing. An alternative catastrophizing scale (PCS) was used to the one used at Time 1 (CSQ) to avoid participants attempting to reproduce their original responses. The participants then placed their non-dominant hand back into the warm water. Finally, they were given the “five best things” task to complete and were thanked and debriefed.</p>

<title>Analysis strategy and preliminary results</title>
<p>Initially, we examined the distribution of variables and searched for outliers. Six threshold outliers (three baseline and three experimental) were identified; threshold variables were log transformed. Transformation dealt with these outliers and improved the distribution. Threshold outliers were defined as three standard deviations above or below the mean.</p>
<p>The control variables (i.e., Time 1 assessed variables: HADS depression, HADS anxiety, attachment anxiety and avoidance) were then examined to determine whether they differed by prime. When prime groups differed on control variables those control variables were included as covariates in analyses. Specifically, there were prime group differences in Time 1 attachment anxiety (<italic>Means</italic>: Secure = 3.38, Neutral = 3.06, Anxiety = 3.71; <italic>F</italic>(2,90) = 3.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; posthocs showed that the neutral group differed from the anxiety group at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and HADS depression (<italic>Means</italic>: Secure = 3.31, Neutral = 2.03, Anxiety = 2.36; <italic>F</italic>(2,92) = 3.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; posthocs showed that secure and neutral prime groups differed at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and secure and anxiety prime groups were marginally different, <italic>p</italic> = .064).</p>
<p>Also, Time 1 control variables correlated with some of the dependent variables (DVs); and were thus used as covariates in analyses. Specifically, post-prime pain intensity was correlated with Time 1 catastrophizing (<italic>r</italic> = .27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and HADS anxiety (<italic>r</italic> = .26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and marginally correlated with T1 attachment anxiety (<italic>r</italic> = .18, <italic>p</italic> = .09); and post-prime catastrophizing was correlated with T1 attachment anxiety (<italic>r</italic> = .28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Time 1 catastrophizing (<italic>r</italic> = .35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), HADS depression (<italic>r</italic> = .26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and HADS anxiety (<italic>r</italic> = .22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>Finally, there were some gender differences. Men were more tolerant of pain than women during the baseline (<italic>Means</italic>: <italic>M =</italic> 136.98, <italic>W =</italic> 79.42, <italic>F</italic>(1,93) = 23.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and experimental (<italic>Means</italic>: <italic>M =</italic> 134.68, <italic>W =</italic> 79.01, <italic>F</italic>(1,93) = 21.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) cold pressor tasks. Men catastrophized after the experimental (<italic>Means</italic>: <italic>M =</italic> 1.05, <italic>W =</italic> 1.40, <italic>F</italic>(1,92) = 3.79, <italic>p</italic> = .055) and the baseline (<italic>Means</italic>: <italic>M =</italic> 1.36; <italic>W =</italic> 2.04, <italic>F</italic>(1,92) = 8.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) cold pressor less than did women. These gender effects were controlled for in analyses for tolerance, intensity and catastrophizing.</p>

<title>Baseline pain variables</title>
<p>We examined whether we could replicate past research that shows that dispositional attachment patterns (i.e., attachment anxiety and avoidance) influence responses to the baseline cold pressor and catastrophizing variables (see standardized betas, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>p</italic> values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0265407511431189">Table 1</xref>
). Hierarchical regressions were conducted with any relevant control variables entered at Step 1, attachment anxiety and avoidance entered at Step 2, and the anxiety by avoidance interaction entered at Step 3. Results showed that Time 1 attachment anxiety significantly predicted Time 1 catastrophizing (<italic>F</italic> of Change at Step 2(2,87) = 9.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>R<sup>2</sup>
</italic> Change = .14). Those high in attachment anxiety reported higher Time 1 pain catastrophizing. In addition, a significant interaction was found between anxiety and avoidance in the prediction of Time 1 catastrophizing (<italic>F</italic> of Change at Step 3(1,86) = 8.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>R<sup>2</sup>

Results showed that secure-primed participants reported higher levels of felt security than did attachment-anxious-primed participants, who reported higher levels of felt security than did neutral-primed participants. Furthermore, it was found that secure-primed and neutral-primed participants reported less negative mood than anxious-primed participants. Secure-primed participants reported higher positive mood than neutral-primed or anxious-primed participants. And neutral-primed participants reported more numbness than did anxious-primed participants, who report more numbness than did secure-primed participants. The above suggests that the priming manipulations were successful.</p>

<p>We found that prime significantly affected threshold and tolerance, but not intensity and catastrophizing. Specifically, participants in the secure prime condition and anxious attachment prime condition showed higher threshold than those in the neutral prime condition; secure-primed and anxious-primed groups did not differ from each other. Furthermore, participants in the secure prime condition and anxious attachment prime condition showed higher tolerance than those in the neutral prime condition; secure-primed and anxious-primed groups did not differ.</p>
<p>Finally, Time 1 dispositional attachment anxiety and avoidance were examined to see if they moderated the effect of the prime on the DVs and it was found that they did not. Due to insufficient power no higher-order interaction variables were examined.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Herein we examined the impact of attachment security and anxiety on pain responses. Our aim was to identify a pathway by which attachment orientations might influence pain regulation. Our sample was one composed of pain-free young adults, a group known to have varied attachment experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407511431189">Bartholomew &amp; Horowitz, 1991</xref>). Our results showed that priming both attachment security and anxiety lead to higher pain tolerance and threshold (that is, lower pain sensitivity), relative to a neutral prime group (control), and that pain intensity and catastrophizing were not influenced by the primes.</p>
<p>Our main finding was that participants in the secure attachment prime condition showed higher pain thresholds and tolerance relative to the neutral prime condition, suggesting that the secure prime acted as a buffer against the experience of pain. This finding supports theoretical perspectives on attachment security and pain that argue that consistently sensitive, reassuring and comforting responses to an individual’s pain on the part of a primary attachment figure in early life result in the optimal regulation of emotions when pain is experienced later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407511431189">Anderson &amp; Hines, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407511431189">Mikail et al., 1994</xref>). Our finding also supports non-human animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265407511431189">Uhelski &amp; Fuchs, 2010</xref>) and human research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407511431189">Meredith et al., 2006a</xref>) examining the relationship between attachment experiences and responses to distress and pain, and extends current research by establishing the causal direction of the relationship between attachment security and pain sensitivity (to date most studies of this relationship have been correlational).</p>
<p>Unanticipated, however, was the finding that participants primed with attachment security did not differ from those primed with attachment anxiety in their pain thresholds and tolerance in the cold pressor task. Indeed, on the basis of previous research that examines the pain reactions of individuals high in attachment anxiety, we predicted that priming attachment anxiety would result in higher pain sensitivity, (that is, lower pain thresholds and tolerance and higher catastrophizing and reports of pain intensity) relative to the secure- and neutral-primed groups. One possible explanation for this unexpected finding (that both attachment secure and anxious primes resulted in lower pain sensitivity) is that both primes activated positive thoughts and feelings about others in close relationships. Priming a secure attachment orientation should activate cognitions relating to others as caring and supportive and of the self as having the emotional resources to cope with adversity. Priming an anxious attachment orientation should activate ambiguous thoughts and feelings about the availability and support of close others, that is, both positive and negative cognitions and emotions regarding support and care. Indeed, in a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407511431189">Mukulincer, Shaver, Bar-On and Ein-Dor (2010)</xref> reported explicit and implicit evidence that high attachment anxious individuals showed attitudinal ambivalence towards romantic partners and motivational ambivalence towards goals relating to interpersonal closeness and distance (mainly in negative relationship contexts). In addition, given that participants were asked to think about attachment relationships in the prime task and that even insecure attachment relationships fulfil some attachment needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407511431189">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2006</xref>), it could be that both primes induced lower pain sensitivity due to the pain inoculating effect of having activated representations of positive relationship experiences regarding care in times of distress. The above rationale is speculative, however, and it should be noted that the secure-primed group reported significantly higher levels of felt security than the anxious-primed group.</p>
<p>An alternative explanation for our unexpected findings is also worthy of consideration. Empirical examinations of Social Pain Theory (SPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407511431189">MacDonald &amp; Leary, 2005</xref>) suggest that high rejection sensitivity – a central characteristic of attachment anxiety (indeed the anxious dimension <italic>is</italic> “anxiety regarding abandonment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407511431189">Brennan et al., 1998</xref>) – is associated with pain analgesia. Pain analgesia is <italic>reduced</italic> pain sensitivity, commonly observed in other species when exposed to periods of social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431189">Naranjo &amp; Fuentes, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265407511431189">Sufka &amp; Weed, 1994</xref>), and a potentially adaptive response to pain. Social Pain Theory proposes that the attachment system co-opted extant pain mechanisms at some point in evolutionary history with the result that pain affect – the unpleasant subjective experience associated with pain sensation – and social rejection stimulate a common threat response system. In support of SPT, human infants’ social isolation and physical pain co-vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407511431189">MacDonald &amp; Leary, 2005</xref>) and in adulthood there is a strong link between attachment and the sense of physical safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407511431189">Mikulincer &amp; Florian, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, responses to physical and social pain affect share neuroendocrine and neurological systems including the opioid and oxytocin neuroendocrine systems, and the periaqueductal gray and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) brain areas (MacDonald &amp; Leary, 2006). Indeed, functional MRI studies have shown the ACC to be involved both in pain affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407511431189">Peyron, Laurent, &amp; Garcia-Larrea, 2000</xref>) and social pain following exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407511431189">Eisenberger, Lieberman, &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>). Taken together these findings suggest that SPT may be a useful model by which to examine pain sensitivity as a function of attachment orientation.</p>
<p>Links between social rejection (and fear of social rejection), in hurt-prone individuals and the experience of pain analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265407511431189">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407511431189">MacDonald, Kingsbury, &amp; Shaw, 2005</xref>) have been established. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265407511431189">DeWall and Baumeister (2006)</xref>, social rejection activates the pain response system and changes how the body registers pain. Results across a number of experiments conducted by these and other authors suggest that exclusion may produce a biochemical reaction that leads to temporary numbness to physical pain which is linked to emotional responding and demonstrated in emotional insensitivity. It is possible, therefore, that priming anxious attachment activated social rejection concerns leading to pain analgesia. Indeed, in the current study the anxious-primed group reported higher levels of post-prime emotional numbness than the secure-primed group, suggesting that the anxious prime produced a level of emotional analgesia before the second cold pressor. It is perhaps not surprising that the anxious-primed group reported lower levels of emotional numbness than the neutral-primed group, because relationship primes contain emotional content but our neutral prime (by definition) did not. Further support for the possible analgesic effects of the anxiety prime relates to the post-prime mood data. If both the anxious- and secure-primed groups were experiencing a pain buffering effect due to the activation of positive attachment cognitions (which is what we consider is happening for the secure-primed group), they should have reported equally positive moods after priming. The secure-primed group, however, reported higher levels of positive affect than the anxious- and neutral-primed groups, as well as higher felt security than the anxious group.</p>
<p>Future research might attempt to distinguish between the effects of secure and anxious attachment primes on pain sensitivity by measuring emotional numbness using multi-item measures (as opposed to the single-item measure used herein) and additional assessments. On the basis of a recent study, for example, which showed that recalling episodes of social exclusion led to greater feelings of coldness (room temperature) than recollections of social inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0265407511431189">Zhong &amp; Leonardelli, 2008</xref>), it might be fruitful to explore the possibility that an attachment anxiety prime (but not an attachment security prime) might lead to greater perceptions of coldness relative to a security prime group.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that we did not prime social exclusion directly, but rather attachment anxiety, and so cannot be conclusive in our argument regarding the possibility that the anxious prime may have induced pain analgesia. Importantly also, the view that social rejection may lead to pain analgesia is somewhat controversial (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407511431189">Baumeister, DeWall &amp; Vohs, 2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407511431189">Gerber &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref> for a full discussion of the controversy) and research suggests that the effects of rejection differ by the type of rejection manipulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407511431189">Blackhart et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the anxious prime group differed from the other prime groups in baseline dispositional attachment anxiety (they reported higher baseline anxiety), suggesting that our random assignment was not successful. Importantly though, we dealt with this issue by controlling for baseline attachment anxiety in analyses. Furthermore, it could be argued that our anxious prime was not fully successful on the basis that it increased felt security relative to the neutral prime (while also increasing negative affect relative to the control prime).We have argued herein, however, that our manipulation check results (felt security and mood) are interpretable within a theoretical framework as an anxious attachment representation is by definition composed of positive (secure) as well as negative elements, all of which should have been activated by the prime. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265407511431189">Carnelley and Rowe (2010)</xref> examined the effects of priming different attachment styles across three studies using similar (and the same) writing priming techniques and showed that secure- and anxious-primed groups did not differ in the number of positive care words produced in their written protocols (but did differ in their production of negative care words). These findings provide evidence for the ambivalent nature of the anxious attachment orientation and are consistent with our findings.</p>
<p>Baseline data in the current study also suggest a link between attachment anxiety and pain analgesia, although not necessarily in the expected direction on the basis of correlational findings from past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407511431189">Ciechanowski, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431189">MacDonald &amp; Kingsbury, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407511431189">McWilliams &amp; Asmundson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407511431189">Meredith et al., 2006a</xref>). That is, a preoccupied style (high anxiety and low avoidance) predicted higher tolerance at baseline. Importantly, the current research clarifies the role of attachment anxiety in pain sensitivity as it examined how dispositional attachment avoidance moderated the effects of attachment anxiety on pain reactions at baseline. Most previous research has either failed to examine the interactions between attachment avoidance and anxiety dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431189">MacDonald &amp; Kingsbury, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407511431189">McWilliams et al., 2000</xref>), or examined the four attachment orientations but with four-item forced-choice measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407511431189">Meredith et al., 2006a</xref>), although one study used a multi-item measure (with items rated on Likert scales; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407511431189">Ciechanowski et al., 2003</xref>). Herein we used the ECR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407511431189">Brennan et al., 1998</xref>) – a reliable multi-item measure.</p>
<p>There is a difference between how attachment anxiety affects preconceptions of the experience of pain versus pain behaviour (tolerance), which is partially contingent on its combination with avoidance. Fearful attachment style (high attachment anxiety and avoidance) positively predicted pain catastrophizing at baseline in the current study, supporting previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407511431189">Meredith et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407511431189">Ciechanowski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407511431189">McWilliams et al., 2000</xref>). Fearful avoidance also predicted higher pain intensity, supporting some research findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431189">MacDonald &amp; Kingsbury, 2006</xref>) but not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407511431189">Ciechanowski et al., 2003</xref>). So, it appears that high dispositional attachment anxiety (in combination with high avoidance) is related to negative expectations for pain coping, suggesting that the high anxious individual does not expect the analgesic effect of pain they experience. Given, however, that our baseline anxiety and pain sensitivity findings in the first cold pressor task were not consistent with previous correlational study results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407511431189">Ciechanowski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431189">MacDonald &amp; Kingsbury, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407511431189">McWilliams &amp; Asmundson, 2007</xref>), replication of our findings is necessary before firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the relationship between attachment anxiety and pain sensitivity.</p>
<p>Although there were sound theoretical reasons not to prime participants with an avoidant attachment orientation (e.g., most pain sensitivity and attachment-related findings reported concern attachment anxiety), it would be interesting to observe the causal relationship between preoccupied, fearful-avoidant and dismissing-avoidant styles in preconceptions of pain and sensitivity to acute pain experiences. Priming avoidance and avoidance in combination with anxiety may produce effects that mirror our baseline catastrophizing and intensity findings. This is an avenue for future research.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although attachment anxiety has been associated with poor pain coping and sensitivity in a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407511431189">Ciechanowski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407511431189">MacDonald &amp; Kingsbury, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407511431189">McWilliams &amp; Asmundson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407511431189">McWilliams, Cox, &amp; Enns, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265407511431189">Meredith, Strong, &amp; Feeney, 2006b</xref>), to date none has explored the causal direction of this relationship. The present experiment examined the influence of both attachment security and anxiety on pain sensitivity in a cold pressor task. Priming both attachment security and anxiety resulted in higher pain threshold and tolerance, relative to controls. These findings extend previous research and point to the importance of early attachment experiences for pain management. Our findings have important implications for the development of pain management programs for chronic pain sufferers and suggest these should consider psychosocial factors, such as attachment orientation (dispositional as well as within current close relationships), that impact on the experience of pain and potentially on treatment outcomes.</p>

<p>The differences in remuneration between the universities reflected different student research support provisions at the two institutions (that is, course credits could only be offered at one university so to maximize successful participant recruitment a higher monetary incentive was offered at the other). We conducted a MANOVA to compare the performance of the two universities on important variables (attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, felt security, negative mood, positive mood, numbness, HADS anxiety, HADS depression, experimental and baseline pain tolerance, threshold, catastrophizing and intensity).The universities did not differ significantly on any of the variables. The universities differed marginally only on HADS depression scores (first university <italic>M =</italic> 2.93; <italic>SD</italic> = 2.04; second university <italic>M =</italic> 2.1, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.86; <italic>F</italic>(1,84) = 3.66, <italic>p</italic> = .06).

<p>Two of the experimenters (based at one of the universities) were male. To explore the possibility that experimenter sex might have interacted with sex of participant in influencing DVs, we conducted a MANOVA with sex of experimenter and sex of participant as the factors and important variables (attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, felt security, negative mood, positive mood, numbness, HADS anxiety, HADS depression, experimental and baseline pain tolerance, threshold, catastrophizing and intensity) as the DVs. This analysis was conducted exclusively on data collected by the experimenters from the university to which the male experimenters were affiliated. Results showed no main effect of experimenter sex (<italic>F</italic>(2,56) = .80, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) or experimenter sex by participant’s sex interaction (<italic>F</italic>(2, 56) = .23, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>

<p>Although the experimenters were not able to see the content of participants’ writings, they encouraged participants to continue to write for the full 10 minutes if they happened to stop before the 10 minutes was up. Once the priming task was complete, the experimenters discreetly checked that there was writing on the pages given to participants for the task.</p>

<p>We conducted a series of hierarchical regression analyses to examine whether gender or dispositional (Time 1) attachment anxiety or avoidance moderated the effects of prime on pain reactions. Overall, we found that gender did not significantly interact with any of the other variables to significantly add to the prediction of pain reactions. Furthermore, we found that Time 1 attachment anxiety and avoidance did not significantly interact with prime to significantly add to the prediction of pain reactions.</p>
