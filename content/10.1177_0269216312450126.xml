    <p>The Palliative Care Formulary (PCF) has long been a valuable text in the library of
      Palliative Medicine physicians, nurses and pharmacists. It is written in such a comprehensive
      way that others involved in the care of patients with progressive life-limiting conditions
      would also find it a practical guide and information source. As a recent candidate for the
      specialty certificate examination, I regarded the PCF3 as an essential core text and was keen
      to read the differences in the new, noticeably thicker PCF4 when it became available.</p>
    <p>The first part of the PCF4 outlines the pharmacology and practical uses of drugs used by
      prescribers in palliative care. The pharmacology section for each monograph is brief,
      containing relevant and useful details in a highly readable form that is not overwhelming.
      Indications, doses and likelihood of side-effects follow. Evidence for statements is
      referenced at the end of each monograph, which is useful for further reading. New monographs
      include pages explaining evidence, pharmacology and guidance for use of the trans-mucosal
      fentanyl preparations.</p>
    <p>The second part is dedicated to more general advice, providing a wealth of additional
      practical advice, aside from the drug monographs. Sections that advise on driving regulations
      and taking controlled drugs out of the country are very useful, as are the new practical
      sections explaining how to set up commonly used syringe pumps in the community, with advice
      regarding pre-emptive prescribing. This could be particularly helpful for practitioners
      setting up syringe pumps infrequently in the community without ready access to pump manuals
      and compatibility information, the PCF4 providing a very useful summary. Part two also
      includes more detailed information regarding drugs that prolong the QT interval and affect the
      cytochrome P450 system, both of which are important yet I always forget, so a helpful
      reference!</p>
    <p>One great addition is the excellent section on care for the imminently dying. After a
      discussion of general principles and common symptoms, there follows separate advice for
      clinicians caring for patients with end stage renal disease, heart failure and Parkinson’s
      disease. These conditions are often ones with which we struggle in the terminal phase and tips
      on how to best approach these really help the clinician managing these patients when focus is
      on symptom control and when tablet burden is often problematic.</p>
    <p>In summary, this new, larger PCF4, much like its predecessors is an excellent reference and
      guide to all caring for patients towards the end of life.</p>
