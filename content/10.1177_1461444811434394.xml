<p>In a world inundated by the pre-packaged and pre-processed, people are discovering the benefits of creating things themselves. Yet, making something is rarely a solitary activity; people tend to share their work with others. The results may not satisfy elitists’ definitions of high art. Such artifacts may not even be pretty. Yet both of these books argue that individual experimentation is necessary for the development of human creativity, sociality, and political presence. Although they spring from different theoretical trajectories, both books emphasize the importance of participating in do-it-yourself (DIY) environments. Attending more explicitly to philosophies of creativity, Gauntlett discusses a broad range of activities that include non-high-tech craft projects as well as DIY culture online. Strangelove focuses on YouTube and the everyday video-making and sharing practices that are giving rise to a ‘democratization of the lens’ (p. 178) amid a ‘post-television audience’ (pp. 158–180) that craves less commercial fare. By creating their own artifacts, people lead a joyful and empowered existence, and may improve a society’s quality of life.</p>
<p>DIY works are often criticized and relegated to the status of trivialized entertainment, yet the authors believe that it is precisely through such personalized efforts that political change is possible. When individual voices are silenced, society becomes ‘sick and degraded’ (Gauntlett, p. 34). DIY activities and crafting connect people to the physical materials required to make something as well as to other people who share similar interests. More importantly, these hands-on experiences attune people to their own power, to the consequences of their decisions, and to their impact on the world. Not only do people gain psychological satisfaction by making something, they also gain a broader perspective on what it means to live in a capitalist society that emphasizes mass-produced culture, throw-away lifestyles, and unsustainable environmental trajectories.</p>
<p>Creativity and self-expression are part of a ‘process’ that is ultimately more meaningful than any single end-product that emerges from ‘doing it yourself.’ Gauntlett argues that to label works as creative only when so ordained by specialists ignores the private ways in which people experiment to break new ground. Such quiet innovation brings not merely ephemeral pleasure, but a profound sense of joy that has social ramifications. For Strangelove, making videos is a process that not only involves making and posting a video, but also invites direct interaction through written comments and video responses, as well as intertextual ‘appropriations and parodies’ (p. 47).</p>
<p>Neither author paints a carefree portrait of DIY culture or public video-sharing. A very real concern exists that entrenched, traditional media companies and commercialized online-exchange platforms will complicate individual self-expression. Formulaic video-exchange sites, dubious claims over copyright violation, and pressures to commercialize all threaten opportunities for diverse voices to have a fair and open platform to circulate their messages. When individual self-expression is publicly stifled, making any kind of personal media – including those that operate even partially outside of institutionalized media control – becomes a politicized act.</p>
<p>By frankly discussing problems, both authors resist being dismissed as techno- utopians by pundits who would willfully ignore their important social message. For example, Gauntlett is concerned about the often-ignored and poorly understood effects of pre-fab digital templates that sites such as YouTube and Facebook use to channel participation. These automated guides may ultimately yield bland, ‘template identities’ (p. 194) that fulfill corporate agendas. Gauntlett’s argument is <italic>sympatico</italic> with Strangelove’s message, which is that amateur or everyday works may reject the ‘formulaic narrative moulds’ (p. 128) shaped by large-scale entertainment and media institutions. Participatory templates are partially designed to sanitize content toward commercialized uses that include advertising. Yet such formulaic manipulation of human behavior and online identity threatens to neutralize the ‘expressive messiness’ (Gauntlett, p. 225) of DIY engagement that both authors believe is vital for encouraging creativity. Despite YouTube’s efforts to be a ‘village cop’ (p. 106), Strangelove points out that removing violent, unethical, or objectionable material is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Strangelove rightly criticizes media corporations’ aggressive pursuit of copyright violations of people such as mothers who put up videos of their small children singing popular songs. Strangelove joins a growing chorus of protest that argues strongly against corporatized chilling effects that result from ignoring fair use and seeking damages from individuals who do not realistically impinge on income from professional creative works. Although not new, this message bears repeating, as complacency in these matters could further complicate vernacular self-expression. Pundits who dismiss everyday videos because of their uneven execution are essentially colluding with entities that are unconcerned with safeguarding human self-expression and diversity.</p>
<p>Of the two books, <italic>Making is Connecting</italic> more explicitly engages in the philosophical construct of creativity, and why it is politically important. Gauntlett begins by analyzing the philosophies of prior scholars of creativity and subsequently illustrates his points by using a broad range of examples of vernacular crafting, both on- and offline. One reason to protect creativity is that it leads to what Ivan Illich called a ‘convivial society,’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444811434394">1973</xref>) or one that enables its citizens to communicate with others directly, rather than being filtered through institutions. It is only through interpersonal engagement that it is possible to shape the external world.</p>
<p>Gauntlett situates his argument by calling on several important philosophers of societal change. These include John Ruskin, who was concerned with how Victorian-era industrialism might threaten humanity’s beautiful imperfections by separating intellectual from physical work. Gauntlett also describes the philosophies of William Morris, who mastered a variety of crafts such as book printing. Morris is a key figure because of his deep belief that society as a whole benefited from producing a populace with individuals who could experience profound joy by working with fine materials and eschewing false desires that ignored nature and creativity. Rather than invoke scorn for a populace who must make do within a capitalist system, these intellectual figures generally offer a sense of hope and spirit of kindness towards common folk. Including this philosophical groundwork is a wise move as it provides a solid foundation for Gauntlett’s claims about the importance of creativity.</p>
<p>That Gauntlett also invokes the philosophies of Ivan Illich is not surprising as he was an important figure who inspired early computer enthusiasts who sought to broaden access to self-expression, connected sociality, and advanced computer power. Gauntlett connects craft-inspired philosophies to aspirations for new media and so-called Web 2.0 and DIY environments. He argues that the ‘messiness’ of YouTube, for example, is not only interesting in its own right, but is also ‘liberating’ (p. 85) in that it encourages others to develop a voice and avoid being too intimidated to make their own media. What pundits often forget when they criticize vernacular media is that developing literacies means having to begin somewhere, and many individuals (even professionals) have aspirations to improve.</p>
<p><italic>Making is Connecting</italic> includes examples from diverse realms such as knitting circles, ‘craftivism,’ and YouTube videos to argue that creativity is a process and feeling that reflects personal innovation and self-actualization. ‘Craftivism’ (p. 56) was a term coined to combine the concepts of ‘craft’ and ‘activism’ and it refers to the idea that people are making a political choice when they make rather than buy mass-produced goods. This movement is but one manifestation of a larger philosophy that is reflected in a heterogeneous array of everyday creative and political practices.</p>
<p>Gauntlett observes that doing something personal invites engagement with the self, such that artifacts are imbued with the ‘presence’ (p. 81) of the creator. This point, which has also appeared in anthropological writings on reciprocity and material culture, is extremely important. Videos and other artifacts include traces of their creators’ personality, desires, and aspirations. The ‘presence’ of a creator in media continues to influence the creative and social processes of others who later experience these artifacts in their own way.</p>
<p><italic>Watching YouTube</italic> also deeply respects vernacular efforts. Strangelove’s book includes a series of case studies of English-language videos drawn from selected genres on YouTube. To quibble over why he picked certain genres over others misses a point previously made in prior YouTube studies, which is that no work can ever ‘represent’ YouTube, given that it serves up more than 1 billion views per day (Gauntlett, p. 83). Indeed, Strangelove’s selections, which focus on the family, video diaries, women, community, and antagonism are logical and familiar choices when discussing what happens on the ’Tube. These orienting genres may change in the future, but providing current case studies provides important points of comparison for future studies of YouTube and other video-sharing and social-networking sites.</p>
<p>A major difference between home movies of prior eras and YouTube videos is that the latter now appear before large public audiences who may interpret the media in various ways. Strangelove makes the point that the images are simultaneously familiar and yet particular to the video creators who made and shared them. They provide a record for how people live and they showcase the things that people thought important to broadcast globally in the early years of video’s widespread online arrival. Videos on YouTube often exhibit many dimensions of the human experience, and not all of them are idealistic or even palatable. On the one hand, individuals use YouTube to make connections with family and friends, or to work through aspects of the self. Other videos show people being humiliated, stumbling through inebriated states, using the restroom, or aggressively accusing and confronting each other. Strangelove argues that these negative trends hardly emerged from vernacular video. Rather, they echo themes of traditional media in which confrontational patterns appear in so-called reality shows and in talk shows such as the <italic>Oprah Winfrey Show</italic> and the <italic>Jerry Springer Show</italic> (p. 51).</p>
<p>YouTube’s intense popularity is partly based on an audience interested in viewing non-professional content, and the video diary is an important part of the YouTube experience. In this genre, identity becomes a co-construction between the self and the audience, as people often confide in others. Such opportunities are especially important for women, who have had difficulty broadcasting their message publicly. Strangelove asserts that women and girls both reflect and protest hegemonic images of femininity through themes such as playing with Barbie dolls, being violent, supporting pro-anorexia lifestyles, and speaking out against sexism.</p>
<p>Connecting with other people who share similar interests, or wish to participate in a community of amateur video-makers, has been a popular theme among YouTube scholarship, and Strangelove includes a chapter on this topic. YouTube is not without controversies, but such debates are part of the process of community formation. Through these debates, shared behavioral norms are contested and negotiated. YouTube also exhibits numerous political discussions, both emerging from mainstream election-based activities and informally. Marginalized social groups such as atheists use YouTube to engage in lively discussions that ‘challenge conventional thinking’ and help them ‘fight for cultural legitimacy’ (p. 150).</p>
<p><italic>Watching YouTube</italic> provides an interesting although at times quirky catalogue of YouTube videos. Strangelove is rightly critical of traditional media scholarship that eschews the vernacular, assumes a universal viewer as interpretant, and overstates the impact of Marxian-inspired, technological and cultural ideologies on amateur practices of home moviemaking. However, his efforts to tie video case studies to broader media theorization enter into more uncertain territory. <italic>Watching YouTube</italic> struggles with a number of debates that are common in contemporary media studies, such as the problematics of context, adequate determinations of the ordinary, and whether medium specificity is useful for understanding the communicative possibilities of new media.</p>
<p>Strangelove engages in a riff that is fairly popular among scholars and pundits who are tackling new media terrain. Namely, he supports the often-cited claim that media’s interpretive context is lost because of YouTube, or more generally because of the internet (p. 31). Several factors illustrate the complexities of this claim. First, concerns about context are ancient, being deeply imbricated with the nature of media. Recording communicative symbols and circulating them means that elements of an artifact’s original context of creation may be lost. From Plato to Derrida to Gellner, scholars have long struggled with media’s contextual disorientation and resulting misinterpretation.</p>
<p>Second, even though Strangelove claims that context is no longer available in online media (p. 58), this did not seem to prompt him to include interviews of video creators and text commenters. In a book that states it is an ethnography (a contentious word these days), it would seem advantageous to at least consult with some media makers to gain additional perspectives on their intentions and interpretations. Finally, even though context is supposedly lost online, this does not prevent Strangelove and others who make this claim from advancing their own rather confident interpretations of the videos they watch on YouTube. An example is an analysis Strangelove provides for a video entitled ‘White Trash Weddin – what the hell’s a YouTube?,’ in which a visibly pregnant bride is being married in front of groomsmen holding shotguns while the song ‘Dueling Banjos’ plays in the background (p. 37). Strangelove confidently interprets this as a ‘mock wedding,’ in contrast to those misguided text commenters who misinterpreted the wedding as real. If context is lost online, why is Strangelove wedded to the idea that this is a <italic>parody</italic> of a ceremony? Clearly certain signposts exist that encourage particular interpretations of media and the messages contained therein. To be sure, media context is a complex – but long-standing – issue.</p>
<p>A similar analysis might be advanced in terms of Strangelove’s claim that online video has now crossed into the realm of the ordinary, implying that most people post videos on YouTube. Yet certain facts in the book suggest that we have not quite arrived at that point. For example, Strangelove notes that he ‘requires’ his students to obtain a YouTube account and post ‘at least one video’ there (p. 19). Such a requirement would not be necessary if everyone of a certain age were organically life-casting on YouTube. In addition, only 1% (or perhaps up to 10%) of YouTube participants upload videos (p. 121) in YouTube’s ‘core-periphery social structure’ (p. 125). Participants who post video responses also make up a relatively small proportion of the user base for the site (p. 121). Just how ‘hyperactive’ (p. 161) audiences really are at the moment is debatable. Being realistic about what is happening on the ground is important because such findings have implications for crafting adequate media literacy policies.</p>
<p>Using Strangelove’s work in a classroom setting would benefit from involving companion texts that engage more directly with the media philosophies that Strangelove invokes. <italic>Watching YouTube</italic> will quite likely prompt classroom debates on what is meant by the ordinary in the context of documenting the human experience through video. Everyone has probably vomited, but not everyone records it, or puts such a video on YouTube. Are such videos documenting the ‘ordinary,’ in terms of both content and meta-statements about what media should accomplish? Strangelove makes an important point when he states that YouTube ‘challenges our sense of the “normal” by confronting us with extreme diversity of human behavior’ (pp. 34–35).</p>
<p>Strangelove notes that his book is an ethnography, yet one is left wanting more information about how his participation – which was clearly enthusiastic and committed – helped achieve new insights. For example, he posted a video containing odd images of a Barbie doll with scissors near its head (p. 93) that ‘protests patriarchy and consumer culture.’ But how? He also put himself on camera several times, exhibiting an odd expression (p. 66), wearing a bicycle helmet with a camera attached (p. 189), and enacting a simulated performance of an ‘angry professor’ who hears a cell phone ringing in class (p. 123). But what did these engagements bring to the analysis? For example, what kind of text commentary did he receive? It would have been beneficial to hear how these participatory practices contributed to the development of his analysis about YouTube and vernacular video.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Strangelove’s aesthetic and self-presentational choices, being experimental in tone, may be better viewed as part of the very stuff of YouTube, as they transmit an aura of quirkiness, oddity, playfulness, and openness that is compatible with what some see as YouTube culture. Could this type of participation be a harbinger of more playful forms of scholarly engagement in future media studies?</p>
<p>Given an ever-changing media landscape, neither author offers extensive future predictions for the potential of vernacular video. However, both express concern about how the capitalist, commercial platforms in which participation is embedded may influence what is said and what is possible to say in public. Gauntlett suggests that alternative funding approaches, such as that of Wikipedia’s public-service model may be more conducive to promoting a connected, convivial society than the present system with its drive to commercialize, in part through content sanitization. Wikipedia depends on donations and grants (p. 212), yet such a model may be difficult to execute in more expensive, high-bandwidth service environments such as video-exchange. Gauntlett tries to offer some suggestions for future directions of DIY media. These include creating gatekeeper-free platforms for sharing media online, and effecting changes in education and workplaces that more directly connect people to their handiwork.</p>
<p>Gauntlett’s book, written in accessible prose, will quite likely find use not only in classrooms, but also among educated readers who wish to explore how creativity can improve the human condition. Strangelove’s approach emerges more directly from visual media studies that are concerned with theoretically analyzing what people post to YouTube and why. Both books respect everyday DIY contributors and argue that making something, however imperfect, is vital for human development. The mediated ephemera before us reveal a social and interactive process of creativity that is constantly in motion. Vernacular creativity offers the potential for profound change – provided that ordinary participants fight to maintain open platforms that foster experimentation and play.</p>
