<p>In her own words, Dr. Marie-Helen Maras wrote this book in an attempt to appeal to the individual who does not have a comprehensive legal or technical background in computer forensics. Indeed, most law enforcement officers and students who are considering a career in computer forensics do not or have not had sufficient training in both computer science and criminal justice. Even those criminologists who claimed specialty in cybercrime usually do not have enough technical knowledge on the application of technology. On the other hand, those who possess computer skills often are not familiar with the legal requirement and the sophistication of evidence integrity. A book that can narrow the gap is much needed in the field of computer forensics.</p>
<p>In totally 13 chapters, the author thoroughly introduces the basics of computer forensics and the cyber environment in which forensic works would be conducted. In Chapter 1, the definition and typology of cybercrime are discussed. This is utmost important in that different types of cybercrime may require different skill sets to extract digital evidence, and they also usually generate different types of digital evidence, which entails different legal consideration in the presentation of evidence. In the following chapter, the concept of electronic evidence is introduced and the procedure of computer forensics is also described. Chapter 3 through Chapter 5 are dedicated to addressing the legal aspects of computer forensics, such as the suspect’s constitutional rights and the legal grounds on which searches and seizures can be conducted. In Chapter 6, the cyber environment which breeds multiple types of cybercrime (e.g., cyberbullying, identity theft, and online scam) is discussed. This is an important aspect that is usually missing in a book that is too technical to address the etiology of crime. Nonetheless, in this book the content also covers technical knowledge. In Chapter 7, the tools that can be used to collect evidence are introduced. Chapter 8 discusses what an investigator should do at a crime scene when digital evidence is involved. Chapter 9 is about how to conduct a corporate investigation. Chapter 10 is e-mail forensics and Chapter 11 is network forensics. In these chapters, the author avoids bombarding the reader with too many technical terms. Instead, she adeptly talks about the network structure in a way easier to understand for people who lack extensive computer literacy. In Chapter 12, mobile phone and Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) investigations are addressed. Considering how prevalent nowadays mobile phones are, it is important to know how computer forensics is applied to portable devices. In Chapter 13, what a computer forensics investigator should be prepared to face in a courtroom is also discussed. Evidence is never all about techniques. How it is interpreted and presented as crucial as how it was collected.</p>
<p>All in all, as mentioned, this book should be very useful for people who first started studying computer forensics. It is very helpful in establishing a conceptual framework for computer forensics, and it paints a fairly solid idea of what to expect in both the technical and legal aspects. It is finally a book about computer forensics that is suitable for readers who are primarily trained in social sciences. I particularly appreciate the fact that the author stresses the differences in different types of cybercrime separately in terms of their respective cyber environments, techniques required, and evidence generated. As in all other fields, there are many subdivisions in computer forensics. You cannot expect to tackle all cybercrimes by knowing just one or two techniques.</p>
<p>Despite my overall appreciation for Dr. Maras’ book, I have one critique. In the book, Dr. Maras seems to imply computer forensics is for the investigation of cybercrime. I must point out the fact that in today’s society where technology has been embedded in our everyday life, digital evidence can be applicable to any crime, because electronic devices could be used in any crime that is not normally construed as cybercrime. For example, a murderer could videotape his killing using his cell phone. It is not a cybercrime but the crucial evidence can be stored in the form of digital evidence. E-mail can be used for communication between criminals. Even though they did not commit crime through e-mail, the e-mail conversation could still serve as evidence. Global positioning system devices also could store important evidence related to a criminal’s whereabouts in a case that is not necessarily cybercrime. To think of computer forensics as cybercrime investigation is incomprehensive. Computer forensics ought to be seen as part of forensic science that could be applicable in any crime investigations. Moreover, computer forensics not only generates evidence in a legal sense but also provides useful leads for investigation. This is to say even if the information extracted from electronic devices is not forensic evidence per se, computer forensics might still be able to offer clues for investigators to look for evidence somewhere else or to profile the suspect. For example, the websites a suspect frequently visits may not prove any crime but such information can help understand the suspect’s hobby and interest. If the full utility of computer forensics can be clearly identified, it would be beneficial for the reader to understand the practicality of computer forensics and thus circumvents the misconception that suggests computer forensics is only relevant to cybercrime.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would recommend this book to anyone, including practitioners, academics, and students, who is interested in computer forensics. It addresses not only the technique but also the law and the criminal background. Dr. Maras’ writing style renders great readability and the organization of the book is superb.</p>
