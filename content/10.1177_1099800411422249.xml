<abstract>
<p>Midwives often work night and rotating shift schedules, which can lead to sleep disturbances, increased fatigue, and greater likelihood of accidents or errors. This study investigated the sleep of midwives (<italic>n</italic> = 17) in an Australian metropolitan hospital. Midwives completed work and sleep logbooks and wore wrist actigraphs for 28 days. Midwives worked combinations of morning, afternoon, and/or night shifts on constant (<italic>n</italic> = 6) or rotating schedules (<italic>n</italic> = 11). They obtained less than recommended amounts of sleep, getting only 6–7 hr per 24-hr period. Morning shifts were associated with the lowest sleep durations, lowest subjective sleep quality, and highest postsleep fatigue ratings. Despite the significantly higher amount of wake after sleep onset (51 min), the sleep before afternoon shifts had significantly lower postsleep fatigue ratings and was rated as significantly higher quality than sleep before other shifts or days off. Those who were married or living with a partner reported significantly more sleep and lower postsleep fatigue than those who were separated or divorced (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Seventy-one percent of midwives took naps, primarily before night shifts, with nearly 40% of nightshifts preceded by a nap. Average nap durations were nearly 1.5 hr. Midwives reported feeling moderately to very physically or mentally exhausted on 22–50% of all shifts and days off. Exhaustion was most common on night shift. This study suggests that midwives may be suffering from chronic sleep loss and as a consequence may be at risk of impairments in functioning that accompany fatigue.</p>

<body>
<p>The advent of shift work has simultaneously led to greater convenience and availability of services and increased health and safety issues for the people who work around the clock. The adverse consequences of shift work have been widely documented, including sleep loss, sleepiness, performance impairment, increased risk of accidents and injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099800411422249">Åkerstedt, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411422249">Rajaratnam &amp; Arendt, 2001</xref>), reduced well-being, increased stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411422249">Costa, 1996</xref>), and greater risk of health issues, including cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal problems, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1099800411422249">Lowden, Moreno, Holmback, Lennernas, &amp; Tucker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Nurses and midwives are integral parts of the health care industry, and the nature of their work necessitates round-the-clock care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411422249">Efinger, Nelson, &amp; Walsh Starr, 1995</xref>). Because the body’s natural circadian rhythms promote sleep during the hours of darkness, nurses are frequently working in opposition to their body’s predisposed tendencies, and this can lead to suboptimal performance, alertness, and functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411422249">Rajaratnam &amp; Arendt, 2001</xref>). A number of studies have documented stress, exhaustion, and burnout associated with nursing and midwifery, which can adversely impact the quality of patient care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800411422249">Aiken et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411422249">Efinger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1099800411422249">Sandall, 1998</xref>). Work hours and sleep loss in nursing and midwifery have been associated with increased sleepiness, fatigue and exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411422249">Dorrian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099800411422249">Paterson, Dorrian, Pincombe, Grech, &amp; Dawson, 2010</xref>), an increased likelihood of struggling to stay awake while at work or while driving to or from work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411422249">Dorrian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411422249">Gold et al., 1992</xref>) as well as increased likelihood of error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411422249">Dorrian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099800411422249">Rogers, Hwang, Scott, Aiken, &amp; Dinges, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>At present, we are not aware of any studies on the sleep patterns of midwives using objective sleep indicators. Objective indicators are important, as self-reported sleep can be inaccurate or biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411422249">Gehrman, Matt, Turingan, Dinh, &amp; Ancoli-Israel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411422249">Reyner &amp; Horne, 1995</xref>). In addition, some studies have suggested that researchers should use caution when relying on sleep diaries with subjects who have regular fluctuations in daytime vigilance or excessive daytime sleepiness or take frequent daytime naps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411422249">Rogers, Caruso, &amp; Aldrich, 1993</xref>). Arguably, shift workers would fit this description. While polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard of objective sleep measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099800411422249">Carskadon &amp; Rechtschaffen, 2000</xref>), it can be expensive, interfere with the natural sleep setting, and be difficult to implement in field research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1099800411422249">Meltzer, Mindell, &amp; Levandoski, 2007</xref>). Actigraphy is a useful alternative. It provides an objective estimate of sleep/wake patterns by recording motor activity via a small wrist-worn monitor. These monitors can record continuously for extended periods (i.e., several weeks) and need only be removed during activities where they may become wet (e.g., showering). Actigraphy is relatively unobtrusive and substantially less expensive than PSG. Validation studies for actigraphy have yielded favorable comparison with PSG-recorded sleep, typically citing above 78% agreement rate for sleep/wake identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411422249">Sadeh, Hauri, Kripke, &amp; Lavie, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1099800411422249">Sadeh, Sharkey, &amp; Carskadon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1099800411422249">Webster, Kripke, Messin, Mullaney, &amp; Wyborney, 1982</xref>) even in sleep-disordered patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411422249">Sadeh et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to the potential severity of the consequences of sleep loss, it is important to determine whether midwives are obtaining sleep of adequate quality and quantity. In particular, it is important to investigate how the working of different shift types impacts the characteristics of midwives' sleep, in terms of timing, duration, and quality. Describing these sleep parameters is the first step in examining sleep and sleepiness-related health and safety of midwives and, thereby, the safety of patients.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1099800411422249">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited 17 midwives from a South Australian metropolitan hospital via information sessions, which we organized in collaboration with the director of Midwifery Services and the unit managers. Following the information sessions, we provided midwives with information packages about the study. Those who volunteered to take part signed informed consent documents prior to commencement of the study. We provided no remuneration for participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1099800411422249">
<title>Procedure and Instruments</title>
<p>This study received ethics approval from the University of South Australia Human Research Ethics Committee and the ethics committee of the participating hospital, in accordance with the guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. Participants completed preliminary questionnaires regarding their general health and sleep history (including possible sleep disorders), demographic details (e.g., age, height and weight, marital status, dependents, travel time to work, shift length), and work history. We then asked them to complete daily logbooks for 28 consecutive days, recording their sleep and work hours. The logbooks were A4 spiral bound and contained a sleep diary to be completed every day and a work diary to be completed on days when they worked a shift. We asked them to complete their logbooks at the same time each evening, and if they forgot to record an entry for that day, to proceed to the next day and not complete the entry from memory. In the work diary participants recorded their scheduled and actual work hours for each shift. In the sleep diary, participants recorded all main sleep periods and naps, and for each of these sleep periods they indicated the times at which they went to sleep and awoke, their duration and perceived quality of sleep, fatigue levels, and number of awakenings. They also used a 5-point scale to rate their levels of physical and mental exhaustion for the day overall (work and days off), from 1 (<italic>very exhausted</italic>) to 5 (<italic>not at all exhausted</italic>).</p>
<p>All participants wore a wrist actigraphy monitor (Philips-Respironics, PA) on their nondominant wrist for the duration of the protocol (28 days), with instructions to remove it only during activities when it might become damaged or wet (e.g., showering or swimming). Actigraphy monitors record movement via a motion-sensitive device and contain a piezo-electric accelerometer with a sensitivity of 0.1 g. The analogue sensor samples movement every 125 ms and stores this information in 1-min intervals for analysis. We set a medium sensitivity level (activity count per epoch &lt; 40) to determine sleep/wake states. When used with the appropriate computer algorithm program, actigraphy can determine a wearer’s rest and movement patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099800411422249">Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1099800411422249">Sadeh et al., 1994</xref>). We compared actigraphy data with sleep diaries using the Philips-Respironics algorithms (Actiware-Sleep software, Philips-Respironics) to validate recordings of movement and provide an overall picture of sleep/wake activity. This type of actigraphy device and the associated algorithms have been validated against PSG in laboratory and applied shift work settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1099800411422249">Signal, Gale, &amp; Gander, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1099800411422249">Stanley, Dorling, Dawson, &amp; Hindmarch, 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1099800411422249">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We analyzed sleep occurring in the 24-hr period prior to each shift start time separately for each shift type (morning, afternoon, and evening) and for days off. We classified sleep periods by duration as main sleeps or naps. If there was only one sleep period in the 24 hr prior to a shift or on a day off, we classified this as the main sleep regardless of duration. If there was an additional sleep period of &lt; 3 hr, we classified it as a nap. We obtained the following subjective variables from the sleep diaries for each period of sleep (main sleeps and naps):<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Pre- and postsleep fatigue level: 7-point scale, from 1 (<italic>fully alert and wide awake</italic>) to 7 (<italic>completely exhausted and unable to function effectively</italic>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Perceived sleep quality: 5-point scale, from 1 (<italic>very good</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very poor</italic>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>We calculated the following parameters for each sleep period obtained during the protocol, including naps, using the Actiware-sleep software (Philips-Respironics) in conjunction with the sleep diaries (used for bedtime and get-up time):</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Sleep latency: the number of minutes between the reported bedtime and the onset of sleep.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Wake after sleep onset (WASO): the duration (in minutes) of any wake that occurs during the sleep period.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Total sleep time (TST): the sum of sleep occurring between sleep onset and wake time, excluding any periods of wake.</p>
</list-item>
</list>In addition, we calculated TST for each 24-hr period prior to a shift or day off, inclusive of main sleep periods and any naps. We used mixed effects analyses of variance ([ANOVAs] random effect = participant ID, taking into account repeated observations by the same individuals; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1099800411422249">Van Dongen, Olfsen, Dinges, &amp; Maislin, 2004</xref>) to investigate differences in each sleep variable according to shift type (morning, afternoon, and night) or day off, conducting post hoc comparisons (least significant differences, using the estimated marginal means [EMMs] from the fitted model) to determine which shifts/days off differed significantly for each of the dependent variables (presleep fatigue, postsleep fatigue, sleep quality, sleep latency, WASO, and TST). Where significant, models included covariates of age, body mass index (BMI), shift length, travel time to work, marital status, dependents, schedule type (mornings only; mornings and afternoons; mornings, evenings and nights; and nights only) and rotation (rotating shifts vs. constant shift type).</p>

<p>The protocol was designed to yield a total of 476 days of data (17 midwives × 28 days). Four days contained missing data, resulting in 472 days of data, including 241 work shifts. We classified shifts as morning shifts (start time 0600–0900 hr), afternoon shifts (start time 1100–1700 hr), or night shifts (start time 2000–2200 hr). Most midwives worked sequences of rotating shifts that were 8–10.5 hr in duration each, although three worked only night shifts and three worked only morning shifts during the protocol. Of the remaining 11 participants, 7 rotated between morning and afternoon shifts and 4 rotated among morning, afternoon, and night shifts. Approximately half of the shifts worked during the protocol were morning shifts, with the other half being comprised fairly equally of afternoon and night shifts. Most shifts were scheduled to be 8 hr in length, though night shifts could be 10 hr. Midwives reported feeling moderately to very physically or mentally exhausted on approximately one in four afternoon shifts or days off, one in three morning shifts, and 44–50% of night shifts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1099800411422249">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1099800411422249">Table 2</xref>

<p>Average subjective sleep quality was between 2 and 3 (good–average) for all main sleep periods. Subjective sleep quality for main sleep periods before afternoon shifts was significantly better (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) than for sleep before morning or night shifts or days off. Midwives also rated sleep before days off of higher quality than sleep before morning shifts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1099800411422249">Table 3</xref>). BMI (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,11.8</sub> = 5.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) was a significant covariate of sleep quality, such that those with a higher BMI had lower sleep quality.</p>
<p>For all main sleep periods, the duration of WASO averaged 43–51 min. The amount of WASO was significantly greater (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) for main sleep periods preceding afternoon shifts than for sleep periods before morning or night shifts or days off. Further, sleep before days off contained significantly more WASO (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) than did sleep before a night shift (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1099800411422249">Table 3</xref>). There were no significant covariates for WASO.</p>
<p>On average, midwives obtained less than 7 hr of sleep per day. The TST obtained in the 24 hr before each shift type, including main sleeps and any naps, was significantly shorter for morning shifts (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) than for afternoon or night shifts or days off (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1099800411422249">Table 3</xref>). Marital status was a significant covariate of 24-hr TST (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,11.1</sub> = 4.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), such that those who were married or with a partner obtained significantly more TST (EMM = 6.95 hr) than those who were separated or divorced (EMM = 5.84 hr). In the 24 hr prior to a shift or day off commencing, midwives obtained &lt; 6 hr TST before 49.1% of night shifts, 42.6% of morning shifts, 27.4% of afternoon shifts, and 29% of days off.</p>
<p>During the protocol, 70.6% of midwives took naps. Naps most often preceded night shifts, with midwives napping before 38% of night shifts compared to 16.6% of days off, 3.1% of afternoon shifts and 2.4% of morning shifts. There were very few naps associated with morning (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and afternoon shifts (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and there was no significant difference between nap variables for shift type/days off. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1099800411422249">Table 4</xref> presents nap details by work days (i.e., morning, afternoon, or night shifts) and days off. Removing naps from the 24-hr sleep history calculations reduced the average TST prior to morning and afternoon shifts by &lt; 3 min and prior to days off by &lt; 1 min but reduced average TST prior to night shifts by nearly 26 min. Similar to main sleep periods, midwives rated subjective sleep quality for naps as 2–3 (good to average) and postsleep fatigue between 3 (<italic>okay, somewhat fresh</italic>) and 4 (<italic>a little tired, less than fresh</italic>) for both work days and days off. The mean nap duration was 1.39 hr (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.53 hr) for work days and 1.45 hr (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.72 hr) for days off.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the sleep characteristics of a sample of Australian midwives over 1 month as they worked a mixture of morning, afternoon, and night shifts. We examined whether their sleep differed as a function of type of shift or work day versus day off. We investigated main sleep and nap periods both separately and in combination in order to assess TST in the 24 hr prior to the start of a shift or day off. That is, our focus was how much sleep midwives achieved during the 24 hr prior to commencing each work shift in order to gain insight into whether they may be working while sleep deprived.</p>
<p>Before all shift types and days off, midwives in the present study obtained less than the recommended daily sleep quota of 8 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1099800411422249">Van Dongen, Rogers, &amp; Dinges, 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411422249">Carskadon and Dement (2000)</xref>, most people report sleeping for around 7.5 hr on week days and 8.5 hr on weekends. In the present study, midwives obtained approximately 6–7 hr TST, with highest sleep durations prior to afternoon shifts. They obtained less than 6 hr sleep before almost half of all night and morning shifts and before a third of afternoon shifts and days off. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1099800411422249">Van Dongen, Maislin, Mullington, and Dinges (2003)</xref> demonstrated that chronically restricting (14 days) sleep to 6 hr or less per night can result in cognitive performance impairments that are equivalent to being totally deprived of sleep for up to 2 nights. Throughout the present study, midwives also frequently reported moderate-to-high levels of physical and mental exhaustion. Therefore, these midwives may be suffering from chronic sleep loss and frequent exhaustion, making them vulnerable to sleep-loss-related impairments in functioning.</p>
<p>In a study of hospital staff nurses using self-report daily logbooks, investigators found sleep durations (including naps) to average 6.7 hr (SD = 1.79 hr) on work days, and only 20.8% of participants reported obtaining a minimum of 6 hr of sleep prior to work shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1099800411422249">Scott et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1099800411422249">Scott and colleagues (2007)</xref> found that shorter sleep durations, decreased alertness at work, and working at night were significantly related to drowsy driving episodes. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411422249">Gold et al. (1992)</xref> found that less than 30% of American hospital nurses (<italic>n</italic> = 635) working night or rotating shifts obtained more than 7 hr of sleep on work days. In comparison with nurses who worked day or afternoon shift, the nurses who worked rotating shifts (including day, afternoon, and nights) were twice as likely to report an accident or error related to sleepiness and were twice as likely to “nod off” while driving to or from work. Consistent with the current study, these results suggest a trend in nursing and midwifery of insufficient sleep and, therefore, possibly associated exhaustion, errors, and drowsy driving.</p>
<p>Indeed, the majority of midwives (71%) in the present study supplemented their primary sleep periods with naps, indicative of inadequate sleep time. Even when midwives took naps, however, they still obtained less than the recommended amount of total sleep. Although the duration of naps did not differ significantly between work days and days off, there were differences in the frequency of naps associated with each shift type and days off. Participants primarily took naps prior to nightshifts (nearly 40% of nightshifts were preceded by a nap), suggesting prophylactic use of napping to aid nightshift alertness. This finding is consistent with other studies that have also found naps to be more common in connection with night shifts than morning or afternoon shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411422249">Axelsson, Åkerstedt, Kecklund, &amp; Lowdon, 2004</xref>). Unlike studies from other countries, in this study participants recorded no naps during work hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099800411422249">Ribeiro-Silva et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In accordance with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411422249">Dorrian et al., 2008</xref>), the shortest 24-hr TST in this study was before morning shifts and the longest before afternoon shifts. Working morning shifts that commence between 0600 and 0900 hr can lead to inadequate sleep as such shifts necessitate a relatively early bedtime for the worker to obtain the optimal 8 hr of sleep. This may be additionally difficult for midwives working a rotating shift schedule which interferes with the establishment of a normal sleep/wake schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099800411422249">Poissonnet &amp; Véron, 2000</xref>). Thus, midwives in the present study may have been unable to initiate sleep sufficiently early in the night before commencing a morning shift the following day, particularly if they had worked an afternoon shift the previous day. Indeed, research suggests that it is very difficult to advance sleep onset in preparation for an early morning shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411422249">Costa, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>For hospital nurses working rotating shifts, subjective sleep quality is most affected for morning and night shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099800411422249">Schroer, De Witte, &amp; Philipsen, 1993</xref>). Consistent with this, in the present study participants rated sleep periods prior to morning and night shifts as of subjectively lower quality than those prior to afternoon shift. However, they also rated sleep on days off as of lower quality than sleep before afternoon shifts, and sleep on days off was also significantly reduced relative to sleep prior to afternoon shifts. This finding suggests that on days off, midwives were not extending their sleep to compensate for work-related sleep loss. Sleep extension on days off in shift workers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411422249">Dorrian et al., 2008</xref>) and on weekends in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411422249">Carskadon &amp; Dement, 2000</xref>) to catch up on sleep lost during work days is common. However, midwives may have difficulty reestablishing a normal sleep/wake pattern on days off between shifts, or they may try to utilize their time off to catch up on social or family activities that were not possible while working irregular shifts, thereby sacrificing sleep to meet their other commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411422249">Åkerstedt, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, results indicate that for the midwives in the present study, sleep prior to afternoon shifts was superior to that prior to other shifts, or even days off, in terms of duration, subjective sleep quality, and postsleep fatigue. The one exception to the overall superiority of sleep parameters for afternoon-shift sleep was WASO, which was significantly higher during afternoon-shift sleep than for any other shift type or days off. As sleep before afternoon shifts tended to be initiated later in the night and ended later in the morning, midwives may have been disrupted during their sleep period by outside noise or activity within their house as their partner or children got ready while they were still trying to sleep or by morning sunlight in their bedrooms. Consistent with this suggestion, we noted the smallest amount of WASO for sleep before morning shifts. WASO durations recorded in this study, irrespective of shift type or day off, ranged from 43 to 51 min. If midwives are not cognizant of the amount of wake they experience during sleep periods, they may be subjectively overestimating the amount of sleep they obtain. Certainly, research has indicated that subjective sleep reports can be inaccurate and may overestimate sleep durations and underestimate WASO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411422249">Gehrman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411422249">Reyner &amp; Horne, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1099800411422249">Tremaine, Dorrian, &amp; Blunden, 2010</xref>). These findings emphasize the importance of research investigating objective sleep indices, as such results can be used to increase knowledge and education, potentially safeguarding against the mistaken belief that time in bed equates TST.</p>
<p>Results of the present study further indicate that marital status was a significant covariate of TST and postsleep fatigue. Specifically, midwives who were married or living with a partner obtained significantly more TST and rated their fatigue levels upon awakening as significantly lower than did midwives who were separated or divorced. As the midwives in this study were predominantly middle-aged females, it is conceivable that being married or living with a partner may have increased subjective feelings of security, which may be reduced significantly after a divorce or separation. Of course there is also additional stress associated with a recent separation or divorce. Such factors associated with marital status may influence not only the perceived restorative value of sleep but also the amount of TST obtained. Indeed, prior research has suggested that marital status is correlated with sleep duration, with people who are separated or divorced obtaining significantly less sleep than those who are married (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099800411422249">Hale, 2005</xref>). While the differences between shift types in terms of postsleep fatigue were statistically significant, they are not highly meaningful (i.e., there was an average rating of 3, <italic>okay, somewhat fresh</italic>, after all shift types); differences were larger comparing those who were married or with a partner (less than 3, <italic>okay, somewhat fresh</italic>) compared to those who were separated or divorced (more than 4, <italic>little tired, less than fresh</italic>). Further, in accord with epidemiological evidence (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099800411422249">Knutson, Spiegel, Penev, &amp; Van Cauter, 2007</xref>), BMI was a significant covariate of subjective sleep quality in the present study, such that midwives who had a higher BMI rated their sleep as poorer in quality than did midwives who had a lower BMI.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first published study to report on an objective indicator of sleep behavior of midwives over a 1-month period. Overall, results indicate that Australian midwives obtain less than recommended amounts of sleep both before their shifts and on days off. This practice can be hazardous to their health and well-being, their safety (particularly while traveling to and from work), and the safety and health of the patients with whom they work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411422249">Costa, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411422249">Dorrian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411422249">Efinger et al., 1995</xref>). In a practical sense, these findings indicate that education may be necessary to ensure that midwives are aware of the dangers of working and driving after inadequate sleep, particularly for morning and night shifts, which in this study were preceded by the lowest sleep durations. As part of this education, there should be an emphasis on the potential utility of days off for recouping sleep lost during work days. It appears from the present study that midwives are not using days off in this capacity, which may be perpetuating their chronic sleep loss and exacerbating overall tiredness. Certainly, research has indicated that difficulties balancing work and personal life can lead to feelings of stress and burnout in midwives and nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411422249">Fereday &amp; Oster, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations to the present study. Although the length of the study (28 days) is relatively long for collection of objective sleep data, the participant group is still comparably small (<italic>n</italic> = 17), which may explain the lack of significant between-subject differences in terms of shift schedule and rotation. Participants were relatively homogenous in terms of gender and age. However, this characteristic is also a reflection of the broader demographics of midwifery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099800411422249">AIHW, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099800411422249">2010b</xref>). Further, the generalizability of this study is limited, as we collected the data from midwives on staff at a single metropolitan hospital. We must also acknowledge the limitations of actigraphy. Although this method is useful for large-scale field studies and has yielded high agreement rates for sleep/wake identification in validation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1099800411422249">Sadeh et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411422249">1995</xref>), it cannot record the nuances of sleep with the accuracy of PSG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099800411422249">Carskadon &amp; Rechtschaffen, 2000</xref>), which would allow examination of sleep architecture changes across shift types, giving a more objective and detailed indicator of depth and quality as well as sleep duration. Analyses in this article focused on the level of sleep deprivation midwives may be likely to experience at work, investigating the 24 hr prior to beginning each shift. We did not investigate postshift sleep, which would be relevant particularly for night shifts, where sleep occurs during the daytime and is therefore likely to be shorter and of poorer quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411422249">Rajaratnam &amp; Arendt, 2001</xref>). Participants completed the diary once daily, at approximately 1800 hr. Data therefore rely on participant recall, which may vary across shifts at different times of day. To minimize the possible negative impact of inaccurate recall, we instructed participants not to try to complete diaries from memory the following day after missing a day of recording but, rather, to leave it blank.</p>
<p>The findings of this study highlight the need for further research into the sleep behavior of midwives, as the results suggest that Australian midwives may be suffering the effects of chronic sleep loss. Future research should investigate whether the present results are replicable in larger samples specifically representative of the midwifery workforce throughout Australia (e.g., hospitals in rural and metropolitan locations, using different models of care). It would also be useful to further investigate factors that influence whether shift workers choose to extend sleep on days off to compensate for sleep loss during work schedules and to examine in more detail the effects of domestic status on sleep. Cost, time, and participant burden permitting, it would be beneficial to collect PSG recording of midwives' sleep, perhaps using ambulatory equipment. However, results of the current study suggest that actigraphy can be successfully used among midwives to provide a more objective estimation of sleep than the traditional sleep diary approach.</p>
<p>Taken together, the sleep and exhaustion data in the present study suggest that participating midwives were sleep deprived. The next step is to examine whether, as has been clearly demonstrated in other shift working populations, this translates into impairment in operational performance. For example, possible approaches include short tests of sustained reaction time in the workplace, as has been done in mining and transport (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411422249">Ferguson, Paech, Dorrian, Roach, &amp; Jay, 2011</xref>), or recording of errors and near errors in health care (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411422249">Dorrian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099800411422249">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>Results of this study indicate that throughout the 28-day protocol, and irrespective of shift type or day off, midwives obtained average daily sleep durations of approximately 6–7 hr per 24-hr period. Morning shifts were associated with the lowest duration of TST, the lowest subjective sleep quality, and the highest postsleep fatigue ratings. Dissemination of this information will increase awareness of the impact of work schedules on the sleep of midwives. In particular, recognition of the particularly short sleep prior to morning shifts would help to highlight the importance of considering the possible negative impact of reduced sleep overall, not just in connection with night shifts. Current findings indicate that this underresearched area warrants further investigation due to the potential implications for the health, well-being, and safety of midwives and their patients.</p>
