<p>This special issue will focus on macromarketing issues in Turkey and the Turkish immigrant communities in Europe and elsewhere. </p>
<p>The purpose of the issue is to help illuminate marketization and marketing dynamics in a world of global markets and growing globalization. Turkey and Turkish communities present a fertile context in which such dynamics can be studied, since they represent a meeting and confrontation of the East and the West, culturally, historically, economically, socially, and politically, whether within Turkey or elsewhere where large communities of immigrants reside. A crucial question is: what can macromarketing scholars learn from studying various phenomena and issues in the Turkish context? Thus, the special issue welcomes works, which will generate new learning, insights, and conceptualization/theorization about markets, market(ing) processes and systems, marketization trends, and macro consumption and marketing phenomena. Broader, contextualized, and critical perspectives into the phenomena of interest are likely to be gained through this special issue.</p>
<p>Articles published in the Journal typically address the interplay of marketing and society. Authors have examined marketing systems, socioeconomic development, market transition, ethics and distributive justice, marketing history, globalization, market competition, consumer vulnerability, environmental degradation/renewal/sustainability, marketing efficiencies in allocating resources, consumer and societal well-being, and quality of life. These and other topics in a Turkish context offer promise for contribution to this special issue. Related research themes may include, but are not limited to:
