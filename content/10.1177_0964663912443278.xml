<italic>The Paradox of Regulation</italic> proceeds from the important (and correct) premise that regulation has strengths and there are appropriate times to regulate, but that we must always be vigilant as to the limitations of regulation, and we must equally be cognizant of the precision that is required if the regulatory exercise is to be effective. It also rightly notes that regulation emerges from, and is created and constantly reformed against, a backdrop of conflicting demands. On the one hand, it faces calls for more regulation and on the other it faces complaints that we are already over-regulated. Such are the socio-political challenges that confront the regulator, and the scholar seeking to understand regulation and improve regulatory outcomes. And so emerges the title of the book.</p>
<p>The author, Fiona Haines, proceeds by way of a very brief but useful scene-setting introductory chapter wherein she suggests that regulation is a policy response to the manifold risks of the modern, global, techno-science society (i.e. it is a response to the ‘risk society’, so termed and explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912443278">Beck (1992</xref>) and others). She characterises regulation as a modernist project involving processes aimed at avoiding harm or diminishing the risk of harm (p. 3). The ‘modernist’ regulator, she claims, like modernists generally, is positive and opportunistic and seeks mastery over threats, whether natural or manmade. Modern regulation, therefore, is both an outcropping and indicator of human agency, and that agency is aimed, in no small part, at subjugating the world around us, and the threats that it represents or holds.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Haines examines in some detail the technical, social and political aspects of regulation, examining the literature of regulatory production, reform and compliance. In doing so, she rightly points to the critical, though sometimes veiled or hidden and often underappreciated, roles that values and politics play in regulatory assessment and reform. Equally importantly, she also notes that different groups will have different criteria for determining what is appropriate for regulatory attention, and what counts as ‘good’ regulation. She suggests that, at a minimum, regulation should have clear objectives, achieve those objectives in the least costly (most efficient) manner, be a proportional response to the subject risk/harm, be accessible, and have some enforcement component.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, Haines examines how risks are identified and defined, and how they thus provide the instrumental objectives of regulation (a fact previously noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912443278">Black (2008</xref>)). Of course, recognising that regulation is an instrumental tool does not answer some of the most important questions such as: What ends are most important or most appropriate to reach? What ends are even capable of being reached through regulation? This injects a social and political element to the regulatory undertaking (beyond the harmful or, as Haines terms it, the ‘actuarial’ element to be addressed). The consequence is that the actuarial risk is socially constructed and negotiated; it is understood against, and described using, a language shaped by values and interests and symbolic orders (a term coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0964663912443278">Douglas (1966</xref>)).</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, drawing on primary and secondary sources, Haines describes the three events that ground the case studies pursued in the remainder of the book: the 1998 Longford Gas plant explosion in Australia; the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Towers in New York (and their fallout in Australia); and the 2001 HIH Insurance collapse in Australia. These events were chosen because it is spectacular and devastating events such as these that so often generate, for better or worse, the social pressure and political dynamic that permits (or encourages) regulatory change. In each case the author explores the diverse interpretations of the disasters (i.e. views about their causes and significance) from a range of stakeholders, arriving at an actuarial, socio-cultural and political profile that shaped the subsequent regulatory activities.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, Haines outlines and assesses the respective regulatory responses, revealing how reform was ‘propelled’ by each event but ultimately shaped by actuarial, socio-cultural, and political types of risk. In Chapters 6, 7 and 8, Haines assesses the impact of these reforms on the ground by examining how hazardous sites, air and seaports, and financial institutions are regulated in Australia. She concludes from this assessment that the nature of the harm or risk to be avoided through regulatory action is a significant determinant of the potential success of the regulation (i.e. some risks and harms are more amenable to anticipation and reduction, and thus to regulatory control, than others). Additionally, regulatory flexibility can be both a strong weapon in the regulator’s armament, or a root cause of the harmful events that are intended to be avoided.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 pulls the analysis together, suggesting that regulation has considerable risk-reducing/avoiding potential, but that successful regulation is rare for a variety of reasons, not least the failure to appreciate the multifaceted nature of risk, and the potential to ‘race to the bottom’ rather than to ‘race to the top’ when it comes to negotiating standards and boundaries. <italic>The Paradox of Regulation</italic> concludes with two propositions that are not unfamiliar to those of us examining the regulatory context in a sustained way, but that are nonetheless usefully reiterated in the face of empirical evidence (at least from Australia). The first proposition is that regulation can be technically possible and supported and both politically and socially attractive, but can be thwarted when the subject risk is not amenable to targeted interventions; and the second is that even if regulation can be effectively used to avoid risks and harms, its success relies on both political support (to minimise gaming or avoidance behaviour by actors) and political forbearance (to avoid smothering the regulator’s capacity to frame and manage the regime in optimal or effective ways) – needs which are in constant tension. The book additionally concludes that it is particularly important to acknowledge these propositions or realities in the aftermath of disasters and crises (because, as noted above, they are so often instigators of regulatory construction and/or reform).</p>
<p>On the whole, I found <italic>The Paradox of Regulation</italic> to be well conceived, well researched, and well written. It was detailed, ambitious and insightful. It tackled the theoretical and the practical and remained wholly accessible throughout. The author grounded her claims and findings in concrete case studies which, though Australian, were generalisable. This book would, I think, be of interest to law and policy scholars generally, thus embracing a cross-disciplinary cadre of humanities researchers, as well as regulators and policymakers, who would benefit from the better understanding of their task that this book offers.</p>
