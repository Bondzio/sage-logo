<title>MNRS Foundation News</title>
<p>In this month’s column, I want to highlight the names and contact information for the Foundation’s Board of Trustees. As President, I am very privileged to work with such a distinguished group of leaders and scholars who are devoted to supporting nursing research through their work on the Foundation Board. We are so lucky to have the Foundation’s first President, Sally Lusk, continue to share her wisdom and breadth of knowledge in her new capacity as Past President. We also recently welcomed Dean Roberta K. Olson as a Trustee, along with Marge Bott, our new MNRS Board Liaison. Board members are our greatest resource, putting in countless hours annually in support of the Foundation’s mission to advance research, research utilization, and research careers in the Midwest region. The Trustees listed below do so in many ways, such as helping to identify and solicit funds from corporate sponsors and MNRS members, working on FUNdraising ideas for the annual conference, and continuing to build the infrastructure for the Foundation by developing and revising (as needed) policies and procedures to guide the Foundation. In my last column, I identified the many ways by which MNRS members (and those outside the Society) may contribute to our fundraising efforts. Any of the Trustees named below would be happy to respond to inquiries about the various support mechanisms, to answer any concerns or questions you may have related to our mission and to receive and communicate your ideas for making our activities more effective. So please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
