<abstract>
<p>In this article, we present a French adaptation and validation of the Adult Dispositional Hope Scale (ADHS). The sample was composed of 310 French adults. We found that the ADHS scores demonstrated good reliability as well as adequate temporal stability. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) supported a bifactorial structure of the scale. The two factors (agency and pathways) were highly correlated, but discriminant validity was established by comparing their shared variance against their average extracted variance. Multiple-group CFAs revealed evidence of configural, metric, scalar, and factorial invariance across genders. ADHS total scores as well as scores on agency and pathways were significantly and negatively related to hopelessness, negative affectivity, anxiety, and depressive mood and positively correlated with optimism and positive affect. We believe these findings show evidence for the construct validity of the ADHS.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112468315">Snyder et al. (1991)</xref> developed the theory and measures of the hope construct. The emergence of positive psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191112468315">Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000</xref>) propelled scientific interest in this construct because hope is considered as a psychological strength. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112468315">Snyder (2002)</xref>, hope is “the perceived capability to derive pathways to desired goals, and motivate oneself via agency thinking to use those pathways” (p. 249). Snyder’s theory of hope involves three interrelated cognitive components: goals, agency, and pathways. Goals are the core of the hope generating process because without desired goals, there are no hopeful thoughts. However, goals need to be sufficiently important to activate the desire to reach them. Pathways are cognitive routes for goal attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112468315">Snyder, 1994</xref>). People engage in pathway thinking when they plan ways to attain their desired goals. Agency thinking is the motivational component “Hope Theory,” defined as “the thoughts that people have regarding their ability to begin and continue movement on selected pathways” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112468315">Snyder et al., 1991</xref>, p. 180).</p>
<p>Snyder and his colleagues developed three scales to assess hope: the Adult Dispositional Hope Scale (ADHS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112468315">Snyder et al., 1991</xref>), the State Hope Scale (SHS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191112468315">Snyder et al., 1996</xref>), and the Children’s Hope Scale (CHS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191112468315">Snyder et al., 1997</xref>). The ADHS is an 8-item scale (plus four filler items) designed to evaluate agency thoughts (four items) and pathways thoughts (four items; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191112468315">Table 1</xref>). Respondents indicate their extent of agreement with each item using an 8-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = <italic>definitely false</italic> to 8 = <italic>definitely true</italic>. The ADHS has been used in many languages such as Dutch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191112468315">Brouwer, Meijer, Weekers, &amp; Baneke, 2008</xref>), Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191112468315">Chen, Shen, &amp; Li, 2009</xref>), and Japanese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112468315">Kato &amp; Snyder, 2005</xref>). There is no measure of hope in French, and the ADHS has never been adapted to the French population. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the French translation of the ADHS. We followed the guidelines for test translation and cross-cultural validation provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191112468315">Van de Vijver (2003</xref>; see also the International Commission Test guidelines on adapting tests: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.intestcom.org">www.intestcom.org</ext-link>). We then examined (a) reliability (i.e., both internal consistency and temporal stability), (b) the factor structure via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), (c) the measurement invariance of the ADHS across gender via multiple-group CFAs, and (d) construct validity. ADHS scores were expected to be positively and moderately related to positive affectivity and optimism and negatively related to negative affectivity, hopelessness, anxiety, and depressive mood.</p>

<title>Translation Procedure for the Adult Dispositional Hope Scale</title>
<p>Three bilingual postgraduate students independently translated the scale into French. Then the three independent translations were evaluated and amended by a committee composed of the two first authors of this study and one other psychologist. The resulting French version was then submitted to three other bilingual people for back-translation into English. Based on an examination of the back translations, it was concluded that only one item was problematic, so two French versions of this item were pretested on a small random sample, and the best one was chosen. The final version of the scale was pretested for clarity on a small random sample of adult subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 30). The scale was well received and participants did not report any problems in answering the items.</p>

<sec id="section3-1073191112468315">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample was composed of 310 (162 women, 148 men) adults. The average age was 27.88 years (range = 17-77 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.05) for women and 27.12 years (range = 17-55 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.85) for men. Most (61.5 %) were single, 32% married (or living together; 32.0%), 5.5% were divorced, and 1% were widowed. Of the 310 participants, 61% had some college education, which indicates that the sample was well educated. The sample was a convenience sample recruited from a mid-sized town in France (230,000 inhabitants). The instructions asked participants to fill in the questionnaire individually and seal it in the attached envelope. They were informed that the study was voluntary and anonymous.</p>

<title>Retest Reliability</title>
<p>A 3-week retest reliability measure among 58 students with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC; with its 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) was obtained using a one-way analysis of variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191112468315">Shrout &amp; Fleiss, 1979</xref>). The calculation of ICC produces a value between zero and one, with values closer to 1.00 indicating less error variance and stronger reliability. An ICC value of .7 or more is considered acceptable for retest reliability. The results revealed that the single ICC for the AHDS total scores was .80 (95% CI = .68, .88) and the average ICC was .89 (95% CI = .82, .94). The mean total scores for the first and second administrations were 45.51 (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.43) and 46.50 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.81), respectively. For the agency subscale, the single ICC was .78 (95% CI = .66, .86). The average agency scores from the first and second administrations were 23.12 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.12) and 23.36 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.57), respectively. For the pathways subscale, the single ICC was .61 (95% CI = .42, .75). The average scores from the first and second administrations were 23.17 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.26) and 22.39 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.34), respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1073191112468315">
<title>Dimensionality of the ADHS and Gender Invariance</title>
<p>CFA was used to evaluate the dimensionality of the ADHS. It was accompanied by bootstrap procedures to check for robustness of parameter estimates. CFA requires multivariate normality of the sample data distribution. Normality of the ADHS items was examined using the skewness and kurtosis scores. The results showed that univariate skewness scores were significant, except for two items; the univariate kurtosis score were also significant. Thus, the distribution’s multivariate normality was affected: Mardia’s coefficient was equal to 21.94, indicating significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) violation of normality. Consequently, we opted for the asymptotically distribution-free estimator (ADF) available in AMOS 18.00 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191112468315">Arbuckle, 2009</xref>) to assess the fit of the measurement model underlying the ADHS.</p>
<p>Two competing measurement models for the ADHS data were tested: (a) a single-factor model that assumes that dispositional hope is unidimensional and (b) a two-correlated-factor model. The two factors are agency, which hypothesized to account for the common variability among four items, and pathways, which was hypothesized to account for the common variability among the other four items.</p>
<p>The results for these measurement models are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191112468315">Table 1</xref>. The two-factor model fits the sample data better than the one-factor model. Standardized factor loadings and standard errors were generated via the bootstrap procedure with 1,000 bootstrap samples. Examination of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191112468315">Table 1</xref> shows that all the items loaded significantly on their respective factors, and they yielded coefficients of .40 or higher. The correlation between the two factors was strong, <italic>r</italic> = .78. The discriminant validity of the two factors was then assessed by comparing their shared variance (squared correlation) against their average variance extracted (AVE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112468315">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>). If the AVE for each factor is greater than their shared variance, discriminant validity is established. Our results revealed that the AVE values for agency (.61) and for pathways (.62) were more than their shared variance (.60). Thus, the discriminant validity of the two factors was supported, although weakly. The CI of the correlation between the two factors, obtained through the bootstrap procedure (.671, .883), did not include “1,” which provides further evidence of their discriminant validity.</p>
<p>Prior to testing for measurement invariance, we estimated the two-factor model for women and men separately. The results revealed a good model fit for both genders, with relatively equal model-fit statistics. Simultaneous analysis of measurement invariance was then performed. Four nested, increasingly restrictive models were tested: (a) the configural invariance, (b) the metric invariance, (c) the scalar invariance, and (d) the strict factorial invariance. The results showed the model containing all the measurement-invariance restrictions (the strict factorial invariance) fits well, χ<sup>2</sup>(59) = 78.08, <italic>p</italic> = .049, comparative fit index (CFI) = .96, root mean square of approximation (RMSEA) = .032, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .06. Moreover, this model did not degrade the goodness of fit relative to the preceding model, χ<sup>2</sup>(51) = 66.86, <italic>p</italic> = .000, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .032, SRMR = .059. Indeed, the chi-square difference was not significant when comparing the two nested models, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(8) = 11.22, <italic>ns</italic>.</p>

<title>Construct Validity</title>
<p>Total ADHS scores (as well as scores on agency and pathways) were significantly and negatively related to hopelessness (<italic>r</italic> = −.455, <italic>p</italic> = .000), negative affectivity (<italic>r</italic> = −.231, <italic>p</italic> = .000), anxiety (<italic>r</italic> = −.251, <italic>p</italic> = .000), and depressive mood (<italic>r</italic> = −.250, <italic>p</italic> = .000). Total hope scores were significantly and positively correlated with optimism (<italic>r</italic> = .408, <italic>p</italic> = .000) and positive affect (<italic>r</italic> = .391, <italic>p</italic> = .000). Respondents who reported more hope also reported more optimism and more positive affectivity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study is the first to evaluate the psychometric properties of the French version of the ADHS. Overall, the results support the psychometric properties of this scale in a French sample. Our measures of reliability indicated an adequate level of internal consistency as well as good temporal stability for the ADHS scores. These results are comparable with those obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112468315">Snyder et al. (1991)</xref>.</p>
<p>With respect to structural validity, our findings add further evidence to the body of studies confirming the bifactorial structure of the ADHS. Indeed, using a large multiethnic sample from the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191112468315">Roesch and Vaughn (2006)</xref> evaluated cross-ethnic measurement equivalence of the DHS. They concluded that the two-factor structure of Agency and Pathways is relatively stable and robust. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191112468315">Venning, Eliott, Kettler, and Wilson (2009)</xref> confirmed the existence of these two separate and related factors in an Australian sample. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112468315">Creamer et al. (2009)</xref> evaluated the psychometric properties of the DHS in injury survivors. Their results support the two-factor structure in this population. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191112468315">Abdel-Khalek and Snyder (2007)</xref> confirmed the two-factor structure in an Arabic-speaking sample, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191112468315">Chen et al. (2009)</xref> in a Chinese sample. In addition, our findings suggest that the strict invariant two-factor model of the ADHS fit the data fairly well for women and men. This means that (a) all important parameters of the measurement model were found to be equivalent across the genders, (b) the items in the French version of the ADHS were not prone to any gender bias, and (c) the scale has the same meaning and structure for different groups of respondents. Thus, one can conclude that any differences between groups can be interpreted as reflecting actual differences in dispositional hope rather than differences arising from measurement bias. Furthermore, research is therefore be needed to determine whether the ADHS is a culturally and gender-invariant measure.</p>
<p>Finally, our findings also supply further evidence for the construct validity of the ADHS. Indeed, dispositional hope was positively related to positive affect and optimism, supporting recent empirical findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191112468315">Wong <italic>&amp;</italic> Lim, 2009</xref>). It should be noted here that the relationship between hope and optimism was moderate. Their coefficient of alienation (unexplained variance/total variance) was .91, indicating that these are two very different personality constructs. Moreover, the pattern of correlations we found between the ADHS and other measures is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112468315">Snyder et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present findings argue for the ADHS as a measure providing valid and reliable scores for assessing dispositional hope. In addition, the psychometric properties of the ADHS revealed in the current study appear to be similar to that of Snyder’s original English version used in the United States. Thus, we are hopeful that this version will encourage cross-cultural research on this construct.</p>
