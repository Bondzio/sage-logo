<p>The United States has the most comprehensive policy regarding human trafficking in the world, and has allocated approximately eighty million dollars a year for the past decade toward the elimination of international trafficking. The edited volume <italic>From Human Trafficking to Human Rights</italic>, however, grows out of the authors’ collective frustration over the stalled progress in the discourse over and policies addressing international human trafficking, or slavery. While theoretically based on the “three-Ps” of trafficking—prevention, protection, and prosecution—U.S. policy and resources have been directed primarily to law enforcement intervention. Additionally, while domestic and international law recognizes all forms of trafficking, U.S. policy has effectively equated the broader definition of human trafficking with a narrower understanding, sex trafficking. This volume is divided in three sections, each articulating the shift in the discussion that the authors would like to see.</p>
<p>Part I, “From Sex to Slavery,” challenges the dominant notion in U.S. policy, that human slavery is synonymous with sex trafficking, by situating trafficking in current power structures as well as in its historical context. Part II, “From Prostitution to Power,” reframes the issue of trafficking from one of law enforcement to one of human rights. The authors contributing to this section expose the national- and international-level power structures, fears, and priorities that ultimately result in a failure to address major underlying causes of trafficking: inequality and powerlessness. Finally, Part III, “From Rescue to Rights,” calls for a reorientation of priorities away from securing borders and toward securing rights. This reorientation necessarily places more responsibility on sending countries to protect the rights of all their citizens, on receiving countries to shift from protection of borders to protection of victims within those borders, and the international community for engagement in the issue and solidarity with victims.</p>
<p>Best suited for graduate students and scholars interested in the intersections of trafficking, gender, inequality, history, human rights, and policy, the book’s engaging style and relative ease of understanding may also make it applicable to sophisticated undergraduates and the general public.</p>
