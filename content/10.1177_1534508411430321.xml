<abstract>
<p>Because math fact automaticity has been identified as a key barrier for students struggling with mathematics, we examined how initial math achievement levels influenced the path to automaticity (e.g., variation in number of attempts, speed of retrieval, and skill maintenance over time) and the relation between attainment of automaticity and gains in general math achievement. Findings indicated that most students did not meet the grade level recommendations for addition and subtraction identified by standards-setting organizations, but those that did were likely to achieve superior gains in math achievement, controlling for pretest scores. Relative to higher-achieving students, low-achieving students required more attempts to demonstrate automaticity, achieved automaticity later, and their speed of retrieval was lagging. Overall, low-achieving students were less likely to demonstrate fluent retrieval of math facts, but those that did also experienced particularly large gains in general math achievement.</p>

<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411430321">National Mathematics Advisory Panel (2008)</xref>, the ability to recall basic mathematics facts is critical for general success in mathematics. Deficits in accuracy and speed of fact recall are characteristics common both to students with low mathematics achievement and those classified as learning disabled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411430321">Garnett &amp; Fleischner, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411430321">Geary, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411430321">Jordan, Hanich, &amp; Kaplan, 2003</xref>). Automatic recall must be developed over time with sufficient instruction, practice, and feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508411430321">Baroody, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534508411430321">Willingham, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534508411430321">VanDerHeyden and Burns (2008)</xref> described the process as moving from acquisition (accuracy) to proficiency (speed). On the road to developing automatic recall, students often use a variety of procedures and strategies to generate responses. For instance, common strategies include verbal counting or using fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508411430321">Siegler &amp; Shrager, 1984</xref>). Once students have consistently demonstrated accuracy of a given set of facts, instructional strategies typically shift to improving speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534508411430321">Daly &amp; Martens, 1994</xref>). This model of fluency development is similar to reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508411430321">LaBerge &amp; Samuels, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>As with reading fluency, the benefits of math fact fluency are substantial. Some studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508411430321">Royer, Tronsky, Chan, Jackson, &amp; Merchant, 1999</xref>) have found math fact automaticity to be a predictor of performance on general mathematics achievement tests, even those that permit the use of calculators. Posed with increasingly challenging tasks, such as moving from single-digit to multi-digit problems, success will depend in part on the efficiency with which components of those tasks can be handled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411430321">Delazer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534508411430321">Whitehurst, 2003</xref>). Other research has sought to unpack the relation between general cognitive abilities and math performance. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411430321">Floyd, Evans, and McGrew (2003)</xref> discovered moderate relations between general long-term memory retrieval and performance on mathematics tests involving calculation and reasoning for students aged 6 through 8, though not after age 9. This suggests that problems with math fact retrieval may largely be domain-specific and are not consistently explained by general long-term memory difficulties.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411430321">National Mathematics Advisory Panel (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411430321">Common Core State Standards Initiative (2010)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411430321">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (2006)</xref> agree that the quick and accurate recall of math facts is a core skill and prerequisite for higher level learning. The National Mathematics Advisory Panel wrote that “Computational fluency with whole number operations is dependent on sufficient and appropriate practice to develop automatic recall of addition and related subtraction facts, and of multiplication and related division facts” (p. xix). Students struggling with mathematics can benefit from interventions involving increased practice to achieve improved fact accuracy, speed, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411430321">Burns, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411430321">Burns, Kanive, &amp; Degrande, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508411430321">Fuchs et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, writing on behalf of the What Works Clearinghouse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411430321">Gersten et al. (2009)</xref> noted, “Weak ability to retrieve arithmetic facts is likely to impede understanding of concepts students encounter with rational numbers” (p. 37). They recommended that interventions for students struggling with mathematics include frequent instruction and practice to strengthen fluent retrieval of math facts, with each session lasting approximately 10 minutes.</p>
<p>While there is seemingly universal agreement on the critical importance of math fact automaticity, there are differences among the leading associations as to exactly when it should be demonstrated. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411430321">National Mathematics Advisory Panel (2008)</xref> recommends that schools ensure fluent retrieval of addition and subtraction facts by the end of Grade 3. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411430321">Common Core State Standards Initiative (2010)</xref> recommends that students be able to know from memory the addition facts involving pairs of single-digit numbers by end of Grade 2, with the ultimate goal of being able to fluently perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division calculations (not necessarily all from memory) involving multidigit numbers by the end of Grade 5. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411430321">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (2006)</xref> recommends that by Grade 2, students demonstrate quick and accurate recall of addition and related subtraction facts. This article seeks to address the extent to which students are meeting the ambitious targets set by these three organizations, and whether there appears to be any benefit to meeting them, in terms of performance on an assessment of general mathematics achievement. To date no studies have investigated these questions using large, diverse samples of students.</p>

<title>Defining Math Fact Automaticity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1534508411430321">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>The prevailing definition of math fact automaticity is the ability to deliver a correct answer immediately from memory without conscious thought, as opposed to relying on a calculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411430321">Bloom, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411430321">Logan, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534508411430321">Willingham, 2009</xref>). Specific criteria used in the assessment of automaticity depend on many factors, including whether the stimulus is presented to the student verbally or in writing, and whether the student is asked to provide a response orally, in writing, or using a computer input device such as a mouse or keyboard. Criteria for timed responses vary between less than 1 second (following the stimulus) to 3 seconds (which could include time for a student to read the stimulus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411430321">Ashcraft, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411430321">Hasselbring, Goin, &amp; Bransford, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411430321">Isaacs &amp; Carroll, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534508411430321">Vos (2009)</xref> outlined a three-stage progression from “concept development” to “practice” (with recall rate of 3–4 seconds per fact) and finally to “automaticity,” defined as a recall rate of 2 to 3 seconds.</p>
<p>An important characteristic of students who demonstrate math fact automaticity, as opposed to those that have learned facts but cannot quickly or consistently retrieve them, is that they are much more likely to retain the information and apply it to novel or more advanced tasks at later points in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534508411430321">VanDerHeyden &amp; Burns, 2008</xref>). For example, in experiments conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508411430321">Singer-Dudek and Greer (2005)</xref>, students instructed on component skills in a manner that emphasized both speed and accuracy were better able to maintain related composite skills 2 months later relative to students that acquired the skills but did so without working toward automaticity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534508411430321">Wong and Evans (2007)</xref> found that students who practiced multiplication facts until they were automatic were able to demonstrate similar proficiency 4 weeks later. This paper seeks to contribute to the understanding of the extent to which at-risk and low-risk students are able to maintain automaticity over time.</p>

<title>Using MathFacts in a Flash to Assess Math Fact Automaticity</title>
<p>A computerized assessment referred to as MathFacts in a Flash (MFF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534508411430321">Renaissance Learning, 2003</xref>) offers an operational definition for math fact practice and automaticity. Using timed trials and multiple-choice questions, MFF assesses both the accuracy and speed of student retrieval of math facts involving numbers between 0 and 10 (addition and subtraction) and 0 to 12 (multiplication and division). MFF’s assessments are organized into 62 levels encompassing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squares, and conversions between fractions, decimals, and percents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1534508411430321">2</xref></sup> Some of the levels are dedicated to reviewing facts previously mastered<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1534508411430321">3</xref></sup> to ensure that automaticity has been maintained.</p>
<p>MFF generates Practices (typically 20 items, though the length can be adjusted) and Tests (40 items), both of which are timed. Because it is a hybrid practice and assessment tool, MFF has undergone psychometric review<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1534508411430321">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411430321">National Center on Response to Intervention [NCRTI], 2010a</xref>) and has been studied as a supplemental intervention designed to improve fact mastery, recall, and general mathematics achievement. In an initial review of MFF, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508411430321">Ysseldyke, Thill, Pohl, and Bolt (2005)</xref> employed a quasi-experimental design with 4,224 students in 163 classrooms. Students were assigned to two group conditions: A, where students used MFF from October to May (8 months), and B, in which students used MFF from January to May (5 months). Teachers were asked to provide 5 to 15 minutes of daily MFF sessions for students; however, there was a wide range of variability in actual MFF implementation. The dependent measure at the mid- and end-of-year comparison points was Renaissance Learning’s STAR Math (for detailed description, see Methods section). Results indicated that MFF could be used to monitor student mastery across 2 different time spans, half the school year and the entire school year. Comparisons of groups A and B suggested MFF led to increased mathematics ability at both the January and May time points. There was also an overall progress monitoring effect across Grades 1 to 8; students using MFF had greater achievement than the students without MFF monitoring. Time spent using MFF correlated with highest level mastered (<italic>r</italic> = .58) and levels mastered (<italic>r</italic> = .62), suggesting that practice with MFF facilitates math facts automaticity.</p>
<p>In a more recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411430321">Burns et al. (in press)</xref> investigated the extent to which regular practice with MFF (i.e., three times a week over 2–4 months) was beneficial for low-achieving students in Grades 3 and 4. As with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534508411430321">Ysseldyke et al. (2005)</xref>, Burns et al. also used STAR Math as the dependent measure. Relative to a control group that did not use MFF and controlling for pretest, the treatment group experienced greater rates of pre–post growth (effect sizes of <italic>d</italic> = 0.34 and <italic>d</italic> = 0.44 in Grades 3 and 4, respectively). A second analysis compared rates of growth for severely deficient MFF users (pretest scores at or below the 15th percentile) and at-risk MFF users (pretest scores between the 16th and 25th percentiles) and found no statistically significant differences. The third and final analysis examined the extent to which students in the at-risk group were able to move beyond the 25th percentile at posttest, finding statistically significant positive effects favoring treatment students in both grades.</p>

<sec id="section3-1534508411430321">
<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>Building on previous research, the current study used a database of MFF users to address questions pertaining to early numeracy development for low- and higher-achieving students. Specifically, to what extent have students achieved the math fact automaticity goals outlined by the National Mathematics Advisory Panel, Common Core State Standards Initiative, and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and were there benefits in terms of general math achievement gain for students who reached the goals? Furthermore, to what extent did the path to automaticity vary for low- and typically achieving students (in terms of overall likelihood of obtaining mastery, grade placement at time of mastery, number of attempts required, retrieval speed, and maintenance over time)? Finally, how did differences in initial student achievement affect relations between math fact automaticity and gains in general math achievement?</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample consisted of students in Grades 1 to 3 who used MFF during the 2009–2010 school year and took a STAR Math test at the beginning of the year. This resulted in a sample of 89,159 students from 50 states. The mean STAR Math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411430321">Renaissance Learning, 2002</xref>) pretest Normal Curve Equivalent<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1534508411430321">5</xref></sup> score was in the midrange (<italic>M</italic> = 44.61, <italic>SD</italic> = 21.00) and scores were normally distributed, with skewness of –0.80 (SE = 0.01) and kurtosis of –0.46 (SE = 0.02). Students were placed into 1 of 3 math performance categories based on the percentile rank (PR) of the STAR Math Pretest: severely deficient (PR 1–15), at risk (PR 16–30), and low risk (PR 31–99). Grouping according to initial PR resulted in 23% of the sample being categorized as severely deficient, 15% at risk, and 62% low risk (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508411430321">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>MathFacts in a Flash</title>
<p>MFF is a computerized assessment that uses timed trials and multiple-choice questions to assess both the accuracy and retrieval speed of math facts. It relies on a database of mathematical problems designed to provide intense practice of, and feedback on, constrained skills. Students can work in 62 narrowly defined levels, each with a virtually unlimited number of alternate forms made possible through the use of tightly controlled algorithms. For instance, Level 1 (Addition of 0, 1) involves the addition of 0 or 1 to numbers between 0 and 10. Level 21 is Subtraction Review 1, which includes subtraction of numbers between 0 and 10 from other numbers, 0 to 10. The MFF levels used in the present study are listed in tables summarizing results (e.g., <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534508411430321">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Using MFF, students can take Practices while working toward automaticity, and then take 40-item Tests to establish that they have achieved automaticity (i.e., “mastered” a level). The default criterion for mastery of each level is to score 100% correct on a Test in 2 minutes or less, though teachers can adjust the test time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534508411430321">Renaissance Learning, 2009</xref>). This translates into students having an average of 3 seconds per item to read the stimulus and use the mouse to select a response.</p>

<sec id="section8-1534508411430321">
<title>STAR Math</title>
<p>In addition to using MFF, students in the sample also completed an administration of a computer-adaptive multiple-choice measure of general mathematics achievement called STAR Math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411430321">Renaissance Learning, 2002</xref>) before mid-October. Using an item response theory approach and item bank of approximately 2,000 questions, STAR Math items are selected for each student based on prior responses. The test is timed, and students are given about 3 minutes per item. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508411430321">Salvia, Ysseldyke, and Bolt (2010)</xref> reviewed STAR Math and found it to be technically adequate, with generic and split-half reliabilities ranging from the high 0.70s to 0.80s. It was also favorably reviewed by NCRTI in both the progress monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411430321">2010b</xref>) and screening domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411430321">2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1534508411430321">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The large majority of students (86%) using MFF were able to master at least 1 level during the school year. For students who mastered at least one level, comparisons were made to explore mastery characteristics across the three student categories. Students in the low-risk category mastered more levels, and reached higher levels, than students in the at-risk category; and students in the at-risk category mastered more, and higher, levels than students in the severely deficient category, <italic>F<sub>Levels Mastered</sub></italic>(2, 77101) = 93601.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>F<sub>Max Level Mastered</sub></italic>(2, 77101) = 151731.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The default criterion for mastering a level is answering all test questions correctly in 2 minutes or less; however, teachers can adjust the time. There were small, but statistically significant, differences in the amount of time allowed; low-risk students were given the shortest test time, followed by at-risk students; and then severely deficient students, <italic>F</italic>(2, 89117) = 66.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534508411430321">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Overall MFF Use</title>
<p>Linear regression was conducted to explore the interactive effects of student category and MFF use (i.e., overall time) on growth in general math ability across the year (i.e., STAR Math NCE gain<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1534508411430321">8</xref></sup>). Contrast-coded variables were created to represent student category. One variable contrasted severely deficient and low-risk students (severely deficient coded 1, at risk coded 0, low risk coded –1); another variable contrasted at-risk and low-risk students (severely deficient coded 0, at risk coded 1, low risk coded –1). To control for differences in initial performance and duration between pretests and posttests, pretest NCE and the duration (days) between pretest and posttest were included in the model. The contrast-coded student category variables, MFF use (seconds), and the interaction terms were added, with posttest NCE as the outcome variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1534508411430321">9</xref></sup> The at-risk versus low-risk student category contrast was statistically significant (β = –.74, <italic>SE</italic> = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but was qualified by an interaction with MFF use (β = .45, <italic>SE</italic> = .19, <italic>p</italic> = .02). Increased MFF use was more beneficial for at-risk than low-risk students.</p>
<p>Additional analyses suggested that the number of MFF levels mastered<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1534508411430321">10</xref></sup> mediated the Student Category × MFF Use interaction. The same linear regression model with pretest NCE, duration, student category variables, MFF use, and the interaction terms for student category and MFF use was run with the number of levels mastered as the outcome variable. An interaction similar to what was observed for posttest NCE scores was observed for levels mastered; increased MFF use was more beneficial for at-risk students than low-risk students (<italic>β</italic> = 1.41, <italic>SE</italic> = .07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). A third linear regression predicted posttest NCE with pretest NCE, duration, student category variables, MFF use, the interaction terms, and levels mastered as predictors. Levels mastered remained a statistically significant predictor (β = .51, <italic>SE</italic> = .01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), whereas the Student Category × MFF Use interaction was no longer statistically significant (β = –.01, <italic>SE</italic> = .21, <italic>p</italic> = .96), suggesting that levels mastered mediated the interactive effect of student category and MFF use on posttest NCE scores (sobel test: <italic>z</italic> = 2.35, <italic>SE</italic> = .27, <italic>p</italic> = .02).</p>

<sec id="section14-1534508411430321">
<title>Mastery Stability</title>
<p>Dummy coded level mastery variables were created indicating whether students mastered each level (coded 1) or not (coded 0). The mastery variable, contrast-coded student category variables, and interaction terms were included in a logistic regression model with review attempt as the outcome variable (coded 1 for <italic>attempted</italic> and 0 for <italic>not attempted</italic>). A main effect of mastery emerged for every MFF level (βs ranging from 2.22 to 5.93, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001), indicating that mastery of individual levels significantly increased the likelihood of attempting a review level. The same model was run with review mastery as the outcome, and again a main effect of mastery emerged across MFF levels (βs ranging from 2.86 to 4.98, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001), indicating that mastery of individual levels increased the likelihood of mastering a review. The effects of level mastery were not moderated by student category, suggesting similar mastery stability regardless of whether students were in the low-risk, at-risk, or severely deficient category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1534508411430321">
<title>Grade-Level Recommendations</title>
<p>Analyses were also conducted to explore (1) the extent to which students are meeting the recommendation that students demonstrate automaticity in addition and subtraction by the end of Grade 2 or 3, (2) whether meeting the recommendation is moderated by student category, and (3) how meeting the recommendation relates to general math performance (i.e., STAR Math NCE gains). Two dummy-coded variables were created to indicate mastery in addition and subtraction (<italic>mastered</italic> coded as 1 and <italic>not mastered</italic> coded as 0). Students who mastered all the addition levels or an addition review level involving all addition facts were categorized as having mastered addition. Similarly, students who mastered all the subtraction levels or a review level involving all subtraction facts were categorized as having mastered subtraction.</p>
<p>For the entire sample of students, 39% of students mastered addition and 18% mastered subtraction. Considering Grade 2, 36% demonstrated automaticity of addition facts and 14% demonstrated automaticity with subtraction facts. In Grade 3, these percentages increase to 50 and 26, respectively. Logistic regression analyses for third-grade students indicated a student category effect for both addition (β = .69, <italic>SE</italic> = .01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and subtraction (β = .90, <italic>SE</italic> = .02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Low-risk students were most likely to achieve mastery, at-risk students were less likely, and severely deficient students were least likely.</p>
<p>A 2 (addition mastery) × 3 (student category) ANOVA revealed statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001) Addition Mastery × Student Category interactions for NCE gain scores for every grade, Grade 1: <italic>F</italic>(2, 9447) = 15.97, Grade 2: <italic>F</italic>(2, 25982) = 38.62, Grade 3: <italic>F</italic>(2, 31394) = 19.80. Mastering addition tended to lead to greatest NCE gains for severely deficient students, followed by at-risk students, and then by low-risk students (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1534508411430321">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The MFF program considers a fact “mastered” if the student demonstrates automaticity by meeting speed and accuracy criteria. The large majority of students (86%) were able to master at least one math facts level during the school year. However, the percentage of students meeting recommended operational goals was low. The National Mathematics Advisory Panel recommends that students demonstrate automaticity in addition and subtraction facts by third grade. On the basis of the third-grade sample, we estimate that at least 50% of students would meet the addition goal, and at least 26% would meet the subtraction goal. Because the Common Core and NCTM recommend automaticity with addition facts by end of Grade 2, we estimate that at least 36% would meet this more ambitious goal. These estimates are lower-bound because of the fact that the sample includes data from 1 year only; we do not know how many students would have met the recommendations in prior years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, trends emerged suggesting a problematic ongoing cycle for low-achieving students. Students in lower initial ability categories made less progress on mastering basic math facts during the year. Despite being given more time, severely deficient and at-risk students mastered fewer levels and were not able to master levels as high as low-risk students. When severely deficient and at-risk students achieved mastery, it was after more attempts, with longer test times, and occurred later in the school year compared to low-risk students. In mastering entire operations (e.g., additional and subtraction), severely deficient students were least likely to achieve overall mastery (particularly for subtraction); at-risk students were slightly more likely, and low-risk students most likely, to achieve mastery. In sum, many students were not on track to demonstrate automaticity in basic math facts at the recommended developmental goals. Severely deficient and at-risk students showed signs of continued struggling with math facts mastery, putting them at risk for falling increasingly further behind their classmates.</p>
<p>This finding regarding low-achieving students’ risk for continued academic decline is consistent with previous research in this area, such as that conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411430321">Jordan et al. (2003)</xref>. Controlling for IQ, Jordan et al. compared poor fact mastery students to grade-level fact mastery students. The two groups experienced the same rate of improvement across 2 years in assessments of general reading and mathematics achievement. However, the poor fact retrieval group performed at a much lower level, and the students with accuracy deficiencies experienced poor performance and growth on timed fact retrieval tasks.</p>
<p>These different rates, and characteristics, of mastery are consequential because automaticity of basic math facts was associated with favorable gains in general math ability (as measured by the STAR Math interim assessment). Our findings were consistent with extant theory and research highlighting the importance of students’ ability to automatically recall basic math facts in effective math education. Research identifying mechanisms underlying general math ability offers instructors a practical focus for enhancing math instruction. Teachers can feel confident that using tools such as MFF to build math fact automaticity can contribute significantly to improved general mathematics achievement.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that math facts practice pays off. Increased practice time seemed to be especially important for low-achieving students, suggesting a possible means for breaking the cycle of falling further behind with each year. Specifically, we found that spending more time working in the MFF program was associated with gains in general math ability, particularly for students in the at-risk category. Furthermore, a mediation model was supported, suggesting that at-risk students needed more time than low-risk students to master MFF levels, but experienced the same gains in general math ability as the low-risk group once they did master the levels. In other words, though it took more time and effort for low-PR students to achieve automaticity, doing so was associated with positive gains regardless of student category. These findings, combined with similar results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411430321">Burns et al. (in press)</xref>, suggest that MFF could be useful in a Response to Intervention framework as both a component of an intervention and a progress monitoring tool.</p>
<p>Analyses for overall mastery of addition and subtraction facts to 10 revealed a similar message: students in lower initial math achievement categories were less likely to achieve mastery, but the ones that did achieve mastery experienced the greatest benefit. Specifically, student category moderated the likelihood of mastering each operation, with severely deficient students being least likely, at-risk being more likely, and low-risk being most likely to achieve mastery. For both addition and subtraction, mastery was associated with statistically significant improvement in general math performance across the school year. However, the greatest improvements in general math performance were observed for severely deficient students who achieved mastery, followed by at-risk students, and then by low-risk students.</p>
<p>Additionally, mastery was stable across time regardless of student category. In general, mastering a MFF basic skill level increased the likelihood of attempting a review level. For students who did attempt a review, mastering a basic skill level also predicted an increased likelihood of mastering the review, regardless of student level.</p>
<sec id="section17-1534508411430321">
<title>Implications for Practice and Further Research</title>
<p>Perhaps the most consequential finding from this study is the documentation that not enough students are reaching the recommended goals for automaticity of addition and subtraction facts. This finding suggests that changes need to be made with the focus of helping students reach these goals. This should serve as an alarm for more focus on promoting overall progress (which will require effective interventions) for these subjects at these ages. Though not randomly selected, our sample of students was considerable in size (almost 90,000) and scope (50 states represented). Though there may be selection bias, in that students who use MFF differ from the general population in some important way, all evidence to date suggests that the program is used widely and in diverse settings.</p>
<p>Mastering basic math skills at the appropriate ages is important for laying the foundation for future math education. Without being able to add and subtract with ease, third-graders will be limited in what progress they are able to achieve in other areas. The cycle of low-achieving students falling farther and farther behind may become more difficult to break as students get older. If students have not mastered addition and subtraction by third grade, they may be even less likely to master math facts in the future, and with less benefit once they do. Perhaps increased awareness and the increased availability of practice and assessment tools such as MFF will help teachers be more accurate in estimating student skill and progress, enable more effective intervention, and increase the likelihood that deficits in math fact mastery will not be a barrier to more advanced learning.</p>
<p>Our findings also suggest that instructors should use an RTI framework to adjust their expectations and interventions to student ability. In particular, our results emphasized the importance of building in extra time for practice. Time spent practicing with MFF was positively related to gains in general math ability, and was especially important for severely deficient students. Instructors and learners should be prepared for severely deficient students to require more time than low-risk students to master math facts. However, once mastery is achieved, results should be similar, if not more favorable, for severely deficient students compared to their peers.</p>
<p>Beyond timing and planning, there will be motivational issues to consider when working with low-achieving students on building fact automaticity. An explicit focus on persistence could be especially important for struggling students. Because they have to put in more time and effort to experience the same progress as low-risk students, students in lower initial math achievement categories are more likely to become discouraged. A recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411430321">Gersten et al., 2009</xref>) indicated praising low-achieving students for both their efforts and achievements is an effective strategy and should be part of any intervention. Though no motivational measures were included in our study, the findings regarding low-achieving students are in keeping with Gersten et al.’s conclusion that “Praising students for their effort and for being engaged as they work through mathematics problems is a powerful motivational tool that can be effective in increasing students’ academic achievement” (p. 44). It may be encouraging for both students and teachers to be armed with the knowledge that it will take low-achieving students longer to achieve automaticity but that additional practice is “normal” for this group and can have extremely favorable effects.</p>
<p>Finally, our sample was advantageous in that it summarized the typical use of a math facts learning tool by a large number of students across the United States. Though a useful sample, it was observational in nature and the lack of experimental control is problematic. We were not able to manipulate variables, meaning that we are limited in drawing conclusions about causation. We have limited information about potentially important factors, meaning that our findings do not account for variables known to impact gains in math performance, such as instructional strategies or student demographics. Future research should extend the current observational findings in more controlled settings and with a variety of math facts teaching tools.</p>

<p>NCRTI judged STAR Math to have convincing evidence supporting its technical adequacy as Progress Monitoring measure in all nine categories, including a number of reliability and validity indicators as well as evidence of sensitivity to student growth. It also found STAR Math to have convincing evidence in all five Screening categories, including generalizability, reliability, validity, disaggregated reliability and validity for diverse student populations, and accuracy in classifying students according to risk status.</p>
