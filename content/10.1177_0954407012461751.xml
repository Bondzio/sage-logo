<abstract>
<p>Industrial brake lining materials are composite with complex formulations consisting of multiple constituents. Resulting from the fabrication process, the morphology and distribution of the constituents have significant influences on the future properties and braking performance. In this study, an in-depth analysis ranging from the microscale to the macroscale was performed to assess the relationships between the microstructure, the mechanical properties and the braking performance of an industrial brake lining material formulated for heavy vehicles. It was observed that the manufacturing process had different effects on the morphology and size of constituents and on their distribution in the phenolic binder. The morphologies of large organic particles such as rubber and graphite were affected by the mixing procedure, contrary to those of fibres and mineral particles. A transverse anisotropy consistent with fibre orientation due to cold preforming and hot moulding was observed. The microstructure displayed a strong local heterogeneity right up to the mesoscopic scale at which friction and wear mechanisms typically occur. The mechanical properties were analysed with regard to the heterogeneity of the microstructure to determine the scale at which these properties could be considered to be associated with a homogenised behaviour. The rubbing surface after braking showed that load-bearing localisation depends on the nature, morphology and orientation of constituents but that this heterogeneity can be of interest with regard to the braking ability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Braking is a fundamental safety feature of vehicles that enables control of their motion and bringing them to rest in a predictable manner. In disc or drum brakes, this feature is provided by the frictional contact between the two brake components. In general, the disc or drum is made of grey cast iron while the lining is composed of an organic matrix composite material that may be referred to as being organic, metallic or semimetallic, depending on the relative amounts of metallic elements in the formulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407012461751">1</xref></sup> Brake lining composite materials are known for their microstructural heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407012461751">2</xref></sup> and a phenolic resin is usually used as a binder as it has a relatively good thermal resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407012461751">3</xref></sup> Lining materials must possess an adequate combination of physicochemical, mechanical, thermal and tribological properties contributing to provide the right response to the mechanical and heat stresses generated during braking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407012461751">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407012461751">5</xref></sup> These properties result from their formulation and manufacturing process. Several studies have focused on the effects of these two aspects on the braking performance. Some of these were based on experimental design and neural networks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407012461751">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407012461751"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407012461751"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407012461751"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407012461751">10</xref></sup> Other comparative studies were interested in the impact of certain constituents on the performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407012461751">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407012461751"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407012461751"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407012461751"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012461751"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407012461751"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407012461751">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the friction-induced energy dissipated during braking leads to thermomechanical stresses and deformation of the contact surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407012461751">18</xref></sup> As a consequence the occurrence of localised load-bearing areas was noted,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954407012461751">19</xref></sup> which had a considerable effect on the friction and wear mechanisms. Load-bearing areas occur and develop around the larger constituents of the lining material and form flat plates through third-body accumulation and compaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407012461751">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954407012461751">21</xref></sup> The distribution in load bearing inevitably depends on the composition and distribution of the constituents in the lining matrix. It has been mentioned in the literature that the constituent dispersion is one of the most important characteristics of lining materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954407012461751">22</xref></sup> Thus, braking-induced phenomena are strongly dependent on the local properties, which are related to the material microstructure and the specific effect of each constituent.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be concluded that the performance of brake lining materials depends on the volume and the surface properties related to the microstructure. However, few studies have been devoted to the relationships between the microstructure and the performance of brake lining materials. This article aims at a better understanding of such relationships in the case of an industrial organic brake lining material manufactured for heavy vehicles. To achieve this, compression, indentation and braking tests are carried out and the results were analysed with regard to the heterogeneous microstructure of the material resulting from the formulation and manufacturing process.</p>

<title>Material composition</title>
<p>The material under study was an organic matrix composite manufactured for linings of drum brakes for heavy vehicles. This material consists of several constituents in particle and fibre form, of sizes ranging from micrometric to millimetric dimensions, incorporated within a phenolic resin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407012461751">Table 1</xref>). Each constituent introduced into the formulation contributes in its own way to the overall physical, mechanical, thermal and tribological properties. These constituents may be classified according to their main role in the mechanical and tribological behaviours of the brake lining. Thus, the following categories may be identified: binder, fibres, fillers, abrasives, lubricants and friction modifiers.</p>

<p>A morphological analysis of the constituents was carried out. This is useful for the development of a detailed database containing descriptions of each constitutive element of the material being studied, in terms of the shape and size, with a view to establishing correlations with the friction mechanisms related to the localised contact phenomena occurring during braking. All the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations of the raw constituents before mixing are available in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0954407012461751">Appendix 1</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0954407012461751">
<title>Material-manufacturing process and the influence of mixing on the morphologies and sizes of the constituents</title>
<p>The process by which the material was made consisted of mixing, cold preforming (where a parallelepipedic mould was filled by applying pressure in successive strikes) and hot moulding (which took 18 min at a curing temperature of 150 °C under pressure and, finally, post-curing of the plate in a furnace at 160 °C for 10 h). The manufacturing process ended with a series of finishing operations to yield a flat plate with a surface area of 400 mm × 400 mm and a thickness of 16 mm.</p>
<p>Mixing of the constituents can influence the morphology, notably through the shearing action of the mixer’s cutting blades and the rubbing action between particles and fibres. A post-mixing analysis of the shapes and sizes of the constituents was performed using SEM.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the observations show that the morphologies of the components that existed in the form of mineral and organic powdery particles hardly changed at all. They underwent very few changes and occasionally retained their agglomerate form, quite similar to that observed in the raw materials prior to mixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012461751">Figure 1(a)</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012461751">(c)</xref>). On the other hand, the morphologies and sizes of some particles of graphite, coke and rubber were affected by the mixing, becoming smaller with respect to their initial dimensions. These particles, which are rich in carbon, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012461751">Figure 1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012461751">(c)</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The rock fibres were hardly affected by the mixing process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012461751">Figure 1(d)</xref>). The shots maintained their spherical form and the small fibres experienced very little shearing. The cellulose fibres were scattered and retained their millimetric dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012461751">Figure 1(e)</xref>). Occasionally, some cellulose fibre agglomerates were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012461751">Figure 1(f)</xref>). The glass fibres that were added towards the end of the mixing were barely modified. They were lightly scattered and either retained their initial length or underwent very slight fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012461751">Figure 1(g)</xref>). They remained grouped together as bundles of parallel fibres, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012461751">Figure 1(h)</xref>.</p>
<p>It may be therefore concluded that the mixing process had little impact on the morphologies of glass and rock fibres as well as those of powdery mineral particles. The main effect was revealed on the organic particles.</p>

<title>Mesoscopic-scale heterogeneity and distribution of the constituents</title>
<p>In order to characterise the diversity of the microstructure on the millimetric scale (which is considered as a mesoscopic scale), many observations were carried out using SEM and optical microscopy. The distribution of constituents observed after the manufacturing process reveals a highly heterogeneous microstructure. The presence of a multitude of constituents of different shapes and sizes concords with the observations of the mixture prior to moulding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407012461751">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The optical observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407012461751">Figure 2</xref> correspond to various zones of the surface of brake lining material presented on the same scale for easier comparison. On this particular scale, the material seems to be highly heterogeneous in some regions in view of the wide variety of large particles such as carbonaceous particles (rubber, graphite and coke) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407012461751">Figure 2(b)</xref>), agglomerates of mineral particles (chalk or barite) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407012461751">Figure 2(c)</xref>), bundles of parallel glass fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407012461751">Figure 2(d)</xref>) or shots derived from mineral fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407012461751">Figure 2(e)</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Given the manufacturing process of the plate, the distribution and orientation of constituents within the phenolic resin were studied in order to assess the amount of material anisotropy. Samples were taken in the transverse and normal directions with respect to the plane of the plate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012461751">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012461751">4</xref> allow us to compare the microstructural differences between these two directions. The most noticeable difference has to do with the fibre orientation, especially those of the glass fibre bundles of millimetric dimensions. An inspection in the normal direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012461751">Figure 3(b)</xref>) reveals that fibre bundles that are visible at the surface (indicated by the dashed ellipses) are preferentially oriented lengthwise, but no preferential orientation is observed in the plane of the plate. In the transverse direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012461751">Figure 4(b)</xref>), the fibre bundles are cut crosswise. Thus, the parallel orientation of the fibre bundles was presumably induced by the striking action of the press during the cold preforming of the plate, and subsequently by the hot moulding that was also performed under pressure. Therefore, it may be concluded that there was transverse anisotropy in the microstructure of the brake lining material that may lead to the differences between the properties in the sliding and normal directions of the contact area.</p>

<title>Heterogeneity analysis of a plate of brake lining material with regard to its mechanical properties</title>
<sec id="section8-0954407012461751">
<title>Indentation tests</title>
<p>The aim of these indentation tests was to analyse the degree of uniformity in the material’s mechanical properties on the scale of an entire plate of brake lining material. It is expected to determine a scale at which these properties could be considered as being representative of a homogenised behaviour in view of the heterogeneous microstructure.</p>
<p>Owing to the complex composition and microstructure of the material, a Brinell indenter measuring 12.7 mm in diameter was selected and a total load of 680 N was applied at a loading speed of 0.5 mm/min. The choice of the indenter diameter and the load is a compromise between the number of local measurements, the size of the analysed surface and the sensitivity to various constituents.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012461751">Figure 5</xref> shows the positions of the indentation measurements on the plate. Because of the symmetry of the plate-manufacturing process, our analysis was reduced to an eighth of the plate indicated by the white dashed triangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012461751">Figure 5(a)</xref>. Seven measurement zones were investigated according to their location on the plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012461751">Figure 5(b)</xref>). In each zone, nine measurements, which were equally spaced within a square area of 12 mm × 12 mm, were taken on each of the two sides of the plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012461751">Figure 5(c)</xref>). It should be recalled at this point that only the upper side of the plate was affected by degassing cycles during hot moulding.</p>

<p>The results are represented by load–indentation depth curves. An example of a set of nine curves for each zone and side is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407012461751">Figure 6</xref>. Some response variability may be observed in these curves for both the upper side and the lower side. This variability can be correlated with the heterogeneity of the lining’s microstructure and the randomly dispersed millimetric constituents, which were of the same order of magnitude as the indentation imprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407012461751">Figure 6(c)</xref>). Analysis of the post mortem microstructure was not carried out in this case with regard to the number of indentation imprints and the complexity of the industrial formulation. It will be of interest to realise such investigations with simplified formulations.</p>

<p>The parameter that was chosen to evaluate the homogeneity in mechanical behaviour among the various zones analysed was the indentation energy. The indentation energy, corresponding to the area under the curve, was evaluated for each set of measurements using the trapezium rule. A maximum load of 600 N was considered for this estimation in order to avoid potential servomechanism problems related to the machine response towards the end of a test, when approaching the final target load. STATISTICA software was then used to process the data through a Levene test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests with a threshold of 5% to evaluate the equality of variances and the equality of mean values respectively for the various zones studied on each side of the plate.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012461751">Figure 7</xref> shows the mean indentation energy values obtained as well as the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for each zone and each side that was analysed. These qualitative results were obtained by carrying out the Levene test, which yielded <italic>p</italic> values of 0.70 and 0.78 for the tests performed on the lower side and the upper side respectively. This allowed us to conclude that the variances were uniform. In summary, even though the microstructure was locally heterogeneous, the degree of heterogeneity remained the same for all locations on each side of the plate. This finding subsequently allowed us to carry out an ANOVA test on the mean values of the indentation energies obtained for the various positions on each side. For the upper side, the <italic>p</italic> value obtained was 0.008, which led us to conclude that at least one of the mean values for one of the zones was different from the others; an inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012461751">Figure 7(a)</xref> suggests that this corresponds to zone 2. Another ANOVA test that excluded this zone enabled us to verify this hypothesis; it yielded a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.33, which is higher than 0.05 and therefore allows us to conclude that all other zones may be considered as being equivalent in average terms. In summary, apart from zone 2, the plate may be considered to be homogeneous in terms of indentation testing if we consider the averaged results for each zone, with a similar degree of heterogeneity at the local level. For the lower side, the <italic>p</italic> value is close to 0, which also allows us to conclude that at least one of the mean values obtained for one of the zones is different from the others. In comparison with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012461751">Figure 7(a)</xref>, an inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012461751">Figure 7(b)</xref> allows us to note that the averages are slightly more scattered among the various zones, albeit with occasional overlaps between the various confidence intervals. It is harder to exclude any particular zone to conduct another ANOVA test. For example, if we exclude zone 7 corresponding to the highest mean value, the resulting <italic>p</italic> value is 0.002, which once again leads to the conclusion that there is at least one mean value that differs from the others in the remaining six zones. A similar analysis whereby zones 7 and 2 are excluded yields a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.004, indicating that there is yet again at least one mean value that differs from the others in the remaining five zones. To sum up, it is not possible to conclude any homogeneity of the lower side of the plate from these indentation measurements, even though locally speaking, the degree of heterogeneity is similar among all the zones that were analysed. In addition, it is interesting to note that, if we gather all the results for each side while excluding the analysis of zone 2 for the upper side and that of zone 7 for the lower side, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012461751">Figure 7(c)</xref>, we may observe that the mean values are equal and the variances are uniform, thereby confirming both the Levene test and the ANOVA tests, which give <italic>p</italic> values of 0.88 and 0.73 respectively.</p>

<p>Compression tests for the mechanical characterisation of the brake lining material were performed at room temperature. Test specimens were machined in the normal and transverse directions. Five measurements were made in each direction. Tests were performed with a preload of 0.5 N. The specimens were cylindrical with a diameter of 14 mm and a height of 16 mm.

<p>One of the first observations that can be made from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012461751">Figure 8</xref> is that the measurements for both the transverse direction and the normal direction show good repeatability. Compared with indentation tests, the smaller amount of scatter in the results on the scale of the entire plate can be attributed to the larger volume employed during the compression tests. Indeed, for an area of similar magnitude, namely a 154 mm<sup>2</sup> circular section in the case of a compression test and a 144 mm<sup>2</sup> (12 mm × 12 mm) area in the case of an indentation test, only the near surface of the plate is solicited for the latter mechanical test whereas the entire thickness is utilised for the compression test. The compression test results are therefore less sensitive to the heterogeneity of the microstructure and a unit volume of approximately 1 cm<sup>3</sup> seems to be representative of the entire plate in terms of evaluation of the material’s bulk mechanical properties.</p>
<p>Another observation that can be made is that all the compression tests, whether for transverse or for normal specimens, followed a dual-gradient stress–strain variation, which led us to distinguish between two different stages, namely domains 1 and 2. Domain 1 for strains less than 1% displays a low gradient, whereas domain 2 for strains greater than 1% shows a higher gradient. The change in gradient may be attributed to a change in the material porosity, which probably decreased progressively at the start of compression loading (domain 1). Up to a stress of 10 MPa and a strain of 1.5%, the closing of pores resulted in a steeper slope. It should also be noted that the specimen machined in the transverse direction was more rigid than that produced in the normal direction, leading to a higher modulus in the transversely machined specimens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954407012461751">Table 2</xref>). Based on our microstructural observations, especially those of the material’s fibres, the difference in rigidity may be explained by a preferential orientation of the composite fibres, most notably those of millimetric dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012461751">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012461751">4</xref>). For the upper curves corresponding to the compression tests of the specimen taken in the transverse direction, the fibres were oriented parallel to the compressive stress. For the lower curves, corresponding to specimens taken in the normal direction, the fibres were oriented perpendicular to the compressive stress. The entire compression curve was used to demonstrate the presence of material anisotropy, via the various mechanical properties shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954407012461751">Table 2</xref>. However, in practical braking conditions, the pressure applied to a brake lining material does not usually exceed 10 MPa, in which case the material may be characterised in terms of the mechanical properties corresponding to domain 1.</p>
<p>The mechanical behaviour of this brake lining material shows that it is more flexible in the normal direction, which reflects its ability to accommodate deformation in this direction, thereby preventing contact localisation and leading to homogeneous heat generation in the friction interface during braking. The higher rigidity in the transverse, i.e. sliding, direction enhances the mechanical behaviour of the material by improving its response to friction-induced stresses.</p>

<title>Impact of the heterogeneity and the distribution of the constituents on the friction surface and load-bearing localisation</title>
<p>The braking test was conducted using a pad-on-disc braking tribometer developed to produce, on a reduced scale, several types of vehicles braking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954407012461751">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954407012461751"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954407012461751">25</xref></sup> The pad has an angular sector shape of 68 mm in length with a width of 16 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012461751">Figure 9(a)</xref>). Its thickness is 16 mm and its friction area is 1100 mm<sup>2</sup> which covers one ninth of the rubbing track of the disc. The grey cast-iron disc had a mean friction radius of 100 mm, a friction track of 17 mm width and 22 mm thickness. The sizes and shapes of the pad and the disc correspond to compromises with regard to the actual disc-brake friction parts. They lead to stresses which differ from those experienced at full scale. However, the sizes are sufficient for the heterogeneity of the microstructure and the phenomena of load-bearing localisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954407012461751">26</xref></sup> The reduced-scale braking test has been defined with respect to similitude rules related to and scale shifting with regard to heat transfer and a rise in the temperature, allowing simulation on reduced-scale braking situations to be observed on the actual scale.

<p>A stop-braking test was carried out with an initial sliding velocity of 22 m/s and an apparent pressure applied on the pad of 0.6 MPa. Such conditions lead to braking with a moderate dissipated energy and a maximum surface temperature of 150 °C measured 2 mm from the surface of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012461751">Figure 9(b)</xref>). The evolution of the friction factor is also presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012461751">Figure 9(b)</xref>. It shows a stable evolution during braking with an average value of around 0.23. During braking, the discs and linings are significantly affected, especially by heat, leading to load-bearing localisation and a reduced contact area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012461751">Figure 9(c)</xref>). Indeed, braking generates severe thermomechanical distortions induced by thermal gradients that deform the bodies in contact, leading to the formation of hot bands and hot spots in the most extreme cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954407012461751">27</xref></sup> Then, powers locally dissipated are responsible for wear and degradation of the friction material. In this case, a hot band characterizes the beginning of braking (infrared thermography at 1.7 s). It migrates in the friction track and progresses with the appearance of circumferential thermal gradients (infrared thermography at 7.7 s). Despite the heterogeneity of the multi-constituent brake lining material and the load-bearing localisation on the reduced contact area scale at which friction and wear mechanisms operate, this material present an adequate and stable friction factor. The transverse anisotropy in the composite material, which was more flexible in the normal direction with respect to the plane of the plate, could be of interest with regard to the brake lining’s ability to ensure proper contact during braking.</p>
<p>It is known that secondary flat plates of a third body are formed and developed on the surface of the brake lining materials by trapping powder on the constituents and compaction of these powders under the effect of the normal pressure, the tangential stress and the frictional heat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954407012461751">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954407012461751">29</xref></sup> These secondary flat plates bear the load.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954407012461751">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954407012461751">30</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012461751">Figure 10(a)</xref> shows the mesoscopic scale distribution of the third body generated after braking.

The majority of particles rich in carbon which appear as dark grey remain totally or partially uncovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012461751">Figure 10(a)</xref>). However, they show traces of sliding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012461751">Figure 10(b)</xref>). Thus, they contribute to friction but the third body does not adhere to it.

<p>The rockwool fibres and shots contribute to the formation of the bearing surface by forming the primary support for the development of the secondary plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012461751">Figure 10(c)</xref>). The glass fibres are often found as packages embedded in the matrix. Their behaviour with regard to the load-bearing mechanisms activated at the rubbing surface depends on their orientation in the brake lining. Oriented parallel to the sliding plane or slightly inclined in the matrix, fibres emerge from the rubbed surface, appearing mostly not covered with compacted third body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012461751">Figure 10(d)</xref>). They do not form primary plates or do not serve as support for the formation of plates of the third body. They seem to act as obstacles to extension of the bearing plate regardless of their orientation relative to the direction of sliding. Conversely, when oriented normal to the sliding plane, glass fibres behave as rockwool shots. They appear flattened and surrounded by compacted third body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012461751">Figure 10(e)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012461751">(f)</xref>). Finally, load-bearing localisation is greatly influenced by the mesoscopic and microscopic heterogeneity of the brake lining material and its anisotropy with regard to the constituent size, distribution and orientation. This heterogeneity introduces the elements necessary for the development of the third body on the overall rubbed surface, allowing the accommodation of speed and ensuring the stability of the friction factor during the braking test. Acting on the size and morphology of the constituents as well as on the manufacturing process, in particular for the mixing, cold-preforming and hot-moulding stages, should allow optimisation of the brake lining microstructure with regard to the friction mechanisms activated in braking.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The performance of brake lining materials depends on their properties related to the microstructure resulting from their formulation and manufacturing process. Additionally, during braking, these materials are subjected to very severe local stresses which vary strongly within the microstructure. Thus, understanding the relationships between their microstructure, mechanical properties and tribological behaviours on different scales is particularly important for understanding the role of each constituent in the friction and wear mechanisms.</p>
<p>Characterising the morphologies, sizes and distributions of the constituents at different stages in the manuacturing process enabled the effect of this process on the material’s microstructure and properties to be understood better. Analysis of the mixture showed that constituents that were initially in the form of mineral and organic powdery particles, with sizes no greater than 50 µm, were well dispersed and that their morphologies were hardly affected by the mixing process. Conversely, the mixing did have an influence on the morphologies and sizes of larger particles such as graphite, coke or rubber. As for fibres, and in particular the glass fibres introduced in bundles towards the end of mixing, the industrial mixing process did not alter either their morphologies or their sizes.</p>
<p>Investigations showed a heterogeneous microstructure that was more or less effective depending on the scale involved with regard to mechanical tests on the scales being studied. Indeed, the effect of the heterogeneity of the microstructure is reflected in the local variability recorded in the indentation measurements. Nevertheless, a statistical analysis performed on these measurements allowed us to conclude that, when considering zones of centimetric dimensions, and therefore on the macroscopic scale, the plate can be said to exhibit uniform mechanical behaviour. This result is consistent with the good repeatability of the compression test results. The distribution of the constituents in the phenolic resin throughout the entire plate was studied by considering the normal and transverse directions. It should be noted that the cold-preforming and hot-moulding procedures performed under a uniaxial pressure had the effect of orienting the glass fibres within the plane of the plate. The compression tests also demonstrated the presence of transverse anisotropy explained by the orientation of the fibres. The results of the compression tests showed that the material was more flexible in the normal direction. Then, a hypothesis can be suggested which leads to interest in this anisotropy with regard to the brake lining’s ability to ensure better contact during braking.</p>
<p>Braking tests and SEM observations of rubbing surface allowed us to hypothesise on the influence of constituents in the heterogeneity of the brake lining material and its anisotropy and on the dependence of the brake ling material on the natures, morphologies and orientations of the constituents, as was the case with glass fibres. The ability of these latter to form primary plates and to participate in load bearing depends on their orientation in the binder. A compromise between the mechanical properties caused by orientation of the glass fibres and their behaviour towards load bearing could be considered.</p>
<p>Examination of the microstructure of the indentation zones also could be of interest to detect a relationship between the actual microstructure and the indentation energy. However, among the difficulties inherent in attempts to improve the performance related to the understanding of the relationships between the microstructure, the properties and the braking behaviour is the complexity of the industrial formulations such as thoset studied in this paper. Development of simplified formulations in future work, containing a limited number of constituents, could be a way to ensure better investigation of the suggested hypothesis.</p>
