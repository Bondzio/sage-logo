<p>This book is an illuminating excavation of the many small struggles, step-by-step appropriations and forgotten dispossessions that form the backstory to New York City’s current ‘crisis of authenticity’. This crisis, argues Zukin, affects many world cities today and is manifest in an endless competition to out-invest each other in displays of homogenous ‘McGuggenization’. The book shows how in the case of New York these corporate urban landscapes embrace two contradictory visions – the urban village of Jane Jacobs and the corporate global city of Robert Moses. These are two sides of the same story of city elites’ relentless pursuit of development and wealth over the past century. In locations once derelict and now gentrified – including East Village, Williamsburg and Harlem – Zukin’s painstaking research shows how authenticity – ‘the <italic>look</italic> and <italic>feel</italic> of a place as well as the social connectedness it inspires’ (p. 220) – is always at stake in struggles over urban space and its symbolic and material ownership. Ultimately, it is exposed here as a ‘lever of cultural power for a group to claim space and take it away from others’ (p. 246).</p>
<p><italic>Kairos</italic> is the Greek word for ‘a sense of the past that intrudes into and challenges the present’ (p. 101). Zukin documents how it is essential to the vision of an authentic and romanticised historic urban village which, by offering a bohemian alternative, itself lubricates the wheels of the high-rise corporate city. The changing fortunes of local stores, with independent, locally based retailers losing out to chains in high-end newly fashionable zones, or to independent selective venues owned by outsiders with resources to invest in more rarefied up-and-coming areas such as East Village, add up to much more than just an economic story. What fascinates Zukin, as in her previous books, is how the local ‘character’ that draws so many people to a neighbourhood is built through a self-fulfilling process fuelled by successive waves of middle-class experience-seekers: eating, drinking, talking, dancing and above all shopping their way to new ‘creative’ lifestyles and aspirations. However, they do so in a process that pulls the economic rug from under the feet of the same long-established and working-class inhabitants whose small-scale record shops and ‘mom and pop’ stores underpinned the place’s vibe in the first place.</p>
<p>The book’s fine-tuned analyses capture how a neighbourhood’s identity as locus for the happening ‘hipperati’ depends, or teeters, on a confluence of factors, like the cube sculpture balancing impossibly on its corner in East Village’s Astor Place. An area’s ‘interest’ or culture is always shifting, at any one time intricately bound up with the fortunes of a particular mix of past and present influences, older inhabitants and newcomers, working-class residents and gentrifiers, which create conditions for unusual stores to thrive, independent clubs and galleries to open and ethnic restaurants to prosper. However, these exact a price in terms of who gains and who loses. In East Village for instance, the current eclecticism and sociability of the area relies on the staying power of poorer residents in (rapidly contracting) rent-controlled apartments, living cheek by jowl with more affluent incomers who pay 10 times the rent and have money in their pockets to do ‘distinctive shopping’. However, as rents continue to be deregulated and smaller shops and poorer residents move out, the bedrock of street and edgy culture on which depends the area’s bohemian atmosphere erodes. At the moment there is ‘a balancing point between class worlds on which it, like the Astor Cube, is tenuously perched’ (p. 114).</p>
<p>The focus of the book is on the details of changes in consumption-oriented facilities and attractions; where you live and what you do in your leisure time. Hence, what Zukin pays attention to are shifts in urban <italic>identity</italic> in terms of food, cafes, restaurants, shopping and (to a lesser extent) artists, musicians, art galleries and museums, continuing her long-established interest in the symbolic economy of loft-living and lifestyle. She has a keen eye for the balance sheet of power and resources that shapes the cultural terrains of neighbourhoods as they move up and down in the endless monopoly game of urban winners and losers. The critique she makes of the city’s removal of the poor is a zero sum game in which the losses they experience are the pay off for the middle classes, a game defined primarily in terms of cultural and consumption gains: who gets to live where and whose culture predominates? The middle classes pay handsomely to live in erstwhile immigrant and working-class areas but they get what they desire: to sup at the new Settepani Bakery rather than slumming it in the previous old-style saloons.</p>
<p>This book presents a forceful critique of class-based inequities and exclusions but not through the lens of a class analysis or Marxian theoretical framework. Broader sociological questions of jobs lost and gained, industries developed and disinvested in, health facilities and schools growing or declining or the fate of other local services are not this book’s principal concern. It is the consumer lifestyle changes that interest Zukin and the conflicts over space that these engender. Often this gaze trained on consumption-clashes between old and new, rich and poor misses other parts of the story – how are young immigrant and working-class neighbourhoods forging their own responses to change? What cultures are emerging in those ‘other’ urban spaces to which poor families moved when the rents were raised? Part of the reason this is missing, perhaps, is that Zukin consciously aligns herself with the New York middle classes whose lifestyle choices she tracks, creating a ‘we’ subject-position moored in the new cultural oases, which does not travel out to dispossessed areas. Her sympathies are with the poorer groups who have to leave, but her data are mainly with the shop owners and store keepers, the consumers and the residents who are still hanging on. Perhaps this is why she eschews the term ‘gentrification’ (p. 221), since it suggests a single interpretation of systematic class-advantaging rather than the more ambivalent story told here – in which the middle-class search for ‘authenticity’ is both critiqued and yet also accepted. What she draws attention to are the losses and gains of the globalised city, making a powerful plea for neighbourhoods to include a social mix rather than pushing out ‘ethnic and working-class residents’. How do we solve the authenticity conundrum that the book reveals in such intricate detail, namely: greater aesthetic authenticity (for the few) = less social authenticity (for all)? It is hard to see the solution in the argument Zukin ultimately advances: that city planners must recognise how mixed neighbourhoods create a more <italic>truly</italic> authentic urban ‘soul’.</p>

<p><italic>Naked City: The Death and Life of Authentic Urban Spaces</italic> updates the examination of culture and capital in New York City found in Sharon Zukin’s previous books <italic>Loft Living</italic> and <italic>The Cultures of Cities</italic>. Like watching Jules Dassin’s (1946) naturalistic film noir of the same title, reading <italic>Naked City</italic> is a sometimes melancholy experience. Zukin is in mourning for the soul of New York City. The introspective mood is partly because, as a self-confessed gentrifier in Greenwich Village in the 1970s, Zukin is concerned to understand her unwitting participation in New York’s detachment from its working-class and immigrant roots. In recent decades sociologists have steered clear of concepts such as authenticity, yet for Zukin, authenticity has become so important because it connects individual yearning to root oneself in place with the desire to grasp the social forces that are remaking our cities (p. 220). An urban place may be considered authentic if it creates the experience of origins, which may be achieved through the preservation of historic buildings and districts, the development of small-scale commercial enterprises and/or the branding of neighbourhoods in relation to a distinctive cultural identity (p. 3). The central problem is that authenticity is a tool of cultural power: ‘to claim that a neighbourhood is authentic suggests that the group that makes the claim knows what to do with, how best to represent, its “authentic character”’ (p. 244). The tastes of those claiming and craving authenticity displace the tastes of working-class residents by fueling rises in real-estate values: ‘In London, Paris and New York artists and gentrifiers move into old immigrant areas, praising the working-class bars and take-out joints but overwhelming them with new cafes and boutiques’ (p. 1). Moreover, ‘Bistros replace bodegas, cocktail bars morph out of old-style saloons, and the neighbourhood as a whole creates a different kind of sociability’ (p. 4).</p>
<p>For Zukin, there are two kinds of authenticity that we may associate with urban places. The first is an authenticity of origins, the timeless quality of the ‘urban village’ similarly admired by Jane Jacobs in <italic>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</italic>. The artists, bloggers and assorted bourgeois bohemians, who appear on the scene in almost every chapter of the book, covet this first kind of authenticity. The second kind of authenticity is an effect produced when these groups move into or frequent a neighbourhood. Gentrifiers cannot participate in the routines and rituals of the origins of place so for them authenticity is a consciously chosen lifestyle and performance (p. 4). Unlike some scholars of gentrification, Zukin is not critical of idealists who seek a moderately priced good life in the city of origins; they are, after all, as much in love with the authentic city as she is. Moreover, she argues that their framing of authenticity offers ‘new beginnings’ to faded neighbourhoods: ‘in the areas where hipsters and gentrifiers live there’s a new cosmopolitanism in the air: tolerant, hip, casual. And that isn’t bad’ (p. 7).</p>
<p>Zukin suggests the discovery of authenticity results in distinctive <italic>terroirs</italic> that nurture originality and innovation, thereby creating a marketable brand for a neighbourhood, its residents and their cultural products. One example of this is ‘Brooklyn Industries’ – an apparel company from Williamsburg discussed in Chapter 2. From stitching together messenger bags out of recycled vinyl billboards the company now has seven stores selling branded wares that transform Brooklyn into aesthetic. In Chapter 3 there is a fascinating detour through the East Village, a section of the old Lower East that was once a home to diverse immigrant communities, artists, cultural dissidents, beat poets, hippies and the famous punk venue CBGBs. Yet Zukin argues this remains a neighbourhood where the streets, storefronts and tenements make the contemporary urban flâneur who shops for hand-made jewellery, or drops by for some ‘Ukrainian soul food’ at the Veselka diner, feel they are connecting with the radical and artistic past of the East Village, that they are ‘recreating a unique story of origin’ (p. 101). The perceived authenticity of the East Village as an urban place becomes a projection of self-image, thereby connecting a sense of personal affinity with the East Village of origins with a desire to consume its latest incarnation (p. 101). Thus a new form of authenticity, one detached from origins and formed out of ‘new beginnings’ and consumptive practices, is forged. The consequence is that shabbiness yields to chic, gritty become trendy and luxury apartments replace live-work lofts. This for Zukin is the tension between the ‘urban village’ as imagined by creative types and the corporate city that exploits the rising land values of such places. In the end, upscale development triumphs over authenticity, whether it is the authenticity of origins or the authenticity of new beginnings (p. 237). This is when a city loses its soul.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, Zukin proposes private–public stewardship agreements to preserve small-scale buildings and urban communities. The aim of protection has the integrity of the city of origins in mind but is overly concerned with preserving the city in the image that pioneer gentrifiers imagine it. Jane Jacobs’ conservative vision of the ‘urban village’ is effectively superseded by Zukin’s funkier cast of ‘artists and writers, […] professors or museum curators, indie band members and graphic artists’ (p. 8). Such agreements are reflective more of these groups’ fears of further upscaling – and their own displacement – than broader convictions towards social justice. Moreover, if the city really is an <italic>oeuvre</italic> produced by its inhabitants, as Henri Lefebvre has it, there is a danger that this kind of stewardship would foreclose productive activities that do not meet with the ‘cultural arbitrary’ that gentrifiers impose on the city. The preservation instinct negates the dynamism, heterogeneity and openness that Zukin admires in urban places.</p>
<p>Although Zukin argues that not everything can be reduced to a discussion of gentrification, in her book this is often the result. Even when her book threatens to leave the comfort zones of the East Village or hipster Brooklyn and ‘venture’ to the public housing projects of East New York the focus is on community gardens – a signal to retreat back to the Lower East Side where the city’s first community gardens were formed by ‘green guerrillas’ back in the 1970s (Chapter 6). Zukin also visits Harlem but it is to look at renovated brownstones and a burgeoning cappuccino culture rather than to closely examine the reasons why a fashionable district so close to the heart of the global city still has a poverty rate four times the national average and – in relation to her book – what this may have to do with competing notions of authenticity (Chapter 2). It’s a shame but then this is not a book about the <italic>whole</italic> city, or the naked city for that matter. It is about the city of appearances and the transformation of New York from a city of production to a city of consumption. In exploring why authenticity matters and how the city is losing connection with its origins Zukin is a perceptive and honest guide.</p>

<p>In this accessible, yet also highly thoughtful book, Sharon Zukin once again reveals her uncanny ability to read New York’s urban fabric to tell a story which resonates. Her concern is with the corporate make-over of cities, and the way that this fundamentally damages the social texture of neighbourhoods even though they are pitched as renewals and investments in the quality of the local infrastructure. Ranging her sympathetic and careful gaze across Harlem, Brooklyn, and East Village, she charts the revival of deprived neighbourhoods and the emergence of a bright consumerist infrastructure which attracts tourists and casual visitors. Yet ultimately she demonstrates how these projects undermine the very things they search for.</p>
<p>Zukin’s arguments can therefore be seen as an urban exemplification of Boltanski and Chiapello’s claims about <italic>The New Spirit of Capitalism</italic>. The success of contemporary capitalism lies in its capacity to absorb the 1960s counter culture and its demands for liberation into its very modus operandi. In Zukin’s story, the demands to renew deprived neighbourhoods, to support a lively retail and cafe scene, and to make streets bright and safe have actually succeeded. However, in this process they have damaged authentic urban life and created a bland consumerist environment. Thus, Jane Jacobs’ campaign to defend the American city against Robert Moses’s city machine succeeded, yet in this process somehow lost its gleam. We might understand this in Proust’s terms, that we are disappointed not because our dreams fail, but because they come true. The urban flâneur has perhaps found his urban destiny, and through this been stripped of his spleen.</p>
<p>Zukin’s focus on authenticity touches the nerve. The growth of interest in the authentic in cultural analysis in large part derives from a recognition that Bourdieu’s emphasis on cultural activity as bound up with struggles over distinction and high cultural capital needs to be supplemented with the recognition of the appeal of the humble, the ordinary, the ‘down to earth’, i.e. the authentic. This appeal, as Zukin notes, is tied in with Walter Benjamin’s recognition that the lure of aura actually increases with commodification. The search for edgy urban environments thus creates the exact stakes that makes neighbourhoods suitable for corporate investment. This evocation of the authentic as the battleground for contemporary battles over cultural distinction is thus a very useful way of re-orienting our analyses of culture and urban change.</p>
<p>Although Zukin’s book is impressive, it is not without criticism. I found the case studies ultimately rather repetitive, with her apparently different kinds of examples ranging from public space in Union Square, the development of IKEA, and the fate of community gardening projects all ultimately being made to sing to the same relentless beat. In her valuable concluding chapter especially, I thought there was a danger of romanticising the old urban villages. Perhaps the new corporate neighbourhoods of today are nonetheless viewed wistfully in 50 years’ time?</p>
<p>It would also have been interesting to explore further the kind of metropolitan demand which drives the corporate take-over of New York. Are these casual tourists, stepping off the sidewalk for a cappuccino? Are they local office workers who also appreciate somewhere nice for lunch? Are they actual professional and managerial residents of these areas, helping to drive the gentrification process? And, insofar as they are residents, what kind of gentrifiers are they? Are they part of an international business elite who flock to New York because of its centrality to world finance? Or are they more mundane affluent professionals who are seeking to get their stake in a ‘desirable’ urban location, especially one which is ‘up and coming’? Although Zukin has conducted some fieldwork, and although she certainly knows these neighbourhoods intimately, the lack of dedicated fieldwork with local residents (and visitors) ultimately means these issues which would provide a more analytically rich account of urban change are passed over. In a paradoxical way, therefore, she produces in her own research the same kind of rather ironic urban orientation which presumably characterises the new breed of urban flâneurs who are attracted to these new corporate neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Finally, we should reflect on the value of the New York example. The appeal of the book no doubt rests on the fact that many of its readers – like me – feel at home in New York. We have visited it, read about it, felt emotionally charged by the attacks on the World Trade Center, and come to feel a little passionate about it. Yet we should not neglect the fundamental changes taking place in urban paradigms. Over the past two decades, classical European-oriented models, ultimately derived from Weberian visions of the civic city, have been challenged firstly by the Los Angeles school with its stress on urban fragmentation (which has itself led to the decentred urban studies associated with the ‘splintering urbanism’ school) and more recently by the focus on southern cities, which have grown very rapidly and now eclipse the cities of Europe and North America. Although Zukin does wander into Brooklyn, this is nonetheless a Manhattan-centred account even of New York itself, which is now an even more a-typical city than it always was, being fundamentally a financial and tourist centre. Parts of other ‘global’ cities are no doubt similar, as Zukin alludes in her conclusion. Nonetheless, we need to be wary about using the New York experience to frame our urban analysis, given the very different dynamics which are likely to be at work in the kind of ‘ordinary’ and mundane cities which are actually much more populous and pervasive across the globe.</p>
<p>The issues posed by this book are therefore profound. Zukin once again identifies fundamental shifts in the urban zeitgeist. This will be a major reference point for urban sociology in the coming years.</p>
