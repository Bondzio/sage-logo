<p>Based on 80 in-depth interviews with middle class and working class women in the New York City area, Sarah Damaske chronicles women’s explanations of their work and family trajectories. Women in her sample follow one of three major pathways. Half of the women she interviews remain steadily employed, usually in full-time work, even as they add the demands of motherhood. These women tend to have resources that facilitate work—financial resources for those in the middle class, supportive extended kin networks for those in the working class. A second group of women, almost 30%, pull back from full-time work, either dropping out of the labor force or reducing their hours to part-time. Middle class (White and Asian) women pull back because of exceptionally long work hours in their chosen profession and a similarly busy spouse. Working class (Latina and White) women pull back when they have unstable child care networks or are in jobs with too few rewards to justify (often to their spouse or kin) the cost of child care. Pulling back is not just about money, however: roughly equal numbers of working class and middle class women pull back even though middle class women are financially more able to do so. Interestingly, no Black women are in this “pulled back” group.</p>
<p>The third group, characterizing about one fifth of the women she interviewed, have work histories that are “interrupted.” These women are in and out of the labor force and have continual upheaval in their work and family lives as they struggle unsuccessfully to be steady, full-time workers. Whereas the steady and pulled back groups are largely undistinguishable until their mid- to late-20s, this interrupted group is already distinct early in their adult lives. As a group, they tend to be unprepared for the workforce—with much higher incidence of high school dropouts or lack of training beyond high school. They often married early, sometimes to escape parental homes that were problematic, and family disruption is common with many raising children alone. These women are the most economically disadvantaged of her three groups.</p>
<p>Damaske makes the conceptual distinction between narratives and accounts. Using a life history approach, women narrate their career and family pathways. These narratives are full of reasons why women either remain on or are deflected from a path of steady employment. Trajectories are influenced by the quality of jobs, health and illness, family support, and family disruption. Early life preparation for work is also important, as is the “luck” of landing in good work environments or ones that are well matched to the individual woman’s interests. Negotiations with a spouse about work and family matters also figure into these narratives.</p>
<p>The “accounts” women give for their particular work and family pathway emphasize only one thing: Women’s particular work trajectory was chosen for the good of their family. That is, the explanations women give for very different life pathways converge around one explanation. Steady, full-time work is for the good of the family. Pulling back from steady full-time work is for the good of the family. Work lives are interrupted because of family needs. Even the childless tend to attribute not having children in light of what is best for their (unrealized) family by claiming they are either too selfish or too committed to career to be good mothers. Thus they forego motherhood. Damaske attributes this similarity in accounts to the strong normative context that continues to surround women’s labor force participation: it is socially acceptable for a woman to work for pay—or draw back from working for pay—when this represents self-sacrifice for her family’s needs. Wanting to work for one’s own self-fulfillment is selfish.</p>
<p>The strengths of Damaske’s study are many, beginning with her sound methodology for choosing her 80 respondents. She uses New York voter registration records to select neighborhoods and respondents to ensure class and race diversity. Damaske has written an engaging book, placing it in the same league as a number of other well-written recent books on women’s work and family decisions—books such as Pamela Stone’s <italic>Opting Out</italic> or Mary Blair-Loy’s <italic>Competing Devotions</italic>. She successfully argues against a simplistic picture of middle class/working class differences in women’s employment pathways. Whether her tripartite conceptualization of women’s work and family pathways can be generalized beyond her sample, however, requires validation that could be done with large representative samples and quantitative analysis of either the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth or the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. There is also a rather uncritical acceptance of these women’s stories. Their accuracy requires further interrogation</p>
