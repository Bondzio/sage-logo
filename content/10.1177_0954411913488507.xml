<abstract>
<p>During cochlear implantation, hearing preservation is a concern. Minimizing disturbances to the cochlea and protection of the underlying endosteal membrane during the formation of a cochleostomy are considered important factors. The robotic micro-drill system tested in this article is the first example of an autonomous surgical drill successfully producing a cochleostomy, which keeps the underlying endosteal membrane intact. This study compares induced disturbances within the cochlea during formation of cochleostomy using the robotic micro-drill with that of conventional manual drilling. The disturbance of the endosteal membrane is measured using a Microscope Scanning Vibrometer at a third window, produced in the cochlea. Results show that the highest velocity amplitude measured was associated with manual drilling technique. The robotic micro-drill technique produced only about 1% of the peak velocity amplitude seen in manual drilling and exhibited much more uniform behaviour, while keeping the underlying membrane intact. The technique applied when using the robotic drill could be a major step in reducing the trauma to the cochlea, by reducing disturbance levels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past 25 years, cochlear implantation has become a standard treatment for severe to profoundly deafened patients. The cochlear implantation procedure involves drilling a cochleostomy (an opening into the cochlea) through the bony cochlea and inserting an array of electrodes into the spiral-shaped cochlea. The cochleostomy formation requires a surgeon to drill through the approximately 1- to 2-mm-thick bony cochlea wall to reveal a thin membrane, known as the endosteal membrane, of 0.1–0.2 mm thickness<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913488507">1</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913488507">Figure 1</xref>). Under the endosteal membrane are the cochlear fluids, which move in the presence of sound and are vital to the hearing process.</p>

</fig>
<p>Recently, there has been much interest in hearing preservation for hearing augmentation of patients with mild to moderate hearing loss in the low frequencies and severe to profound losses in the high frequencies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411913488507">2</xref>
</sup> The sensitivity to pressure disturbances within the fluid endosteal lumen of the cochlea during cochleostomy is considered an important factor in hearing preservation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913488507">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There are two main factors that are hypothesized to cause further loss of hearing of the patient during the formation of a cochleostomy: First is the mechanical and noise-induced trauma during the drilling process<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913488507">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411913488507">5</xref>
</sup> and second is the rupturing of the endosteal membrane by the running burr that can cause serious damage by inducing large pressure disturbances and destroying hair cells. Currently, cochleostomy formation is performed manually by hand, with the endosteal membrane being perforated by the drill in more than 60% of the cases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411913488507">6</xref>
</sup> Lehnhardt suggests the ideal way to minimize trauma during cochleostomy formation is to preserve the underlying endosteal membrane, which is subsequently opened with a pick rather than a running burr. This method avoids introducing a running burr into the cochlear space.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913488507">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The robotic micro-drill system tested in this article is the first autonomous surgical robot applied successfully in the operating room for preparing cochleostomies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411913488507">8</xref>
</sup> The system allows force and torque transient of the drilling process to be derived using data from the tool point. The system allows force and torque transient of the drilling process to be derived using data from the tool point. This information can be used to effectively predict drill breakthrough (BT) and to implement a control strategy to minimize drill penetration beyond the far surface.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913488507">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This unique BT detection feature is significant as it enables production of consistent windows onto the endosteal membrane of the cochlea. There are already two natural windows on the cochlear endosteal membrane, which are the round and oval windows, respectively. Therefore, the window created for the experiments in the bony wall of the cochlea will be referred to as the ‘third window’ (TW).</p>

<sec id="section2-0954411913488507" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods and measurements</title>
<p>To contrast pressure disturbances in manual and robotic drilling of a cochleostomy, the investigation focused on a porcine system, as there are physical similarities in size.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913488507">10</xref>
</sup> The drilling process of the robotic micro-drill produces a consistent membrane window onto the fluid as a TW, in close proximity to the round window (RW), which was then used for an assessment of disturbance amplitude. A schematic configuration of the equipment used in the experimental measurement is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411913488507">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Experimental set-up</title>
<p>For each trial, the porcine head was dissected into two halves, and the brain was removed. The cochlea is located within the temporal bone underneath the dura mater. The dura mater was elevated using a surgical knife and Adson forceps, revealing the cochlea, which was extracted from the temporal bone with the stapes still attached and intact. The cochlea was subsequently fixed into a custom-built test bed capable of being fitted to the microscope. Then, using two screws on the sides, the cochlea remained stationary during the experiment.</p>
<p>A TW of 0.8 mm diameter was created at the far anterior aspect of the basal turn of the cochlea, approximately 9 mm directly anterior from the anterior lip of the RW niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913488507">Figure 3</xref>). To respect the closed fluid structure of the cochlea and provide an accurate measurement of membrane deflection during the drilling process, the endosteal membrane in the TW was visually inspected and palpated and found to be intact after bone removal.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954411913488507-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>As the reflection coefficient of the endosteal membrane is extremely low,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411913488507">11</xref>
</sup> 0.01 mL of silver metallic paint was applied onto the endosteal membrane to be focused on by the Laser Vibrometer. Paint was applied immediately prior to measurement to avoid any chemical interaction with the properties of the membrane. The test bed was then mounted onto the microscope. The TW was oriented at the top of the cochlea test bed facing the lens of the microscope. The laser spot of the Laser Vibrometer (MSV-400) was focused onto the surface of the metallic paint at the measurement point, through the Zeiss 10×/0.3 NA lens of the microscope as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411913488507">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The definition of the term ‘dynamic disturbance’ in this article is the movement of the cochlear endosteal membrane viewed through the TW. This movement is presented as velocity amplitude and is a direct representation of cochlea fluid pressure. High peak and mean velocities of membrane reflect greater pressure amplitudes within the perilymph, located in the scala tympani and hence greater potential trauma. However, it should be stated that while the technique shows the contrasting disturbance transients induced during the cochleostomy formation procedure, it does not provide an absolute measurement of pressure amplitude.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0954411913488507">
<title>Manual and robotic drilling procedure</title>
<p>Drilling was performed anterior inferior to the RW, in the typical position for a cochleostomy during the cochlear implant procedure. Six cochleostomies were performed on separate porcine cochleas: three in the manual group and three in the robotic group.</p>
<p>The manual cochleostomies were performed by a skilled ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon, using a 1 mm diamond paste burr at a speed of 10,000 r/min. At completion of cochleostomy, to assess the disturbances caused by introducing a running burr into the scala tympani, no attempt was made to preserve the underlying endosteal membrane. The surgeon applied a similar force of drilling to that used during human cochlear implantation, although this force was not specifically assessed at this stage. The surgeon was wearing a pair of surgical loupes (SurgiTel EV250) in this process to inspect the correct position of drilling.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411913488507">Figure 4</xref> represents the experimental set-up of the manual cochleostomy drilling. The hand of the surgeon was supported by a robust arm rest to avoid undesired hand movement.</p>

</fig>
<p>The robotic cochleostomy was performed using the robotic micro-drill, attached to a snake arm. The arm was locked to the microscope table. Cochleostomies were created with preservation of the endosteal membrane, inherent with the use of this robotic drill. The same drill burr as in the manual tests was used (1 mm diamond), at a drilling speed of 700 r/min. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411913488507">Figure 5</xref> demonstrates the position of the drill burr with respect to the cochlea. As can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411913488507">Figure 5</xref>, the robotic drill is being attached to a snake arm. The snake arm is a mechanical support, which is used to lock and fix the trajectory of the drill. Initially, the arm allows free movement to enable placement of the drill bit on the trajectory of promontory and then is locked manually to create a static, stable platform for the drill. The arm does not actively remove the vibrations. Its natural rigidity is unlikely to absorb vibrations through deformation.</p>

<p>The set-up time for the robotic drill was approximately 2 min. The direction and angle of drilling achieved through the posterior tympanotomy were similar to that of a conventional cochleostomy formation, with an adequate view of the drilling site.</p>
<p>The axial drill force was limited to 2 N to ensure that the underlying membrane was not perforated when the burr drilled through the cochlear bone. Irrigation was used throughout all drilling procedures.</p>

<title>Result</title>
<p>During the experimental investigations, membrane velocity measured by the Microscope Scanning Vibrometer (MSV) was logged with the settings of (100 mm/s/v), 262,144 lines (time) and 1.28 kHz sampling frequency. These data were processed using the Signal Possessing Toolbox of MATLAB. The contrasting response due to manual and robotic cochleostomies can be seen using plots of velocity transients of the endosteal membrane.</p>

The time axis is shorter for manual drilling as the process is completed within a shorter period. It is noted that there is significantly lower peak amplitude of disturbance in robotic drilling, approximately 1% of that induced during manual drilling. It is observed that transients shown for manual drilling are not as uniform as in the case of robotic drilling, as there is an impact with each sweep of the drill in the manual technique.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study compares endosteal membrane disturbance during manual and robotic cochleostomy formation. While there was an expectation that the robotic micro-drill will cause lower disturbance to the cochlea, the observed magnitude of the contrast was not expected.</p>
<p>As can be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411913488507">Figure 9</xref>, the mean membrane velocity during robotic technique is 4% of the velocity when drilled manually. The peak membrane velocity during the robotic cochleostomy is 1% of that observed during manual drilling.</p>

</fig>
<p>The results of the statistical t-test demonstrated that the two-tailed <italic>p</italic> value is less than 0.0001, between the responses at the robotic and manual drilling, and by conventional criteria, this difference is considered to be extremely statistically significant.</p>
<p>It is concluded that by controlling the force in robotic drilling, it is possible to produce significantly lower disturbances. To support the hypothesis of the effect of drilling speed and force on disturbance velocity amplitude, trials of drilling with three different feed forces of 0.5, 1 and 5 N with a constant speed of 10,000 r/min were performed manually on a cochlea. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954411913488507">Figure 10</xref> shows two graphs to illustrate the relationship of the drilling force applied and corresponding disturbance amplitude. The top graph shows disturbance velocity as a function of time and the lower graph shows the corresponding drilling force as a function of time. As can be observed, the highest disturbance occurs when drilling was performed with an applied force of 5 N, with amplitude response at approximately 0.8 m/s. The graph indicated that pressure disturbances created in the cochlea increase with applied feed force.</p>

</fig>
<p>It can be inferred that controlling interactive force is key to reducing disturbance amplitude during the cochleostomy formation process. The robotic micro-drill is able to ensure that a constant feed force is applied from the burr to the bone at all times. This is achieved by controlling linear displacement of the robot where the drill advances or withdraws in response to the feedback depending on drilling characteristics. Manual drilling usually involves impact between the drill burr and the tissue, one with each sweep of the bone surface. On each sweep, the burr will move away from the bone, but will also rebound, leading to an increase in the force applied into the bone. As bone is removed, the forces continually change, and these forces are out of the range of the human operator to sense and control.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954411913488507">Figure 11</xref> shows the drilling angle in manual and robotic drilling techniques. In manual technique, the burr is held at a slight angle so that the surgeon has a view of the target area to avoid inadvertent penetration of the underlying membrane. Irrigation is constantly performed through to the tip of the burr, and often, the surgeon must remove the burr to allow the liquid to be suctioned out and the drilling site to be inspected. The inspection assesses the integrity endosteal membrane. The sweep of the drill burr and the impact of the tip after each inspection are the major factors leading to spikes in the force delivered to the cochlea during manual drilling. However, in the robotic technique, the burr is held perpendicular to the drilling site. The burr is constantly irrigated with no need for the burr to be moved from the target area.</p>

<p>The most important aspect of the robotic cochleostomy is BT detection. This feature controls bone drilling to stop just before the endosteal membrane is reached, resulting in the preservation of the membrane. Lehnhardt<sup>

</sup> recommends the ideal way to minimize trauma during cochleostomy formation is to perform a bony cochleostomy preserving the underlying endosteal membrane. In this method, the membrane is subsequently opened with a pick rather than a running burr as used in the manual drilling method. This method avoids introducing a running burr into the scala tympani. A previous study by Pau et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913488507">4</xref>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article compares endosteal membrane disturbances during manual and robotic drilling of a cochleostomy. Disturbances were contrasted using a MSV, on the exposed membrane through a TW, produced on the cochlea. The results showed significant reduction in the amplitude of disturbance when using the robotic drilling technique.</p>
<p>Drilling a cochleostomy in cochlear implantation causes disturbances to the endosteal membrane that can lead to permanent damage of residual cochlear function. In the current practice of a manual drilling technique, the cochlea is subject to significant disturbance on BT of the endosteal membrane by the running burr. The use of the robotic micro-drilling technique described in this article will minimize the disturbance to the cochlea by controlling the state of the process of tissue interaction to decrease applied drilling force and perforation of endosteal membrane.</p>
<p>This set-up is likely to be different from the human situation; however, the tests give a comparison of the reduction in disturbances for the two methods on the same set-up and hence give a good indication of potential benefits of the robotic technique.</p>
