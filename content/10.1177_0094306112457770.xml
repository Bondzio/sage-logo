<title>Comment on “Polite Culture: ‘Nice Nellyism’ Suffuses Sociology”</title>
<p>As someone who studies the disciplining power of “positive” and “appreciative” discourse in contemporary life, I should be delighted by Alan Sica’s polemic against Nice Nellyism in sociology (Editor’s Remarks, May, 2012). In fact, my own research has been rejected a number of times for a perceived lack of tact in what I thought was measured criticism of other scholarship. But my reaction on reading his essay was the urge to fill Professor Sica in on the more immediate social forces driving this epidemic of politeness, whose real reasons his younger reviewers were perhaps too diplomatic to state directly. There’s little need to invoke generational difference, a euphemistic “influx of ‘nice people’ into the discipline,” diversity education, or, for God’s sake, 9/11.</p>
<p>As Sica’s repeated mentions of gender imply, the field of sociology has become pervasively feminized (see the recently-elected ASA officers), with all that means for pay and status, just as the crumbling higher education system increasingly relies on contingent labor. In a context in which senior faculty continue to receive the generous employment benefits of earlier eras, while those of us in the lower ranks wonder how we will pay for retiree health care or send our own children to college, you might forgive us for seeming to exhibit a little class consciousness!</p>
<p>Sica’s “ancients” could literally afford to be impolitic, and had a blast doing it. From where I stand as an assistant professor, that acerbic privilege looks plenty appealing. I’d like to think that I carry on the serious intellectual traditions of my forebears by writing honest reviews, but I am certainly aware that today’s monographs were produced by peers trying to squeeze in quality research with overwhelming teaching and service burdens. When a new book represents a foothold on a rickety tenure ladder, the eggheady satisfactions of a biting remark or witty takedown seem trivial at best, even though— and it should be obvious at this point— I think they’re a lot of fun. It’s the young Nellies’ insecurity, not our fellow-feeling, that needs fixing. Can we agree on that?</p>
