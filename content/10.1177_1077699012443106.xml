<p>Only someone with extensive experience in our field could put together such a comprehensive perspective on the evolution of journalism and journalism education. Edd Applegate, the author of several books, is a journalism professor at Middle Tennessee State University. Before he became a professor, he worked in public relations and has published articles in newspapers. From this background, he has much to say, and at the end of his chapters he offers comments and/or recommendations.</p>
<p>Among topics covered in his <italic>Journalism in the United States</italic> are theories of the press and their evolution, issues of fairness and balance, the clash of media, the presence of minorities in the media, concepts of balance and objectivity in the news, and the purposes of the media. Most especially, he includes a very lengthy chapter on journalism education, “The History and Questionable Quality of Journalism Education.” Is it questionable? Well, Professor Applegate presents the history of, for want of a better term, the use of professionals versus doctorate-holding academics (of course one can be both) in journalism education. And then there is the issue—to some at least—of whether accreditation is a benefit to school and students. Applegate, like our own former North Carolina Dean Norval N. Luxon, favors fewer, better journalism programs. Certainly Luxon generated controversy in the late 1950s and early 1960s with this argument.</p>
<p>Applegate uses a wide range of sources, journals, magazines, and books published over many years to examine his <italic>Concepts and Issues</italic>. His extensive citations will remind many readers of materials they have covered in graduate schools or since. Sometimes his advice is tentative. For example, in the chapter about the purposes of the media, Applegate urges journalists to ask themselves if they are fulfilling their role in democratic society to the best of their ability. If not, he says, then changes should be made. This somewhat mild-mannered advice must be balanced with, say, Applegate’s comments to journalism educators. Today, he says, most journalism graduates will not find employment in their major. Are all these journalism programs necessary? Applegate’s answer, on page 143, is no.</p>
<p>The more experience you have in journalism and journalism education, the more you will find this study to be provocative. One wonders why such macro observers as Leon Epstein, Michael Shudson, Todd Gitlin, Neil Postman, and Herbert Gans have so shaped our thinking about the public role of journalism, as aside from journalists, other than Walter Lippmann and a few others. We also remember the days when journalism education was more often a topic in <italic>Atlantic</italic> or <italic>Harper’s</italic> or other leading publications. What happened? Why are we as journalists and teachers not more insightful? Applegate’s study provides a personal summary of key perspectives in our collective field since the field emerged in the first quarter of the twentieth century. And he urges us to reconsider the concepts and issues that are “the foundation on which American journalism is based” (p. ix).</p>
