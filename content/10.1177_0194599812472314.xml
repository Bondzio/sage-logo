<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>A 10-question multiple-choice quiz was given to residents in family practice, pediatrics, emergency medicine, and internal medicine during scheduled educational conferences. Residents were also asked if they ever participated in an otolaryngology rotation during medical school or residency. Medical students and otolaryngology residents completed the quiz to act as controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812472314">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 98 examinations were analyzed (49 non-otolaryngology residents, 10 otolaryngology residents, and 39 second-year medical students). Only 24% of the non- otolaryngology residents had an otolaryngology rotation during medical school. The same amount (24%) had a rotation during residency. The average percentage correct on the quiz was 48%, 56%, and 92% for medical students, non-otolaryngology, and otolaryngology residents, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Questions with surprising results included one with an endoscopic image of the middle turbinate and examinees asked to identify the structure (non-otolaryngology residents = 18% correct). A laryngectomy stoma was shown and participants asked what would happen if the stoma was occluded for 10 minutes (non-otolaryngology residents = 20% correct).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this sample of non-otolaryngology residents, a minority experienced a clinical rotation in otolaryngology during medical school or residency. This nonvalidated questionnaire also suggested significant deficiencies in basic otolaryngic knowledge in these residents. Identifying mechanisms to improve exposure to otolaryngology in the medical training curriculum is needed.</p>

<p>Approximately 10% of new consultations to general practitioners are complaints of the ear, nose, and/or throat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812472314">1</xref></sup> Within the pediatric population, this number has been reported even higher, with up to 50% of consultations related to otolaryngic disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812472314">2</xref></sup> Despite the prevalence of ear, nose, and throat problems in a primary care practice, exposure to formal training in the otolaryngology–head and neck specialty in the United States medical school curriculum is often limited. Experience during primary care residency training varies among programs and is often limited to brief elective rotations.</p>
<p>Surveys taken in the United Kingdom and Canadian medical systems suggest that primary care specialties are not receiving sufficient training for otolaryngic complaints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472314">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812472314"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812472314"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812472314"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812472314"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812472314"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812472314">9</xref></sup> In England, 75% of surveyed general practitioners (GPs) responded that they received inadequate training in otolaryngology and the same percentage of GPs would have preferred additional training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472314">3</xref></sup> In another study, 90% of emergency room physicians considered their otolaryngology training as directly benefiting their practice. However, 75% believed they had not received enough training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812472314">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>These surveys assess the perception of primary care physicians’ desire for more otolaryngology education. However, there are no studies that attempt to quantify this deficiency within primary care training programs. The objectives of the current study were to objectively assess the otolaryngology-related knowledge of medical students and residents training in primary care specialties within an academic tertiary care training center. Identifying these potential insufficiencies could highlight the need for an increased emphasis on general otolaryngology training in medical school and graduate medical education.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812472314" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A 10-question, multiple-choice exam was administered to current residents within the family medicine, pediatric, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and otolaryngology programs at the University of Utah School of Medicine and second-year medical students (MS2) attending the university. Examinees were also asked if they had participated in a clinical rotation in otolaryngology during residency and/or medical school. The exam was given to residents and students at the conclusion of a conference or previously scheduled gathering with voluntary participation. Although participation was voluntary, nearly all potential examinees offered the questionnaire completed the study. We were unable to identify characteristics or the rationale of the few who declined to participate. Approval was granted from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Utah. All responses were anonymous and categorized to specialty.</p>
<p>The 10 questions covered basic head and neck anatomy or common otolaryngic complaints that frequently present to the emergency room or primary care physician’s office (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812472314"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). All questions had only 1 correct answer, and answers were graded on an overall percentage correct and stratified by individual question within a training specialty.</p>

<p>The responses were categorized into 3 groups: otolaryngology residents, non-otolaryngology residents, and medical students. Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine a difference in means between the 3 groups, with statistical significance for <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Groupwise comparisons were then performed to determine significant differences in the means when comparing one group to another.</p>

<sec id="section8-0194599812472314" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 119 exams were distributed and 104 exams were received (87% response rate), with 5 removed as they were responses from fourth-year medical students rotating as externs, and 1 was excluded because no identifying specialty was answered. Thus, 98 exams were analyzed.</p>
<p>Only 24% of non-otolaryngology residents had a formal clinical course in otolaryngology during medical school, and the same number (24%) had participated in an otolaryngology rotation during residency. Responses were not significantly different between residents who had participated in an otolaryngology rotation during medical school or residency and those who had not.</p>
<p>The percentage of respondents answering each question correctly is depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812472314"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Overall, otolaryngology residents answered 92% (95% confidence interval: 83%-100%) of the questions correctly. Non-otolaryngology residents and MS2s only answered 56% (52%-60%) and 48% (44%-53%) correct, respectively. Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric ANOVA identified a significant difference in the mean scores between the 3 groups (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Groupwise comparison also identified significant differences between the otolaryngology residents and non-otolaryngology residents (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), the otolaryngology residents and the MS2s (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and the non-otolaryngology residents and the MS2s (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812472314"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Of the non-otolaryngology resident participants, 59% were in PGY-I/II, while 41% were PGY-III or greater. No significant difference was seen in the scores between these two subgroups of the non-otolaryngology residents (57% for PGY-I/II, 55% for PGY-III and greater).</p>

<p>When analyzing the questions by stratifying them into specialties, of particular concern is that no emergency medicine residents out of 17 correctly identified that occlusion of a laryngectomy stoma for 10 minutes would lead to asphyxiation. The other answer choices included moderate dyspnea, no change in respiratory status, or temporary improvement in voice function. It is also worth noting that only 15% of family medicine residents correctly identified the middle turbinate as it would be viewed by anterior rhinoscopy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812472314" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study attempting to quantify the knowledge of basic otolaryngology concepts of primary care residents and comparing it with otolaryngology residents. The results of this study suggest a lack of knowledge concerning common otolaryngic complaints within primary care physician training. While it is unrealistic for primary care physicians to be expected to know detailed surgical techniques for neck dissection or the complexities of sinus anatomy, it is reasonable to expect appropriate first-line treatment for sinusitis or be able to identify the middle turbinate on exam. It is also reasonable to expect an emergency medicine physician to correctly identify a laryngectomy stoma and understand the concept when needed to manage these airways in emergencies.</p>
<p>While informative, this study has several limitations. The questionnaire was not validated. The questions were formulated to examine frequently encountered otolaryngology issues in a primary care setting that non-otolaryngology trainees should be able to answer. The responses from residents who did participate in previous otolaryngology rotations were not significantly better than those who had not. This may signify a weakness in the appropriateness of the exam questions. However, the questions were written and discussed by 3 attending otolaryngologists. Possibly, insufficient student participation on an otolaryngology service and/or lack of a formal curriculum prevents teaching satisfactory otolaryngic knowledge to medical students not pursuing the otolaryngology field.</p>
<p>Our participants were limited to a single institution. We must be cautious not to extrapolate these findings to all non-otolaryngology residents as the results may be a deficiency unique to this institution’s training programs. However, these residents were educated at various medical schools throughout the country. Although we did not ask the medical school at which participants were educated, at this institution, only 13% of current residents within the programs participating in the questionnaire attended medical school at the University of Utah. Low scores across all non-otolaryngology programs suggest that knowledge deficiencies were not specialty specific. Other surveys cited previously suggest that this knowledge deficiency is a more generalized problem and greater exposure and training in otolaryngology is needed throughout training programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472314">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812472314">4</xref></sup> A previous study examining otolaryngology training in U.S. medical schools identified significant variability in medical students’ exposure to otolaryngology, with a minority of programs offering mandatory rotations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812472314">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Improved exposure and teaching of otolaryngology in medical school and graduate medical education will not only help primary care physicians appropriately treat patients, it will also give them a greater knowledge of an otolaryngologist’s breadth and depth of training and may lead to increased, more appropriate referrals. In a survey of primary care residents, only 14% picked otolaryngologists as specialists in allergy, 32% for sleep apnea, and 47% for thyroid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812472314">11</xref></sup> This indicates that primary care residents may not understand the scope of an otolaryngologist’s practice. Greater exposure to the specialty would likely improve this understanding and increase the otolaryngologists’ referral base while simultaneously preventing unnecessary referrals that could be handled by a better trained general practitioner. However, exposure alone may not solve this deficiency in otolaryngic knowledge. In our study, there was no difference in scores between those residents who had had a rotation compared to those who had not. A focused curriculum with important objectives may be needed to obtain the desired results.</p>
<p>As the complexities of medical education intensify and the demands for more general practitioners increase, formal exposure to the otolaryngology specialty in the general medical training curriculum will likely become more difficult. Nontraditional methods of teaching otolaryngic content in the education curriculum may become necessary. Computerized simulation cases, webcasts, and other online training modules should be explored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599812472314" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although primary care providers see a large number otolaryngic of complaints in daily practice, formal training may be lacking in basic otolaryngology concepts. The findings in this study support the increasing literature concluding that primary care providers need more otolaryngology education in their training. Primary care physicians could benefit from increased training in otolaryngology to expand their knowledge of otolaryngic complaints frequently encountered in their practices.</p>
