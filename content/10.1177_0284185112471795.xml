               <p>There are only two studies that discuss the effect of a gadolinium chelate contrast agent on pancreatic diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). However, both studies only included normal pancreas and/or pancreas with pancreatitis and did not include pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).</p>

               <title>Material and Methods</title>
               <p>Twenty-two patients (13 men, 9 women; mean age 62 years) with histopathologically proven PDA were included in this study. DWI was acquired before and after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist) with two b-values: 0 and 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>. The signal intensity (SI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the lesion were recorded for comparison.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Results</title>
               <p>The mean time interval between the initiation of contrast administration and the start of the postcontrast DWI series was 393 s (range, 350–510 s). The SIs and SNRs of lesions of b1000 and b0 images of enhanced images were significantly higher than non-enhanced images (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for b1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001 for b0 s/mm<sup>2</sup>). The ADC of all PDAs revealed no statistically significant difference between non-enhanced and enhanced images (<italic>P</italic> = 0.709). There was also no significant difference between non-enhanced and enhanced images in subgroups based on grades of differentiation and locations of lesion.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Conclusion</title>
               <p>With increasing SI and SNR of PDA, intravenous contrast administration does not result in a significant difference in quantitative ADC measurements when comparing precontrast to postcontrast DWI when acquired approximately 6–7 min after administration.</p>

         <title/>
         <p>With recent technical innovations, it is now feasible to perform diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as part of a routine technique for abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C6">6</xref>). Recent studies report that DWI is useful for detecting pancreatic cancer and evaluating the degree of malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C14">14</xref>).</p>
         <p>Although DWI is usually performed prior to intravenous administration of a gadolinium chelate contrast agent, DWI may occasionally be necessary to repeat after contrast administration because of the presence of motion artifacts, the need to image with different b-values, and additional evaluations when lesions are found in the contrast-enhanced images.</p>
         <p>A recent study showed that the signal intensity (SI) of the liver and kidneys significantly decreased after contrast administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C15">15</xref>). The reason may be that gadolinium chelate contrast agents may affect quantitative DWI of the abdomen by decreasing the SI on the T2W sequences due to shortening of the T1 and T2 relaxation time. However, Chiu <italic>et al</italic>. noted that there was no significant difference in the liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or contrast-to-noise ratio of DWI before and after administration of a contrast agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C17">17</xref>).</p>
         <p>To date, there are only two studies that discuss the effect of a gadolinium chelate contrast agent on pancreatic DWI, and their results show that intravenous gadolinium administration does not make a significant difference in the qualitative appearance or ADC of the pancreas when comparing precontrast to postcontrast DWI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C18">18</xref>). However, both studies only included normal pancreas and/or pancreas with pancreatitis and did not include pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).</p>
         <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of gadolinium chelate contrast agent on DWI of PDA when comparing precontrast to postcontrast DWI.</p>

            <title>Patient population</title>
            <p>Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study and informed consent was obtained for each participant. Between March 2011 and October 2011, we prospectively enrolled 32 subjects. All 32 patients underwent surgical resection of their tumours. Twenty-two patients (13 men, 9 women) with histopathologically proven PDA were included in this study (the excluded 10 cases consisted of two pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, two mucinous cystadenomas, one mass-forming chronic pancreatitis, one duodenal stromal tumor, one serous cystadenoma, one intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, one periampullary carcinoma, one pancreatic solid pseudopapillary tumor). The mean patient age was 62 years (range, 48–78 years). In total, 22 lesions were detected. Twelve lesions were at the pancreatic head, two lesions at pancreatic body, and eight lesions at the pancreatic tail. The 22 lesions were classified by grades of differentiation: seven PDAs were poorly differentiated, 11 were moderately differentiated, and four were well-differentiated PDAs.</p>

            <title>Imaging protocols</title>
            <p>All MRI examinations were performed on a 3.0-T MRI system with a torso-phased array multicoil (Sigma HDx; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). There was a fasting period of at least 6 h before imaging, and no oral contrast material or antiperistaltic agents were used.</p>
            <p>DWI was acquired before and after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist; Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) at a rate of 0.1 mmol/kg of body weight through a power injector at a rate of 2 mL/s. DWI sequences were performed with the single-shot echo planar imaging technique with motion-probing gradients in three directions. The following parameters were used to acquire 10 sections in a 22-s breath-hold (two b-values: 0 and 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>): TR/TE, 2000 ms/min; matrix size, 130 × 96; field of view, 36 × 36 cm; number of excitations, 5.0; slice thickness/gap, 6 mm/2 mm. A parallel imaging technique and array spatial sensitivity encoding technique were used. Breath-holds were at the end of expiration after two preceding full respirations.</p>

            <title>Data analysis</title>
            <p>Images were analyzed on the manufacturer's Advantage Windows workstation (version ADW 4.3; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). All MR images were analyzed retrospectively by two experienced radiologists. When there was a discrepancy between the two radiologists' reads, the result was discussed, and a consensus reached. The pancreatic lesions were identified on the T1-/T2-weighted images and/or contrast-enhanced images. All regions of interest (ROIs) were placed within the confines of the lesions. For heterogeneous lesions, the ROIs included the solid part. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the lesions were assessed three times within the same area, and an average was calculated. All ROIs were first established in each lesion on the diffusion-weighted images before enhancement and then copied and pasted onto the diffusion-weighted images after enhancement and on ADC maps. The SI and ADC of each lesion were recorded for analysis. The SNR of each lesion were calculated using the following equation: SNR = SI/SD<sub>noise</sub>, where SI is the signal intensity of the lesion and SD<sub>noise</sub> is the SD of the background noise. The signal intensity of the background noise was measured by the ROI in the air immediately left and dorsal to the pancreas and outside the body. The area of the ROI in the background was maintained at a value &gt; 250 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

            <title>Statistical analysis</title>
            <p>Statistical significance of the SI, SNR, and ADC of each lesion between the precontrast and postcontrast DWI series was assessed by the Wilcoxon test. A value of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS (version 16.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

         <title>Results</title>
         <p>The mean time interval between the precontrast and postcontrast DWI series was approximately 12 min (mean ± SD , 712 ± 107 s; range, 599–995 s). The mean time interval between the initiation of contrast administration and the start of the postcontrast DWI series was approximately 6–7 min (mean ± SD, 393 ± 46 s; range, 350–510 s).</p>
         <p>The SIs and SNRs of b1000 and b0 images of PDAs are reported in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-12-0526TB1">1</xref> and showed a significant difference between non-enhanced and enhanced images (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for b1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001 for b0 s/mm<sup>2</sup>). The SIs of the PDA lesions of enhanced images were 22% (b1000) and 17% (b0) higher than those of non-enhanced images (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-12-0526F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-12-0526F2">2</xref>).

The ADC values of all PDAs revealed no significant difference between non-enhanced and enhanced images (<italic>P</italic> = 0.709). The mean ADC value of PDAs was 1238.84 × 10 <sup>−6</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s in non-enhanced images and 1236.98 × 10 <sup>−6</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s in enhanced images. The ADC did not show a significant difference between non-enhanced and enhanced images in each subgroup based on the grades of differentiation and locations of lesion (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-12-0526F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-12-0526F2">2</xref>).</p>

         <p>Brain studies on the effect of gadolinium chelate contrast agents for DWI showed that there was no difference between pre- and late postcontrast ADC values (performed 5–10 min postcontrast) in normal brain tissue and in brain lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C20">20</xref>). However, there was a difference between pre- and early postcontrast ADC values (performed immediately after contrast administration). Contrast medium injection showed significant time-dependent effects on ADC values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C21">21</xref>).</p>
         <p>The abdominal literature reports that the SIs of the liver and kidneys substantially decrease over approximately 5 min after contrast administration, thereafter gradually returns to baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C15">15</xref>). Additionally Gd-EOB-DTPA does not significantly influence the DWI of liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C2">2</xref>).</p>
         <p>Until now, only two studies have discussed the effect of gadolinium chelate contrast agent for DWI of the pancreas. Wang <italic>et al</italic>. suggests that there are no qualitative and quantitative significant differences in ADC values or changes in the DWI appearance of the pancreas before and approximately 11 min after the administration of intravenous contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C18">18</xref>). Gulani <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the SI of the pancreas substantially decreased over approximately 5 mins after contrast agent administration and then gradually returned to baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C15">15</xref>). However, both studies only included normal pancreas and/or pancreas with pancreatitis and did not include PDA.</p>
         <p>In our study, intravenous contrast agent administration significantly increased the SI and SNR of PDA and did not make a significant difference in the quantitative ADC measurement of PDA. The SIs of lesions of b1000 and b0 images of enhanced images were higher than those of non-enhanced images. Our result did not agree with the results in the literature, which suggests the SI of pancreatic DWI after administration should decrease within 5 min and show no significant differences between before and approximately 11 min after the administration of an intravenous contrast agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C18">18</xref>). The time point of postcontrast DWI in the study led by Wang <italic>et al.</italic> was 11 min after administration. According to the result of Gulani <italic>et al</italic>., the gadolinium concentration may return to baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C15">15</xref>). Thus the SI of DWI showed no significant changes between non-enhanced and enhanced images. In our study, the post-contrast DWI was performed approximately 6–7 min after administration, and the gadolinium concentration did not return to baseline, which may have resulted in the significant change of SI of postcontrast DWI. Additionally, Gulani <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the SI is expected to increase at very low gadolinium concentrations but then decreases as the gadolinium concentration increases. The cut-off point for the gadolinium concentration is approximately 0.5–0.7 m/M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C15">15</xref>). If the time point of DWI data acquisition was relatively long after the gadolinium administration, the gadolinium concentration of PDA decreased to a specific concentration, which may cause an increase in the SI of PDA. Another reason may be that PDA is a hypovascular tumor, which causes low gadolinium concentration in PDA tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C23">23</xref>). These reasons were hypothesized to underlie the different findings concerning the influence of gadolinium on SI and SNR of DWI.</p>
         <p>The current study demonstrated that PDA ADC values before and after contrast agent administration was not significantly different in all cases and all subgroups. One reason may be that the gadolinium concentration was too low to influence the ADC value, although the same gadolinium concentration could simultaneously increase the lesion SI and SNRs of b1000/b0 images. Additionally, several studies showed the relationship between ADC and the contrast agent's viscosity and the decrease in ADC with increasing contrast agent viscosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C25">25</xref>). The contrast agent viscosity in the PDA tissue may not be sufficiently high to affect the ADC values because of the hypovascularity of PDA and the relatively long time after gadolinium administration. Moreover, the protocol with a high b-value of 1000 mm/s and a longer repetition time may be more robust to microperfusion and saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0526C2">2</xref>).</p>
         <p>There are several limitations in this study. First, a small study sample was used, and we only focused on one type of pancreatic lesions, the PDA. Second, matching slices and ROIs before and after contrast agent injection may not have been perfect. Third, we were unable to standardize the time between the administration of intravenous contrast agent and the acquisition of the postcontrast DWI. As a result, there was a range of times between the administration of intravenous contrast and the acquisition of the postcontrast DWI. Fourth, only two b-values (0 and 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) were compared between precontrast and postcontrast in our study, in order to restrict the total examination time. The impact of multiple b-values needs to be evaluated in further studies. Finally, a larger sample size and comparisons with a different viscosity contrast agent may have improved our understanding of the effects of the contrast agent on DWI.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, intravenous contrast administration does not make a significant difference in the quantitative ADC measures of PDA when comparing precontrast to postcontrast DWI if acquired approximately 6–7 min after administration. Our results may allow DWI sequences of PDA to be performed either before or after contrast administration as needed, indicating that the postcontrast DWI of PDA is feasible in clinical practice.</p>
