<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In 2001, the Bi-State Blue Crab Advisory Committee (BBCAC) released <italic>Taking Action for the Blue Crab</italic>, a Chesapeake Bay-wide plan to facilitate the recovery of the ailing blue crab stock. The release of the report was notable as it represented the first time in history that Maryland and Virginia had reached consensus in developing plans that were “workable and acceptable to a range of stakeholders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510374177">BBCAC, 2001a</xref>: 6). The Bay-wide consensus had a profound impact on policy making in the region. Jack Travelstead of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) noted that the Virginia Marine Resources Commission was resolute in achieving the recommended 15 percent reduction in effort because for the first time in Bay history they had scientific consensus that there was indeed a problem with the fishery. Working on the advice of its Technical Working Group, the BBCAC had established biologically determined limits and targets to the fishery, and determined that an effort reduction of 15 percent was the appropriate course of action (J. Travelstead, 2003, personal communication).</p>
<p>However, despite changes in policy resulting in harvest reductions that had painful repercussions for the industry, the crab population continued its apparent decline. In 2007 the fishery registered its worst year since 1945 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510374177">Chesapeake Bay Stock Assessment Committee, 2008</xref>: 475). In September 2008, the Chesapeake Bay blue crab fishery was declared a federal disaster. What went wrong?</p>
<p>I argue that information produced and then taken up for decision making is a function of a complex interplay within the scientific community and between scientists and the broader policy network who are all grappling with issues in a complex environment with a high degree of scientific uncertainty. The dynamics of forming and re-forming the scientific community are shaped by political processes, as are the directions and questions scientists attend to in their roles as policy advisors. In turn, the output of scientific inquiry—numbers, raw data, scientific reports—gains footing in the policy context when scientists craft persuasive arguments through the selective use of information infused with values by a limited number of researchers that achieved authoritative status to speak for the resource. Succinctly, three factors: 1) social construction of scientific communities, 2) the indeterminacy of science, and 3) demands by policy makers to have narrowly defined concrete information for decision making; are intertwined in the production and dissemination of information that may serve as the basis for policy learning. Through this process, however, what gets learned may not be what is needed to mitigate the problem or be complete in terms of addressing multiple causations.</p>

<sec id="section2-0963662510374177">
<title>2. Scientific communities, uncertainty, and policy</title>
<p>An influential model in understanding the role of science in policy making to mitigate environmental harms stems from Peter Haas’ work on epistemic communities. He argues that an epistemic community shares not only a “belief in a common set of cause and effect relationships,” but also “common values to which politics governing these relationships will be applied” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510374177">Haas, 1989</xref>: 380, n. 20). Scientific consensus emerging from such communities can provide compelling evidence for governments to act and offer solutions. Haas’ insights have served as a foundation for a number of researchers examining the roles of expert knowledge and his insights have continued to be refined.</p>
<p>Problematizing where shared values come from, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510374177">Giandominico Majone (1989</xref>: 24) notes that interactions of scientists in the policy process may also give rise to shifts in values, as they are “neither given nor constant, but are themselves a function of the policy making process that they are supposed to guide.” In other words, consensus emerges through social interactions that constitute the community in the first place. Real debate encourages participants in the policy process to advance their own positions and concerns as well as adjust their worldviews as a result of compelling arguments. Further research indicates that the legitimacy of epistemic communities varies according to their composition. Studies have found that cross-national representation in scientific bodies has enhanced legitimacy in the science for global climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662510374177">C. Miller, 2001</xref>), Great Lakes water quality assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662510374177">Valiante et al., 1997</xref>), and international tropical tuna management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662510374177">Peterson, 1997</xref>). As such, not only is it important to consider the convergence of ideas about environmental issues but it is also important to consider among whom that consensus is made.</p>
<p>The goals, time frames, and standards of regulatory science differ from research science in that it seeks “truths relevant to policy” in politically determined time frames and is subject to legal tests of sufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510374177">Jasanoff, 1990</xref>: 78). The issue-based science for policy often occurs when “facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high, decisions urgent, and where no single one of these dimensions can be managed in isolation from the rest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662510374177">Ravetz, 1990</xref>: 269). Inquiry may be constrained by institutional or policy making contexts that exclude the examination of processes that may be relevant, but are not attended to in the policy decision context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510374177">Jones and Baumgartner, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Policy makers are often involved in a number of decision processes and give limited attention to each issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662510374177">Cohen et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510374177">Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988</xref>), making it difficult to grasp the multitude of interactions that affect blue crab populations. It is thus incumbent upon knowledge brokers—“intermediaries between the original researchers, or the producers of knowledge, and the policymakers who consume that knowledge but lack the time and training necessary to absorb the original research”—to pare down the information, thereby reducing the complexity of the natural world in order to make it amenable to understanding and in order to provide decision makers with definitive parameters for action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510374177">Litfin, 1994</xref>: 4). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662510374177">Allen et al. (2001</xref>: 475) warn, it is not only policy makers that reduce the world, but also scientists:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We must not underestimate the importance of focusing situations until they become simple. Successfully casting a system as simple results in consistent and singular answers as well as reliable predictions. However, from that consistency it does not follow that the singularity of answers arises from their being expressions of singular truths.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, it is not simply making a complex world or research more easily understood. Actors involved in the policy process vary in their receptivity to information and ability/willingness to learn. Information is attended to unevenly due to cognitive constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662510374177">Simon, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510374177">Baumgartner and Jones, 1993</xref>) and is filtered by normative beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510374177">Denzau and North, 1994</xref>). Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith incorporate those insights in building a model of policy learning that has at its foundation the assumption that policies are “sets of value priorities and causal assumptions about how to realize them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662510374177">1993</xref>: 16). They posit a hierarchy of belief structures: 1) deep core, axiomatic beliefs that are extremely difficult to change, 2) policy core beliefs that refer to basic policy positions and may be subject to change given serious anomalies, 3) secondary or instrumental aspects that are relatively easy to change. In addition to learning about causes and remedies, policy learning involves learning about social goals and how to effectively advance policy positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510374177">May, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Policy learning takes place within institutional contexts where rules “are used to determine who is eligible to make decisions in some arena, what actions are allowed or constrained, what aggregation rules will be used, what procedures must be followed, what information must or must not be provided” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662510374177">Ostrom, 1990</xref>: 51). Institutions can facilitate or frustrate learning not only by the inclusion or exclusion of participants, which may limit or expand sources of information and points of view, but also by the way that they structure the interaction of the actors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662510374177">Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith (1993</xref>: 53–4) discuss the nature of analytical fora and propose that those that are professionalized, with funding from sources not dominated by a specific coalition, meet relatively often, and have an element of prestige, are more likely to facilitate learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510374177">Majone (1989</xref>: 40–1) points to “well structured adversary setting[s]” with “a competition of ideas and viewpoints” as part of the “continuous process of learning through discourse.” Specifically examining the role of fisheries scientists in policy decisions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662510374177">Robert Miller (1990)</xref> finds that scientists are more likely to engage in decision making venues where the approval chain is short and has effective leadership. He comments, “a fisheries scientist faced with a long approval chain would be naïve not to ask himself, why bother? [sic]” (p. 12).</p>

<sec id="section3-0963662510374177">
<title>3. Blue crab in the Chesapeake Bay</title>
<p>The blue crab is an important biologic, economic, and social resource in the Chesapeake Bay. It is the most important commercial fishery in the Bay, with landings averaging 73 million pounds annually between 1968 and 2005. There are over 4,500 commercial license holders in the two states, 67 percent of whom in Virginia and 36 percent in Maryland are considered full-time crabbers as they derive more than 50 percent of their household income from crabbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662510374177">Rhodes et al., 2001</xref>). The crab is truly a bi-state resource. Female crabs release their eggs in the high salinity waters at the mouth of the Bay where they are swept out to the Atlantic Ocean. They re-enter the Bay in the megalope stage and settle in protected shallow waters. Young crabs disperse through the Bay, favoring the lower salinity areas in the tributaries and northern reaches of the Bay. As females mature, they mate once in their lifetimes and settle in the higher salinities of the lower Bay (Virginia waters) to reproduce multiple egg masses from the one insemination. Mature males prefer waters of lower salinity and therefore dominate the Maryland fishery.</p>
<p>Throughout the history of the fishery, the crab population has varied widely, proving quite difficult to predict the next year’s population based on current spawning stock. The wide fluctuations have called into question the manageability of the crab as environmental factors seem to outweigh other variables. Also frustrating management efforts is the lack of a way to determine the age of crabs—fundamental to the models used to describe the population dynamics of the species. As one waterman puts it, “We know three things about the blue crab: he comes, he goes, and he bites” (Whittaker, 2004, personal communication).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0963662510374177">
<title>4. Methodology for studying science and the blue crab policy process</title>
<p>To discern policy learning among policy elites and scientists this research uses a combination of semi-structured and focused interviews, content analysis, and personal observation of public hearings and various relevant workgroups and task forces. In addition to background information as to how long, to what extent, and for which interest informants have been involved in blue crab policy making, the interviews reveal if and how individuals’ thinking about policy problems changed and which information, documents, presentations or fora were most catalytic in those changed perceptions.</p>
<p>I identified potential informants as those committee and workgroup members listed in 1989 and 1997 blue crab fishery management plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662510374177">Chesapeake Bay Program, 1997</xref>) and numerous Bi-State Blue Crab Advisory Committee (BBCAC) documents. I conducted a total of 27 in-depth interviews with individuals representing industry (5), environmental organizations (2), scientists (12), and agency personnel (8). In addition to analyzing the content of the fishery management plans, BBCAC reports, and meeting minutes, a number of the interviewees supplied documents that reflected their involvement in the policy process. These included scientific, agency, or workgroup reports that were authored by the interviewee or, as in the case of some of the industry representatives, reports they read that altered the way they thought about the resource. Observing meetings in the area gave insights as to how participants were engaged, their communication styles and interpersonal relations, and types of information that were exchanged in the different fora.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662510374177">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The community of scientists, policy makers, fishers, and stakeholders in the Chesapeake Bay is quite small and, at times, fraught with conflict. Many interviewees requested anonymity or indicated that they would speak more freely without being taped. Additionally, discussions during many meetings were under “Chatham House Rules” and no transcripts are available. As such, coding software was inappropriate for evaluating a number of personal communications. Nevertheless, I tracked conflicts over and changes in understandings of what factors affect blue crab populations and shifts in attention to different attributes of the resource, industry, and factors believed to affect the crab population. Core themes included the manageability of the crab, habitat issues, and fishing effort. As indicated later, an important dynamic of the process was the narrowing of inquiry that took place over time in the BBCAC and Technical Workgroup (TWG). This was identified through systematic evaluation of agendas, minutes, and reports available as to the focus and content of presentations made by scientists and questions asked by policy makers. Initially there were a range of issues—from habitat to socio-economic context—that were discussed. The range narrowed as the group became increasing focused on fishing effort. Evidence of changes in the ways that policy makers thought about blue crab management was manifest through consistent reference to specific scientific recommendations and reports in various regulations, agency documents, advisory reports, and statements by participants.</p>
<p>Scientists gaining broader and deeper understandings of the biologic and social components of the fishery as well as the policy making process were indicated through written communication, presentations, and self reporting of their learning in the interview process. How scientific arguments changed over time to be more accessible to policy makers was evaluated by systematically comparing arguments used to support scientific claims or assumptions used to inform population models. As discussed in detail later, this shifted from reliance on scientific data alone to infusing arguments with norms such as the need to adhere to the precautionary principle. Not only did scientists communicate complex models, but they also argued for developing both targets and thresholds for the fishery. Systematic evaluation of how analogies and graphical representations changed over time revealed political learning by that community.</p>
<p>A small <italic>n</italic>, longitudinal study such as this is subject to some methodological limitations. Because this is a study that examines only one fishery and the interactions of the scientific community in policy making, it is difficult to isolate all of the potential explanatory variables. Additionally, with the elapsed time between the interviews and the experience, particularly regarding the earlier fishery management plans, some subjects had difficulty recalling dates and events. However, an in-depth examination of the processes provides a richly textured analysis of the ways in which scientific knowledge was transformed and communicated through the policy process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0963662510374177">
<title>5. New ways of thinking about blue crab management</title>
<p>The ways that scientists, policy makers, and agency administrators thought about the blue crab and its management underwent a number of fundamental changes in the late 1990s. These involved rethinking the manageability of the resource and using precaution in policy development, developing targets and thresholds, deciding upon the appropriate level of decision making, and implementing a suite of tools to achieve policy objectives. Each of these changes was fraught with conflict, both within the scientific community and among fisheries administrators and policy makers.</p>
<p>The ways in which information was created and communicated by a circumscribed community of experts were complex. It involved the creation of a Bay-wide community of scientists that were brought into the realm of policy advice through the creation of the Bi-State Blue Crab Advisory Committee (BBCAC) and its Technical Workgroup (TWG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662510374177">Beem, 2006</xref>). Through interaction within that community, experts modified their theories regarding the status of the resource and its life history and narrowed their scope of inquiry to focus on population and fishing effort. The ways that scientific evidence was presented to policy makers also changed in both form and fora.</p>
<p>The resolution of debates within the policy community involved policy advocates, primarily from the natural sciences, making compelling arguments based on selective interpretations of data and information regarding abundance indices and life history of the crab. These arguments were made through the TWG which, through time, became the funnel through which science entered the policy process. It established itself as the legitimate source of information for science/policy discussions and contained the conflict within a circumscribed scientific community. It kept debates over methodological differences and assumptions out of the public sphere, or communicated those debates in a manner that was much less passionate than previously experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662510374177">Virginia Natural Resource Leadership Institute, n.d.</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0963662510374177">
<title>6. Crisis of ideas</title>
<p>Neither the debates about population fluctuations nor the idea of setting thresholds for the fishery are new. Writing in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662510374177">1948</xref>, John C. Pearson examined the fluctuations of up to 47 percent in the period from 1929 to 1941. He attributed these fluctuations to river discharge (affecting the salinity of the Bay) and found no evident correlation between the abundance of adult females and their progeny. However, he cautioned:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>If the rate of fishing and the commercial catch increase materially in the future, it may well be that the spawning population would be reduced to a much smaller number than during recent years, and that the scarcity of spawners would then become the dominant factor in limiting natural reproduction. (p. 25)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In subsequent decades, both the rate of fishing and commercial catch increased and erratic fluctuations continued. Dramatic declines in the first few months of the crabbing season in 1968 relative to the previous year’s harvest prompted hearings before the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation in the US House of Representatives. Leading experts agreed that environmental factors appeared to be the primary influence for egg, larval, and young crab survival, but were in conflict as to whether or not human intervention was appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510374177">Cronin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510374177">Hargis, 1968</xref>). Consistent with the historical record for the animal, stock levels rebounded and “once again, loud concern was followed by rather quick recovery in the crab supply and good suggestions [for long-term management] were not implemented” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510374177">Cronin, 1998</xref>: 380).</p>
<p>After a precipitous drop in landings in 1992, concern over the state of the blue crab once again reached the policy agenda. The rebound in 1993–1994 assuaged fears for a short period. However, in 1995 data from the winter dredge survey (WDS) provided ambiguous information and opened the door for further debate about the status of the resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510374177"><italic>The Capitol</italic>, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>On February 2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510374177">1995</xref>, <italic>The Capitol</italic>, Annapolis’ newspaper, reported how varied the interpretation of the 62 percent decline in abundance was: Rom Lipcius, a crab researcher at VIMS, noted concern and that “it doesn’t appear that the population has quite collapsed, but it is at a very low phase.” Others were unequivocal stating, “I don’t think there is any question that we’re over fishing the blue crabs.” However, fisheries officials and watermen in Maryland questioned the veracity of the data and argued that the survey was too new. Fisheries Director for Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), W. Pete Jensen, ascribed the fluctuation to natural phenomena stating, “you can’t draw a conclusion that because the resource has declined, it’s in any kind of trouble.”</p>
<p>The battle over interpreting the declines in abundance and landings came to a head in the fall of 1995 when researchers released conflicting theories regarding the causes of declines in abundance and the threat of overfishing. Lipcius proposed that when Tropical Storm Agnes swept through the region in 1972 it caused widespread damage to the habitat upon which juvenile crabs depend. Since then, the overfishing of adult crabs hindered recovery. He warned that “if we don’t act now to limit [commercial and recreational crabbing harvests], another natural event could occur and crash the fishery” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662510374177"><italic>The Virginian Pilot</italic>, 1995</xref>). On the other hand, preliminary results of the stock assessment conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency’s (NOAA) Chesapeake Bay Office (CBO) ascertained that “while crabbing pressures have increased in Virginia and Maryland, enough adult crabs are mating to restore those caught each year.” M. Elizabeth (Bess) Gillelan noted, “We’re not in the danger zone yet” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662510374177"><italic>The Virginian Pilot</italic>, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>There were intense personality conflicts between two scientists at the center of the debate, Rom Lipcius of VIMs and Louis Rugolo, lead scientist for NOAA’s Chesapeake Bay Stock Assessment Committee (CBSAC). They were both described as having “strong personalities” that were often in conflict and public disagreements were described as highly impassioned clashes of personalities. This emotionally charged environment of divergent interpretations of the fishery left policy makers wondering “who’s telling the truth here?” (Swanson, 2003, personal communication).</p>
<p>The crisis at this time was one of scientific conflict and uncertainty. Policy makers did not know whom to believe. One group of scientists was raising the alarm and calling for action. On the other hand, another group of equally qualified scientists argued that the resource was not in dire condition. In order to make sense of it all, Ann Swanson, Executive Director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, proposed the BBCAC as a high level advisory committee of legislators and stakeholders to review Bay-wide science. Its technical work group (TWG) provided scientific advice for the committee.</p>
<p>Cognizant of the charged atmosphere that defined the scientific community, Swanson acted strategically in setting up the first meetings of the scientists in Colonial Beach, Virginia, at the offices of the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. Located halfway between the offices of VIMS and MDNR and held at an organization with which neither Lipcius nor Rugolo had any formal association, participants perceived this location as “neutral” territory.</p>
<p>In addition to the primary contestants in this scientific dispute, Swanson invited other blue crab experts and social scientists to participate in the TWG, who varied in their experience in the policy making arena. With its mandate to provide relevant information to the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC), VIMS scientists had extensive experience in giving policy advice. On the other hand, scientists with University of Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay Laboratory (CBL) had limited prior involvement. Thomas Miller, a scientist studying population dynamics at the CBL was first introduced to regulatory science through the TWG (personal communication, 2004), and eventually became its lead spokesman in support of the model that was eventually agreed upon.</p>
<p>By November 1996, the TWG had prepared discussion papers for the BBCAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510374177">BBCAC, 1997</xref>). These discussion papers—which addressed the status of the stock, economic issues, and habitat quality—outlined the areas of consensus and disagreement among the scientists engaged in the process. They were very “matter of fact” in presenting the points of tangency and conflict. In reading them, one does not get a sense of the intensity of the conflict among the members of the group that had been displayed in public meetings beforehand.</p>
<p>However, the final release of the <italic>Stock Assessment of Chesapeake Bay Blue Crab (Callinectes sapidus)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662510374177">Rugolo et al., 1997</xref>) in May 1997, rekindled passionate debate among blue crab scientists. At issue were two points. First, the assumption upon which the population model was based was that the blue crab could live up to eight years. Scientists in the region believed that the crab had a much shorter lifespan. Second, despite this extremely conservative assumption, the population model found that the crab population had not collapsed. The following month Rom Lipcius released his own research that contradicted the assessment. Once again, they were at loggerheads. However, shortly thereafter, Rugolo and Gillelan, the most vocal detractors, transferred to other offices outside of the Bay and did not participate in BBCAC or TWG for its duration. Their departure reconfigured the community of scientists participating in the development of fishery policy for the Bay, and, in effect, limited adversarial positions within the group. Interestingly, after their departure, the TWG based its studies and advice on the model assumptions initially posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662510374177">Rugolo et al. (1997)</xref>.</p>
<p>What the above account reveals is more complex than the epistemic communities’ literature suggests. The TWG was less of a community and more a fragile group consisting of a handful of individuals that were prone to conflict along interpersonal, as well as professional, lines. Consensus was facilitated, in part, not from learning, but from redrawing the boundaries of the group. However, conflict had its place. Its intensity captured the public’s and the policy makers’ attention. In the sections below, I examine the debates that took place within the TWG, how they were infused with values inherent in a precautionary approach to management, and how evidence was communicated to facilitate learning.</p>

<sec id="section7-0963662510374177">
<title>7. Narrowing the question</title>
<p>While the TWG was born out of controversy over conflicting determinations of available crab stocks, consensus did emerge and the group communicated rather unambiguous guidelines to inform policy development. However, consensus was not simply a function of scientific advances, but rather the result of reconfiguring the group, demands for definitive answers along very narrow parameters for decision making, and a shared normative framework of applying a precautionary approach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662510374177">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reflecting the complexity of the fishery, the TWG initially presented a broad range of factors that needed to be considered in managing the resource which included stock status and the impact of fishing effort on abundance, economics and management issues, and habitat considerations. Through these presentations, policy makers became more attuned to the multidimensionality of managing this fishery as well as the dearth of data and developed models to explain its fluctuations (Baxter, 2004, personal communication).</p>
<p>In the first two BBCAC meetings of 1997, TWG members presented findings regarding the status of the stock. Not surprisingly, Louis Rugolo (January) and Rom Lipcius (July) presented incompatible findings at the two meetings—though both concluded that management should be risk averse. Where that bar was set, however, was at issue. Rugolo’s analysis concluded that there was no crisis, while Lipcius’ report implied that there were serious problems with the fishery. After hearing the two presentations, “committee members expressed their desire to have the different scientific studies seek a way of integrating disparate views so that a unified management approach could be maintained” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510374177">BBCAC, 1997</xref>). Again in 1998, policy makers commented on the need for quality information:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Co-Chairman Delegate Robert S. Bloxom [Va.] spoke to the committee concerning the legislative perspective and managing a resource like the blue crab. He mentioned regulatory agencies and the legislature must rely on good scientific data … Bob referred to a letter which questioned the status of the stock of blue crabs, the mixed messages that have been expressed and <italic>the fact that decisions must be based on absolute certainty</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510374177">BBCAC, 1998</xref>, emphasis added)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While policy makers were presented with a range of causes and environmental conditions that contributed to the health of the stock, by 1999 the question that became the dominant driver of TWG inquiry was “How many crabs can we pluck from the Bay, either commercially or recreationally, before we threaten the health of the stock?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510374177">Chesapeake Bay Commission, 2000</xref>: 32). Policy makers were asking for the scientists to focus on <italic>one dimension</italic> of the problem, that a line be drawn, and that it be drawn consensually by TWG. However, it was within a context that was more nuanced than simply having “problems <italic>thrust upon</italic> the relevant researchers by political forces that take scant heed of the feasibility of the solutions they demand” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662510374177">Ravetz, 1990</xref>: 270, emphasis in original). Instead, researchers were involved in negotiating which question was appropriate to ask, with some even acknowledging that political attention was an important source of research funding—if the politicians asked the “right questions” their research would get funded (Anonymous scientist, personal communication, 2004).</p>
<p>During this time, the question changed from “is the stock in trouble and why?” to “how many crabs can we take?” The former pertains to policy core beliefs—which include perceptions about causality and the general seriousness of the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662510374177">Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith, 1999</xref>: 122–3). The latter appears to be a “secondary aspect” (which includes policy preferences vis-à-vis regulations)—i.e. “to what degree, if at all, do we need to adjust fishing effort?” While the fishing effort question does not necessarily imply that there is a problem, it does attribute causality to the crabbers. In other words, not only was the question narrowed, it was re-framed as being more simply about regulations related to fishing effort.</p>
<p>In 1999, the legislatures in Maryland and Virginia allocated $150,000 each for a two-year study of the blue crab. While the funding “kicked the TWG into high gear,” it also set a specific deadline for the TWG to develop specific parameters to guide policy action for the fishery (Swanson, 2003, personal communication). As Jasanoff notes:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>In the regulatory context, a decision to wait for more data amounts to (or is perceived as) a decision not to act. Hence scientists involved in policymaking frequently find that they cannot credibly avoid accepting or rejecting a conclusion on the grounds that the matter calls for further study. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510374177">Jasanoff, 1990</xref>: 78)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, the tension between short-term political needs and long-term research goals made it ever more difficult for TWG members to slow down, evaluate or amend the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662510374177">Virginia Natural Resource Leadership Institute, n.d.</xref>: 3). Once set into place, the institutional context facilitated learning and the accumulation and transfer of knowledge through funding and interaction. However, at the same time, it may have stifled learning by setting a very narrow scope of inquiry and requiring a relatively rigid timeline.</p>

<sec id="section8-0963662510374177">
<title>8. Learning values and teaching models</title>
<p>The two-year study culminated in 2001 with the release of <italic>Taking Action for the Blue Crab</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510374177">BBCAC, 2001a</xref>). What was notable in this process was the way that scientific information was presented changed between 1996 and 2001. In the beginning of the crisis, it was a free-for-all at public meetings and in the press—with hand-drawn graphs and heated debates among the scientists. As the TWG gained its footing, participants contained the debates more narrowly to formal, facilitated meetings among scientists engaged in the research. Presentations before the BBCAC by TWG members followed a predetermined agenda and presenters were sometimes coached (Miller, 2004, personal communication). Swanson, acting as a policy entrepreneur, helped massage the message and create understandable graphical depictions of policy recommendations. Enhanced learning in the more structured contexts affirms policy-learning models posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662510374177">Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662510374177">1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510374177">Majone (1989)</xref>, and others. However, these models overlook how <italic>political</italic> learning (in this case, by scientists involved in the debates) was an important driver within these contexts.</p>
<p>Below, I examine how arguments for the age 8 parameter and the setting of targets and thresholds changed over time, revealing political learning on the part of the scientists and reflecting the transformation of information to accommodate policy maker preferences, which also helped shape new values. In both instances, the more persuasive arguments “were a careful blend of reason and persuasion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510374177">Majone, 1989</xref>: 37). What was probably the most potent lesson that policy makers learned, however, was not the numbers, targets, and thresholds. Rather, they developed a normative framework based on precaution that would inform their decision making and ease accepting the models that scientists presented. They learned that if the fishery were depleted to a certain level, it could become vulnerable to shocks outside of the fishery that could lead to stock collapse. A buffer zone or threshold should be established and, in light of scientific uncertainty, very conservative model parameters should be accepted.</p>
<p>Adopting a precautionary approach in fisheries management is an idea that has gained traction over the past decade. A key element is that “fishery management systems should err on the side of conservation, particularly when there is the chance of irreversible changes that may degrade the equity of future generations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662510374177">Berkes et al., 2001</xref>: 23). The notion has been articulated in international agreements such as the <italic>Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510374177">Food and Agriculture Organization, 1995</xref>) and the <italic>United Nations Straddling Stocks Agreement</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662510374177">United Nations, 1995</xref>) and was later legislated in the United States with the passage of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) in 1996.</p>
<p>The precautionary approach addresses uncertainty in understandings of marine resources and mandates a risk averse approach when long-term effects of fishing are unknown, opening the door for the infusion of values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662510374177">MacDonald, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510374177">Jasanoff (1990</xref>: 7) points out that “in the absence of sufficient hard evidence, decisions have to be made on the basis of available facts supplemented by a large measure of judgment.” Who should make this judgment is open to debate and deciding upon what level of risk is acceptable is generally regarded as value laden, and hence, beyond the narrow purview of scientists and should be left to elected officials, expert administrators, judges, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662510374177">VanderZwaag, 2002</xref>: 169). In the case of blue crab management in the Chesapeake, the TWG developed a population model and set the targets and thresholds—debating and deciding upon the level of risk that the fishing community, and society more broadly, would assume for this resource.</p>
<p>At the heart of developing a population model for the blue crab is the difficulty in measuring the age of the crab. Various techniques have been used over the years to age the crab, however, with limited success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662510374177">Ju et al., 1999</xref>). While new research is being conducted to use lipofuscin to determine age, the length-based method (measuring the width of the carapace) and returns from tagging studies are still the dominant tools used to determine year classes.</p>
<p>Assumptions about how long a crab lives have important ramifications in modeling the population and establishing biologic reference points for management decision making. The following discussion from the Rugolo Report elucidates this point:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The assumption that crabs, under virgin fishery conditions, could live to eight years of age, results in more biologically conservative, or risk averse biological reference points … if crabs lived a maximum of 4 years … fishing mortality rates could be greatly increased from the levels seen over the long-term in this fishery. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662510374177">Rugolo et al., 1997</xref>: 202)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Based on their observations, fishermen did not believe that crabs could live eight years, nor did scientists involved in fisheries research up and down the Atlantic coast. In a scathing review of the Rugolo assessment, a crab researcher writes:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The Stock Assessment report by Rugalo [<italic>sic</italic>] et al. is the most incredibly incompetent analysis of data that I have ever read … no one has presented a detailed description of the female or male blue crab that would substantiate its being six to eight years of age … To be blunt, it appears that none of the analysts, authors or reviewers know the details of the life history of the blue crab in Chesapeake Bay. (Personal communication on file with author)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another scientist referred to the model as “just bad science” and feared that using the model would eventually undermine the authority of scientific analysis in management decisions (Anonymous, 2003, personal communication). The veracity of the claim that the crab could live that long was again questioned at a meeting of blue crab scientists and managers that was convened by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in November, 2003 (personal observation).</p>
<p>Swanson summarized that the Rugolo Report said that the crabs were in pretty good shape at the time, using a model based on maximum age 8, which is equivalent to talking about a 132 year old man. She notes that initially the opponents of the model, “didn’t get it … they didn’t seem to be teachable … if they changed the number to a more realistic number, then the conclusion of the model was, ‘fish ’em up boys!’” This was clearly antithetical to a precautionary approach in light of declining harvests (Swanson, 2003, personal communication).</p>
<p>What was particularly notable was that despite basing the stock assessment model on an age 8 assumption, Rugolo did not find evidence of a stock collapse in 1997. Rugolo, in fact, described the stock assessment committee as “stunned and flabbergasted … we simply were not picking up the problem” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510374177">Leffler, 1996</xref>). The assessment concluded:</p>
<list id="list1-0963662510374177" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>No conspicuous declining trend in absolute abundance detected.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bay-wide stock can best be characterized by long-term dynamic equilibrium.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No evidence of the effects of fishery exploitation on recruitment—i.e. the ability of the stock to replace itself.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The Rugolo Report was controversial on two points: most of the scientific and fishing community thought it was simply outrageous to base a model on the assumption that a crab could live 8 years. Nevertheless, despite its heroic assumptions it did not pick up the problem. Its conclusions ran counter to what many members of the policy and scientific communities expected to hear. They “knew” something was wrong with the fishery, and that “something had to be done” (Swanson, 2003, personal communication).</p>
<p>How the controversy over the age 8 assumption was resolved was a matter of values. When advocating for a maximum age of 8 for the blue crab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662510374177">Rugolo et al. (1997)</xref> based their argument on scientific studies—a 1965 North Carolina tagging study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510374177">Fischler, 1965</xref>) which provided evidence that crabs could live at least 5 years and a 1989 Chesapeake Bay study conducted by Dr. James McConaugha where two returns suggested that crabs could live to be 8 years old. Their argument was undermined when McConaugha found that one of the tags had been previously reported and others speculated the tags were returned long after the crabs had died (McConougha, 2004, personal communication). Despite evidence to the contrary, the stock assessment continued to be based on the age 8 assumption. While the report appealed to a risk averse strategy, the authors did not emphasize a need for it. Debate continued to revolve on the contested empirical claim that a crab could live that long.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Thomas Miller adopted the rhetoric of a precautionary approach to persuade policy makers that an assessment model based on age 8 was appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662510374177">Miller, 2001</xref>). He provided a detailed background of the historical and legal arguments for implementing a precautionary approach and referenced the collapse of other industrial fisheries as well as international and national legal agreements mandating this approach in fisheries policy.</p>
<p>In addition, setting the stage for invoking the precautionary approach, he emphasized that maximum age must be estimated for virgin stock. Miller argued:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Considerable controversy over the estimate of maximum age used to estimate natural mortality will remain while there is confusion as to what maximum age means. It is important to realize that to be used in the approach we need an estimate of the maximum age in the COMPLETE ABSENCE of exploitation. Our everyday experience may not tell us much about the potential longevity of crabs given that they have been heavily exploited in the Chesapeake Bay for over 100 years. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662510374177">T. Miller, 2001</xref>: 23, emphasis in original)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Using this as a premise, he later argued that there is “incontrovertible” evidence that crabs live to be 5 years in an exploited fishery (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510374177">Fischler’s 1965</xref> study in North Carolina), which was corroborated by a tagging study in 1989 in Chesapeake Bay (McConaugha, personal communication, referring to returns corroborating 5–6 year lifespan). Thomas Miller sidestepped the problem of the veracity of the two returned tags that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662510374177">Rugolo et al. (1997)</xref> used to support the age 8 claim, relying instead on the precautionary approach, stating:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The evidence clearly supports a maximum life expectancy of 6 in a moderately exploited population. Applying the precautionary approach, the most prudent action would be to continue use of a maximum age of 8 in an unfished stock until such time that direct estimates of mortality rates become available. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662510374177">T. Miller, 2001</xref>: 24)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The two reports differed in how they constructed their arguments to persuade members of the policy community to accept the claim that the stock assessment model that they used should be based on a maximum lifespan of 8 years for the blue crab. While the former relied on the scientific data, in particular the two returned tags, Miller’s more persuasive arguments were a mix of scientific evidence and appeals to the evolving use of the precautionary approach in fisheries management.</p>
<sec id="section9-0963662510374177">
<title>Targets and thresholds</title>
<p>In addition to justifying using age 8 for management decision making by infusing values and data, the TWG introduced the concept of setting targets for the fishery. These were distinct from the threshold rate of extraction that could potentially lead to a collapse of the fishery. Dr. John Hoenig explained:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The threshold is a level where management should avoid at all costs and that the consequences of exceeding the threshold would be detrimental to the blue crab stocks. The target, on the other hand, would be a goal to achieve a certain level of biomass which could handle a certain fishing mortality rate that might fluctuate year to year and would be comfortably under the threshold level. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662510374177">BBCAC, 1999</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Over the next few years, scientists and policy advocates employed a number of different analogies to persuade policy makers of the need for targets. Communications evolved from “inscrutable graphs” to ones that were understandable to those without science backgrounds (Anonymous, 2003, personal communication). Analogies developed from using weight in 1999—comparing the ideal weight of a person to the target and the heaviest an individual can weigh and still survive with thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662510374177">BBCAC, 1999</xref>)—to walking on thin ice in 2000, “You may walk out there and come back, but if you keep walking out there, one day you are going to fall through” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510374177">Chesapeake Bay Commission, 2000</xref>: 33). Finally, the TWG found that comparing to a highway guardrail had the most purchase in communicating targets and thresholds. They argued, “if a driver approaches a guardrail, or actually collides with it, this is clear indication of being off course, and heading for greater danger … targets represent where one wants to be—on the road, not up against the guardrail” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662510374177">BBCAC, 2001b</xref>: 13). The target was the acceptable level of risk that “should” be assumed in the management of the fishery. How close to the threshold should it become? In this setting, it was the scientific community that made those decisions.</p>
<p>In addition to changes in analogies to be more persuasive, the way scientific information was graphically presented changed in the years 1999 and 2001. In 1999, the CBSAC Blue Crab Advisory Report presented a summary table of the four blue crab surveys. It included two different threshold rates for fishing mortality. One estimated by Rugolo et al. set the rate at <italic>F</italic> = 1.21, the other, estimated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510374177">T. Miller and Houde (1998)</xref> set the rate at <italic>F</italic> = 0.9. Both estimates relied on the assumption of maximum age of 8. The table indicated that there were different conclusions as to the status of the exploitable biomass and whether or not the fishery was above or below the fishing threshold, depending on which model or survey was used. The report was explicit in addressing the level of uncertainty in the fishery and that there were competing assessments of the stock status and effects of fishing. The management advice from the report of that year was that the “current unweighted average fishing mortality rate, averaged from four surveys, is 0.87, which did not exceed the threshold fishing mortality rates (<italic>F</italic> = 1.21, <italic>F</italic> = 0.90).” However, they cautioned that “there is an urgent need to establish target fishing mortality rates which are distinctly lower and more risk averse than current thresholds that are inappropriately interpreted as targets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510374177">CBSAC, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The 2001 CBSAC Advisory Report provided much more definitive numbers for both thresholds and targets—the latter not included in the earlier reports. Based on an assumption of age 8, the group had agreed upon a target that would preserve 20 percent of the spawning potential and a threshold that would preserve 10 percent of the spawning potential. With these limits, the CBSAC produced a graphic representation of fishing mortality rates with the target and threshold boundaries clearly delineated with bold lines. The bold representation belied the level of uncertainty in the fishery and the continued contestation in the broader scientific community over appropriate modeling for the fishery.</p>
<p>In addition to the use of analogies and graphs, TWG and CBSAC members referred to the consensual bases of their recommendations:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>There is a consensus among biologists that action needs to be taken to reduce fishing effort as a way to reduce fishing mortality. The context of this consensus is important. A focused review of appropriate targets and thresholds for Chesapeake Bay blue crabs was conducted by Maryland and Virginia biologists in 2000 with the help of outside experts from the National Marine Fisheries Service … The consensus among technical committee members is that it is risky to remain in the current situation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662510374177">CBSAC, 2001</xref>: 2–3)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Not only was consensus among scientists noteworthy in communicating policy, <italic>Taking Action for the Blue Crab</italic> stressed the consensus among <italic>all</italic> participants in the BBCAC in developing plans that were “workable and acceptable to a range of stakeholders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510374177">BBCAC, 2001a</xref>: 6). The Bay-wide consensus had a profound impact on policy making in the region.</p>
<p>Jack Travelstead, VIMS, noted that the VMRC was resolute in achieving the 15 percent reduction in effort because for the first time in Bay history they had scientific consensus that there was a problem. BBCAC had established biologically determined limits and targets to the fishery, and determined that an effort reduction was the appropriate course of action (Travelstead, 2004, personal communication). What is notable is that the focus of the study was on fishing effort—“how many crabs can we pluck from the Bay?” That was the question posed by policy makers that framed the two-year scientific enquiry. The TWG’s attention was focused on one dimension of a problem embedded in a complex ecosystem involving natural and social processes.</p>

<title>9. Conclusion</title>
<p>This study affirms a number of insights in the policy-learning literature. Scientific consensus is powerful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510374177">Haas, 1989</xref>). The composition of the community of experts is an important factor in providing legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662510374177">Peterson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662510374177">Valiante et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662510374177">C. Miller, 2001</xref>). Professional fora can enhance learning and interaction among scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662510374177">Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith, 1999</xref>). It also finds that framing a problem as instrumental (how many fish can we catch) as opposed to engaging the more difficult core beliefs, may facilitate discussion. Finally, it demonstrates that the infusion of values into discussions of public import, helps make “scientific” arguments more persuasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510374177">Majone, 1989</xref>). These are important insights and affirming their utility in understanding learning in the policy process is important.</p>
<p>However, what the fundamental question that these models overlook is, are policy makers and scientists learning the right things? Are they learning what they need to know to resolve the issue? Do the processes that are in place to winnow down the problem to something manageable to facilitate learning, potentially lead to perverse outcomes?</p>
<p>This research finds that scientists can, and do, teach policy makers, especially if there are scientific consensus, appropriate fora, and persuasive arguments that are not bereft of values. However, much of the literature does not address that we don’t always learn the right things. We can learn the wrong things, and learn them very well. Attributes of the policy process that enhance learning may paradoxically lead to learning the wrong questions by oversimplifying questions and requiring uni-dimensional answers, circumscribing communities of actors, and setting deadlines that conform to policy timetables.</p>

<p>The TWG addressed a number of factors affecting the fishery. In this section, I concentrate on the setting of targets and thresholds. Other areas of concern and controversy included disagreements on how to interpret the data, and arguments over how to explain declines in abundance and which model was appropriate. CBSAC and VIMS analyses differed as to whether or not the stock was at a moderate or low level of abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662510374177">Rugolo et al., 1997</xref>). CBSAC interpreted the decline in catch per unit of effort (CPUE) as that of a steady stock being exploited by increasing amounts of gear versus the VIMS interpretation that it was the result of increased effort combined with declines in stock abundance. Finally, at issue was the strength of the stock–recruitment relationship and whether the current level of stock abundance is to the point at which recruitment to the stock will begin to fail.</p>

<title>Author Biography</title>
<p><bold>Betsi Beem</bold> is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Government and International Relations at the University of Sydney. Her research focuses on the roles of science and policy learning for marine policy and protected areas. She has done extensive work in the development of fisheries policies in the Chesapeake Bay and the policy dynamics that led to the re-zoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Her current work examines the implementation of the World Heritage Convention for natural areas in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and how policy instruments create new domestic political institutions that may provide opportunities or constraints to national and international advocacy groups and scientific communities; the global diffusion of marine protected areas as policy instruments; and a comparison of marine protection policies in the US and Australia.</p>
