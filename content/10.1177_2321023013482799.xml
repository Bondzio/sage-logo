<p>Bina Agarwal’s <italic>Gender and Green Governance</italic> is a magisterial work of astounding erudition. The book starts with a deceptively simple question: what difference does it make when more women are on local forest protection councils? This is the same question raised by numerous studies of gender quotas in local government. But, distinguished from the more straightforward studies, Agarwal mercilessly probes the analytical depths of this question as though she were digging into the roots of a tree and following them out to their farthest extensions. In the course of this exploration she unearths connections to a wide range of literatures: local government, governance of the commons, women in politics, the politics of representation and accountability, women and development, the politics of poverty, civil society and forest management. The work is thoroughly inter-disciplinary, not only drawing on these many bodies of literature, but also on methodology from sociology (sample surveys) and econometrics (multiple regressions) to address questions at the centre of political science. While resplendent with field interviews and statistical tables, its ultimate significance is as a thought-provoking examination of political institutions—what makes them legitimate, efficient, inclusive, representative and stable over time.</p>
<p>The book begins with an analytic discussion of the different stakes men and women have in forest preservation and what that might mean for forest governance. Men are more interested in timber while women are more concerned with firewood and fodder. Their interests have different time trajectories, men’s more occasional and long-term, women’s interests more everyday. Women’s interests are cross-cut by class, for landed women have both money and alternative private sources of firewood that landless women do not. Agarwal asks how does one ensure that women’s interests are represented? Is membership on councils adequate? What will ensure that they attend meetings? What will enable them to speak up? Will landless women’s interests be represented if they are not on the councils? How disabling is inequality? How important is office-holding? What sorts of women are chosen as office-holders? These questions compel a distinction between presence and representation. Agarwal’s careful analysis of all the steps that constitute effective representation provides a model for research on this key question.</p>
<p>Her other major concern is governance: what difference do women’s voices make in decision-making? In this realm as well, Agarwal breaks down the issue into many steps: promulgating rules, enforcing rules, serving women’s interests and reaching the goals of forest preservation. Her detailed knowledge of forest use and the wide variety of local methods and rules used to govern it provide a model for studies of policy implementation. Underlying the details she poses a key question of governance: to what extent are people with a direct interest in the outcomes able to make decisions that serve a larger or long-term goal at the cost of their own interests?</p>
<p>The empirical core of the book reports the results of her field research on forest councils in Gujarat and Nepal. This included two years of conducting focus groups throughout India that yielded many insightful observations, and a rigorous survey of 135 community forest institutions (CFIs) selected by scientific sampling techniques that yielded data for econometric analysis. She also consulted records of meetings and violations, and asked villagers to draw maps of their forests. Different readers will find each of these techniques more or less accessible and compelling, but in combination they construct a uniquely authoritative picture. It should be noted that not only does this represent a great amount of work, but also some of it was conducted at considerable risk during the insurgency in Nepal.</p>
<p>What do we learn? For those interested in representation and in local government, Agarwal’s finding that having more women in councils increases their participation—and that a critical mass of 25–33 per cent is necessary for effective participation—is not surprising, but it adds a strong underpinning to this widely accepted, but little tested, position. More noteworthy, particularly to theorists of the commons concerned about the effect of heterogeneity, is her finding that prior equality among women is not essential for women to assert themselves. Indeed, women from disadvantaged households, if present in sufficient numbers, can be more outspoken in public forums for they are less constrained by social norms and have more at stake in forest access. Overall, she finds that the gender composition of the executive committee of the CFI is a good proxy for women’s effective participation.</p>
<p>For those interested in forest management or in accountability, the most significant finding is women’s capacity to make these institutions effective. Despite their lack of experience with public institutions, by all accounts (Agarwal imposed strict objective measures) the councils run entirely by women or with more women proved to be better guardians of the forest. Despite their more urgent needs for forest produce, councils with more women supported stricter rules for forest use, harsher penalties and more consistent implementation. Where landless women participated in decision-making, the rules allowed somewhat more collection but well below what the forests could sustain.</p>
<p>However, of importance for those concerned with energy poverty, the larger context of gender inequalities within which women operate restricts their capacity to address their needs for clean cooking energy. Women’s opinions are often dismissed because they are illiterate (even where the men are also), women disproportionately bear the costs of forest closure by having to walk further to locate firewood, they are more often blamed for violating access rules (despite a higher proportion of men among reported violators), and their need for firewood is dismissed as a mere women’s issue. On the other hand, since men require fodder for animals, this is accepted as a household concern.</p>
<p>For the politically minded, Agarwal provides an extended analysis of strategies for making CFIs more effectively serve women’s interests. She examines the value of forums for women to formulate a collective interest apart from the CFI, of alliances between women on CFIs and federations of Self Help Groups, of more systematic linkages between government and village women’s representatives, and of gender-progressive civil society organizations. But she notes that the problem of household energy cannot be solved at the local level. Therefore, her ultimate concern is to empower women for full participation in policies that will bring about the needed shift away from dependence on limited forest resources to alternative sources of fuels, building materials and livelihoods for long-term environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>In the course of this extremely important analysis, the book offers many memorable observations: the burdens of household energy poverty include undercooking food and in winter, heating only enough water for the husband to bathe. Men intent on stealing timber often take women along because they can threaten forest guards with the threat of reporting molestation if they are apprehended. Older women are more protective of the forest on behalf of their grandchildren than younger women needing fuel. Of critical significance to field researchers, villagers’ reports on CFI issues are generally the same as focus group discussions, but quite different from records. And for those of us who are amateurs concerning forests, the book provides rich details about the products of forests, the people dependent on them and the complexities of managing them.</p>
