<abstract>
<p>Concern exists regarding care patients receive while boarding (staying in the emergency department [ED] after a decision to admit has been made). This exploratory study compares care for such ED patients under “Inpatient Responsibility” (IPR) and “ED Responsibility” (EDR) models using mixed methods. The authors abstracted quantitative data from 1,431 patient charts for ED patients admitted to two academic hospitals in 2004-2005 and interviewed 10 providers for qualitative data. The authors compared delays using logistic regression and used provider interviews to explore reasons for quantitative findings. EDR patients had more delays to receiving home medications over the first 26 hours of admission but fewer while boarding; EDR patients had fewer delayed cardiac enzymes checks. Interviews revealed that culture, resource prioritization, and systems issues made care for boarded patients challenging. A theoretically better responsibility model may not deliver better care to boarded patients because of cultural, resource prioritization, and systems issues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Emergency department (ED) crowding is a burden worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712457426">Fatovich &amp; Hirsch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712457426">Institute of Medicine, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712457426">Khare, Powell, Reinhardt, &amp; Lucenti, 2009</xref>). A major reason for crowding is difficulty transferring ED patients to inpatient units when hospitals are full (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712457426">General Accounting Office, 2003</xref>). Concern exists regarding care patients receive while “boarding”: waiting in the ED after a decision-to-admit has been made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712457426">Greene, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712457426">Liu, Thomas, Gordon, Hamedani, &amp; Weissman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712457426">Maa, 2011</xref>). Despite concern about the quality of care provided to boarded patients, scant data exist on frequency and determinants of boarding. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712457426">General Accounting Office (2003)</xref> surveyed all 2,021 nonfederal, metropolitan, general medical, and surgical care hospitals. Of the 1,489 responding hospitals (74% response rate), 31% reported that three-fourths of patients spent 2 hours or more boarding in the ED; nearly 20% reported patients boarding for 8 hours or more. In 2005, the American College of Emergency Physicians surveyed 2,434 U.S. ED directors where boarding was defined as waiting 4 or more hours in the ED after admission. Among the 1,328 (54.6%) who responded, 16% reported having more than 10 boarded patients per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1077558712457426">Vanlandingham &amp; Tubbs, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712457426">Felton, Reisdorff, Krone, and Laskaris (2011)</xref> found that 47% of Michigan hospitals were boarding patients on a single Monday evening. These studies indicate that boarding is widespread.</p>
<p>Hospitals may use one of two organizational models to manage boarded patients, which we define as the “Inpatient Responsibility” (IPR) model and the “Emergency Department Responsibility” (EDR) model. The frequency with which hospitals use either model is unknown. Within the IPR model, the inpatient service is responsible for boarded patients. Under the EDR model, emergency physicians (EPs) maintain responsibility for boarded patients until ED departure. Despite the closer proximity under the EDR model of the responsible physician to the patients and their nurses, the IPR model may be superior to the EDR model for several reasons. Transferring responsibility to inpatient teams frees EPs to attend to incoming ED patients, allowing inpatient teams to manage the more chronic aspect of patients’ conditions. EPs’ training and usual practice focus on stabilization, disposition, and preliminary diagnosis than on inpatient management; essentially their skill set does not include the management of boarded patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712457426">Hockberger, 2005</xref>). Also, the ED workforce operates through shift work, whereas inpatient teams often have more continuity of care. The IPR model decreases handoffs between caregivers, subsequently minimizing the loss of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712457426">Horwitz, Krumholz, Green, &amp; Huot, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, as the very presence of boarded patients correlates with ambulance diversion and a crowded ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077558712457426">Schull, Lazier, Vermeulen, Mawhinney, &amp; Morrison, 2003</xref>), an EP is likely to have more acute patients and increased distractions at these times and less likely to provide high-quality care to boarders. In contrast, as inpatient units typically have a fixed capacity, the inpatient team is unlikely to have as many competing demands when patients are boarding.</p>
<p>This mixed-methods study aims to explore whether the IPR is a better boarding model in two academic hospitals.</p>
<sec id="section2-1077558712457426">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>This study is the first to explore whether outcomes for boarded patients are more favorable under the IPR than the EDR model. Specifically, through quantitative analysis, we compared three measures of quality of care: delays in laboratory tests, antibiotic administration, and home medication administration. We selected these outcomes for several reasons. First, all have face validity as important processes that can be time-sensitive, have defined standards at these two hospitals, and represent standard of care in an inpatient unit. We elaborate on the consequences of delays in these processes in our Method section. Second, a pilot study on boarding found medications and laboratory tests were frequently delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712457426">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Third, the Joint Commission mandates boarded patients receive appropriate and adequate care, treatment, and services throughout the hospital (Joint Commission on Accredition of Healthcare Organizations, 2004). We could have selected other common inpatient orders such as delayed deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis or type of diet but thought this might be difficult to measure because of lack of documentation. We subsequently obtained qualitative data to understand our quantitative findings and to explore providers’ experience of caring for boarded patients under each model.</p>

<sec id="section3-1077558712457426">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>According to James Reason’s “systems approach,” humans are fallible, and errors are not only expected but also consequences of upstream systemic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077558712457426">Reason, 2000</xref>). By comparing the causes of error to a slice of Swiss cheese, his description has provided many with the basis of understanding how harmful events occur and how they may be prevented. This metaphor is widely accepted by patient safety professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077558712457426">Perneger, 2005</xref>). The systems approach suggests that hazardous, unpredictable environments such as the ED should experience many errors because of gaps in the management of boarded patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712457426">Croskerry, Cosby, Schenkel, &amp; Wears, 2009</xref>). However, there are high reliability organizations (HROs) such as naval aircraft carriers that are known for their ability to perform without error despite hazardous, complex environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077558712457426">Rochlin, LaPorte, &amp; Roberts, 1987</xref>). One explanation is that HROs error-proof their systems by creating multiple defensive layers as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077558712457426">Reason (2000)</xref> describes. Furthermore, strong safety culture and accountability contribute to the ability of HROs to maintain high reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077558712457426">Roberts, 1990</xref>). Evidence suggests that health care organizations do not yet prioritize safety or operationalize safety in their systems and processes to the extent achieved in HROs such as naval aviation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712457426">Chassin &amp; Loeb, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712457426">Gaba, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077558712457426">Singer, Rosen, Zhao, Ciavarelli, &amp; Gaba, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on HROs and Reason’s system approach has increasingly been applied to improve safety of health care delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077558712457426">Roberts, Madsen, Desai, &amp; Van Stralen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077558712457426">Roberts &amp; Tadmor, 2002</xref>). For example, hospitals have sought to develop multiple defensive layers to minimize errors as in the monitoring of laboratory values. To monitor a given patient’s laboratory results, computers highlight critical values, laboratory technicians alert caregivers if dangerous laboratory values are found, and multiple caregivers review laboratory values during daily rounds. Ideally, each layer is foolproof. In reality, opportunities for error in each layer remain, continuously opening and closing. The presence of gaps does not ordinarily result in a bad outcome. However, if gaps in multiple layers align, the risk increases that the trajectory may result in damage for patients.</p>
<p>Applying the Swiss cheese metaphor to the ED suggests that the EDR approach may be less reliable than the IPR model because the EDR model opens more gaps that can potentially result in an adverse outcome than the IPR model. EPs’ work conditions are less conducive to safe care: They are not generally accustomed to providing care that addresses patient’s chronic needs (i.e., inpatient-type care), work in shifts that increase handoff frequency, and are continually distracted by new, potentially more unstable patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077558712457426">Magid et al., 2009</xref>). These all represent gaps under the EDR model that create opportunities for delays and adverse events that are less present under the IPR model. On the other hand, under the IPR model, the EP is nearby and able to assist if a boarded patient suddenly becomes unstable and needs assistance, creating an extra layer of protection.</p>
<p>Given the EDR model theoretically has more gaps as a responsibility model, we hypothesized that patients boarding under an EDR model would have more delays, errors, and adverse events than patients boarding under an IPR model. We then used qualitative data as a complement in explaining our quantitative findings.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1077558712457426">
<title>Study Design and Methods</title>
<p>We conducted this study at two academic, Level I trauma, nonprofit, urban hospitals with approximately 54,000 and 80,000 annual ED visits, respectively. Both are affiliates of the same health care network, are core teaching sites of an emergency medicine residency, and have similar Joint Commission ED quality measure scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712457426">The Joint Commission, 2011</xref>). One hospital switched from the EDR to IPR model in 2002, while the other hospital used the EDR model by default.</p>
<p>We studied these models using mixed-methods. We first analyzed secondary data from a project examining boarded and nonboarded patients, then interviewed providers to explore reasons for our quantitative findings. Methods were combined both for complementarity and confirmation; each method addressed the question differently, and insights from the qualitative data helped explain our quantitative findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712457426">O’Cathain, Murphy, &amp; Nicholl, 2007</xref>). Relevant institutional review boards approved this study.</p>
<p>The data collection, abstraction methods, and variable definitions for the data set used for the quantitative portion of this study have been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712457426">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, we used chart review and administrative database data and employed an explicit chart abstraction/implicit physician review methodology applied previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077558712457426">Sullivan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1077558712457426">Weissman et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We identified all ED patients admitted to the hospital for at least 26 hours with the diagnosis of chest pain, pneumonia, and cellulitis from August 2004 to January 2005. We chose these conditions as they are common reasons for ED presentation, have standard management guidelines, and admissions for these conditions require follow-up laboratory tests and antibiotics potentially overlooked in boarded patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712457426">American College of Emergency Physicians, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712457426">Campbell, Pierce, Burton-Macleod, &amp; Gerami, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712457426">Mandell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712457426">Marras &amp; Chan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077558712457426">Smith et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077558712457426">Stevens et al., 2005</xref>). We considered examining conditions such as syncope, abdominal pain, and trauma but concluded lack of standardized algorithms made assessment and comparison of quality of care difficult. To increase comparability, we excluded patients admitted directly to the catheterization suite, transferred from other hospitals, admitted to nonmedicine floors, less than 18 years of age (one hospital only treats adults), or in need of precaution rooms (who may have extremely long boarding times). In this study, we defined a boarded patient as a patients waiting in the ED after admission bed request; hence, all patients from the original study with this new definition were considered boarded patients. (An appendix for further explanation is available from the lead author on request.)</p>

<sec id="section6-1077558712457426">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Outcome measures included delays, errors, and adverse events. We examined delays for laboratory testing, administration of antibiotics, and home medications. For laboratory tests, a delay was defined as “greater than 2 hours after the standard expected interval between laboratory tests.” For chest pain cases, we examined delayed repeat cardiac enzymes (more than 10 hours after previous test) and delayed partial thromboplastin time (PTT) checks (more than 8 hours after heparin initiation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077558712457426">Raschke, Reilly, Guidry, Fontana, &amp; Srinivas, 1993</xref>). Delays in obtaining repeat cardiac enzymes can delay diagnosis of myocardial infarction and timely treatment. Delays in obtaining PTT may delay diagnosis of subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic PTT levels, which can lead to risk of clotting or hemorrhage. For cellulitis/pneumonia patients, “delayed antibiotics” were repeat doses of antibiotics administered more than 30 minutes after the standard dosing schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077558712457426">Shah, Schmit, Croley, &amp; Meltzer, 2003</xref>). Delaying antibiotic dosing may lead to infection progression. Patients had “delayed home medications” if more than 50% of their regular diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal home medications or their equivalents were not administered during 1.5 times the standard interval for their home medications.</p>
<p>We defined medications errors as wrong patient, wrong drug, drug–drug interaction, dose error, route error, frequency error, or incorrect strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712457426">Bates et al., 1998</xref>). Physician reviewers classified events as adverse events (and if preventable) or a near miss (and if intercepted), following Institute of Medicine and National Emergency Department Safety Study definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712457426">Committee on Quality of Health Care in America, Institute of Medicine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077558712457426">Sullivan et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Outcomes, with the exception of medication errors, were measured during the first 26 hours of admission. Since medication error times were not recorded, we could determine only that events occurred during patients’ ED stay or within the first 26 hours of their admission.</p>
<p>Our primary independent variable was a dichotomous variable representing the EDR or IPR model (i.e., hospital site). We a priori selected covariates that could affect outcome and included all of them in our multivariate logistic regression when sufficient outcomes allowed inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712457426">Ahrens &amp; Pigeot, 2005</xref>). Covariates that might affect outcome included patient demographics such as age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077558712457426">Murray, Bates, Ngo, Ufberg, &amp; Shapiro, 2006</xref>), sex, self-reported ethnicity, emergency severity index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077558712457426">Van der wulp, Schrijvers, &amp; van Stel, 2009</xref>), and comorbidities, using a Romano-adjusted Charlson comorbidity score, modified for use with ICD-9 codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077558712457426">Romano, Roost, &amp; Jollis, 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077558712457426">1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077558712457426">Schneeweiss et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077558712457426">Tanabe, Gimbel, Yarnold, Kyriacou, &amp; Adams, 2004</xref>). We also controlled for ED and hospital controls that either theoretically or empirically have been associated with adverse events; ED crowding (using the Emergency Department Work Index) at bed request time, and admission day hospital occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712457426">Bernstein, Verghese, Leung, Lunney, &amp; Perez, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712457426">Jones, Allen, Flottemesch, &amp; Welch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077558712457426">Sprivulis, Da Silva, Jacobs, Frazer, &amp; Jelinek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1077558712457426">Weissman et al., 2007</xref>). We included covariates that were found to be significantly different between patients boarding under the two models.</p>
<p>We used the National Emergency Department Safety Study instrument for chart abstraction, adapting it for our project after piloting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712457426">Burstin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077558712457426">Sullivan et al., 2007</xref>). The principal investigator (PI, SWL) trained research assistants (RAs) and supervised abstraction. RAs were blinded to study hypotheses.</p>
<p>To establish reliability, we randomly re-abstracted 4% of charts. Kappa values were measured for the presence of a certain home medication (0.84), presence of a medication error (0.76), and presence of a possible adverse event (0.51). To avoid relying on the judgment of RAs to determine if delays occurred, we instructed them only to record times of laboratory results or medication prescription and administration. We (SWL, YC) subsequently calculated whether delays occurred based on the definition of delay, which varied according to the standard dosing of the medication or laboratory interval. Our Kappa values indicate moderate to nearly perfect agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712457426">Landis &amp; Koch, 1977</xref>). Chart abstractors flagged charts more frequently than the PI for adverse events. As described previously, any chart flagged by any abstractor was sent to two independent reviewers to determine if an adverse event or near miss had occurred so this “over-flagging” would not have a significant impact on the results.</p>
<p>We first performed Wilcoxon and chi-square analyses of differences in patient characteristics. We then tested two hypotheses: (a) EDR patients experience more delays, errors, and adverse events during the first 26 hours of admission than IPR patients and (b) EDR patients have more delays and adverse events while boarding than IPR patients. We defined the start time for both admission and boarding as the admission bed request time. For our first hypothesis, we examined differences in outcomes during the first 26 hours of admission, as this was the original study’s data collection period and increased our sample size. We originally selected this period to have a 24-hour period of observation after becoming boarded patients (defined as 2 hours after bed request in the original study), but could not localize events to occurring in the ED. For our second hypothesis, we observed delays or adverse events that occurred per hour of boarding (admission bed request time to ED departure). This allowed localization of events in the ED but resulted in a decreased sample size, as patients not only had to be in the ED but also had to have an outcome at risk during that time.</p>
<p>We examined differences in outcomes over the first 26 hours of admission and while boarding using logistic regression models. Covariates were included when sufficient outcomes existed to allow for inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712457426">Ahrens &amp; Pigeot, 2005</xref>). We conducted a sensitivity analysis by altering our outcomes definitions. Specifically, we examined whether any, 25%, or 75% of home medications were delayed. For cardiac enzymes, we defined delays as 8 or 9 hours after the previous test. For PTT, we defined delays to be 6 or 7 hours after heparin initiation. For antibiotics, we defined delays as 1 and 2 hours after the standard interval.</p>
<p>A previous study found that 28% of ED patients had an undesirable event while boarding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712457426">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). With 1,431 charts, our study had more than 80% power to detect a 25% difference in undesirable events between EDR and IPR patients at the .05 level. We powered our study originally to detect a difference in this composite undesirable event score; however, as patients had variable exposures (e.g., chest pain patients had more opportunities for delays than pneumonia patients), we examined each outcome separately. Hence, we were likely underpowered for outcomes such as medication errors. We used SAS 9.2 (Cary, NC) for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The qualitative portion of the study sought to explain our quantitative results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712457426">Johnstone, 2004</xref>). Through semistructured interviews we sought providers’ perspective on boarded patients. We included internal and emergency medicine residents from both hospitals and ED nurses who worked at least 20 hours weekly. We randomly selected names from staffing lists. We decided not to interview attendings who are less likely to be the providers to whom patients or nurses first turn for questions. After supervisory approval, we emailed participants to request a confidential interview. We obtained informed verbal consent after providing institutional review board–approved fact sheets and determined sample size a priori with a plan to expand sampling if we did not reach saturation. If participants did not respond to two emails, we randomly selected other providers. Participants received a $25 gift certificate.</p>
<p>Our final sample included 10 providers: two ED residents, who worked at both sites; four medicine residents (two from each hospital); and four ED nurses (two from each hospital). Participants had an average age of 37.5 and 11.8 years of experience as a physician or nurse; some worked under both models.</p>
<p>One investigator (SL) conducted, audio-recorded, and transcribed the semistructured interviews, which consisted of eight main open-ended questions on care for boarded patients, the two models, and potential explanations for our quantitative findings. (An appendix with instrument available on request from lead author.) Based on inductive research methods, these questions were followed with probing questions designed to reveal further details of caring for boarded patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077558712457426">Seidman, 2006</xref>). Thus, a general view of the experience of caring for boarded patients emerged. Interviews lasted approximately 30 minutes.</p>
<p>We generated codes inductively by reading and rereading the primary data and deductively from theory and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712457426">Bradley, Curry, &amp; Devers, 2007</xref>). Two study investigators (SWL, KW) read all transcripts and discussed common themes and ideas generated from the first reading. A code list was developed; one transcript was coded independently by two researchers (SWL, KW). There was substantial coding interreliability; Kappa value was .71 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712457426">Armstrong, Gosling, Weinman, &amp; Marteau, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712457426">Bradley et al., 2007</xref>). Words, phrases, and sentences were extracted and categorized into themes. Analysis concluded when all interviews were coded and analyzed and when thematic saturation was achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712457426">Bradley et al., 2007</xref>). We used qualitative software for this analysis (Atlas-ti 6.1, Berlin, Germany).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 1,467 patients were eligible for this study. We excluded 11 misclassified patients (those whose admissions diagnoses did not match the medical reason for admission) and 25 patients whose charts we failed to locate after multiple attempts. Our final sample was 1,431 charts (811 chest pain, 387 pneumonia, and 233 cellulitis).</p>
<p>No significant differences were found between IPR and EDR patients in terms of age, triage severity, or shift of arrival. EDR patients were more likely to be male, arrive by ambulance, have longer ED lengths of stay, and have lower adjusted Charlson comorbidity scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712457426">Table 1</xref>). There was a significant difference in ethnicity between IPR and EDR patients. Median boarding time was much shorter at the IPR model hospital, at 2.13 hours (interquartile range = 1.30-3.72 hours) versus 5.63 hours (interquartile range = 3.00-10.77 hours) at the EDR model hospital.</p>

<p>Overall, our quantitative results did not support our hypothesis. The IPR model of caring for boarders was not consistently associated with higher quality of care than the EDR model. When examining metrics for over the first 26 hours of admission, EDR patients had delayed home medications more often than IPR patients (46.4% vs. 36.5%, <italic>p</italic> = .01, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712457426">Table 2</xref>). However, EDR patients had fewer delayed cardiac enzyme checks (15.9% vs. 32.9%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), fewer delayed PTT checks (33.6% vs. 52.1%, <italic>p</italic> = .004), and adverse events than IPR patients (1.7 vs. 3.7, <italic>p</italic> = .02). No differences were found in antibiotic administration, medication errors, preventable adverse events, or intercepted near misses.</p>

<p>Multiple regression analysis revealed that EDR patients were more likely to have delayed home medications (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.30, 2.96) but had lower odds of having a delayed cardiac enzyme (AOR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.30, 0.79), and an adverse event (AOR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.23, 0.90) than IPR patients over the first 26 hours of admission (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712457426">Table 4</xref>). Conversely, EDR patients had lower odds of having a delayed home medication (AOR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.13, 0.95) than IPR patients while boarding. EDR patients had lower odds of a delayed cardiac enzymes (AOR = 0.22; 95% CI = 0.06, 0.79) than IPR patients while boarding. There were no consistently significant findings in our sensitivity analysis. Overall, delays in home medication administration depended on the exposure period (time spent boarding) whereas EDR patients consistently had fewer delays in cardiac enzymes than IPR patients.</p>

<p>We explored our quantitative results by collecting qualitative data. In the qualitative portion of the study, providers consistently identified boarded patients as being in “limbo.” Ambiguity over who was ultimately responsible for the patient, especially under the IPR model, or postponing elements of care because, according to one internal medicine resident, “they are going to go to the floor soon anyway,” contributed to this sense of “limbo.” Providers described the advantages of the IPR system as a model that prevented delays in the inpatient work-up, minimized poor handoffs, and freed the ED team to attend to incoming patients. However, communication between nurses and inpatient physicians under the IPR system was challenging because of a lack of relationship with the inpatient teams, difficulty identifying the responsible physician, as well as physical separation (e.g., some inpatient physicians may be on an inpatient floor 20 floors above the ED). The EDR model was perceived as advantageous because the responsible physician was easier to find and physically closer. However, EDR model disadvantages included a lack of training on inpatient care and EPs primary focus on the patients newly presenting to the ED, as well as distractions. While specific systemic difficulties were different at the two hospitals, three themes were similar between the two models that made care for boarded patients challenging under either model: differences in culture, resource prioritization, and computer and laboratory systems.</p>
<p>First, differences in culture, “the context in which care is delivered,” between the ED and inpatient services added to challenges in caring for boarded patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712457426">Pronovost et al., 2006</xref>). At the EDR model hospital, one internal medicine resident thought that
<disp-quote>
<p>beyond writing for their home medications that would be appropriate for them to get and making sure that they remain stable . . . the ongoing advancement of the plan . . . should be first provided by the inpatient service. [However,] . . . we don’t really think a patient is our patient until they (sic) arrive on the floor. So those patients are truly waiting . . . to a certain extent they are sort of neglected.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>An ED resident’s point of view was that
<disp-quote>
<p>we’re often in a situation where we . . . almost play the role of the medicine doctor . . . a role that we’re not trained [for], nor are we equipped to really play . . . we are asked to do things that are probably out of our scope of practice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hence, the inpatient care plan can be delayed within the EDR model.</p>
<p>Choice of workplace can also exhibit mindset differences, as a senior ED nurse emphasized:
<disp-quote>
<p>A lot of us . . . work down here for a reason. We didn’t want to do bedside nursing. We wanted to get to the next thing and keep things going. . . . I haven’t done floor nursing in over 30 years. So, when all of a sudden I see a ‘stat Lipitor’ it is like, “okay, yeah” . . . When you are doing something you really don’t want to do, in the environment where you want to be, it is frustrating.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Second, resource prioritization also compromises care for boarded patients. Under the EDR model, an ED resident thought “it would be much better . . . if we didn’t have the demands of taking care of so many other potentially much more active patients that are much more in need of acute care at that moment.” Regardless of the model, ED nurses usually care for boarded and incoming patients. One ED nurse explained that
<disp-quote>
<p>the volume and the acuity some days are so intense that by necessity these [boarded] patients are getting neglected. . . . It is hard to take care of an acute stroke and still keep this boarder patient in the back of your mind.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A nurse working at the IPR hospital noted that
<disp-quote>
<p>a nurse gives much better care when they (sic) have a well-defined job description. . . . But if you take an ED nurse’s mindset of just going a, b, c . . . which ones do I have to go to now, which ones can wait, and how do I get them to a point where they are either going to be admitted or go home, and then all of a sudden, in the middle of that, you give them a [boarded patient and say] . . . go take care of this acute chest pain from the street that is having an MI (myocardial infarction). And then make sure you get this other person a glass of water . . . that didn’t work.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>ED nurses emphasized that significant amounts of time are required in caring for boarded patients. Most explained that helping patients feel clean and comfortable, for example, “fluffing and buffing” according to one nurse, takes considerable time when there is continual pressure to increase ED flow, often leading to staff stress and burnout.</p>
<p>Third, our interviewees provided several examples of computer and laboratory systems issues that might account for our quantitative findings. Nurses and physicians at the IPR hospital noted that until several months before the study, inpatient teams placed inpatient orders into a physician order entry (POE) system that ED nurses could not access while patients were boarding. Hence, internal medicine residents had to verbally communicate with nurses regarding orders they wanted executed; subsequently, home medications or second sets of enzymes were not necessarily prioritized and ordered by the inpatient resident. On the other hand, providers noted that at the EDR model hospital, all orders were handwritten, and there is an ED point-of-care laboratory that processes cardiac enzymes more quickly. ED laboratory tests at the IPR model hospital are all processed at the central laboratory.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We conducted this mixed-methods study to explore the care provided to boarded patients under EDR and IPR models of care at two facilities. Although we hypothesized that the IPR model would be superior to the EDR model because it allowed the ED team to care for new patients and decrease the number of handoffs, our quantitative data did not demonstrate the IPR model’s superiority in terms of delays, errors, or adverse events. In fact, our quantitative results did not support either model of caring for boarders to be consistently associated with higher quality of care than the other. While we found that the odds of a home medication delay were higher under the EDR model than the IPR over the first 26 hours admission, which supported our hypothesis, we also found the opposite when limited only to home medication delays while boarding. Furthermore, patients experienced fewer cardiac enzyme delays when managed under the EDR model compared with the IPR model, which also contradicted our hypothesis.</p>
<p>Our findings should be considered preliminary given that data were derived from only from two hospitals, and there are important systems differences between the hospitals and their boarding processes. Based on this sample, the median boarding time at the EDR hospital was over twice that of the IPR hospital. The IPR hospital’s rate of patient room turnover may be superior to the EDR hospital’s given that the IPR’s hospital capacity was on average higher than that of the EDR hospital. As the EDR hospital’s median boarding time was longer, their exposure period was longer. This may favor the EDR model in our rate calculation (as the denominator would be larger) as well as the boarding time regression analysis. Furthermore, ED nurses and hospital physicians at the IPR hospital may not initiate chronic care in the ED given the shorter boarding times. Also, given EPs are designed to focus on unstable patients, they may more reliably manage critical patients and avoid adverse events, as was found in our results.</p>
<p>Our qualitative results also suggest that a theoretically better responsibility model may not reliably deliver better care to boarded patients because of gaps such as varying cultures, resource prioritization, and other systems issues. These themes leave boarded patients in limbo as management of boarded patients has not been included in the ED or internal medicine culture and new, more acute patients distract providers. Also, the difficulty communicating between ED nurses and the inpatient team may affect care for boarded patients as communication breakdowns are the leading causes of inadvertent patient harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712457426">Leonard, Graham, &amp; Bonacum, 2004</xref>). Similarly, ED nurses may prefer consulting familiar colleagues, EPs, especially in times of crisis, which may also explain our quantitative findings. Also, the inability of ED nurses at the IPR hospital to see inpatient orders for boarded patients may explain why delayed home medication rates were much higher when we limited analysis to events while boarding. As our qualitative data revealed, this may indicate difficulty implementing an inpatient standard of care for the inpatient team as well. Furthermore, the EDR hospital had an ED point-of-care laboratory, potentially accounting for the lower rate of laboratory test delays among EDR patients as ED point-of-care laboratories typically have faster processing times. While plausible, these themes should be tested in a broader range of facilities to determine if they explain the overall lack of quantitative difference among these ED models.</p>
<p>This study is the first to examine responsibility models for boarded patients. While multiple studies have shown that boarding and prolonged ED length of stay are associated with undesirable outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712457426">Chalfin, Trzeciak, Likourezos, Baumann, &amp; Dellinger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712457426">Liu et al., 2009</xref>), poor communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712457426">Apker, Mallak, &amp; Gibson, 2007</xref>), lost revenue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712457426">Bayley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712457426">Falvo et al., 2007</xref>), and longer hospital length of stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077558712457426">Richardson, 2002</xref>), literature has focused on how to minimize boarding time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712457426">Amarasingham, Swanson, Treichler, Amarasingham, &amp; Reed, 2010</xref>) rather than on care delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712457426">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Ideally, boarding would be eliminated or minimized; however, pending solutions to crowding, hospitals must address how to best manage these patients.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, providers reported that culture, resource prioritization, and systems issues affect care of boarded patients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1077558712457426">Ummenhofer et al. (2001)</xref> found that ED performance is more influenced by different cultures and philosophies between disciplines than position. Furthermore, given that formal triage systems exist in the ED but not elsewhere in the hospital, it seems natural that ED staff noted their cultural philosophy of resource prioritization and focus on sicker patients affects boarded patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712457426">Iserson &amp; Moskop, 2007</xref>). Also, it is likely that a multitude of other systems issues affect care of boarded patients. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077558712457426">Magid et al. (2009)</xref> found that ED physical environment and staffing issues were reported as areas critical to patient safety.</p>
<sec id="section9-1077558712457426">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our study had several limitations. First, the study was retrospective and not randomized. Confounders such as other patient and hospital characteristics may account for our results, such as differences in laboratory systems, hospital size and staffing level, and physician order entry. We lacked sufficient outcomes to control for exposure time in our boarding time analysis, potentially affecting outcomes as median boarding time at the EDR hospital was much longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712457426">Ahrens &amp; Pigeot, 2005</xref>). The findings were only from two academic, tertiary hospitals and are not be generalizable as other hospitals may not implement the models in a similar way. Chart abstraction methods have inherent limitations in measuring quality of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712457426">Luck, Peabody, Dresselhaus, Lee, &amp; Glassman, 2000</xref>), though we followed best practices for chart review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712457426">Gilbert, Lowenstein, Kozio-McLain, Barta, &amp; Steiner, 1996</xref>). There may be valid reasons patients did not receive medications that were not explicitly documented. Furthermore, because of budget limitations, physician reviewers and interviewers included authors who were not blinded to the study hypothesis, possibly introducing bias. Finally, either model may have been poorly executed, which may be more of an indication of the hospital’s ability to implement that model rather than the model’s impact.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our exploratory mixed-methods study did not demonstrate the superiority of the IPR model; rather, it identified strengths and weaknesses of EDR and IPR models, indicating some advantages of the EDR model and gaps in safety and quality under both systems. Although interviewees generally agreed with the theoretical advantages of the IPR model, we did not find consistent evidence confirming its superior safety/quality. Our case study should serve as a foundation for a larger multihospital study to determine under what conditions is one model superior to the other, and whether type of nurse, computer system issues, or other issues affect care for boarded patients. Administrators should focus on strengthening systems under either model to improve quality, such as by holding orders under the EDR model or expediting laboratory checks under the IPR model. Additional opportunities for improving ED reliability may include standardized checklists, improving handoffs, creating surge pods, or other policies to prevent such patients from being in limbo. Future studies should more thoroughly test and evaluate the merits and shortcomings of the ED boarding models as well as examine what interventions can improve quality care for boarded patients. Recognizing that caring for human beings may make the goal of consistently achieving high reliability elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712457426">Gaba, 2007</xref>), hospitals can continue to prioritize safety by seeking systemic improvements.</p>
