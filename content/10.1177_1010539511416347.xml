<abstract>
<p>To investigate the association between childhood obesity and neighborhood-level socio-economic and environmental factors in Japan. The prevalence of childhood obesity in 2008 was obtained from annual reports of the School Health Survey. The following 12 factors were publicly available: income per person, ratio of people completing up to college or university education, population density, total length of roads per square kilometer, number relative to the population of food and drink stores, restaurants, large-scale retail stores, convenience stores, passenger cars, traffic accidents, criminal offenses, and death by accidents. The ratio of people completing up to college or university education was inversely associated with obesity in boys and girls. No association was found between obesity and the other factors examined. An inverse association was shown between educational level and childhood obesity in both boys and girls. Further studies integrating associations between childhood obesity and neighborhood-level factors are needed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity in children has become a public health concern in many countries, with elevated rates of childhood obesity being associated with health problems such as an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular complications, and other physical and psychological disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511416347">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511416347">2</xref></sup> In Japan, with the westernization of lifestyles following World War II and large economic growth between the 1970s and 1990s, a rapid shift in dietary structures was reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511416347">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511416347">4</xref></sup> Consequently, obesity has become a health concern among both adults and children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511416347">5</xref></sup> Gaining a better understanding of the factors associated with childhood obesity is an important step in public health efforts aimed at reversing these disconcerting trends. Some previous studies from Japan have reported regional differences in childhood obesity. For example, Sakihara et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511416347">6</xref></sup> showed that excess body weight is more prominent in the northeast than in the southwest of the country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511416347">6</xref></sup> They suggested that children’s physical development exhibits local differences and is affected by regional factors. Matsushita et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511416347">7</xref></sup> showed that increasing trends in childhood obesity are rather more prominent in rural areas than in urban ones. However, no previous studies have investigated the association between childhood obesity and neighborhood-level socioeconomic factors in Japan. Based on the systematic review of the international literature on child obesity and socioeconomic factors conducted by Shrewsbury and Wardle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511416347">8</xref></sup> the studies that used neighborhood-level socioeconomic status were limited even in Western countries, although the limitations of focusing only on individual-level determinants have been increasingly acknowledged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511416347">9</xref></sup> In the present study, the association between childhood obesity and neighborhood socioeconomic and environmental factors was investigated by prefecture-level analysis in Japan using the results of a nationwide survey.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1010539511416347">
<title>Data Source</title>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has been conducting a “School Health Survey” of height and weight since 1948. The data are collected annually by sampling with probability proportionate to size. In 2008, information was collected from 72 380 kindergartners aged 5 years (from 1645 kindergartens), 270 720 elementary school children aged 6 to 11 years (from 2820 schools), 225 600 junior high school students aged 12 to 14 years (from 1880 schools), and 126 900 high school students aged 15 to 17 years (from 1410 schools). These samples corresponded to 4.7% of all children and adolescents in Japan in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511416347">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Japan, all children and adolescents of kindergarten and school age undergo a mandatory annual medical examination, performed by school doctors and nurses. Height and weight are measured by school nurses in early April. Height is measured to the nearest 0.1 cm without shoes and weight to the nearest 0.1 kg in underwear.</p>
<p>Data documenting the prevalence of childhood obesity in 2008, the latest reported result at the time of this analysis, were obtained from annual reports of the School Health Survey published by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511416347">11</xref></sup> In this report, a participant is defined as obese when the percentage overweight (%OW), calculated as [(Observed body weight) − (Standard weight for their height)]/(Standard weight for their height), is more than 20%. In Japan, %OW is traditionally the most commonly used unit for assessing obesity in children,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539511416347">12</xref></sup> whereas body mass index (BMI) is commonly used internationally. The reason for this is that BMI in childhood changes substantially with age,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539511416347">13</xref></sup> and therefore, a cutoff point related to age is needed to define child obesity, based on the same principle at different ages—for example, using reference centiles. However, in Japan, it was not until 2006 that the national cutoff points for overweight and obesity in children were defined by Inokuchi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539511416347">14</xref></sup> In 2007, Isojima et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539511416347">15</xref></sup> conducted a study to evaluate the correlation between %OW and BMI <italic>z</italic>-score and concluded that %OW can be used as a surrogate marker in children similarly to the globally used BMI <italic>z</italic>-score because the study showed that there was a strong correlation between the two. More specifically, +1 standard deviation (SD) of BMI corresponded to approximately +15%OW and +2 SD to +30%OW.</p>
<p>Data on childhood obesity are publicly available for children between 5 and 17 years of age according to prefecture. Japan’s 47 prefectures were therefore used here as the study units. Data related to socioeconomic and environmental factors were obtained from the annual reports of social welfare indicators of the Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539511416347">16</xref></sup> Those factors available to the public by prefecture and previously shown to be associated with childhood and adult obesity were used—namely, economic status,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511416347">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511416347">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539511416347">17</xref></sup> educational level,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511416347">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511416347">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539511416347">17</xref></sup> accessibility to various kinds of stores,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539511416347">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539511416347">19</xref></sup> urban/rural status,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511416347">7</xref></sup> car ownership,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539511416347">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539511416347">20</xref></sup> and neighborhood safety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539511416347">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Generalized linear regressions were performed to investigate the association between childhood obesity and socioeconomic and environmental factors at the prefecture level.</p>
<sec id="section5-1010539511416347">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>The prevalence of childhood obesity was used as the dependent variable. The prevalence of obesity in boys and girls was analyzed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1010539511416347">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>Data for the following 12 categories were publicly available by prefecture: (1) income per person as economic status; (2) the ratio of people having completed up to college- or university-level education as educational level; (3) food and drink stores per 1000 persons; (4) restaurants per 1000 persons; (5) large-scale retail stores per 100 000 persons (stores with &gt;50 workers); (6) convenience stores per 100 000 persons (self-service stores open &gt;14 hours per day, with food and beverage sections of area 30-250 m<sup>2</sup>) as accessibility to various kinds of stores; (7) total real length of roads per 1 km<sup>2</sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539511416347">22</xref></sup> (8) population density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539511416347">22</xref></sup> as urban/rural status; (9) total owned passenger cars per 1000 persons as car ownership; (10) traffic accidents per 100 000 persons; (11) officially recognized criminal offenses per 1000 persons; and (12) death by accidents per 100 000 persons as neighborhood safety.</p>
<p>SAS software 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) was used for the analysis. Each independent variable was divided into quartiles and quintiles. Continuous, quartile and quintile groups were compared to determine which explained the greatest amount of variability in child obesity based on the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values and then used in the analysis. To avoid overfitting, variables with a <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 in univariate analysis were defined as candidate variables. Variables introduced into the final model were selected by backward elimination. A <italic>P</italic> value of .025 that was corrected for multiple comparisons by Bonferroni correction was assumed to detect significance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .025 = .05/2)</p>
<p>Maps were created to depict the geographical distribution of obesity and socioeconomic and environmental factors that were found to have significant relationships with the prevalence of obesity.</p>

Note that the association between the prevalence of obesity and social factors was focused on in children aged 17 years for the following reasons. First, prevalence increases with age until it reaches a plateau at 12 years. Second, adolescence is often considered a critical period for a number of psychological and behavioral transitions, including eating habits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539511416347">23</xref></sup> Third, data pertaining to 17-year-olds is the last age for which childhood data are publicly available.

The following 4 variables were categorized into quartiles: income per person, food and drink stores per 1000 persons, officially recognized criminal offenses per 1000 persons, and death by accidents per 100 000 persons. The following 3 variables were categorized into quintiles: ratio of people having completed up to college- or university-level education, total real length of roads per 1 km<sup>2</sup>, and total owned passenger cars per 1000 persons. Density has a bimodal distribution, and almost half of the Japanese population, which was 57 000, lives in prefectures of more than 1000/km<sup>2</sup>—that is, Tokyo, Osaka, Kanagawa, Saitama, Aichi, Chiba, and Fukuoka. These seven prefectures were thus defined as urban and others as rural.</p>
<p>By univariate regression, the following variables were defined as candidate variables for both boys and girls: (1) income per person, (2) ratio of people having completed up to college- or university-level education, and (3) food and drink stores per 1000 persons. By backward elimination, the ratio of people having completed up to college- or university-level education were selected and had inverse associations with the prevalence of obesity in boys and girls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1010539511416347">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The importance of considering neighborhood characteristics as fundamental determinants of obesity is becoming increasingly apparent, although, at present, research into this area is still limited and evidence is still accumulating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511416347">9</xref></sup> Wardle et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539511416347">24</xref></sup> indicated that effective preventive interventions need to be developed at the societal, familial, and individual levels and implemented early in the adolescent years to reduce the social toll of growing disparities in health outcomes. Booth et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539511416347">25</xref></sup> claimed that if overweight is found to be more prevalent among some groups of children and adolescents, it may be appropriate to allocate health promotion resources differentially to those groups. Similarly to other countries, some studies in Japan have shown that the health of individuals is affected by neighborhood characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539511416347">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539511416347">27</xref></sup> Thus, the concept of social capital seems to apply to Japan also.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Shrewsbury and Wardle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511416347">8</xref></sup> conducted a systematic review of the literature on the association between socioeconomic status and childhood obesity. The studies examining the associations with neighborhood socioeconomic status showed mixed results: 2 studies found inverse associations (higher obesity in lower socioeconomic status neighborhoods), 2 studies found a mixed inverse association (ie, only within sub-populations or with certain adiposity measures), and 3 studies found no association. Moreover, individual-level studies showed that education was more consistently inversely associated with childhood obesity than any other indicator; 19 studies showed an inverse association, whereas only 5 showed no such association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511416347">8</xref></sup> It is noteworthy that educational level shows an inverse association with childhood obesity in the present study despite examining data according to area (prefecture)-based educational level.</p>
<p>Shrewsbury and Wardle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511416347">8</xref></sup> also mentioned an inconsistent association between parental income and childhood obesity, such that 7 studies showed an inverse association between family income and childhood obesity, whereas 8 studies showed no association between the two. This study showed that income was inversely associated with childhood obesity in univariate analysis but lost its significance in multivariate analysis. The present study supports the claim that development of obesity may be related to factors other than income, although this study was limited by the small sample size and use of mean income, which may not represent the true population in a given study unit. According to the theoretical framework proposed by Sobal and Stunkard,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539511416347">17</xref></sup> education influences knowledge and beliefs, whereas income is related to access to resources. Jaarsveld et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539511416347">28</xref></sup> suggested that knowledge and beliefs are key to a healthy lifestyle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539511416347">28</xref></sup> This study showed that neighborhood education is also an important factor in a healthy lifestyle, such as preventing childhood obesity.</p>
<p>In this study, there was no association between childhood obesity and any of the indicators related to stores, including restaurants. However, in this study, these indicators were nonspecific and did not include information about the type of establishment; for example, fast food versus traditional Japanese restaurants. The results of previous studies on the link between fast food restaurants and obesity prevalence are varied, and thus detailed investigation, including door-to-door surveys, is needed to clarify the association.</p>
<p>Many studies have hypothesized an inverse association between neighborhood safety and physical activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539511416347">22</xref></sup> with a lack of physical activity subsequently being related to obesity. However, this study showed no association between childhood obesity and neighborhood safety or between childhood obesity and family car ownership. In previous studies, car ownership was used as a variety of different proxies. For example, it was used as a proxy for physical activity in a report from Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511416347">3</xref></sup> and as a proxy for wealth in a report from the United Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539511416347">20</xref></sup> Compared with many other countries, Japan has a well-organized public transportation system, and as a result, the frequency of public transportation use is perhaps higher and the meaning of owning a private car might be different from other countries. Thus, any associations between this and obesity will also vary geographically and cannot be generalized. To show an association, individual investigations specific to the country would be required.</p>
<p>Although there have been well-documented gender differences related to obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539511416347">29</xref></sup> the significant neighborhood-level factor (education) in both boys and girls was the same in this study. There has been very little previous research that investigated gender differences in obesity using neighborhood-level determinants. Therefore, further studies with special attention to gender differences would be needed.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to consider in interpreting the results. First, the main limitation of this study is that BMI data for children are not publicly available by prefecture in Japan, unlike in other countries, and could not be used in this study. Second, using area-based measures always raises the problem of ecological fallacy—whether causal inferences at the population level are valid at the individual level. Third, only publicly available data were used for the analysis; as an example, although income, occupation, and education are known to be 3 important factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511416347">9</xref></sup> occupation could not be used in the present analysis. Additionally, as for income, the mean, which is used in this analysis as income per person, may not represent the true population in a given study unit. Also, indicators for restaurants were nonspecific and did not include information about the type of establishment, as noted above. Furthermore, the year the survey was conducted to collect the data varied depending on the variables as follows: income per person from 2005; food and drink stores, restaurants, and large-scale retail stores from 2006; ratio of people having completed up to college- or university-level education, convenience stores, total real length of roads per 1 km<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511416347">2</xref></sup>, total owned passenger cars, and death by accidents from 2007; and population density from 2008. Fourth, this was a cross-sectional study and thus was unable to determine time trends. Despite these limitations, the current study contributes to the existing literature for the following reasons. First, in this study, the same index (%OW) was used throughout the analysis, and a previous study showed a strong correlation between %OW and BMI <italic>z</italic>-score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539511416347">15</xref></sup> Second, the School Health Survey provides the most reliable data with the least bias on the level of childhood obesity in Japan. Third, the sample size used in the School Health Survey is sufficiently large to provide valid results on obesity levels among children in Japan. Fourth, this analysis overcomes problems created by self-reported information, which is often used to measure socioeconomic factors. Fifth, although specific information about stores, including restaurants, was not obtained, Guthrie et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539511416347">30</xref></sup> suggested that food bought away from home was higher in total fat and saturated fat on a per-calorie basis than food prepared at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539511416347">30</xref></sup> Moreover, food bought away from home also contained less dietary fiber, calcium, and iron on a per-calorie basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539511416347">14</xref></sup> Even a report specific to the Japanese situation said that noodles, sushi, rice dishes, pasta, curry and rice, and breads make up 70% of foods ordered when dining out for children aged 1 to 14 years. These foods consist mainly of carbohydrates and lack protein and yellow or green vegetables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511416347">3</xref></sup> Sixth, cross-sectional evidence is more consistent than prospective data linking neighborhood socioeconomic factors with obesity, although the reason for this is largely unclear. It is assumed that methodological issues could be involved (eg, loss to follow-up and selection of analytic strategies), but strong secular trends for weight gain in the general population may also be responsible. In addition, if socioeconomic differences strongly affect obesity at baseline, variation over time may be less apparent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511416347">9</xref></sup> Finally, some have argued that the annual reports of school health statistics from the Ministry of Education have shown numerous measurement values for body height and weight among large representative samples of school children and that no further analyses on the data sets for descriptive epidemiology of childhood obesity have been made mainly because of the limited accessibility to the original data sets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511416347">7</xref></sup> Therefore, no detailed epidemiological aspects of obesity in children have been shown using a nationwide representative sample in Japan thus far. It is hoped that the current study will trigger public access to the data, so that analysis from various perspectives can be conducted and evidence accumulated.</p>
<p>Further study, such as multilevel analysis or spatial analysis, would be needed to consider the influence of both neighborhood-level and individual-level socioeconomic factors on obesity because both levels of influence are important.</p>
