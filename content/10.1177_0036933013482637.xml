<title>Background and aims</title>
<p>The incidence of uterine carcinosarcoma and factors associated with its survival are little known and this study helps to address this question for women residing in north-east Scotland.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0036933013482637">
<title>Methods and results</title>
<p>Data were collected from women diagnosed with carcinosarcoma of the uterus residing in north-east of Scotland from 1991 to 2009. Kaplan–Meier plots and Cox regression analysis were used for analysis. A total of 43 women were analysed during this period. The median survival was 25 months. The estimated five-year survival for stage I/II disease was 52.5% (95% CI: 30.5–74.5%). The 2-year survival rate for stage III/IV disease was 46% (95% CI: 16–75%). There was an increase in the incidence during this period. Improved survival was seen in early-stage disease (FIGO stages I and II) and in the absence of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI; <italic>p</italic> = 0.015). A total of 26% of the women had a history of tamoxifen usage with no effect seen on survival. Multivariate analysis showed that when treatment modality and LVSI were adjusted for FIGO staging, there was no statistical significance in the survival outcomes.</p>

<p>Carcinosarcoma of the uterus is a highly aggressive neoplasm with a poorer prognosis compared to grade 3 endometrial carcinomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482637">1</xref></sup> It accounts for almost half of all uterine sarcomas and has an overall survival rate of 30–40%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482637">2</xref></sup> The carcinomatous component is the driving force, the sarcomatous element, which is either homologous (spindle cell sarcoma) or heterologous (e.g. rhabdomyosarcoma), being derived from this as a result of dedifferentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482637">3</xref></sup> The risk factors associated with carcinosarcomas are similar to endometrial carcinomas including nulliparity, obesity and pelvic irradiation. An earlier study from our region suggested an association between tamoxifen use and uterine carcinosarcoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482637">4</xref></sup> The prognosis of uterine carcinosarcoma is extremely poor because of a high tendency to metastasise even after surgery, radiotherapy or both.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482637">5</xref></sup> Even the patients with negative lymph nodes have a high recurrence rate and hence adjuvant therapy should be considered in all patients with carcinosarcoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0036933013482637">6</xref></sup> Approximately, 50% of women with stage I carcinosarcoma will have a recurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0036933013482637">6</xref></sup> The prognostic factors include the depth of myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), histological type, stage, extrauterine spread and the age. The initial management of carcinosarcomas of the uterus is surgery that includes total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal washings and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, even for early-stage disease. Lymphadenectomy is usually recommended for early-stage carcinosarcoma if the myometrial invasion is greater than 50% or if there is LVSI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482637">7</xref></sup> The adjuvant therapy remains controversial.</p>
<p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine the incidence over a 19-year period in a stable, geographically defined population and to check the effect of tamoxifen and other prognostic factors on survival in women with uterine carcinosarcoma. Our tertiary gynaecological oncology centre covers Grampian and Highland regions with a single pathology service in Grampian.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0036933013482637" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This retrospective study included all cases of uterine carcinosarcoma over a period of 19 years (January 1991–December 2009) diagnosed in women residing in north-east of Scotland. The cases were identified from the pathology database at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the clinical data were recorded from the patient’s case files. The histology slides were reviewed by two pathologists for diagnostic accuracy and for FIGO staging. The new FIGO 2009 staging was considered for final analysis. Data were collected from case note review on age, parity, menopausal status, co-morbidities (hypertension/diabetes/other medical conditions), use of tamoxifen in the past, previous malignancies, presenting signs and symptoms and the method of diagnosis. The histopathology data included the subtype of the carcinomatous component, presence or absence of heterologous elements, presence of LVSI, myometrial invasion and the revised 2009 FIGO stage. The data on management modalities were grouped as women who underwent surgery alone, those who received adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, those who received palliative treatment only and the minority who received no treatment following diagnosis. Finally, information was also collected on survival, recurrence and treatment of recurrent cases. Data on the incidence of endometrial adenocarcinoma in Grampian were obtained from the Information Services Division Scotland, Cancer Information Programme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482637">8</xref></sup> SPSS v 18.0 was used for data input and statistical analysis. Kaplan–Meier plot and Cox regression analysis were used for survival analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0036933013482637" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 59 cases were identified, but 16 case notes had been destroyed and accurate information was not available, so only 43(72.9%) were included in the analysis. There were 1642 uterine corpus malignant tumours during this period and carcinosarcoma accounted for 3.6% of the total. The median age at diagnosis was 67 years (range 44–88). Of the 43 cases, 41 (95%) were postmenopausal and 25 (58%) were multiparous. Of the 43 women, 13 (30%) did not have any co-morbidities while in the remaining 30 hypertension and diabetes were more frequent. Of the 43 cases, only 11 (26%) had used tamoxifen in the past. Around one-third (14 of 43) of the women had other malignancies in the past with breast cancer being the most frequent. More than three-fourth of women (33 of 43) had the diagnosis made by initial hysteroscopy and curettage. There were two cases which were diagnosed at histology, posthysterectomy. The rest had their diagnosis by out-patient curettage alone.</p>
<p>The distribution of stage categories using the new FIGO 2009 is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0036933013482637">Table 1</xref>. As there were only two women with stage II disease they were combined with the stage I in the analysis. Both the women with stage II disease are still alive 3 and 4 years after the initial diagnosis, respectively. One of them had surgery, including iliac lymphadenectomy, followed by adjuvant brachytherapy and the other had surgery without lymphadenectomy but combined with adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin/doxorubicin).

<p>The treatments received are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0036933013482637">Table 2</xref>. One-third of the women (14 of 43) had surgery alone. Just less than half (21 of 43) had surgery with adjuvant therapy. Two women did not receive any treatment as they were medically unfit. Of the 35 women, 13 who had surgery with or without adjuvant therapy also had pelvic lymphadenectomy. Of the 43, 19 (44%) are still alive from the time of initial diagnosis with 3 of them completing 10 years of follow-up. Of the 36, 12 staged women and 7 unstaged women had a recurrence. Among the staged women, four recurred within 6 months. Of these 12 women, 5 had chemotherapy, 3 had pelvic radiotherapy and 1 had chemoradiotherapy. The remaining three recurrent cases had no treatment due to unavoidable reasons: two developed vaginal fistulas and were not fit for aggressive therapy. One died before the commencement of treatment.

<p>The overall median survival was 25 months (95% CI: 5.6–44.4). Women with FIGO stage I or II tended to survive longer than those in stage III or IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0036933013482637">Figure 1</xref>). There was a statistically significant difference between stage categories for the unadjusted analysis (log-rank test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) but not when this was adjusted for treatment and LVSI using Cox regression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0036933013482637">Table 3</xref>). Due to the small number of cases, the 5-year survival could only be calculated for stage I and II disease, the estimated 5-year survival using Kaplan–Meier analysis was 52.5% (95% CI: 30.5–74.5%). The 2-year survival for stage III/IV disease was 46% (95% CI: 16–75%). The 95% CI is wide as the follow-up period for many patients is less than 5 years and the total number of cases in the study is small. Moreover, as most of the patients at stage III/IV either died or were censored before 5 years, a 5-year survival calculation was not possible.

<p>The histological subtype for the carcinomatous component was endometrioid in the majority (27 of 43) followed by serous in 9 (21%) of 43 cases. The sarcomatous component was homologous in 32 (75%) of 43 and heterologous in the remaining. There was no statistical difference in survival based on the type of sarcoma (homologous vs. heterologous) as shown by the log-rank test (log-rank test: <italic>χ</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482637">2</xref> </sup>= 0.82, df = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.37).</p>
<p>The presence of lymphovascular space invasion significantly reduced the survival. Women who had either surgery alone or surgery with chemoradiotherapy had similar survival curves and had a longer survival than those who had only palliation or no treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0036933013482637">Figure 2</xref>). It was not possible to analyse individual adjuvant treatments due to small case number and hence surgery with any form of adjuvant therapy was analysed against surgery alone and palliative/no treatment.

<p>Uterine carcinosarcomas are rare aggressive neoplasms and comprise only 2–3% of uterine cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482637">8</xref></sup> which is similar to our study population. Our population-based study included women diagnosed histologically with uterine carcinosarcoma from January 1991 to December 2009. The year 1991 was chosen, as this was the year when the multidisciplinary team meeting and formal tumour review were established in Aberdeen. This gave the assurance that cases were managed through multidisciplinary team with an agreed care pathway and histological assessment although we found that lymphadenectomy was not done consistently in all patients undergoing surgery. Even with a 19-year study period, there were only 59 cases and only 43 were suitable for analysis. This long time period explains the diversity of treatments as centralisation of management and local protocols evolved. This rather small number precluded an accurate calculation of the incidence rate. However, we observed a trend in increase in the actual number of cases in four of the five-year periods (1991–1995 = 11, 1996–2000 = 13, 2001–2005 = 17 and 2006–2010 = 24) similar to the overall trend in Scotland for uterine corpus cancer where the crude incidence rose from 11.9/100,000 person years at risk in 1990 to 22.4/100,000 person years at risk in 2008 (ISD Scotland).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482637">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The median survival was 25 months with 19 women still alive. Survival among women with uterine carcinosarcomas has always been poor due to its aggressive nature despite maximal surgical staging and postsurgery adjuvant therapy. We confirmed the high-risk nature of the tumour as even in stage I and II disease only 52.5% were alive at 5 years. There were seven women for whom FIGO 2009 staging was not possible as they did not have a full surgical procedure and the only pathological sample was the initial endometrial curettage. Despite the small number of cases, our study showed that early stage, absence of LVSI and surgery combined with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy were associated with longer survival. The multivariate analysis showed that when matched for FIGO stage with treatment and presence or absence of LVSI there was no statistically significant difference in survival. Our study also agreed with the previous literature that the type of sarcomatous element does not have a bearing on survival.</p>
<p>Our study results are similar to a study done by Wu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0036933013482637">10</xref></sup> on 45 women who showed a beneficial effect of adjuvant therapy which is in contrast with another study that showed systemic adjuvant therapy was not associated with longer survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0036933013482637">11</xref></sup> Two randomised controlled trials designed to study the effects of radiotherapy postsurgery (EORTC 55874 and Gynecological Oncology Group (GOG) 150) failed to show a survival advantage but showed effect on local control of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0036933013482637">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0036933013482637">13</xref></sup> There have been prospective trials lead by the GOG investigating various adjuvant chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy to check whether the survival can be improved,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0036933013482637">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0036933013482637"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0036933013482637"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0036933013482637">17</xref></sup> but ifosfamide with paclitaxel has been the preferred regimen with established superiority based on a randomised phase III trial conducted through the GOG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0036933013482637">14</xref></sup> In our study, 15 women received adjuvant chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic combination commonly used was ifosfamide/doxorubicin followed by cisplatin/doxorubicin and carboplatin/paclitaxel addressing the issue of different chemotherapeutic combinations over a 19-year period.</p>
<p>A past history of tamoxifen treatment, whilst present in 26% of cases, did not affect the survival.</p>
<p>Few studies have shown an association between tamoxifen usage and uterine carcinosarcoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482637">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0036933013482637">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, as only 72.9% of the total number of cases were analysed, this might have had an impact on the results of the study. Bearing the rare nature of this tumour in mind, the number of cases in this study is nevertheless small and possibly a larger Scottish wide study will give us more in-depth information on prognostic factors, survival and the treatment modalities.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0036933013482637" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Uterine carcinosarcomas are increasing in incidence parallel with endometrial carcinomas with no significant effect of tamoxifen on survival. We confirmed poor prognosis with a median survival of 25 months.</p>
<p>A larger study based on all Health Boards in Scotland could give a more accurate picture of the incidence rate and behaviour of this tumour, and further our understanding of the efficacy of various treatment modalities. By doing so, we could implement a standard adjuvant treatment protocol for uterine carcinosarcoma across Scotland and United Kingdom.</p>
