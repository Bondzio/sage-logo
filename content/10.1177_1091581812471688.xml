The PEA is a natural fragrance material that is widely used in perfumes, soaps, and lotions and is a major ingredient of natural rose oil. Following dermal (430, 700, or 1400 mg/kg body weight [bw]), gavage (430 mg/kg bw), or dietary (430 mg/kg bw) administration of PEA to rats, plasma concentrations of PEA were found to be low regardless of the route of administration. The plasma concentrations of phenylacetic acid (PAA, the major metabolite of PEA) greatly exceeded the concentrations of PEA and were highest after gavage, followed by dermal then dietary administration. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion were compared following topical application of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled PEA to rats, rabbits, and humans (specific activities of dosing solutions: 58-580, 164, and 50 µCi/mL, respectively). In rabbits, the plasma concentration–time profile for PAA was markedly prolonged compared to rats or humans. In humans, only 7.6% of the applied dose of PEA was absorbed, versus 77% in rats and 50% in rabbits. Based on a human dermal systemic exposure of 0.3 mg/kg per day from the use of multiple consumer personal care products containing PEA, a rat dermal no observed adverse effect level of 70 mg/kg per day, and the percentage of dose absorbed in humans, the margin of safety exceeds 2600 concluding that, under normal fragrance use conditions, PEA is not a developmental toxicity hazard for humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>humans</kwd><kwd> pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>phenylethyl alcohol</kwd><kwd>rabbits</kwd><kwd>rats</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January/February 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap> </article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1091581812471688"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) is a natural fragrance material that is widely used in perfumes, soaps, and lotions and is a major ingredient of natural rose oil.

The PAA was obtained from Fisons Scientific Apparatus (Loughborough, UK). Two groups of 32 rats supplied by Charles River UK, Ltd (Margate, Kent) were administered, 1 topical dosage of either 700 or 1400 mg/kg (0.7 or 1.4 mL/kg) PEA. The liquid was applied to an intact, closely clipped, 3 × 3 cm area of skin on the back of each animal. The area was then covered by an aluminum foil patch held in place by an adhesive bandage until sacrifice, to minimize oral ingestion or evaporation of test agent. An additional 2 groups of 4 rats were untreated and used as predose negative controls. At 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours post treatment, 4 rats from each group were euthanatized and exsanguinated. Plasma was immediately frozen at −20°C. The PEA and PAA plasma levels were determined using an HP5792A gas chromatograph coupled directly to a VG16F single-focusing mass spectrometer. The methodology for PEA detection was developed in the Department of Chemical Metabolism and Radiosynthesis at Huntingdon Research Centre Ltd. (Cambridgeshire, UK) and involved separation by capillary gas chromatography (GC) and detection by mass spectrometry (MS), using α-methylbenzyl alcohol as internal standard. Retention time of PEA and α-methylbenzyl alcohol were 3.4 and 3.1 minutes, respectively. The limit of detection (limit of quantification [LOQ]) for PEA was set at 0.03 μg/mL. The methodology for PAA detection was based on the method of Karoum et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1091581812471688">10</xref></sup> and involved separation by capillary GC and detection by MS of the pentafluoropropyl ester of PAA, using the deuterium-labeled analog, phenylacetic-d<sub>7</sub>acid, as internal standard. Retention times of PAA and phenylacetic-d<sub>7</sub>acid were 4.34 and 4.32 minutes, respectively. The limit of detection (LOQ) for PAA was set at 0.1 μg/mL.</p><p>In a second study, plasma and urine concentrations, as well as the pharmacokinetics of PEA and PAA, were determined after dermal or oral administrations of 430 mg/kg of PEA. Forty female CD nonpregnant rats supplied by Charles River UK, Ltd were administered PEA by topical application (0.43 mL/kg, equivalent to 430 mg/kg) as described above; 44 female CD nonpregnant rats were gavaged once with 0.43 mL/kg PEA (430 mg/kg PEA) in an aqueous PEG 200 solution, and 40 female CD nonpregnant rats were fed for up to 24 hours an <italic>ad libitum</italic> diet containing encapsulated PEA in a gum arabic matrix providing a nominal dose of 430 mg/kg. All groups had 4 additional rats that provided predose control plasma. Plasma samples were obtained from 4 rats from each treatment method at 10 or 11 time points ranging from 0.25 to 24 hours after the initiation of the treatment. The rats killed at 24 hours post treatment were housed in metabolism cages, and a 0 to 24 hour urine sample was collected and stored at −20°C, along with all plasma samples.

Purity (&gt;97%) was determined by thin-layer chromatography. The PAA was synthesized (Huntington Research Centre, Gillingham, UK) and its identity was confirmed by MS analysis. Metabolite identification was performed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/MS. The chromatography was performed in a reversed phase mode, using a solvent system of 0.1 mol/L sodium acetate-acetic acid: methanol and a flow rate of 2 mL/min at 4000 psi pressure. Hippuric acid, phenaceturic acid, PAA, and PEA had retention times of 4.2, 5.2, 11.4, and 14.2 minutes, respectively. Radioactivity was measured by using an LKB Liquid Scintillation Counter (Model No. 1219 Rackbeta `Spectral', LKB-Wallac, Turku, Finland) or a Philips Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (Model No. PW 4700, Philips NV.

Mean radioactivity totals of 47.1% and 57.2% of the 140 and 700 mg/kg dosages, respectively, were recovered (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1091581812471688">Table 5</xref>). The remainder was considered to have been lost via evaporation, as occurred in the rat studies.</p><p>Phenaceturic acid was the main component in the urine and accounted for 34% to 36% of the radioactivity at both dosage levels; hippuric acid and a conjugate of PEA each accounted for 2% to 3%. The PAA was not detected at any significant level (&lt;0.3%) in urine from the 140 mg/kg dosage, but it was associated with approximately 6% of the 700 mg/kg dosage excreted in the urine. These results suggest that the pathway for the formation of phenaceturic acid from PAA was becoming saturated at the 700 mg/kg level.</p></sec><sec id="section13-1091581812471688"><title>Studies in humans</title><p>Examination of the absorption and elimination of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091581812471688">14</xref></sup>C-PEA in 2 human male volunteers after single dermal applications of 10 mg (approximately 0.15 mg/kg) revealed that mean radioactivity concentrations of 3.5 ng/mL were detected in the plasma 15 minutes after application of the radiolabeled PEA. These levels rose to a C<sub>max</sub> of 13.8 ng/mL at 1.5 hours and then declined to 11.7 ng/mL and 3.1 ng/mL at 2 and 4 hours post treatment, respectively. All later samplings were below the limit of accurate detection (3.0 ng/mL). Because of the low level of radioactivity, plasma samples were not subjected to HPLC analyses.</p><p>During the 5 days after the single dermal application to the chest, a mean of 7.56% of the dosage was recovered in the urine. It was recovered only during the first 48 hours after application. Radioactivity in the feces was below the limit of detection. Most of the radioactivity was lost from the skin during the 6-hour exposure period, presumably due to evaporation; 2.60% of the dosage was recovered from the dressings and 0.64% from the skin washes at 6 hours (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1091581812471688">Table 5</xref>).</p><p>Two metabolites of PEA were detected in the urine. The major metabolite (4.1% of the dosage) was identified as phenylacetylglutamine, the glutamine conjugate of PAA.

No observable effect level or no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) values, as well as calculated margins of safety based on a maximum human exposure of 0.3 mg/kg per day for a 60-kg woman,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1091581812471688">11</xref></sup> varied greatly in the 4 rat developmental toxicity studies, although most of the variation was assumed to be due to differences in the routes of administration (gavage vs diet vs dermal application).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1091581812471688">4</xref></sup> It was not known whether species differences in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion also played a prominent role in these variations.</p><p>Results from the present studies suggest that species differences in dermal absorption were major factors in calculating a realistic margin of safety for PEA. Absorption through rodent skin is, in most cases, higher than through human skin, although there is no consistent pattern between the compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1091581812471688">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1091581812471688"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091581812471688">14</xref></sup> This higher absorption in rodent skin may be due to differences in morphology of the individual skin layers, or immunological or metabolic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091581812471688">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812471688"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1091581812471688">16</xref></sup> In addition, the percentage of absorption of a limited source of test article depends on the concentration and length of exposure and necessitates that (1) the exposure remains constant during the exposure period and (2) reflects actual use conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1091581812471688">17</xref></sup></p><p>To meet these criteria, single-dosage and repeat-dosage dermal absorption studies were used to explore exposure in rats. The same procedures were followed as in the developmental toxicity studies, except that the applied material was <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091581812471688">14</xref></sup>C-PEA, applied in dosages of 140, 700 or 1400 mg/kg per day. The PEA was readily absorbed from the skin and excreted primarily in the urine. There was no clear effect of dosage on the percentage of material absorbed, as measured by excretion of radioactivity (84% of the 140 mg/kg dosage was recovered; 79% in the 700 mL/kg dose from the supplemental study) with significant amounts of PEA lost due to evaporation, despite occlusion of application sites with foil and a porous bandage.</p><p>The rapid excretion of PEA was confirmed in a quantitative tissue distribution study in male rats, in which essentially all absorbed PEA from dosages of 140 mg/kg were eliminated from tissues by 12 hours. Some radioactivity remained in (decreasing order) treated skin, fat, kidneys adrenal glands, pancreas, and liver.</p><p>Autoradiography of pregnant rats reflected the distribution observed in quantitative studies in male rats. However, radioactivity was only observed in fetuses during peak blood levels in dams administered repeated dosages of 140 or 700 mg/kg PEA for 10 consecutive days, and then only in low or moderate concentrations.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of PEA in rabbits after single topical applications of 140 or 700 mg/kg was similar to that of rats (about 50% of the applied PEA was absorbed and subsequently metabolized, mostly to PAA, as in rats). However, in rabbits at a dosage of 700 mg/kg, the concentration–time profile of PAA was markedly different (prolonged, high levels for 24 hours), which was unlike the profile in rats. These results suggested a dose-dependent saturation of the glycine conjugation pathway in rabbits, which was confirmed by the presence of PAA in the urine.</p><p>A dermal absorption study in humans under simulated exposure conditions, in which 10 mg of radiolabeled PEA was applied to the chest, revealed that essentially all absorbed PEA was excreted in the urine within 24 hours. An average of only 7.6% of the total dosage was absorbed, compared to 77% in the rat (after 24 hours). Based on the results presented here, the rat and human dermal absorption data were used to revise the development toxicity margin of safety. This revision takes into account the estimated daily human exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1091581812471688">11</xref></sup> and the percentage of applied dermal dose that is absorbed by humans. These are then compared to the rat maternal and developmental NOAEL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1091581812471688">4</xref></sup> for dermal application and the percentage of applied dermal dose that is absorbed by rats. The margin of safety is calculated to be greater than 2600 based on the following:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>human exposure: 0.3 mg/kg per day × 7.6% absorbed by humans = 0.02 mg/kg per day;</p></list-item><list-item><p>NOAEL rat: 70 mg/kg per day × 77% absorbed by rats = 53.9;</p></list-item><list-item><p>53.9/0.02 = a margin of safety of 2695.</p></list-item></list><p>However, adverse developmental effects of the fetus are often considered to be due to excessively high peak exposures to the noxious agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1091581812471688">18</xref></sup> Therefore, calculation of peak plasma concentrations is also of interest in the estimation of a developmental toxicity margin of safety.
