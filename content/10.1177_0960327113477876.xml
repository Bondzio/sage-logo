<abstract>
<p>The present study was undertaken to evaluate the possible ameliorating effect of butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT), associated with ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in mice. The treatment of mice with Fe-NTA alone enhances ornithine decarboxylase activity to 4.6 folds, protein carbonyl formation increased up to 2.9 folds and DNA synthesis expressed in terms of [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine incorporation increased to 3.2 folds, and antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes decreased to 1.8–2.5 folds, compared with the corresponding saline-treated controls. These changes were reversed significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in animals receiving a pretreatment of BHT. Our data show that BHT can reciprocate the toxic effects of Fe-NTA and can serve as a potent chemopreventive agent.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oxidative stress results when the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overrides the antioxidant capability of the target cell, resulting in the occurrence of oxidative damage due to the interaction of reactive oxygen with cellular macromolecules.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327113477876">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327113477876">2</xref>
</sup> ROS are formed in cells during many endogenous and exogenous metabolic processes. ROS may attack and modify membrane lipids, proteins and DNA, giving rise to a large number of altered and damaged products, which may result in the initiation and progression of carcinogenesis by induction of gene mutations, chromosomal damage and cytotoxic effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0960327113477876">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327113477876">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) is an iron complex of a chelating agent which has earlier been demonstrated to accumulate more redox active iron in hepatocytes and has been shown to be a potent hepatic tumor promoter. Sakurai and Cederbaum<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327113477876">5</xref>
</sup> have revealed that Fe-NTA causes apoptosis in hepatocytes and promotes liver fibrosis. Fe-NTA is a potent hepatic tumor promoter which acts through the generation of oxidative stress.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327113477876">6</xref>
</sup> In addition, Fe-NTA induces oxidative stress by downregulating hepatic NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase activity and produces protein carbonyl contents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0960327113477876">7</xref>
</sup> Administration of Fe-NTA has also been reported to result in hepatic iron loading associated with extensive peroxidation of membrane lipids in vivo.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0960327113477876">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Diet has been suggested to have a significant impact on the process of the cancer development.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327113477876">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0960327113477876">10</xref>
</sup> Past investigations suggest that several dietary constituents may be important factors capable of increasing or decreasing the cancer incidence. Thus, specific and predetermined manipulations of the diet may represent a promising and noninvasive approach to minimize cancer. These studies promoted us to search for a novel and effective agent that may suppress toxicity. Fruits, vitamins and other several herbs with diversified pharmacological properties have been shown to be a rich source of cancer chemopreventive agents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0960327113477876">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0960327113477876">12</xref>
</sup> Most of these agents intervene at the promotion stage of multistage carcinogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0960327113477876">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many such agents having the capability to inhibit carcinogenesis both at the initiation and at the promotion stages possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0960327113477876">14</xref>
</sup> The prevention of Fe-NTA-induced hepatotoxicity by gallic acid has also been reported previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0960327113477876">10</xref></sup> The inhibition of Fe-NTA-mediated carcinogenicity in mice by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a plant lignin, was observed in our earlier studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0960327113477876">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>When administered prior to, or at the time of carcinogen exposure, the phenolic antioxidant butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) was found to be an effective inhibitor of carcinogenesis in several target organs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0960327113477876">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0960327113477876">17</xref>
</sup> Since liver is the largest gland and a major metabolic organ in the body, it is necessary to understand the effect of BHT on Fe-NTA-induced hepatic damage. This study was designed to provide sufficient amount of data to show the chemopreventive potential of BHT, utilizing a well-established animal model of oxidant-induced hepatic damage. In the present study, the effect of prophylactic treatment of BHT, a known antioxidant on Fe-NTA-induced hepatic oxidative stress, hyperproliferation and injury has been shown.</p>

<title>Effect of BHT on Fe-NTA-mediated generation of hepatic oxidative stress, ornithine decarboxylase activity induction</title>
<p>For studying the effect of BHT on Fe-NTA-mediated generation of hepatic oxidative stress and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) induction, 30 mice were taken and were divided into five groups of six mice each. Group I received saline and served as negative control. Group II received an oral treatment of only higher dose BHT and also served as control. Group III received only corn oil (vehicle of BHT) for a period of 1 week through the gavage. Groups IV and V received 1 mg and 2 mg/animal/day in 0.2 ml of corn oil of BHT, respectively, daily for 1 week orally. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment of BHT or corn oil, the animals of groups III, IV, and V received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 9 mg Fe/kg body weight of Fe-NTA.</p>
<p>All the 30 animals were killed 12 h after the treatment of Fe-NTA by cervical dislocation within a short period of 1 h. Just before killing, blood of these animals was collected in different test tubes from retro-orbital sinus for the estimation of serum transaminases, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminases (sGOT) and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminases (sGPT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Liver of these animals were collected and processed for the ODC activity and estimated for antioxidants including glutathione (GSH) and antioxidant enzymes: GSH peroxidase, GSH reductase, GSH S transferase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and catalase.</p>

<title>Effect of BHT on Fe-NTA-mediated changes in transaminases and LDH</title>
<p>The effect of pretreatment of BHT on Fe-NTA-mediated enhancement in the activities of serum transaminases (sGOT and sGPT) and LDH is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0960327113477876">Figure 2</xref>. Fe-NTA administration led to about 2.2 and 3.2-fold enhancement in the values of both sGOT and sGPT and 3.4-fold increase in LDH activity, respectively. Administration of Fe-NTA to mice receiving a pretreatment of BHT, however, led to a significant diminution in these values. The effect was dependent on the dose of BHT administered; though both doses of BHT used, a significant reduction in the values of sGOT and sGPT and LDH activities could be observed. Higher dose of BHT resulted in bringing down these indices to almost 1.7-, 1.4- and 3.0-fold, respectively, as compared to the Fe-NTA-treated group. There was up to 32–68% decrease in the activities of these enzymes compared to Fe-NTA groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fe-NTA is a known renal carcinogen. However, little is known about its carcinogenic potential in liver. Considerable progress has been made relating free radicals, especially ROS, in living cells to pathogenicity of various diseases including diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, aging and carcinogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0960327113477876">35</xref>
</sup> Humans could be significantly affected if exposed to NTA in drinking water or to its metal complexes. Dietary intake of natural antioxidants, therefore, has been suggested to be useful against the effects of these mutagenic and carcinogenic agents in minimal amounts that are not toxic to the body.</p>
<p>A large number of agents including natural and synthetic compounds have been identified as having potential cancer chemopreventive value inhibiting mutagenesis hyperproliferation or induce apoptosis or differentiations, which are the critical characteristics of chemoprevention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0960327113477876">36</xref>
</sup> Identification of naturally occurring carcinogens and anticarcinogens provides new strategies for cancer prevention.</p>
<p>One of the known phenolic antioxidants, BHT, has been commonly used in foods, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products to prevent oxidation of liable lipid compounds, and it also modifies certain enzyme system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0960327113477876">16</xref>
</sup> Similar to previous reports which have shown protective effect of BHT in various animal models, a dose-dependent decrease in the Fe-NTA-mediated oxidative stress in liver of BHT-pretreated mice was also observed in this study. Our dose selection for BHT in minimum amounts does not show any toxic effect in mice and also suggests that these doses may not be toxic to human consumption.</p>
<p>In the present study, we observed that Fe-NTA treatment enhances ODC activity, DNA synthesis, inhibits GSH, activities of GSH-metabolizing enzymes, transaminases (sGOT and sGPT) and antioxidant enzymes in liver. In addition to these, Fe-NTA treatment induces hepatic microsomal lipid peroxidation and generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Our data shows that pretreatment of animals with two different doses of BHT suppressed Fe-NTA-mediated induction of ODC activity and DNA synthesis, reversed the decrease in the activities of GSH-metabolizing enzymes, antioxidant enzymes and depleted the level of reduced GSH in liver. Also, there was decrease in the levels of protein carbonyl formation and lipid peroxidation in a group of mice pretreated with BHT. The inhibitory effect of BHT against Fe-NTA-mediated hepatic damage as obser-ved in the present study may be due to the counteracting effect of its antioxidant property, which may be related to its ability to prevent the in vivo activation of carcinogens to reactive forms and increasing detoxification of reactive intermediate by inducing relevant enzymes such as GSH-S-transferase, GSH peroxidase, GSH reductase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, catalase and so on.</p>
<p>The exact mechanism by which BHT suppresses Fe-NTA-mediated hepatic toxicity and hyperproliferation is not known. In the present study, higher activities of sGOT and sGPT have been found in response to iron-induced oxidative stress. Such increased activities might be attributed to the leakage of these enzymes from the injured liver cells into the blood stream because of the altered liver membrane permeability.</p>
<p>ODC activity and [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine incorporation are widely used as biochemical markers to evaluate tumor-promoting potential of an agent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327113477876">21</xref>
</sup> Although ODC and polyamines are necessary for cellular proliferation, induction of ODC is involved in tumor promotion and cell transformation, and cultured tumor cells often contain high levels of ODC. Therefore, ODC is considered as an attractive target in both chemotherapy and chemoprevention. It has also been reported that induction of ODC activity and DNA synthesis plays an important role in carcinogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0960327113477876">37</xref>
</sup> A sharp decrease in Fe-NTA-mediated enhancement in hepatic protein carbonyl, ODC activity and [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine incorporation by the pretreatment of BHT also suggests the protective role of BHT against Fe-NTA-induced hepatotoxicity in mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0960327113477876">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results presented in this study clearly indicate that pretreatment of animals with BHT ameliorates Fe-NTA-mediated hepatic toxicity and thereby suppresses hyperproliferation. The major pathway for its action and efficacy seems to be its effectiveness to intercept the oxyradical and protect cellular membrane damage against the deleterious effect of ROS. In summary, present data suggest that BHT may be an effective chemopreventive agent and may offer protection against Fe-NTA-mediated hepatic damage in mice.</p>
