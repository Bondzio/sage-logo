<abstract>
<p>A study of siblings tested a relational dynamics model set in the family and based largely on Belief Systems Theory. Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 351) in a 3 (biological relatedness) × 2 (participant sex) × 2 (other sibling sex) quasi-experimental design evaluated their relationship with their sibling. Path analysis was used to track the effects of the independent variables on verbal aggression and verbal comforting. Mediating variables completed two distinct processes. The egocentric assertion of power and hostility between siblings mediated a sequence related to selfish emotions within the individualistic affect system. This sequence is anchored in parent–child verbal aggression and culminates in sibling verbal aggression. Empathy and strength of sibling bond mediated a sequence related to prosocial emotions within the cooperative affect system. This process is anchored in parent–child closeness and ends with expressions of comfort between siblings. The results provide an explanation for the emotional ambivalence of sibling relationships.</p>

<body>
<p>When a person unleashes aggressive language on another, it often casts a pall over their relationship. A message that attacks the worth of the other person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261927X11425035">Infante &amp; Wigley, 1986</xref>) tends to sharply reduce the likelihood of a supportive, comfortable exchange. Meta-analysis indicates that the negative effect of verbal aggression on verbal collaboration between acquaintances is indeed quite large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X11425035">Hamilton, Buck, Chory, Beatty, &amp; Patrylak, 2008</xref>). Yet a hallmark of sibling relationships is that hostility and criticism are often accompanied by attachment and praise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X11425035">Brody, 1998</xref>). With criticism following from hostility and praise following from attachment, siblings are frequently emotionally ambivalent about one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X11425035">Deater-Deckard, Dunn, &amp; Lussier, 2002</xref>). That is, if siblings feel both attachment and hostility in their relationship, then verbal comforting would occur despite verbal aggression. It would appear then that familiarity moderates the strength of the negative effect of verbal aggression on verbal collaboration. Hence, any model of relational dynamics that seeks to explain verbal and nonverbal communication across a wide range of familiarity would need to address the emotional ambivalence and the sometimes paradoxical behavior of siblings.</p>
<p>The present study sought to trace the weak link between verbal aggression and comforting observed in sibling communication back through personality to three aspects of the family milieu. These three exogenous factors should serve to anchor subsequent adult verbal behavior, revealing details about the way in which personality mediates this anchoring process. The formative parent–child relationship, biological relatedness, and identity (age and sex) were the putative anchors. How siblings as children relate to their parents should influence later exchanges between adult siblings. Biological relatedness, spanning three degrees of parental connection, should also influence the verbal behavior of adult siblings. Finally, sex of siblings and their age should shape sibling communication.</p>

<title>A Process Model With Independent Affect Systems</title>
<p>The framework for the relational dynamics model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X11425035">Figure 1</xref> was based primarily on belief systems theory (BST; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X11425035">Hamilton, Buck, &amp; Chory-Assad, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X11425035">Hamilton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425035">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X11425035">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261927X11425035">Rokeach, 1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261927X11425035">1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261927X11425035">1968</xref>). The theory tracks the effect of exogenous factors through personality to message production and its consequences. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X11425035">Figure 1</xref> displays a process model derived from BST. The model distinguishes two independent neurophysiological structures in the brain that form the individualistic affect system and the cooperative affect system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X11425035">Buck, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X11425035">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X11425035">Hamilton et al., 2004</xref>). The individualistic affect system is characterized by the expression of selfish emotions; it is the driving force behind the <italic>dark side</italic> genre of interpersonal relations. By contrast, the cooperative affect system is characterized by the expression of prosocial emotions and propels the <italic>light side</italic> genre of interpersonal relations.</p>

<p>Within the individualistic affect system, parents who verbally aggress against their children are more likely to produce children who are egocentric and strive to assert their will on their siblings. Verbal aggression is used to address conflict in nearly all families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0261927X11425035">Steinmetz, 1977</xref>). In turn, the egocentric assertion of power should fuel hostility, with hostility driving verbal aggressiveness. Across studies, verbal aggressiveness has been shown to escalate to physical aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261927X11425035">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>). Within the cooperative affect system, parents who are close to their children are more likely to produce children who are empathic. In turn, empathy should enable attachment in the form of a strong bond between siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261927X11425035">Shortt &amp; Gottman, 1997</xref>), with this attachment driving verbal collaborativeness. Finally, verbal collaborativeness should produce a variety of communicative behaviors that comfort others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X11425035">Hamilton et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Verbal Aggression and its Antecedents</title>
<p>Despite the potential positive outcomes of constructive conflict management, siblings have been shown to use destructive tactics more frequently than constructive tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X11425035">Felson, 1983</xref>). When siblings as children engage in dominance behavior, it leads to more negative feelings toward their siblings as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261927X11425035">Riggio, 2000</xref>). One common manifestation of hostility between siblings is verbal aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0261927X11425035">Teven, Martin, &amp; Neupauer, 1998</xref>). Sibling rivalry and the assertion of power may contribute to such hostility.</p>
<p>The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X11425035">Figure 1</xref> proposes that egocentrism gives rise to hostility and verbal aggressiveness, where the assertion of power by siblings is self-interested and egocentric. The effect of egocentrism on verbal aggressiveness is only partially mediated by hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X11425035">Hamilton et al., 2008</xref>). The impact that argumentativeness has on verbal aggressiveness between acquaintances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X11425035">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>) parallels the impact that the egocentric assertion of power has on verbal aggression in sibling relationships.</p>

<title>Verbal Collaboration and Comforting and Their Antecedents</title>
<p>Prosocial affect between siblings is correlated with social support, companionship, admiration, and entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X11425035">Furman &amp; Buhrmester, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0261927X11425035">Stormshak, Bellanti, Bierman, &amp; Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 1996</xref>). Closeness encompasses shared experiences, trust, and concern, as well as enjoyment of the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261927X11425035">Lee, Mancini, &amp; Maxwell, 1990</xref>). The present study tests the prediction that sibling closeness increases siblings’ affectionate communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261927X11425035">Floyd &amp; Morman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261927X11425035">Shortt &amp; Gottman, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X11425035">Figure 1</xref> proposes that the positive effect of empathy on verbal collaborativeness is partially mediated by attachment, instantiated in the present study as the feelings of closeness that strengthen the bond between siblings.</p>
<p>The multifaceted nature of collaboration and praise between siblings reflects the many subordinated aspects associated with communication behaviors and emotional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X11425035">Furman &amp; Buhrmester, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261927X11425035">Myers, 2001</xref>). Comforting can be manifest both verbally and nonverbally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261927X11425035">Guerrero &amp; Floyd, 2004</xref>) and vary in directness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261927X11425035">Floyd &amp; Morman, 1998</xref>). The present study differentiated verbal expressions of collaboration and comfort from molar behaviors that communicate affection.</p>

<title>Inhibitory Effects</title>
<p>The individualistic and cooperative affect systems can influence one another at the point of the parent–child relationship, mediating personality variables, and sibling communication. That is, even though the two affect systems are structurally distinct, they may have an impact on one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X11425035">Hamilton et al., 2004</xref>). Among acquaintances, this influence has been found to be inhibitory and recursive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X11425035">Hamilton et al., 2008</xref>). In the parent–child relationship, closeness should reduce verbal aggression. Echoing this pattern within the sibling relationship, empathy should reduce the egocentric assertion of power.</p>
<p>Attachment and hostility are two emotions relevant to interpersonal functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261927X11425035">Guerrero &amp; Floyd, 2004</xref>). Among acquaintances, hostility has a moderately large negative effect on attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X11425035">Hamilton et al., 2008</xref>), measured in the present study as strength of sibling bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425035">Bank, 1997</xref>). For emotional ambiguity to prevail among siblings, this negative hostility effect would be of modest size. Consequently, if verbal aggression reduces verbal collaboration and comforting among siblings, the effect should be noticeably smaller than that observed among acquaintances.</p>

<title>Relational Dynamics in Families</title>
<p>As an elaboration on the process model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X11425035">Figure 1</xref>, the causal model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> specifies the three factors within the family milieu that anchor verbal aggression and comforting. The three exogenous factors are the relationship between parent and child (closeness and verbal aggression), the degree to which the siblings are biologically related (i.e., full-, half-, and step-siblings), and sibling identity as defined by sex (including how the gender of the two siblings interact to match or not) and age (both linear and quadratic effects).</p>

<title>The Parent–Child Relationship</title>
<p>Parents exert considerable influence on their children. The present study predicts that children have been socialized by their parents on closeness. Research highlights the effect of family processes on sibling relationship dynamics and quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425035">Baham, Weimer, Braver, &amp; Fabricius, 2008</xref>). The quality of parent–child relationships is directly related to siblings’ prosocial and agonistic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261927X11425035">Reese-Weber, 2000</xref>), where closer parent–child relationships translate into closer ties between siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425035">Baham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261927X11425035">Rinaldi &amp; Howe, 1998</xref>). The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> proposes that this process, by which parent–child closeness (of mothers and fathers) enhances strength of sibling bond, is mediated by empathy.</p>
<p>Parents also teach children how to deal with conflict, where the level of conflict between siblings is partly rooted in the parent–child relationship. The way in which parents deal with parent–child conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X11425035">Buss, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0261927X11425035">Trivers, 1974</xref>) helps to establish a norm of how authority is exercised. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> proposes that parent–child verbal aggression should enhance sibling verbal aggression and that the egocentric assertion power and hostility mediate that sequence.</p>

<title>Biological Relatedness</title>
<p>The changing demographic structure of family households over the past few decades has significantly increased the diversity of family structures<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0261927X11425035">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0261927X11425035">Teachman, Tedrow, &amp; Crowder, 2000</xref>). The rate of marriage (and consequently divorce) is decreasing as single-parent and cohabiting-couple households are increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0261927X11425035">Teachman et al., 2000</xref>). In half of all marriages, at least one of the partners has been married before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425035">Coleman, Fine, Ganong, Downs, &amp; Pauk, 2001</xref>). Although 60% of marriages end in divorce, 75% of those will remarry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.winningstepfamilies.com/BlendedFamilyStatistics.html">http://www.winningstepfamilies.com/BlendedFamilyStatistics.html</ext-link>). Crucially, 65% of remarriages include at least one child from a previous relationship (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.winningstepfamilies.com/BlendedFamilyStatistics.html">http://www.winningstepfamilies.com/BlendedFamilyStatistics.html</ext-link>). As a result, one third of children in a stepfamily will gain a half-sibling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X11425035">Hofferth &amp; Anderson, 2003</xref>) and two thirds of children in stepfamily relationships will have a step-sibling or a half-sibling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X11425035">Hofferth &amp; Anderson, 2003</xref>). Despite this burgeoning diversity in family structure, studies including various sibling relationship types are rare.</p>
<p>Research indicates that outcomes are most positive for full-siblings and most negative for step-siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X11425035">Falci, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425035">Hetherington &amp; Clingempeel, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261927X11425035">Hetherington, Henderson, &amp; Reiss, 1999</xref>). What produces this social advantage for biological relatedness? Full-siblings show more empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X11425035">Anderson &amp; Rice, 1992</xref>) and hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0261927X11425035">Sturgess, Dunn, &amp; Davies, 2001</xref>) than other sibling types and step-siblings are more apathetic—less negative and less positive compared with full biological siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261927X11425035">Hetherington, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261927X11425035">Hetherington et al., 1999</xref>). These findings are consistent with the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>, which proposes that biological relatedness will increase the egocentric assertion of power and subsequent hostility. In addition, biological relatedness should enhance sibling bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X11425035">Deater-Deckard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261927X11425035">Jankowiak &amp; Diderich, 2000</xref>), an effect partially mediated by empathy.</p>

<sec id="section8-0261927X11425035">
<title>Identity</title>
<p>The present study examined the effects of two aspects of identity-sex and age-on personality and subsequent verbal aggression and comforting. Participant female sex (not males), sibling female sex (not males), and the interaction between the two (same sex rather than opposite-sex dyads) appear to influence sibling bond and assertion of power and may exert direct effects (not mediated by personality) on verbal aggression. Age of the siblings was predicted to have a negative linear effect on assertion of power but a nonlinear effect on sibling bond.</p>
<sec id="section9-0261927X11425035">
<title>Sex variables as antecedent</title>
<p>Sex differences between siblings influence communication and caretaking (facets of sibling closeness) and conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X11425035">Maccoby, 1988</xref>). Female sex of participant and sibling should influence sibling bond and assertion of power. Female siblings tend to be more emotionally involved in comparison with male siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0261927X11425035">Tillman, 2008</xref>), so female participants and female siblings should have a positive effect on sibling bond, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>. Female dyads have also been found to have less conflict than male dyads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X11425035">Cole &amp; Kerns, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425035">Graham-Berman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261927X11425035">Matthews &amp; Conger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0261927X11425035">Vespo, Pedersen, &amp; Hay, 1995</xref>). Hence, the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> predicts a negative effect of female sex of participant and sibling on assertion of power.</p>
<p>The interaction between the sex of participant and sibling also appears to be important in that siblings tend to prefer same-sex dyads. Sex-segregation begins in school at around 3 to 4 years of age. In school, both boys and girls show a preference for same-sex playmates in addition to avoiding mixed-sex play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X11425035">Maccoby, 1988</xref>). This preference for same-sex play compared with mixed-sex play is also apparent in sibling relationships. As with peers, the sex of the sibling dyad influences the siblings’ relationship. Maccoby (1998) argues that compatibility is increased when the dyad is of the same-sex. Hence, sex-matched dyads should show a stronger sibling bond than mixed-sex dyads. The literature is unclear, however, on whether conflict occurs more often in mixed-sex sibling dyads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X11425035">Deater-Deckard et al., 2002</xref>) or same-sex sibling dyads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0261927X11425035">Vespo et al., 1995</xref>). In fact, the disparity in findings might be due to sampling error. Hence, the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> did not predict a sex-match effect on assertion of power.</p>
<p>Research has found that men are higher in verbal aggressiveness than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X11425035">Hamilton et al., 2008</xref>). This effect occurs even after controlling for age and argumentativeness. Such effects have been observed between siblings (Maccoby, 1998) but not always (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0261927X11425035">Vespo et al., 1995</xref>). The present study explored whether the negative effect of female sex on sibling verbal aggression would be direct or indirect.</p>
<p>Communicating affection tends to be more appropriate between siblings than acquaintances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X11425035">Deater-Deckard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X11425035">Floyd, 1997</xref>; Maccoby, 1998). Women tend to express affection more than men; this effect may be due to the fact that they engage in less verbal aggression, given that criticism generally decreases affection. It is unclear whether the positive effect of female sex on comforting is indirect (mediated by reduced verbal aggression which in turn decreases comforting) or direct. In the interest of parsimony, the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> proposed that the positive effect of female sex on verbal comforting would be mediated by verbal aggression.</p>

<title>Age as an antecedent</title>
<p>Siblings’ relationships change substantially as they progress through various life stages. The nature and quality of the sibling relationship changes as individuals transition from childhood to adolescence to emerging and later adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261927X11425035">Noller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261927X11425035">Riggio, 2006</xref>). The sibling relationship transforms with age, becoming more egalitarian, symmetrical, and voluntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0261927X11425035">Scharf, Shulman, &amp; Avigad-Spitz, 2005</xref>). The sibling bond, reflected in part by amount of contact, substantially decreases from adolescence to emerging adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0261927X11425035">Segrin &amp; Flora, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Most adult siblings, despite decreased contact, are very close and report very positive feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261927X11425035">Shortt &amp; Gottman, 1997</xref>). Older aged adult siblings report greater closeness and solidarity, compared with siblings in emerging adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X11425035">Goetting, 1986</xref>). For many older adults, the bond with a sibling is almost as close as the parent–child bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0261927X11425035">White &amp; Riedmann, 1992</xref>), such that most adult siblings share a strong bond and many rate their sibling as one of their strongest intimate relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0261927X11425035">White &amp; Riedmann, 1992</xref>). Thus, the high level of support and companionship that siblings shared during childhood returns during older adulthood; this is especially true during times of crisis, as when dealing with ailing parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261927X11425035">Riggio, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>As children reach late childhood, the strength of their sibling bond is supposed to weaken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261927X11425035">Pike, Coldwell, &amp; Dunn, 2005</xref>). Children are thought to begin seeking companionship outside the home as they move from childhood to adolescence. That is, from mid-childhood to late adolescence, interest in relationships with peers should increase. As this interest outside of the family increases, the level of sibling companionship should decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X11425035">Cole &amp; Kerns, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261927X11425035">Kramer &amp; Kowal, 2005</xref>). Peer relationships become more salient and influential than family relationships during this developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0261927X11425035">Scharf et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, adolescence marks a progressive decline in sibling intimacy, amount of contact, and intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261927X11425035">Kramer &amp; Kowal, 2005</xref>, p. 503). Hence, sibling bond is thought to peak during childhood and pick up later in life after the siblings have raised their respective families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261927X11425035">Leigh, 1982</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> therefore proposes that age will have a quadratic effect on sibling bond, forming a U-shaped function.</p>
<p>Relative power tends to increase with age, as siblings begin to challenge their parents’ authority. Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X11425035">Hamilton et al., 2004</xref>) suggests that age has a small inhibitory effect on verbal aggressiveness. This inhibitory effect should be partly mediated by assertion of power. That is, age should decrease the assertion of power, with assertion of power increasing verbal aggression. The present study explored whether the negative effect of sibling age on verbal aggression is indeed indirect, mediated by the assertion of power.</p>
<p>From early childhood into later adult years, siblings continue to provide affection and social support to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261927X11425035">Mikkelson, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261927X11425035">2006</xref>). The behavior of young siblings has been found to be generally cooperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425035">Graham-Bermann, 1994</xref>), where the trend is for age to decrease comforting into young adulthood and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261927X11425035">Salt, 1991</xref>). The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> predicts that this negative effect of age on comforting would be very weak because it is mediated by three personality variables.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The study employed a 3 (degree of biological relatedness) × 2 (participant sex) × 2 (other sibling sex) quasi-experimental design in which <italic>average age</italic> of the two siblings and two parent–child relationship variables were covariates. Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 332) were instructed to fill out an anonymous online questionnaire. <italic>Biological relatedness</italic> was categorized as three levels: 65% (<italic>n</italic> = 255) reported on a full-sibling, 15% (<italic>n</italic> = 48) on a half-sibling, and 8% (<italic>n</italic> = 27) on a step-sibling. Participants were 211 women (64%). Among the siblings reported on, 156 (47%) were female (2 participants did not report their siblings’ sex). Almost half of the sibling dyads were opposite sex (47%), followed by same-sex female sibling dyads (33%), and same-sex male sibling dyads (20%).</p>
<sec id="section12-0261927X11425035">
<title>Demographics on Participants and Their Siblings</title>
<p>Participants ranged in age from 18 to 63 years (<italic>M</italic> = 24.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.86). Siblings ranged in age from 12 to 68 years (<italic>M</italic> = 24.08, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.80). The age difference (participant age minus sibling age) between siblings ranged from −20 to 21 years (<italic>M</italic> = 0.49, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.10). Most (77%) were Caucasian, 9% were Hispanic, 5% were African American, 4% were Asian, 3% were Native American, and 3% were of other ethnic origins. At the time of the study, 1% had only a high school education, 79% had some college but held no degree, 13% had a baccalaureate degree, and 6% had a graduate or professional degree. Among all participants, 81% were in college (<italic>n</italic> = 290).</p>

<sec id="section13-0261927X11425035">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Undergraduate and graduate college students were recruited from a large southwestern university in compliance with the institution’s human subjects institutional review board. Specifically, students were recruited to participate in the study through undergraduate communication courses and a graduate student listserv. All participants were offered the chance to win an iPod shuffle. In addition, undergraduate students were offered extra credit if they participated or recruited someone to participate. To qualify, participants had to be at least 18 years of age. A sibling who was no more than 10 years younger or older than the participant was preferred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0261927X11425035">2</xref></sup> Only 1% of the relationships were age differences of 10 years or younger and only 1% were 10 years or older.</p>
<p>Those with more than one sibling type were asked to choose the first sibling type listed, starting with step-siblings, half-siblings, twins (fraternal or identical), adopted, and full biological siblings. Participants with more than one sibling in the designated sibling type were asked to choose the sibling closest to them in age. This decision was made to avoid a selection bias wherein participants chose the sibling with which they had the most positive relationship. Participants were also asked to report on other important demographic information, such as sibling and parental education levels, parents’ occupations, number of siblings in household, parents’ current marital status, who they lived with during childhood, and years they lived in the same household. Data from twin and adopted siblings were excluded from analyses because of the purpose of the current study and the limited number of participants in those sibling groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0261927X11425035">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>All scales were revised to fit a 7-point Likert-type format with higher values indicating stronger agreement or frequency and lower values indicating stronger disagreement. Cronbach’s standard score coefficient alpha was used to assess scale reliabilities. An item pool to measure the sibling evaluation variables shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> was generated by including 134 items from the four scales listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261927X11425035">Table 1</xref>. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) preceded the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The confirmatory analysis used the program CFA 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261927X11425035">Hunter &amp; Hamilton, 2011</xref>), imposing three criteria to assess item quality: homogeneity of content, internal consistency, and external consistency. Internal consistency was measured with alpha reliabilities. External consistency was measured with parallelism tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X11425035">Hunter, 1980</xref>). The parallelism tests yielded a root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) value for flatness (item quality is approximately equal) and gradient (item quality ranges from weak to strong).</p>

<p>Two separate CFAs were conducted. The first analysis considered the 11 personality factors. The sibling bond items formed four factors rather than a single sibling closeness factor. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0261927X11425035">Table 2</xref> indicates, the 11 factors were all internally consistent with alpha values ranging from .79 to .97. Because of internal consistency concerns, one item each was discarded from the parent–child Verbal Aggression Scale, the Verbal Comforting Scale, and the Family Function Scale. The parallelism tests indicated that the parent–child Verbal Aggression Scale, the Self- and Other-Assertion of Power Scales, and the Talk Frequency Scale were all flat. That is, the items on these scales were approximately equal in quality. By contrast, the parallelism tests indicated a strong–weak gradient for the items on the parent–child Closeness Scale, Sibling Empathy, Hostility, Closeness, Self-disclosure, and Shared Experiences Scales.</p>

<p>Only the Other-Assertion of Power Scale exceeded the standard RMSEA level of acceptable error (.08). Inspection of the RMSEA values for each personality factor for two other-assertion items indicated that the RMSEA were noticeably high for hostility (.17), closeness (.17), self-disclosure (.17), shared experiences (.15), and talk frequency (.13). These findings suggest that the two other-assertion items relate somewhat differently to the temperament variables shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The second first-order analysis considered the four derived factors presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0261927X11425035">Table 2</xref> shows, the four factors were internally consistent with α values ranging from .80 to .97. One item was discarded from both the verbal comforting and family function scales because those items reduced internal consistency. The parallelism tests found that the sibling Verbal Aggression Scale, the Comforting Acts Scale, and the Family Function Scales were all flat, indicating that the items on these scales were of approximately equal quality. The parallelism tests found a strong–weak gradient for the verbal comforting items.</p>

<sec id="section16-0261927X11425035">
<title>Second-order factor structure</title>
<p>EFA of the first-order factors suggested three patterns. First, the two parent–child closeness factors formed a second-order factor of parent–child closeness. Second, the self-assertion and other-assertion factors formed a second-order factor of general assertion of power; the structure of this second-order factor was closely inspected given the parallelism concerns of the other-assertion factor. Third, the closeness, self-disclosure, shared experience, and talk frequency factors formed a second-order factor labeled strength of sibling bond. The strength of adult sibling relationships is influenced by shared experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261927X11425035">Myers, 2001</xref>) as well as the amount of contact and communication siblings share. The parallelism tests across the other first- and second-order factors indicated that the parent–child closeness factor was flat (RMSEA = 0), as was the assertion of power second-order factors (RMSEA = 0). The parallelism tests found a strong–weak gradient for the sibling bond second-order factor (RMSEA = .08).</p>
<p>Items on the first-order factors were summed to generate scale scores. For parent–child closeness, assertion of power, and sibling bond, the first-order factor scores were summed to generate the three second-order factors.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The analysis was conducted in three steps. First, a multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to detect any general patterns of moderation among the three independent variables. The three independent variables and their interactions were used to predict the 10 dependent variables, with age and nonlinear age as covariates. Two of the interaction terms had no overall effects so they were eliminated from subsequent analyses. The three-way interaction had an <italic>F</italic> value less than 1.0: λ = .96, <italic>F</italic>(20, 546) = .63. The biological related by other sibling sex interaction also had an <italic>F</italic> value less than 1.0: λ = .94, <italic>F</italic>(20, 546) = .82.</p>
<p>Second, multiple regression was used to estimate effect sizes in a reduced model. Main effects and interaction terms remaining after the multivariate analysis of variance cull were examined for each of the 10 criterion variables. The three independent variables were effect coded; the linear and quadratic effects for biological relatedness and age were included as explicit terms. The effect coding meant that the quadratic term isolated half-siblings, as compared with the other two types of siblings. Third, path analysis was used to test the model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>. The analysis differentiated the direct and indirect effects of the exogenous variables on sibling personality, language use, and molar affection behavior.</p>

<title>Multiple Regression</title>
<p>The results of the 10 regression analyses can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0261927X11425035">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0261927X11425035">4</xref>. Average linear age decreased both parent–child closeness (β= −.28) and verbal aggression (β = −.19); together, these findings indicate that the parent–child relationship becomes less intense with time. Among the eight sibling measures, the results differed markedly by affect system. The exogenous variables had twice as many effects on the cooperative affect system than the individualistic affect system. Biological relatedness and parent–child communication influenced the prosocial emotions of the cooperative affect system. By contrast, the selfish emotions of the individualistic affect system were more sex-dependent.</p>

<title>Siblings’ cooperative affect system</title>
<p>On three of the five variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0261927X11425035">Table 3</xref>, female participants interacted with biological relatedness. These interactions were with linear biological relatedness rather than quadratic (half-sibling) biological relatedness. Specifically, the effect of biological relatedness on sibling bond, verbal comforting, and family function depended on whether the participant was male or female. The interaction was ordinal, so <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0261927X11425035">Table 3</xref> shows a main effect for biological relatedness on all three measures. Among women, biological relatedness had a moderately large positive effect on sibling bond (<italic>r</italic> = .37), verbal comforting (<italic>r</italic> = .40), and family function (<italic>r</italic> = .22). By contrast, among men, biological relatedness had a moderately small positive effect on sibling bond (<italic>r</italic> = .20), verbal comforting (<italic>r</italic> = .21), and family function (<italic>r</italic> = .05). Thus, full-siblings were more likely to experience prosocial emotions than half-siblings, and half-siblings were more likely to experience prosocial emotions than step-siblings, a trend that was stronger for female participants than male participants.</p>
<p>Quadratic age decreased empathy (β= −.18) and strength of sibling bond (β= −.20), indicating that these prosocial emotions between siblings peak at middle age. Female siblings increased affection displays (β= .12). Women are generally regarded as more affectionate than men, but in the present study this effect could not be attributed to women reporting greater empathy, closer attachment (sibling bond), or verbal comforting. The interaction between female participant and female sibling (same sex) increased sibling bond (β = .16) and verbal comforting (β = .14). These findings indicate a stronger bond between same-sex siblings than opposite-sex siblings and as a consequence more supportive verbal exchanges.</p>

<sec id="section20-0261927X11425035">
<title>Siblings’ individualistic affect system</title>
<p>On two of the three variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0261927X11425035">Table 4</xref>, female participants moderated the impact of biological relatedness. These interactions were with linear biological relatedness rather than quadratic (half-sibling) biological relatedness. Specifically, the effect of biological relatedness on assertion of power and verbal aggression depended on whether the participant was male or female. The interaction was disordinal, so the main effect for biological relatedness was nullified for the two dependent measures. For women, biological relatedness had a modest positive effect on assertion of power (<italic>r</italic> = .21) and verbal aggression (<italic>r</italic> = .13) whereas for men, biological relatedness had a small negative effect on assertion of power (<italic>r</italic> = −.07) and verbal aggression (<italic>r</italic> = −.11). Thus, full-siblings were more likely to experience prosocial emotions than half-siblings, and half-siblings were more likely to experience selfish emotions than step-siblings, a trend that held only for women. Among male participants, this trend was either reversed or nonexistent.</p>
<p>Linear age decreased assertion of power (β= −.26), hostility (β = −.20), and verbal aggression (β = −.33), suggesting that the individualistic affect system becomes less active with age. Quadratic age increased assertion of power. This indicates middle age is characterized by less assertion of power, which complements the increase in empathy and strength of sibling bond at that age.</p>

<title>Causal Model</title>
<p>A causal model was constructed based on the propositions contained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> and refinements from the regression results. One of the key objectives of this analysis was to determine which effects of the exogenous variables were mediated by the personality variables shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0261927X11425035">Table 5</xref> contains the correlations on which the causal model was tested. The correlations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0261927X11425035">Table 5</xref> were corrected for attenuation due to measurement error. The resulting model, which appears in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0261927X11425035">Figure 3</xref>, had excellent fit with root mean squared error (RMSE) = .052 and a RMSEA of 0. Dotted lines in the figure represent tentative findings. Following the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>, the effects of the three experimental factors on the parent–child relationship were examined first, followed by the variables in the cooperative affect system, and then the variables in the individualistic affect system.</p>

<title>The parent–child relationship</title>
<p>As anticipated, age decreased both parent–child closeness (ρ = −.20) and parent–child verbal aggression (ρ = −.20). That is, the most emotionally intense communication occurs at younger ages. Parent–child closeness decreased parent–child verbal aggression (ρ = −.44). The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> implies that had parental hostility been measured, it would decrease closeness to the child and increase verbal aggression toward the child, producing a spurious correlation between closeness and verbal aggression of −.13. Yet the observed effect of −.44 is substantially larger than a value of −.13. This discrepancy suggests that there is a direct negative effect of closeness on verbal aggression, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0261927X11425035">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0261927X11425035">
<title>Prosocial emotions within the cooperative affect system</title>
<p>Parent–child closeness increased empathy (ρ = .18), as predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>. However, parent–child verbal aggression had a direct negative effect (ρ = −.24) on empathy. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> proposed that the negative correlation between parent–child verbal aggression and empathy would be spurious due to the common causal antecedent parent–child closeness. Instead, the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0261927X11425035">Figure 3</xref> shows that parents’ verbal aggression against a child decreases the child’s (siblings’) empathy. Finally, biological relatedness increased empathy (ρ = .30). Having a full-sibling produces more sibling empathy than having a half-sibling, and having a half-sibling produces more sibling empathy than having a step-sibling.</p>
<p>Empathy had a massive positive effect on strength of sibling bond (ρ = .85), an effect that was much larger than that observed in acquaintance studies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>). The biological relatedness by female participant interaction slightly increased strength of sibling bond (ρ = .08); the regression analysis had indicated that biological relatedness had a larger positive effect on sibling bond for women than men. Finally, same-sex siblings had a stronger sibling bond than opposite-sex siblings (ρ = .14). Two effects failed to materialize, neither hostility nor age weakened the sibling bond. The apparent independence between hostility and sibling bond distinguishes the sibling relationship from acquaintance relationships (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>). The indirect effect of age on sibling bond, mediated by both parent–child closeness and sibling empathy was near zero (.03).</p>
<p>Research on acquaintances, represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>, holds that the positive effect of empathy on verbal comforting is partially mediated by strength of attachment. Verbal comforting did indeed increase with strength of sibling bond (ρ = .30) and empathy (ρ = .64). However, the direct positive effect of sibling empathy on verbal comforting was more than twice the size of the indirect effect mediated by sibling bond. Just as it had for sibling bond, the biological relatedness by female participant interaction had a small positive effect on verbal comforting (ρ = .07); the regression analysis had indicated that the positive effect of biological relatedness on verbal comforting was larger for women than men.</p>
<p>Verbal comforting increased attendance at family functions (ρ = .65) and affection displays (ρ = .78). In addition, affection displays were somewhat more likely among half-siblings (ρ = .78), female participants (ρ = .10), and female siblings (ρ = .11). Half-siblings did not influence verbal comforting. These findings suggest that female siblings are more likely to express prosocial emotion nonverbally than male siblings. Finally, half-siblings were more likely to express prosocial emotion nonverbally than full-siblings or step-siblings.</p>

<title>Selfish emotions within the individualistic affect system</title>
<p>The biological relatedness by female participant interaction increased assertion of power (ρ = .15). The regression analysis revealed that biological relatedness had a positive effect on assertion of power for women but not men. Female siblings increased assertion of power (ρ = .15) but female participants did not. As the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> proposed, assertion of power increased hostility (ρ = .72). The size of this effect was quite large. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> also predicted that empathy would have a negative effect on hostility but that this effect would be mediated by assertion of power. Instead, empathy had a direct negative effect on hostility (ρ = −.36).</p>
<p>The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>, drawing on acquaintance research, predicted that the positive effect of assertion of power on verbal aggression would be partially mediated by strength of hostility. Verbal aggression did indeed increase with hostility (ρ = .64) and assertion of power (ρ = .27). The indirect positive effect of assertion of power on verbal aggression mediated by hostility was nearly twice the size of the direct effect from assertion of power. Parent–child verbal aggression had an unexpected direct effect on sibling verbal aggression (ρ = .07). Age directly decreased verbal aggression (ρ = −.14), an effect that has been observed between acquaintances as well as siblings. Finally, female participant decreased verbal aggression (ρ = −.21), an effect that can be reframed as male participants showing higher verbal aggression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Family is crucial to human development and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X11425035">Branje, van Lieshout, van Aken, &amp; Haselager, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261927X11425035">Kalil &amp; DeLeire, 2004</xref>). From infancy to old age, family experiences and communication have a pervasive impact on our lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0261927X11425035">Segrin &amp; Flora, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0261927X11425035">Vangelisti, 2006</xref>). Specifically, family members contribute to an individual’s personality formation, behavior patterns, and relationship expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X11425035">Belsky, Steinberg, &amp; Draper, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0261927X11425035">Sherman, Lansford, &amp; Volling, 2006</xref>). The first emotional and affectionate bonds experienced within the family serve as the basis for attachment, trust, and security in nearly <italic>all</italic> other close relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261927X11425035">Collins &amp; Feeney, 2004</xref>). Thus, patterns of family communication have a powerful influence on personality development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261927X11425035">Pecchioni et al., 2005</xref>). With increasing frequency, researchers are investigating the various experiences that individual family members have with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261927X11425035">Noller, 2005</xref>). Most family research has been devoted to the role of marital and parent–child relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X11425035">Aguilar, O’Brien, August, Aoun, &amp; Hektner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X11425035">Dunn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X11425035">Goetting, 1986</xref>). The results of the present study describe how the parent–child relationship influences communication patterns between siblings.</p>
<p>The process model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X11425035">Figure 1</xref> proposes that two independent sequences are relevant to sibling relationships. Within personality, the model contrasts the egocentric assertion of power with empathy and hostility with attachment (strength of sibling bond). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>, sibling bond combines with hostility to generate the affective ambivalence characteristic of many sibling relationships. Others researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X11425035">Deater-Deckard et al., 2002</xref>) have defined <italic>emotional ambivalence</italic> as the interaction between warmth and conflict, building on the conflict-by-warmth array proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0261927X11425035">Stocker, Lanthier, and Furman (1997)</xref>. The results of the present study indicate that conflict (criticizing and verbal aggression) and warmth (verbal and nonverbal comforting) follow from hostility and strength of attachment. That is, emotional ambivalence is a temperament phenomenon that generates communicative ambivalence or “mixed messages.” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0261927X11425035">Figure 3</xref> reveals just how independent the two affect sequences are for siblings. Recall that for acquaintances, empathy decreases egocentrism, hostility decreases attachment, and verbal aggression decreases verbal collaboration. These inhibitory effects did not occur among siblings. Rather, the only influence exerted between the two affect systems occurred as empathy decreased hostility.</p>
<sec id="section26-0261927X11425035">
<title>Reality Testing and Temperament as Mediating Processes</title>
<p>Among the exogenous variables, only age had an impact on the parent–child relationship. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref> predicted that more emotionally intense communication would occur between younger siblings. Consistent with this prediction, age reduced parent–child closeness and parent–child verbal aggression. Yet age had antagonistic or opposing effects on parent–child verbal aggression. That is, parent–child closeness decreased parent–child verbal aggression so age indirectly inhibited parent–child aggression (.09) by decreasing closeness. This small positive effect of age was dwarfed by the direct negative effect of age on parent–child verbal aggression (−.20). Thus, the net effect of age on parent–child verbal aggression was negative.</p>
<p>The effect of biological relatedness and sex on sibling personality and language use were independent of the parent–child relationship. Moreover, personality mediated only some of the effects that the exogenous variables had on language use and molar behavior.</p>
<sec id="section27-0261927X11425035">
<title>The cooperative affect system that underlies the “light side” of sibling relationships</title>
<p>Consistent with prediction, parent–child closeness increased empathy. Contrary to prediction, parent–child verbal aggression did not influence egocentric assertion of power. Instead, parent–child verbal aggression decreased empathy. This verbal aggression finding for siblings is at odds with that observed for acquaintances.</p>
<p>Biological relatedness strengthened sibling bond and increased verbal comforting in two ways. Indirectly, biological relatedness increased empathy, with empathy strengthening sibling bond and increasing verbal comforting. Half-siblings were found to display the most molar affection, suggesting that they may be compensating for their sibling bond deficit by demonstrating greater affection. This pattern is much more pronounced for female than male participants in the present study, where the positive effect of biological relatedness on sibling bond was nearly twice as large. Closeness between parents and child strengthened the sibling bond by increasing empathy. This finding supports the results of previous studies that indicate positive, emotional, parent–child relationships increase harmony and closeness in siblings’ relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0261927X11425035">Yu &amp; Gamble, 2008</xref>). Directly, biological relatedness strengthened sibling bond and increased verbal comforting, although these positive effects were greater for women than for men. As predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>, sibling bond was stronger for same-sex siblings than opposite-sex siblings. Although the regression results suggested a reversal of the predicted age effect on sibling bond, the causal analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0261927X11425035">Figure 3</xref> determined that this finding was spurious.</p>
<p>As predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>, empathy had a positive effect on verbal comforting that was partially mediated by strength of sibling bond. The direct positive effect of sibling empathy on verbal comforting was more than twice the size of the indirect effect mediated by sibling bond. In turn, verbal comforting increased attendance at family functions and molar affection displays. Women and half-siblings were more prone to molar affection displays than men or full- and step-siblings.</p>

<sec id="section28-0261927X11425035">
<title>The individualistic affect system that underlies the “dark side” of sibling relationships</title>
<p>Biological relatedness was found to have a moderately small effect on assertion of power for women in sibling relationships, although this effect may not hold for men. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X11425035">Jenkins, Dunn, O’Connor, Rasbash, and Behnke (2005)</xref> found a similar effect, with full-siblings showing more negativity than half-siblings, yet they did not find a significant difference between half-siblings and step-siblings. Female siblings were rated as more likely to assert power than male siblings. However, a parallel sex effect was not present when siblings rated themselves on propensity to assert power: Both men and women are more inclined to blame female siblings than male siblings for their competition and strife. This sibling effect stands in stark contrast to acquaintances, where men are more likely to assert power and be argumentative. As predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425035">Figure 2</xref>, egocentric assertion of power had a positive effect on verbal aggression that was partially mediated by hostility. That is, asserting power increased hostility, with hostility fueling verbal aggression; yet assertion of power also directly increased verbal aggression. This “direct” effect of power assertion on verbal aggression may actually be mediated by an as yet unidentified variable.</p>
<p>Parent–child verbal aggression “directly” increased sibling verbal aggression in that this effect was not mediated by either assertion of power or hostility. Two direct identity effects held for siblings as well as acquaintances, indicating that familiarity does not moderate these effects. The indirect positive effect of assertion of power on verbal aggression mediated by hostility was nearly twice the size of the direct effect. Age decreased verbal aggression and male participants increased verbal aggression. Contrary to prediction, the current study did not find that siblings were closer at younger ages and older ages and less close at middle age. The results indicate that age influenced assertion of power but not sibling bond.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>The current study had two notable limitations. First, the study relied on each participant’s perceptions of interactions and experiences within the family. The study and findings would have been broader had both siblings in a pair reported on their relationship. Only one person of each sibling pair rated their relationship, so the results are more subjective than had both siblings been surveyed.</p>
<p>Second, given that the majority of the sample was college-aged students, generalizing beyond this group is tenuous. Research that seeks to extend the model tested here to different developmental stages is clearly warranted. Sibling relationships in emerging adulthood tend to be less intense and siblings are less influential in each others’ lives. It would be interesting to explore how different developmental stages influence the effects within the current model. For example, the strength of the relationships would presumably be higher during childhood, given the intense nature of sibling relationships during that developmental stage. It may be instructive to research sibling relationships during the developmental stages when siblings are particularly salient, such as during childhood and older adulthood.</p>

<p>The decision to discourage siblings outside of the 10-year range was based on research suggesting that family age spacing (i.e., relative age differences) influences the nature of sibling interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0261927X11425035">Scharf et al., 2005</xref>). In particular, some researchers argue that age spacing changes the roles and functions of sibling relationships. Specifically, closer age spacing increases siblings’ closeness and frequency of conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261927X11425035">Pecchioni, Wright, &amp; Nussbaum, 2005</xref>). It has been also argued that wide age spacing decreases the likelihood of a <italic>reciprocal sibling relationship</italic>, characterized by mutuality and friendship, and increases the likelihood of a <italic>complementary sibling relationship</italic>, characterized by asymmetry and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0261927X11425035">Tucker, McHale, &amp; Crouter, 2001</xref>). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0261927X11425035">Teti (2002)</xref> argued that there is little value in using static variables, such as birth spacing, birth order, or number of siblings, to predict sibling interactions and relational quality (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0261927X11425035">Segrin &amp; Flora, 2005</xref>). Given the contradictory findings from existing research on the influence of static variables, the qualifying age difference was relatively large.</p></fn>
