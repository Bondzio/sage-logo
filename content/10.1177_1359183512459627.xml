<abstract>
<p>During the German Occupation of the Channel Islands, 1940–1945, the ratio of occupying soldiers to civilians was higher than anywhere else in Occupied Europe; thus, armed resistance was virtually impossible. In its place, unarmed and symbolic resistance grew in importance, and while the role of this has been played down, such acts, many of which left a material trace, were of great significance to islanders. The case study presented here examines the role of coins and trench art (such as cigarette lighters and badges) made out of coins, which were used as symbols of resistant identity during the German Occupation. It is argued here that coinage is particularly appropriate and versatile for Occupation trench art, made and used by civilians and occupying soldiers alike, because of the key symbols of patriotism and identity that they carry. In this article, the author shows how these symbols were used at different times in the biographical trajectories of different types of trench art made from and with coins, and varied in meaning depending on context and owner.</p>

<title>Introduction: the ‘Occupation artefact’</title>
<p>During the First World War, the most ubiquitous raw material for trench art was the artillery shell case (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512459627">Saunders, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359183512459627">2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512459627">2003</xref>), reflecting the mass production of armaments and the industrialisation of war by the beginning of the 20th century. During the Second World War, the coin was one of the more common (and readily available) sources of trench art and, as in the First World War, civilians were deliberately targeted in the conflict. Trench art has been defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512459627">Saunders (2003</xref>: 11) as ‘any item made by soldiers, prisoners of war and civilians, from war matériel directly, or any other material, as long as it and they are associated temporally and/or spatially with armed conflict or its consequences’.</p>
<p>Chosen for their incorporated historical symbols of identity and patriotism, coins were especially useful for trench art and were meaningful in a conflict that comprised not only armed conflict on the battlefield, but the taking of prisoners, deportations on an unprecedented scale and, importantly for discussion here, the large number of military occupations by countries such as Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union. For occupied peoples especially, there was comfort to be found in the manufacture of souvenirs depicting their king or queen, or important mythical but patriotic figures such as Britannia, or the symbol of the French republic, Marianne. Some objects recalled symbols of an earlier conflict with the same occupiers. To make trench art out of coins in this fashion was clearly to make a statement about identity and loyalty to the crown despite the circumstances, and thus can be seen as a small act of resistance.</p>
<p>Resistance against the military authorities was just one of a series of reactions to military occupation. Other alternatives within the spectrum included avoidance, confrontation, co-existence, compliance, co-operation and collaboration, and all of these had their material manifestation. Also manifest in an artefactual medium was the expression of the unequal relationships between occupiers and the occupied. Symbols of identity, including those on coins, were appropriated by the enemy and incorporated into their own symbolic repertoire; sometimes they were later reclaimed by the occupied.</p>
<p>Unequal power relations also involved the unequal distribution of food, fuel and raw materials – including money and coinage – and this, too, had its material expression, not just in trench art, but also in items of ‘make do and mend’, such as in the many items made of wood during this period. Examples seen on fieldwork in the Channel Islands by the author show that soldiers of occupation were carving decorative items of trench art from good quality wood at a time when islanders were burning furniture in order to keep warm, cook food or heat water for washing.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the power relations of occupation was the need to control populations and make sure that they obeyed military orders and new laws. This was done by acute observation and surveillance: by watching occupied populations and by having the right to search people and property at will. The kinds of objects made under such conditions, especially outlawed items or objects that expressed resistant attitudes, were thus often ambiguous or disguised in appearance. Many items of this type can be interpreted as ‘weapons of the weak’, described elsewhere by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359183512459627">Scott (1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359183512459627">1990</xref>), who has explored the range of ‘offstage hidden transcripts’, which described the numerous but tiny acts of non-compliance and insubordination carried out behind the backs of those in power, and which corroded their authority.</p>
<p>Occupation artefacts were made by a variety of people who lived within the occupied context, including the occupiers as well as the occupied. Many, if not all, of these items today are ‘heirlooms’ of a kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359183512459627">Lillios, 1999</xref>); ‘memory objects’ that are instrumental in the recitation of family occupation stories and which should thus be seen as receptacles of cultural memory. These objects form part of the wider concept of ‘occupation archaeology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359183512459627">Carr, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359183512459627">2010a</xref>), a concept that includes the post-war treatment of the legacies of occupation, which itself is also part of the wider archaeology of 20th-century conflict.</p>
<p>One of the aims of research into artefacts made during the period of occupation is to collect and record the stories behind the objects or, rather, their ‘occupation biographies’. These are now on the edge of living memory and, because of the action of collectors, many of the stories and meanings have now become divorced from their original objects, owners and makers. This has unfortunately been the situation with the case study presented below, which focuses on the role of a small group of artefacts which today number no more than two or three dozen examples, divided predominantly between two private museums run by collector–owners in Guernsey, in the British Channel Islands (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359183512459627">Figure 1</xref>). These are the German Occupation Museum, owned by Richard Heaume, and the Valette Military Museum, owned by Peter and Paul Balshaw. A small number of further examples exist in Jersey War Tunnels, a privately owned but professional museum in the neighbouring island of Jersey. It is probable that this small group represents the same set of artefact biographies. The survival of a greater number of examples in Guernsey probably simply reflects the activity and interest of collectors in this island. By reuniting artefacts such as those in private collections and museums with their biographies, I hope to restore and preserve an Occupation heritage and, thus, an important part of modern identity to many peoples today living in the Channel Islands, although the implications of this study have a potentially much wider reach.</p>

<p>The case study presented below is taken from fieldwork in the Channel Islands and examines the role of coinage in trench art predominantly in Guernsey and, to a lesser extent, Jersey during the German Occupation of 1940–1945, and in Alderney, the third largest Channel Island, immediately after the war. Many of the occupation power relationships between people described above were manifested in material culture that used coins and, as we shall see, artillery shell cases. Both occupier and occupied were using the same symbols, and sometimes even the same artefacts, to express different things; thus, the context of ownership and artefact biography has proved key to interpretation.</p>

<sec id="section2-1359183512459627">
<title>Occupation coinage in the Channel Islands</title>
<p>Before the Occupation (always spelt locally, and here, with a capital O), British, Guernsey and Jersey coins circulated together in the Channel Islands, as they do today. During the Occupation, German currency was introduced (both <italic>Reichskreditkassenscheine</italic> banknotes, or ‘Occupation Reichsmark’ as they were known, as well as various German denominations of the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich); the islanders also used French coins and notes, meaning that six sets of coinage were in use at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359183512459627">McCammon, 1984</xref>: 163–164). Although it is unknown whether judicious use of, or abstinence from, one currency or another occurred during this period for political reasons, either way, islanders and soldiers had access to a rich repertoire of coinage from which to make purchases or recycle into trench art.</p>
<p>The Occupation Reichsmark fluctuated in value after its introduction but was then finally fixed at 9.36 to the British pound sterling in August 1942, where it remained until liberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359183512459627">Cruikshank, 2004[1975]</xref>: 131). Contemporary diaries written by islanders show that the Germans created much ill-feeling from the outset by rapidly emptying the shops of goods, which were sent back to soldiers’ families in Germany or consumed by those garrisoned on the island (as expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359183512459627">Leslie Sinel, 1945</xref>, in his diary entry for 31 December 1940). Most troubling was the fast-diminishing stock of food supplies as thousands of soldiers poured into the island and food was shipped to France to feed more soldiers on the continent. From the earliest days of the Occupation, rationing became more severe and prices rose.</p>
<p>Although German currency was principally used, the banks continued to maintain all accounts in sterling, believing that the Occupation would not last forever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359183512459627">Cruikshank, 2004</xref>: 131). However, by 1941, small silver and copper coinage was disappearing fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359183512459627">Sanders, 2005</xref>: 44). By the beginning of May, diarist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359183512459627">Leslie Sinel (1945</xref>: 43) reported that dud coins were being circulated, that there was a shortage of silver and that businesses were obliged to use German paper money. By the end of the year, the situation was no better. The <italic>Guernsey Evening Press</italic> reported on 27 December 1941 that the lack of silver and copper coinage was causing increased difficulties in commercial circles. In the same month, in Jersey, Sinel wrote that one of the greatest problems at that time was the acute shortage of small change and that even copper was hard to obtain. This was partly because of hoarding and partly because the troops sent coins home as souvenirs.</p>
<p>What is clear from the artefact record is that not all of the souvenired coins were sent back to Germany. It is likely that a good many remained in the islands to be transformed into or incorporated within trench art. Copper coins that featured the Guernsey and Jersey crests were particularly favoured. These two crests are very similar to each other, differing mainly in the sprig of foliage which blossoms from the top of the Guernsey crest, and the way that the shield of the crest was drawn on coins from each island. Both crests, like that of Normandy, feature three leopards <italic>passant guardant</italic>. The obverse of the Jersey coins featured the king, always depicted crowned, while coins from Guernsey did not depict the monarch until 1985. Instead, during the Occupation, they showed the value of the coin in ‘doubles’, of which eight made a penny, and which could be subdivided into denominations of one, two, four and eight. These coins were also decorated with laurel wreaths on the bottom halves. Jersey copper coins were issued in fractions of a penny. The copper coinage of both islands was used alongside British silver coinage. While coins featuring the crest were used in trench art by German soldiers and locals alike (but for different reasons), images of the king were used initially almost exclusively by locals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1359183512459627">
<title>Occupation trench art</title>
<p>On 30 June and 1 July 1940, the Germans occupied Guernsey and Jersey, respectively. This followed the swift and successful invasion and occupation of Norway and Denmark in April, followed by Belgium, Holland, Luxemburg and France in May and June. The possession of British territory was a great morale boost and propaganda victory for the Germans. Subsequent iconic photos of British policemen talking to or opening car doors for German officers were also of great propaganda value in Germany.</p>
<p>Having occupied and taken control of the Channel Islands, the Germans saw themselves as the new masters of the islands and, thus, the rightful owners of the islands’ crests. While they did not use this as part of their identity as the locals did, they appropriated them as symbols that were proudly carved into wooden plates and bowls, which were then given to each other as gifts, made for sweethearts and, presumably, hung on walls in prominent places such as <italic>Soldatenheime</italic> (literally a ‘soldiers’ home’; a kind of mess or club where soldiers could spend their spare time) and billets. Several examples of these are on display in the two Occupation museums in Guernsey. The crests were used on a wide variety of other items made by Occupying soldiers, such as book jackets and nameplates, tobacco boxes and candlesticks.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, crests were also readily available on souvenired coins, and soldiers incorporated them into trench art in the form of smoking paraphernalia, most commonly ashtrays. Most were made out of the bases of shell cases (a tradition that appears to have begun in the First World War), and the coins were heated, curved and soldered, crest side up, onto the shell case to act as cigarette rests. Several ashtrays also contained integral matchbox holders, which were soldered onto the top of bullets, which themselves were attached to the base of the shell cases. These were often decorated with the crest from a coin.</p>
<p>In Jersey, in private ownership, is an unofficial and self-awarded German medal, stamped to commemorate one year’s military service, and engraved with the date of January 1942. The other side of the medal reveals the be-ribboned disc to be a Jersey copper penny, complete with crest. In this context, the crest was clearly a symbol of appropriated ownership, power and strength.</p>
<p>Another key item that proudly displayed the crest, and one which is fairly common in the two Occupation museums in Guernsey today, is the cigarette lighter. There are two main types in the islands’ museums. Type 1 lighters are roughly the size and shape of a lipstick barrel and are more commonly made from recycled war matériel; type 2 lighters strongly resemble the lighters made by allied soldiers during the First World War (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359183512459627">Figure 1</xref>), and are more typically made from brass nuts or knobs of various kinds. Crested coins were fixed into the lid of the lighter of the first type or were sometimes heated, bent into a convex shape and pressed into or onto one or both sides of the lighter of the second type as decoration. Such examples of recyclia are an integral part of most trench art (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359183512459627">Saunders, 2000a</xref>), and the cigarette lighters discussed here, like other examples of trench art, embody ‘the complex relationship between human beings and the things they make, use and recycle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359183512459627">Saunders, 2000b</xref>: 45).</p>
<p>The makers of these lighters, however, are something of a mystery, although they are assumed to be German soldiers by the museum owners. Most examples display the crest, like many other items made by Germans at this time. Because many are made from war <italic>matériel</italic>, this has led to the assumption that they were made by occupying troops. However, two aspects give us pause for thought. First, a minority of lighters are decorated with coins that show the king’s head as well as or instead of the crest. As we shall see, this image was used by islanders in small acts of resistance. Second, as mentioned above, the second type of cigarette lighter is almost identical to those made in the trenches by First World War allied soldiers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359183512459627">Durand, 2006</xref>: 52; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512459627">Saunders, 2003</xref>: 88–89).</p>
<p>It is possible to overcome these difficulties of interpretation by suggesting that Germans were familiar with these First World War lighters – perhaps even saw them in local ownership, in houses where they were billeted, and were able to copy them. Alternatively, perhaps they independently created the design, which coincidentally happened to be the same as those made by the allies. We might further bolster this argument by suggesting that to display the side of the coin that showed the king’s head was not problematic for German soldiers, as it represented just another souvenir of the island to which they had been posted; perhaps another symbol to appropriate and one which symbolised the German conquest of a piece of British soil. This interpretation is less convincing when we examine the symbols employed on each type of lighter, for it seems that type 2 lighters display more obviously resistant symbols than those of type 1. We shall return to this observation later.</p>
<p>Let us first consider the symbolic importance of the image of the king to Channel Islanders. In order to understand this, we must examine what the islanders did with their silver and copper coinage that <italic>they</italic> took out of circulation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359183512459627">
<title>Coins and kings</title>
<p>After their symbol of identity, the crest, had been appropriated by the Germans, the islanders turned to the other side of the coin, literally and figuratively speaking, to exploit a different symbol: that of the king’s head. This was an image that could symbolise patriotism and loyalty to the British throne; something that islanders felt very strongly about, despite being apparently ‘abandoned’ to the Germans by the British in 1940.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1941, the V-for-victory resistance campaign was launched by the BBC and broadcast to the occupied countries of Europe, encouraging people to chalk up the letter V on walls and roads to make the Germans feel that they were surrounded by a hostile resistance army (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512459627">Rolo, 1943</xref>: 137). By early summer, the Channel Islanders had picked up the broadcast, which was not directed at them because of the precariousness of their position (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359183512459627">Carr, 2010b</xref>, for a fuller account of the V-sign campaign in the Channel Islands).</p>
<p>Soon after this, two young Guernseymen, Alf Williams and Roy Machon, met Guy Guillard, a young Belgian Organisation Todt (OT) worker. The OT were a paramilitary engineering auxiliary of the German armed forces, who brought thousands of foreign labourers to the Channel Islands to build the concrete fortifications, which still survive in the islands today in their hundreds. Guillard showed them an English penny, which he had crudely clipped so that the king’s profile was cut out with a V-shape carved underneath. Alf and Roy both decided that they would start making versions of this V-sign coin, but would file them down to make a finer version that could be worn as a badge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359183512459627">Figure 2</xref>). Roy, who worked as a projector operator at the local cinema, made his badges in the projection room while the Germans watched films. Alf made his in his workshop in the dairy at his father’s farm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359183512459627">Carr and Heaume, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>Alf and Roy wore their badges on the inside lapel of their jackets so that they could not be seen by any passing German soldier or anyone else who might have reported them. Soon, trusted friends were asking for their own badges, and Alf estimated that he and Roy made around 300 to 400 badges between them, worn secretly or just kept as souvenirs and mementoes by men and women alike. When worn, wearers could flash the inside of their lapel to trusted friends as they passed them in the street. In this way, islanders could signal to each other not only their exclusive membership of an unofficial and impromptu patriotic ‘resistance group’, but could also communicate group solidarity. This was to prove particularly important in providing courage to others to commit more daring acts of resistance.</p>
<p>People who wanted a badge would bring along their own pennies, sixpences, shillings, florins and half-crowns, and they paid one Occupation Reichsmark to Alf or Roy for the finished product. Alf’s method of manufacture was to measure a straight horizontal line, level with the king’s eyes, from one side of the coin to the other, and to draw diagonal lines from the edges of the coin at this level to the bottom centre of the coin. These diagonal lines which formed the ‘V’ were then scored down into the coin; then, using metal clippers and a carpenter’s saw, the excess metal around the V-sign and around the king’s head were removed. The profile of the king’s head was then filed down, as neatly as possible, with a small carpenter’s file. Finally, a small safety pin was soldered to the back of the coin to make it into a badge. The whole operation took about an hour. Alf continued to make V-sign badges until the end of the war, although Roy was caught wearing one openly on his lapel by the Germans in 1942. He was sentenced to six months in a camp in Munich and was then deported to the male civilian internment camp of Laufen until the end of the war.</p>
<p>Having seen how the king’s head was used by islanders to make statements of identity and silent resistance, we can now return to the problem of interpretation of the cigarette lighters of type 2 that were decorated with coins showing the king’s head. It is likely that these lighters were actually made by islanders; most probably by men who fought in the trenches in the First World War and who had made similar items for themselves 25 years before. This link between the wars makes use of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512459627">Saunders (2001</xref>: 477–478) calls the ‘memory bridge’:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The memory bridge is one way of conceptualising the effects of the materiality of the First World War on those who lived during the inter-war years. Objects, ideas and attitudes linked the two World Wars during a period of dramatic social, economic and cultural change, forming a bridge composed of materiality, emotion and memory.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The making and use of these lighters would have transported the Channel Island veterans back to their time in the trenches, a period when they learned how to make trench art and barter it with their fellow soldiers for their own gain. This knowledge, and their experience in successful and skilful bartering, would have been employed to good use during the Occupation, when they could trade with the enemy for extra food rations for the family or for cigarettes.</p>
<p>While the raw materials for type 2 lighters were mostly ordinary brass nuts or knobs, type 1 made more use of recycled shell cases and military hardware, and it seems likely that this type was, indeed, made by German soldiers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1359183512459627">Figure 3</xref>). By including the image of the king in type 2 lighters, the islanders were making a clear resistance statement about who really owned the islands and with whom their loyalty lay. They could pass off this design feature to the German market as a simple souvenir of their stay in Guernsey, so that these items of resistance were used by the enemy without being recognised for what they were.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1359183512459627-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>The lighters in this context are reminiscent of Gell’s ‘distributed personhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359183512459627">1998</xref>: 20–21, 104). Gell describes the importance of ‘exuviae’ (p. 104), pieces of the person that have been detached and cast out into the outside world. In this example of the trade of resistance artefacts, the veterans’ dearest and most important symbols of identity, patriotism and resistance were distributed to the unwitting enemy.</p>
<p>Gell’s concept of art (within which we must include trench art) as a ‘technology of enchantment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359183512459627">1992</xref>) is also pertinent in the trade described here. In this context, the cigarette lighters acted as ‘potent psychological weapons’ whose purpose was to put the Germans ‘off their stroke’, to ‘deprive [them] of their reason’ (p. 46) and to dazzle and beguile them during trade so that they would accept these ‘weapons’ without recognising them for what they were. Such skills of successful trading with very similar artefacts would have been honed 25 years previously.</p>
<p>When German soldiers used the image of the king in their own type 1 lighters, this image, like the islands’ crest, might have been just another appropriated symbol of ownership to them. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359183512459627">Isyanova (2009</xref>: 137) argues, ‘trench art can be viewed as the materialisation of soldiers’ relationships and experiences’; the ‘reification of social relations in trench-art objects allows these relationships to live beyond the soldiers themselves’. While both the former occupiers and the men who traded with them are no longer alive, through these cigarette lighters we can gain an insight into one small aspect of the relationship between some German soldiers and former allied veterans.</p>
<p>The king’s head was not the only coin-symbol used on type 2 cigarette lighters. Extant examples include images of Britannia, Queen Victoria, Marianne and, most especially, George V, with his associated connotations of V for victory. The laurel wreath encircling the Guernsey doubles could also have been used to symbolise a ‘Guernsey victory’.</p>
<p>It is worth qualifying here the museum attribution of ownership of these artefacts to German soldiers. While the soldiers may have been the ultimate owners of some of these objects, type 2 examples are likely to have been made and circulated among island men for a period before being traded to Germans. When tobacco, cigarettes and lighter fuel became scarce among the general population, the Germans still had their own supplies. At the point at which the lighter ceased to have any practical use to islanders, it could have been traded (perhaps as a last resort) with the occupying soldiers. These symbols of identity might have appealed to the Germans, who saw them as a sign that the islanders were tacitly acknowledging their defeat and German ownership of the islands.</p>
<p>Alternative readings are possible; indeed, lighters bearing the king’s head could well have been bartered or sold to anti-Nazi soldiers who were ideologically opposed to Nazi rule. Anti-monarchist islanders, who perhaps felt let down at the failure of the British government to protect the islands, could also have deliberately ‘prostituted’ the king’s image for financial gain to souvenir collectors among the occupying garrison. These lighters were multivocal items or, at least, were artefacts containing multivocal symbols that may have been read in different ways by different people.</p>
<p>It seems strange that these items would have been displayed in a Channel Island museum with the wrong attribution for many years without anyone coming forward with an alternative narrative. Islanders treasure their Occupation anecdotes and will often share their stories of similar items with museum owners (personal observation). They also feel strongly about the accuracy of the public Occupation narrative, and so it is almost inconceivable that the attribution is knowingly incorrect. Given that it is probable that both types of lighters ended up in German hands, whoever made the lighters originally has not been seen as of importance. An article on these items by the author in the <italic>Guernsey Evening Press</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359183512459627">Carr, 2007</xref>), which called for islanders to come forward with their memories, yielded no response, confirming that these items circulated mostly within the German domain. If at least some were made by First World War veterans, as is suggested here, then these men would no longer be alive today to give their story, and it is also probable that most would no longer have been alive to correct the museum labels at the time the exhibitions were first mounted.</p>

<title>Cigarette lighters and biographies</title>
<p>The trench art cigarette lighters in this case study have been considered at particular points in their life histories, but specifically the point at which they were seen as commodities or objects intended for exchange. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512459627">Appadurai (1986</xref>: 13) proposed that ‘the commodity situation in the social life of any “thing” be defined as the situation in which its exchangeability (past, present or future) for some other thing is its socially relevant feature’. To view lighters as commodities brings into focus the period during which they were traded with German soldiers. They may also have entered the commodity state at an earlier stage in their life history if they were passed between island men as a way of exchanging symbols of solidarity, group cohesion and resistance. In a similar manner to those who flashed their V-sign badges in the street at each other, the lighters may also have been revealed to other islanders at the moment at which they were proffered to light a cigarette.</p>
<p>The purpose of a biographical approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359183512459627">Kopytoff, 1986</xref>) to studying cigarette lighters is that it allows us to understand the changing meaning of the social actions that involved them. It also illuminates the links between people and things and the ways ‘meaning and values are accumulated and transformed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359183512459627">Gosden and Marshall, 1999</xref>: 170, 172). It short, it clarifies the numerous possible trajectories that the lighters may have taken and the resultant changing meanings and attitudes attached to them by different people.</p>
<p>The biography of a type 2 cigarette lighter, for example, may have looked something like this (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359183512459627">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To view the lighters in this way shows not only how they moved in and out of the commodity state through time, but also how they changed in meaning and use, throughout their life history, depending on the owner or audience. The original intention of the maker may not have been to trade with the Germans; the predestined path of the lighter may have been diverted by an entrepreneurial individual because of economic hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512459627">Appadurai, 1986</xref>: 25–26), and this would have resulted in a change in meaning of the lighter. It may also have led to the lighter being eventually taken back to Germany, where it would have been permanently decommoditised; kept as a souvenir or as inalienable wealth that would have remained out of circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359183512459627">Weiner, 1985</xref>) – at least for the lifetime of that soldier.</p>

<title>The battle for the crest</title>
<p>We have seen how images on coins were used by both occupiers and the occupied in their trench art to make statements about identity, patriotism, resistance and ownership. It is likely that certain segments of the population were aware of what the other was making and using, if only because they traded with each other or lived and worked in close proximity, sometimes in the same house or building. It seems that some islanders were well aware of the occupiers’ appropriation of the crest because an attempt was made to reclaim it, with some success.</p>
<p>A small number of items of jewellery depicting the crest exist in the Valette Military Museum in Guernsey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1359183512459627">Figure 4</xref>). Made from trimmed and filed-down coins showing the island crest or that of the British royal family taken from the reverse of the florin, these badges, brooches and rings proudly display a message of identity and pride, and were most likely made by islanders. Unlike the Germans, who used the crested cigarette lighters as amusing souvenirs that proclaimed a certain conceit and arrogance, the use of the crest by islanders was certainly a form of silent resistance. It was a statement of identity, reclaimed from the occupiers and quietly worn unobtrusively on the body or on clothing, quite probably hidden from view.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1359183512459627-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<p>To wear such items was risky. The necessity of concealment followed a German order published in the <italic>Guernsey Evening Press</italic> on 8 November 1940, which forbade the wearing of ‘distinctive emblems’ and flags. Given that the penalty for such actions included up to a year’s imprisonment and a fine, it was better to be safe than sorry when interpreting the order. Wearing crested badges was undoubtedly a brave and defiant act.</p>
<p>A further level of interpretation is possible. These crested badges are highly reminiscent of the Royal Guernsey Militia cap badges and lapel badges worn during the First World War. It is probable that crested coin badges were gendered objects, worn by veterans to signal their former membership of the military in a way that would have invoked the ‘memory bridge’. It would have indicated the continuation of the 1914–1918 fight with the Germans through material culture. The act of attaching the badge to their clothes would have evoked in the veteran memories of the act of dressing for battle. In this context, the coin badge would have metonymically stood for the whole uniform or battle dress, and would have been recognised as such by other veterans. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359183512459627">Doyle and Foster (2010</xref>: 24) remind us, soldiers were taught to love their regiment. To wear the cap badge, with its embodied symbols, was to appropriate for the veterans’ own use the ‘heroic and historic actions’ of their forebears. Because the cap badge represented in miniature ‘a compressed time capsule of the achievements of the regiment’, the veteran wearing it during the German Occupation would have been continuing the ethos and tradition of his regiment.</p>
<p>If badges made from coins were used in this way, it suggests that the biographies of the First World War cap badges and the Occupation coin badges became ‘entangled’ in the minds of the veteran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359183512459627">Rainbird, 1999</xref>). Some of the meanings of one type of object were carried forward, via the ‘memory bridge’, into a different object that was similar in appearance. While, in one sense, the context had changed entirely, in another, this was still war, fought against the same enemy. Only the site, form and weapons of the battle had changed.</p>
<p>The story of the ‘battle for the crest’ did not end with the liberation of the islands on 9 May 1945. Many occupying soldiers stayed behind as prisoners of war to help clear the islands of mines and artillery. For a while, islanders, British liberating soldiers and the former occupiers worked together to return the islands to some sort of normality. A carved wooden plate, complete with a Guernsey crest and dating to 1946, survives in private ownership. It was given to a Guernsey girl by a German soldier as a token of his affections as they both worked together to clear a concrete bunker on her farm. His affections were not reciprocated, although the gift was kept.</p>
<p>Also in private ownership is a similar carved bowl, given to a Guernsey girl by a soldier with whom she had a relationship during the Occupation. Although these gifts could be read in similar ways because the specific context of power relations between the gift giver and receiver differs, so does the meaning. While the post-liberation gift can be read as a tacit acknowledgement of the true ownership of the crest as it was handed back to its ‘rightful owner’, the Occupation-period gift was an expression of dominant power relations. The soldier was demonstrating his superiority by making a statement that the crest was <italic>his</italic> to give.</p>
<p>In Alderney, the third largest island (which was almost entirely evacuated during the Occupation), around 500 out of a garrison of 2,832 men remaining on the island at liberation were left behind to clear up the mess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359183512459627">Cruikshank, 2004[1975]</xref>: 327). Many members of the civilian population, who had been evacuated to England days before the invasion, started to return to the island in December 1945. Before this date, the island was in too bad a state of destruction for the islanders to return, and the German prisoners of war (POWs) were put to work to make it habitable again.</p>
<p>After their homecoming began on 15 December, the islanders, the British army and the POWs shared the island. On Boxing Day of that year, an athletics competition was held between the army and the prisoners. Although the winner of the contest is not recorded, the design on the shield-shaped trophy engraved by a German prisoner was, appropriately, the island’s crest (Alderney Museum, ref ALNYM: 1985/133). It seems that this group of former soldiers, unlike the POWs in Guernsey, were not willing to simply hand over the crest that they had appropriated in 1940. This time it had to be fought for, but through the competing display of a different kind of prowess.</p>
<p>In a slightly different context, the following year two young German POWs were clearing up the debris in the house of Mr and Mrs Odoire of Alderney. Mrs Odoire gave them some soup to supplement their POW rations, and the young men said that she deserved a medal. Shortly afterwards, the two POWs made her a little medallion out of a florin given to them by Mr Odoire, carved in the shape of the Alderney crest, a lion <italic>rampant</italic>, and now on display in Alderney Museum (ALNYM: 1991/004) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1359183512459627">Figure 5</xref>). Like the carved bowl made in post-Occupation Guernsey, this too can be read as a return of the crest to its rightful owner.</p>

<p>One more example will suffice to illustrate a closing chapter in the battle of the crest; a final definitive statement of ownership, identity and victory expressed in both Jersey and Guernsey: on the first anniversary of liberation, in May 1946, every school child who lived through the Occupation in Guernsey and Jersey received a brass liberation medal. The image chosen for this souvenir was, naturally, the island crest.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of this article has been threefold. Firstly, to introduce to the material culture literature the case study of trench art objects, especially cigarette lighters and badges, from the occupied Channel Islands. Secondly, to draw attention to Second World War trench art which invokes the form of that of the First World War; and thirdly, to highlight the importance and power of coinage in trench art.</p>
<p>During the German Occupation, Guernsey, Jersey and British coins were used, shaped, manipulated and appropriated as symbols of memory, identity and resistance. The images that they carried were claimed and reclaimed by both Germans and islanders, but in different social contexts and incorporated into different artefact types to make different statements. The same images were used both to proclaim German ownership, military might and power; and also to defy orders and protest against German appropriation and occupation of the islands.</p>
<p>This power struggle between occupier and the occupied is a typical feature of occupation, but to a great extent was visible in the Channel Islands mostly to the occupied peoples, especially veterans from the First World War, who would have noticed and keenly felt the appropriation of their symbols. However, when desperate, they were able to capitalise on the German interest in their coinage, and not just in financial terms; they were able to use it as an opportunity to generate defiant artefacts that expressed their resistance and which could be sold to the unwitting enemy.</p>
<p>The use of such ‘weapons of the weak’ was a coup for islanders, who needed a victory of some sort over the enemy – or at least, needed to signal to each other that they were not a defeated people, but were very much still fighting. Such methods of waging war and ‘fighting’ in an underground resistance ‘army’ was certainly not restricted to the Channel Islands and has been noted in other previously occupied countries. Coinage has also played a central role in such acts. In occupied Norway, coins of King Haakon VII, which displayed his monogram (H7) were made into badges and worn by Norwegians (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359183512459627">Stokker, 1997[1995]</xref>: 74). Trench art in the Verzetsmuseum (Resistance Museum) in Amsterdam shows the use of coins of Queen Wilhelmina (who, like Haakon, was in exile in London during the war). Occupied Dutch people made bracelets, brooches, medallions and commemorative spoons out of coins bearing her image, quite possibly for the same reasons as Channel Islanders, i.e. as statements of patriotism and identity. In occupied Denmark, people wore badges made up of four coins, which together came to nine øre (100 øre = 1 krone); it was considered best if the coins were minted in 1940 – the symbolism of ‘9.4.1940’ implying the date Denmark was occupied. Danes would also proudly wear the ‘Kongemaerke’ (the ‘King’s badge’), which was issued on 26 September 1940, the 70th birthday of King Christian X (Museum of Danish Resistance 1940–1945). It is likely that these are not isolated examples, and further research will reveal more, in Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>Such defiant but small acts of resistance were important because they could release the pressure of pent-up frustration and impotence that affected ordinary occupied peoples. They could also allow the wearer of these coin-badges to test for fellow feelings of resistance amongst his or her friends, to reassure themselves that they were in like-minded company. Thus, they could also act to spread solidarity and a sense of community between people, ensuring safety in numbers and encouraging others to go on to commit more daring acts of resistance, safe in the knowledge that there were many who would cheer them on and (hopefully) not denounce them.</p>
<p>These resistance acts, like other manifestations of the unequal power relationships between the groups of people who experienced occupation, have often revealed themselves in an artefactual medium (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359183512459627">Carr, 2010b</xref>). The potential of small and easily overlooked items of resistant material culture, in times of occupation, to incite others to greater acts of resistance should not be underestimated. Such items can also be used to articulate statements as diverse as defiance, identity, patriotism, surrender, power and aspirations for the future of ultimate victory. They can also invoke memories of earlier conflicts, perhaps even with the same enemy; but such interpretations are highly contingent on context and maker. Only by examining a wide range of the trench art produced by a given society during a period of war, and by setting this within its historical context, is it possible for the observant material culture specialist to notice subtle patterns within collections and to interpret the meanings of common items of material culture, thus eventually reuniting artefacts with their biographies and gaining a closer insight into the experience of occupation and war.</p>
