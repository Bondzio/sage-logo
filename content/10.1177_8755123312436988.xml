<abstract>
<p>This article is a review of relevant literature on the use of phenomenology as a research methodology in education research, with a focus on music education research. The review is organized as follows: (a) general education, (b) music research, (c) music education research, (d) dissertations, (e) important figures, (f) themes, and (g) the future. The article concludes with a synthesis of the existing research that attempts to provide suggestions for applying the results to current research practice. The purpose of this literature review is to examine recent scholarship that uses phenomenology and to make recommendations for which areas of the teaching and learning of music might benefit most from this methodology in the future.</p>

<p>If the goal of research in music education is to further the profession’s understanding of music teaching and learning so that students and teachers can be more successful, then it seems to follow that research should be conceived of and undertaken with a connection to practice foremost in mind. Some researchers have criticized what they have come to perceive as a disconnect between music education research and the real world of music teaching and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-8755123312436988">Roberts, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-8755123312436988">Swanwick, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-8755123312436988">Roberts (1994)</xref> writes,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I have argued that a reasonable strategy to bridge the gap between research findings and the teachers who might appear to benefit from them the most is to give these same teachers a stronger claim to the ownership of the research. I believe that this can best be accomplished by shifting our major research paradigm to one that is better suited to examine the world in ways that are more closely tied to the way in which teachers seem to view the social world of the classroom. Qualitative models provide opportunities not only to pursue research in a contexualized format but also to take advantage of the rather extensive lived experience that teacher-researchers can bring to bear on the analysis of the situation. (p. 31)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>He suggests that teachers might make the best researchers of teaching and learning. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-8755123312436988">Roberts (1994)</xref> suggests that researchers might best work in natural settings by using qualitative methodologies that more deeply reflect practitioner language and culture.</p>
<p>Among the common branches of qualitative research are case study, ethnography, grounded theory, historical research, and phenomenology. Unlike the other areas of qualitative research, phenomenology focuses on “meaning” questions. As a result, phenomenology is also often considered to be a mode of philosophical inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312436988">Bowman, 1998</xref>). Phenomenology as both a branch of qualitative research and a mode of philosophical inquiry, seeks to describe the phenomenon in question with as much richness of detail as possible, with the unique goal of describing the “essences” of the phenomenon that contribute to an understanding of meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-8755123312436988">Husserl, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-8755123312436988">Van Manen, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>It is the task of the qualitative researcher interested in phenomenology to explore the meaning of a single phenomenon by using known and accepted phenomenological data analysis steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-8755123312436988">Creswell, 1998</xref>, p. 33). Participants and the researcher are asked to “internalize the objective world into consciousness and negotiate its reality in order to make it livable and shareable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8755123312436988">Bartel &amp; Radocy, 2002</xref>, p. 110). Central to phenomenology is the practicality of the use of results and the understandability of the data for the layperson.</p>
<p>There are a number of strategies that a phenomenological researcher uses to investigate lived experience. The researcher generally starts with her personal experience. She explains how she became interested in the phenomenon, why she might be a good person to examine the particular area further, and why a more in-depth understanding of the particular phenomenon might be valuable to a particular academic area. Then, data are gathered via interviews, conversations, discussions, observations, focus group meetings, and through participant journaling. Descriptions of events are written and reflected on. These accounts of experience are then tested by participants, the researcher, and related others to see whether the description rightly describes the essence of the phenomenon. Someone reading a phenomenological study should be able to understand—by reading participants’ accounts of a particular phenomenon—what is valuable to know and understand about that phenomenon.</p>
<p>Research in this area can be “messy.” Qualitative researchers embrace the “messiness,” often putting themselves into the study as participants. This is a distinction between quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. Whereas quantitative methodologies feature a separation between the researcher and the research, qualitative methodologies embrace the connection between the researcher and the research as a potential strength that could influence the meaning and applicability of research findings. Generalizability is not the goal. Because the researcher is so close to the phenomenon being considered, results of the study and implications for those results will have more of the fingerprint of the researcher than when the researcher is not <italic>directly</italic> involved with the study. Some may argue, however, that the researcher is never completely removed from the study. I believe that this is a valid point for music education research to consider. There may be times when the researcher’s participation in a study, because of the personal and social contributions that they bring to the understanding of the phenomenon, produces more useable or transferrable knowledge to the research community and the practicing teacher.</p>
<p>The contents of this literature review are meant to be helpful for those music education researchers who are new to the phenomenological research tradition and might be considering using this research tool in the future, and for more experienced researchers in this tradition to reflect on what work has been done in this area. The “phenomenological approach involves a return to experience,” with a priority placed on the value of description over explanation, the conveyance of “the essences of the experience,” in order to inform practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-8755123312436988">Moustakas, 1994</xref>, p. 13). “Essences of the experience” are the starting points for an understanding of each phenomenon. Furthermore, phenomenological studies tend to focus on inviting readers into a dialogue about a subject rather than on the reporting of empirical facts in order to generalize about a subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-8755123312436988">Van Manen, 1990</xref>). To make sense of how this definition and methodology have been explored recently, I have separated the studies into broad categories. The categories are as follows: (a) general education research, (b) music research, (c) ethnomusicology research, (d) music education research, (e) dissertations, (f) important figures, (g) themes, and (h) the future. I shall begin with a review of the general education literature.</p>
<sec id="section1-8755123312436988">
<title>General Education</title>
<p>General education research has embraced phenomenology based on what seems to be a realization that this mode of qualitative research allows the researcher to retain what is most meaningful about the particular phenomena being examined differently than is the case with various quantitative strategies for examining similar phenomena. The tension that results from this mismatch in the usefulness of research data seems to be most pronounced in arts education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-8755123312436988">Eisner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-8755123312436988">Streb, 1984</xref>), as the value and meaning associated with the process of producing and the evaluation of artistic products are often difficult to articulate. General education has recognized this tension as well, and phenomenology has effectively found a rightful place in the tool belt of the research community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-8755123312436988">Cohen Manion, Morrison, &amp; Morrison, 2007</xref>). I shall begin with some short sketches of a few studies from the general education area as a way of displaying some of the diverse ways that phenomenology has been used to assist researchers in uncovering the meanings of particular phenomena (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-8755123312436988">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Recent research has examined teachers’ views of how their alternative preparation has prepared them for teaching in urban school settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-8755123312436988">Clarke &amp; Thomas, 2009</xref>), ways of helping the doctoral thesis writer gather and make sense of their field of study as a way of moving their unique research agenda forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312436988">Carter, 2009</xref>), ways for teachers to explore the question, “who am I as a teacher?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-8755123312436988">Wittman Velde, Carawan, Pokorny, &amp; Knight, 2008</xref>), ways of looking at perceptions of identity within an urban African American school community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-8755123312436988">Nasir, McGlaughlin, &amp; Jones, 2009</xref>), and ways of exploring adolescents’ experiences of educational computer use as leisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312436988">Cilesiz, 2009</xref>). Subject areas are similar to that of the music education literature, reflecting a basic need that phenomenology fulfills—that of providing a meaningful way to describe something that is not easily quantified. In these studies, an explanation of the phenomenon emerges through the researcher—by way of participants’ experiences—explaining personal experiences and interactions that have many layers of meaning.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-8755123312436988">Clarke and Thomas (2009)</xref> started with interviews of the teachers. They were asked to share their everyday experience as participants in an alternative teacher preparation program for mathematics teachers in an urban setting. These interviews told the story of what this experience meant to them. These accounts are “seldom factual; however, they reflect what people believe should be true” (p. 147). Participants’ accounts differ from gossip because they have a moral, which is often “filtered, denied, or not in participants’ consciousness during traditional interviews” (p. 147). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-8755123312436988">Hansen and Kahnweiler (1993)</xref> write about the power of stories in this line of research,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>stories happen naturally as a way of telling one’s perceptions of past events, problems, or people . . . They are easy to follow, generally entertaining and are more likely to be remembered than other forms of written or oral communications. (p. 1393)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Storytelling is one of the techniques that phenomenological researchers employ in their work. I shall now move to brief sketches of work in music research that have used phenomenology as a research tool.</p>

<title>Music Research</title>
<p>Phenomenology has been used as a methodology in music research to better understand a multitude of different phenomena, such as the musical experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-8755123312436988">Pike, 1967</xref>), the emotional experience in music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-8755123312436988">Pike, 1972</xref>), the experience of listening to music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-8755123312436988">Dura, 2006</xref>), and musical nuance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-8755123312436988">Madison, 2006</xref>). It has been used as a way of understanding the role of music as a leisure activity related to a decrease in stress levels of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-8755123312436988">Iwasaki &amp; Bartlett, 2006</xref>), and as a way of meaningfully examining the beliefs of Black males about “second-lines and regular funerals” in New Orleans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312436988">Bordere, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-8755123312436988">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-8755123312436988">Iwasaki and Bartlett (2006)</xref> used focus groups, which are groups comprising study participants for the purpose of collectively explaining the particular event or case being studied. Focus groups are a technique common to many of the qualitative research traditions. From these focus group interviews, the researchers separated statements according to group, organized each group’s statements into themes or “meaning units,” and refined and checked the statements with the entire text to validate the process (p. 328). In the case of this particular study, the stress level of aboriginal individuals with diabetes was the phenomenon that was discussed in the researcher-mediated focus groups.</p>

<p>Each of these studies would be difficult to conduct, with the goal of producing meaningful data, with quantitative methodologies. Therefore, out of necessity, phenomenology has found a valuable place in the ‘tool belt’ of the music researcher. In every case, the research results not only increased the sense of what was known about the phenomenon to the specific field—the results were published in some of the leading journals—but they also helped each of the research participants talk and work through what the phenomenon meant to them. The strength of this methodology, as illustrated by these studies, is the almost immediate accessibility of the results for both the scholar and the practitioner.</p>

<title>Ethnomusicology Research</title>
<p>Recently, in ethnomusicology research, phenomenology has been used to compare the meaning and role of instruments in different cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-8755123312436988">Mrazek, 2008</xref>). Also, it has been used to help interpret the feelings of participants of “Capoeira”—a type of game/fight/art/music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-8755123312436988">Downey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-8755123312436988">Table 3</xref>). Meaning and value are important themes in both these studies. Another study used social phenomenology to make a metaphorical comparison of experiencing music over time to a term called <italic>print-through</italic>, used in older recording technology when tapes were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-8755123312436988">Porcello, 1998</xref>). “Print-through” involved hearing a brief portion of the piece in slight, shadow form, immediately before actually hearing the music on the recording. Porcello suggests that “print-through” is a lot like one’s previous experiences hearing similar music. Another study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312436988">Berger (1997)</xref> examined the perceptions of a heavy-metal drummer concerning various musical goals at a nightclub gig. Phenomenology—as seen in these studies and other studies not mentioned—is a useful methodology for conveying meaning of actual lived experience in the words of participants. I shall now turn to a review of research conducted in the area of music education.</p>

<p>Phenomenology has been used by Liora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8755123312436988">Bresler (1996)</xref> to justify to the field of music education that qualitative research methodologies are useful to the field. She has used phenomenology specifically to frame music education research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8755123312436988">Bresler, 1996</xref>), understand the nature of narrative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312436988">Bresler, 2006</xref>), and reconceptualize research in music education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8755123312436988">Bresler, 2009</xref>). Traditionally, researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-8755123312436988">Eisner (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8755123312436988">Barone (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8755123312436988">Bresler (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312436988">Barrett and Stauffer (2009)</xref>, and others, found themselves justifying to the field that qualitative methodologies, such as phenomenology are rigorous and worthy of inclusion in the mainstream of music education research. The tide seems to have changed. Phenomenology and the various other qualitative methodologies have become accepted in most institutions and journals. It seems that the music education community of scholars has shifted its valuation of methodology to include multiple modes of inquiry.</p>
<p>Phenomenology has been used practically as a way of understanding how to best mentor novice teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-8755123312436988">Blair, 2008</xref>). The possibility of research becoming more easily accessible to practicing teachers has been examined using phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-8755123312436988">Roberts, 1994</xref>). Diverse topics, such as the learning styles of instrumental drum students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-8755123312436988">Smith &amp; Durant, 2006</xref>), beliefs of musicians confronted with music outside of their culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-8755123312436988">Dunbar-Hall, 2006</xref>), parents’ beliefs about their children’s musical progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-8755123312436988">Davidson &amp; Borthwick, 2002</xref>), and the role of group singing on the well-being of homeless men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312436988">Bailey &amp; Davidson, 2005</xref>) have been examined. In each case, the study process and outcomes were said to be valuable for both the researcher and the participants, both groups left the study having thought to a greater extent than they had previously about the phenomenon in question.</p>
<p>Furthermore, phenomenology has frequently been used by researchers to gather big-picture snapshots of a phenomenon, resulting in the generation of a model—or pictoral rendering of what is at work in or during the phenomenon. There are examples of this in the area of creativity: composition and improvisation with young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312436988">Burnard, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312436988">2006</xref>), the process of composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-8755123312436988">Newman, 2008</xref>), the construct of creative identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-8755123312436988">Randles, 2009a</xref>), and the area of curriculum development and popular music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-8755123312436988">Snell, 2007</xref>). Researchers have found this methodology valuable when a subject area has not been examined much in an in-depth way before. Models crafted as a result of phenomenological research are sometimes used as tools for setting research agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312436988">Burnard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-8755123312436988">Newman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-8755123312436988">Randles, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-8755123312436988">Snell, 2007</xref>). Randles has used his model of “Music Teacher Identity Progression,” generated in his phenomenological study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-8755123312436988">2009a</xref>), to begin conceptualizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-8755123312436988">2010a</xref>), and examining what “creative identity” might mean to music teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-8755123312436988">2011b</xref>) and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-8755123312436988">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-8755123312436988">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-8755123312436988">2011a</xref>). This is one example of how qualitative research, and phenomenology specifically, can initiate discourse in and around specific subject areas.</p>
<p>One of the techniques used in qualitative research methods in music education, including phenomenology, is the <italic>thick description</italic>. In thick description, the researcher does not set out to provide an “objective record of culture,” rather, she seeks to “make sense of a local setting through the process of writing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-8755123312436988">Flinders &amp; Richardson, 2002</xref>). Thick description is a manifestation of narrative inquiry where language is used as a means of sorting through the working of culture and phenomena. Here is an example of thick description:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>With my trombone and bag of mutes in hand, I left for the Summer Celebration’s Coopersville Community Band performance. My black clothes amplified the August heat like a vintage tube amp would heat up Chuck Berry’s guitar as I stepped into my car and turned on the air-conditioning. During the half-mile drive to the school all I could think about was how my arrangement of Del Shannon’s Runaway was going to be heard for the first time by the Coopersville community.</p>
<p>This was the second year of my first substantial teaching assignment. Coopersville was and still is a town that Norman Rockwell would have admired. It had everything one might expect, the barber pole, the corner ice cream shop, the historical society—Main Street had an art gallery and a Farm Museum. This was small town America at its best.</p>
<p>As I drove past children playing baseball, and children on scooters, I pulled up to the modern looking high school with its towering performing arts facility. I thought of the community’s high regard for the arts which was confirmed in my mind by its building a stage and a state-of-the-art performance venue in its last three building projects, dating back to the early 1900s. I met Eunice Conway on the way into the building, the former general music teacher in Coopersville who I had in part replaced upon her retirement the previous year. Her name had become synonymous with piano lessons, busts of Beethoven and Mozart, and the Methodist Church organ on Sunday mornings. She also happened to have a road named after her family in the “new” part of Coopersville. Mrs. Conway told me about how a piano student of hers came to lessons the other day wanting to play music that he had “made up” instead of playing the prescribed exercises for that day’s lessons, because he wanted to be just like his new music teacher, Mr. Randles. I smiled inside with pride for my student’s new-found interest in creative music making, but outwardly, I made no gesture of acceptance of the child’s actions, for the woman’s intensity scared me. I then entered the school doors to a wonderfully chilly, air-conditioned climate.</p>
<p>Tonight the community band would be performing my arrangement of Del Shannon’s “Runaway,” the number one hit of 1961. Del Shannon of course was Coopersville’s own Chuck Westover, a 1953 graduate of CHS. At the previous week’s community pancake breakfast held at the downtown fire station, I heard the story of Chuck Westover from the former high school principal’s son. Amidst the smells of pancake batter and maple syrup, I learned that Chuck never went to class, but spent most of his time lounging around in the halls or on the lawn, playing his guitar and making up songs. This man told me how if it were not for his dad’s cajoling, Chuck would never have graduated from high school. Years later, when Del Shannon became a household name, Chuck would return to Coopersville to visit family and would always pay a visit to his former principal. Everyone liked to claim Del and his flashy star persona. Every lady over 60 either dated him or was best friends with someone who had.</p>
<p>As the director of the basketball pep band, it seemed logical to me that the Coopersville pep band should play “Runaway.” I found an arrangement in the files that had the title “Runaway,” however, upon singing through the score and analyzing the parts, the arrangement looked more to me like a version that one might hear in a mid-eighties dentist waiting room. So, I wrote my own arrangement, paying close attention to the harmonic progression and rhythmic intensity that made the original a hit. Now, Coopersville would hear my version for the first time.</p>
<p>I found the community band on the stage warming up. The group contained, among other members, five band teachers who were either currently teaching or had retired from Coopersville, but still lived in the community. Like these, my predecessors, the people that I was then conducting, my job was to direct the band. This band, whose members had forged the path for me and my current teaching position, whose blood, sweat, and tears had defined music to the Coopersville community for the past 50 years, would play the music of someone who had put the town on the map, Del Shannon, directed by someone who for the first time felt like he had arrived professionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-8755123312436988">Randles, 2009a</xref>, pp. 52-53).</p>

<p>This excerpt was taken from a special issue of the journal <italic>Research Studies in Music Education</italic> (vol. 31, issue 1), which was dedicated to the exploration of the role of thick description in music education research. Articles addressing philosophical concerns related to the role of thick description were presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312436988">Carr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-8755123312436988">Jorgenson, 2009</xref>), as well as responses to those philosophical positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-8755123312436988">Stauffer &amp; Robbins, 2009</xref>), and applications of thick description in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-8755123312436988">Randles, 2009a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-8755123312436988">Jorgenson (2009)</xref> cautions the widespread acceptance of thick description and narrative inquiry based on her perception of an insufficiency of academic rigor existing within the tradition and suggests various limitations of the methodology to the educational research community. Notwithstanding the caution of critics, researchers have used thick description meaningfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-8755123312436988">Geertz, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-8755123312436988">1983</xref>) over the past few decades in their work and appear to be continuing to explore the role of this technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312436988">Barrett &amp; Stauffer, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Dissertations</title>
<p>A number of dissertations have been written recently that use the methodology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-8755123312436988">Table 5</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312436988">Carlisle (2008)</xref> used phenomenology to examine the socioemotional climate within three secondary performance ensembles.

<title>Important Figures</title>
<p>Most music education researchers would likely argue that a specific research question should direct what methodology should be used to answer that question. However, individuals sometimes champion methodologies, especially somewhat controversial or misunderstood methodologies such as phenomenology. Liora Bresler is a prominent figure in qualitative research, specifically phenomenology, who has made strides using the methodology over a period of more than a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8755123312436988">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8755123312436988">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312436988">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8755123312436988">2009</xref>). Marie McCarthy’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-8755123312436988">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-8755123312436988">2010</xref>) contributions to narrative research have been notable as well. She has written book chapters, given keynote addresses at gatherings of qualitative music education researchers, expressed her views as to the importance of phenomenology and the voice of participants and researchers, comparing research with woven threads of a massive fabric that could collectively represent the combined knowledge of all that pertains to music teaching and learning (2007).</p>
<p>Other prominent figures within this discipline are Margaret Barrett and Sandra Stauffer. As editor of <italic>Research Studies in Music Education</italic>, Barrett has championed qualitative research, phenomenology, and narrative inquiry. An Australian music educator interested in creativity research, Barrett has recognized the importance of alternative ways of understanding the complex interactions that music educators are faced with on a daily basis. Under Barrett’s leadership, <italic>Research Studies in Music Education</italic> has welcomed and continues to welcome contributions by the qualitative researcher. Together, Barrett and Stauffer have recently edited the text <italic>Narrative Inquiry in Music Education</italic> (2009), a collection of essays and other forms of scholarship that support placing narrative inquiry, a branch of qualitative research closely related to the smaller category of phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-8755123312436988">Emden, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-8755123312436988" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Phenomenology tends to live closely in the methodology spectrum to philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312436988">Bowman, 1998</xref>). This is likely the result of phenomenology’s focus on meaning wrapped up in experience; meaning is typically the focus of work in philosophy. That being said, the majority of phenomenological studies focus on meaning as it relates to identity—perceptions of individuals about themselves, others, acts, society, culture, and of course the business of music teaching and learning. It might be beneficial at this point in the discussion to talk about the practicality of asking someone to describe the meaning of his or her experience in his or her own words, and the immediate transferability of such transactions to other, similar, teaching and learning settings.</p>
<p>If the circumstances surrounding any given person’s experiences are similar to one’s own, or to someone that one has known, or if someone’s meaningful experience requires a degree of empathy that the reader is willing to give, expressed meanings are nearly always valuable on some level. And so, researchers who use phenomenology as a research methodology do not shy away from some otherwise “messy” subject matter, rather, the messiness intrigues them, informs them, and guides them to draw conclusions that are logical for them and quite possibly others as well. This close relationship between researcher and the researched, as was discussed previously, allows for a richness of data, results, and corresponding implications that might not have been obtainable any other way.</p>
<p>The diverse areas of the music education literature listed and described in this article have been explored by using phenomenology because of the value ascribed to personal accounts of individuals who have experienced the phenomenon firsthand. The strength of phenomenology as a methodology resides in the way that it is expressed in terms of real-life people sharing their experience with the phenomenon. Transferability can be achieved when one’s own experiences and the contexts surrounding those experiences are similar to those of a particular study’s participants.</p>
<p>Phenomenology can illuminate one’s own thought processes and affect how one approaches the teaching and learning that surrounds a phenomenon, whether one is a teacher/researcher or solely a teacher. The ideal phenomenological study—like all good research—paints a picture of an aspect of music teaching and learning that can have personal meaning for the reader. Having the potential for being meaningful to someone should be the primary purpose of research. This point is a strength of phenomenology as a methodology.</p>
<p>Phenomenological researchers must maintain the integrity of the methodology specifics as set by the leading figures mentioned previously and the leaders that have yet to emerge from within the academy. Practicality and utility will hopefully over time become the hallmarks of phenomenology, embraced by the profession as benefiting students, teachers, and teacher educators alike.</p>
<p>The strength of phenomenology as a research methodology is that it bridges the gap between research and practice in that practicing teachers can understand the language used in the research reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-8755123312436988">Roberts, 1994</xref>). The author does not wish to imply that the practicing teacher cannot understand the reports found in quantitative studies. It is probably worth mentioning here that quantitative research can provide a meaningful line of research, and that quantitative research can also be linked to practice. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-8755123312436988">Roberts (1994)</xref> asserts, much of the material that is published as research requires a fair amount of other knowledge, often times statistical knowledge, for the results to be understood and then successfully applied in teaching practice. Qualitative descriptions of the meaning of individual phenomena typically take the shape of stories or narratives that people naturally gravitate toward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312436988">Barrett &amp; Stauffer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8755123312436988">Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-8755123312436988">Connelly &amp; Clandinin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-8755123312436988">McKee, 1997</xref>). These stories or narratives naturally tie to practice and can therefore be transferred to other similar teaching and learning situations for application and further consideration.</p>
<p>Researchers interested in creativity, composition, and improvisation, as components of the K–12 music curriculum, might be able to make use of phenomenology as a viable research methodology. Much of the published research in the area of musical creativity has used quantitative methodologies, with the exception of the work of Pamela Burnard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312436988">2000</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312436988">2006</xref>) and others, and have included sampling techniques that are removed from the actual teaching and learning settings that these activities must naturally take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-8755123312436988">Kratus, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-8755123312436988">Swanwick &amp; Tillman, 1986</xref>). Phenomenology would enable the researcher to conduct research in natural settings with the same curiosities that led earlier researchers to pioneer the study of children’s creative music making as inclusive of processes, products, and creative persons.</p>
<p>Researchers interested in examining identity as a sociological construct in the teaching and learning of music might continue to use this methodology. All the manifestations of music making, including listening, performing, improvising, and composing, are experiences that are connected to identity. Each area could therefore be examined as separate or related phenomena in all the settings that feature the teaching and learning of music.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-8755123312436988">Eisner (2002)</xref> posits, arts education research needs to develop agendas, strands of research that span 5 to 10 years or more. Researchers such as Bresler, Barrett, and others have been important advocates for phenomenology and qualitative research in the recent past. New leaders in this form of inquiry will likely emerge that will help clarify what this methodology could offer the future of the profession. Cautionary work in philosophy should be carefully considered as phenomenology as a research tool is refined and more fully implemented in educational research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-8755123312436988">Jorgensen, 2009</xref>). The link between research and practice is important for academic music education to consider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-8755123312436988">Roberts, 1994</xref>). Phenomenology is a research methodology that is naturally linked to practice. It is hoped that this article will demonstrate to the field where phenomenology has been useful and where it might be useful in the future.</p>
