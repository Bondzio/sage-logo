<p><italic>The Pragmatics Reader</italic> contains 32 chapters which spread across one introductory chapter, eight themed sections and one concluding chapter. The 30 chapters of the themed sections are of two categories: 26 already published papers adapted to the book and four specially commissioned papers. In the prelude to the book, the target readership (students) and the structure of the chapters are spelt out. In their Section 1 chapter, the editors adopt a context-anchored definition of pragmatics, discuss context, highlight approaches to pragmatics and summarise the thesis of each contribution.</p>
<p>In Section 2, ‘Linguistic Pragmatics’, Austin’s work provides the reader with knowledge of his speech act theory; Searle’s covers indirect speech acts; Grice’s addresses the observance and non-observance dimensions of his theory; Seuren gives an historical and descriptive account of presupposition; and Stalnaker discusses pragmatic presupposition in terms of context, truth condition and linguistic markers. Section 3 dwells on the tenets of neo-Gricean and post-Gricean schools. From the former, Levinson concentrates on the principles of his presumptive meaning, and Blutner handles lexical pragmatics in relation to narrowing, approximation, metaphorical extension and optimality. From the latter, Blakemore focuses on explicatures and implicatures; Clark on developments in relevance theory (RT); Carston on the core cognitive dimension to RT; and Sperber and Wilson on the mapping between the mental and public lexicon.</p>
<p>The readings in Section 4, ‘Indexicality’, by Levinson, Rubba and Verschueren respectively take deictics both as linguistic and non-linguistic markers, treat the interpretation of deictics and deictic relations, and discuss the nature, scope, function and significance of metapragmatic awareness. In Section 5, ‘Historical Pragmatics’, Traugott handles the role of pragmatics in semantic change; Brinton discusses pragmatic markers in English; and Jucker and Taavitsainen attempt a diachronic analysis of the speech act of insults. Section 6, covering politeness, face and impoliteness, presents Goffman’s pioneering work on the concept, kinds and use of face; Brown and Levinson’s research on face work; Locher and Watt’s paper on relational work theory; and Culpeper’s work on a theory of impoliteness. Section 7 is devoted to cross-cultural and intercultural pragmatics. Blum-Kulka, House and Kasper’s contribution discusses the cross-cultural implications of requests and apologies; Cook’s paper centres on the degree to which learners of Japanese as a foreign language are able to contextually determine impolite speech style; and Kecskes’s contribution focuses on principles of intercultural pragmatics and the similarities and differences between intracultural and intercultural pragmatics.</p>
<p>Section 8 deals with developmental and clinical pragmatics. Ninio and Snow’s paper on developmental pragmatics gives attention to how children develop turn-taking and turn-management skills; two chapters on clinical pragmatics, by Schegloff and Hamilton, discuss the problems of relying exclusively on laboratory experiments in language therapeutic settings. They demonstrate the ability of conversation analysis (CA) to analyse effective collaboration. In Section 9, ‘Pragmaticians on Pragmatics’, Kyoto criticizes the rationalistic approach to pragmatics; Pressman draws attention to methodological omissions in the pragmatics literature and supports an ethnolinguistic approach to pragmatics; Briggs directs a criticism at the focus of pragmatics and CA on ‘ordinary’ language use.</p>
<p>In her Section 10 chapter, Archer proposes a theoretical direction for pragmatics by presenting the professional promise of developmental, clinical and experimental pragmatics and their potential to square up to the task of Theory of Mind and thus unite pragmaticians of different orientations. She recommends cross-investigative research encounters between mainstream pragmatics and applied pragmatics; and, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445613476791">Ariel (2010)</xref>, she sees much potential in relevance theory to dictate the norms in pragmatics.</p>
<p>The readings in <italic>The Pragmatics Reader</italic> have been carefully selected. The book has a structural design through which readers are immersed effortlessly into its contents. The editors are largely absolved of the Meyian charges of selectional bias (see p. 4) by the large representativeness of the readings, and they sidetrack the criticism levelled against Mey’s approach to pragmatics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445613476791">Kecskes, 2010</xref>) by selecting papers on the basis of their addressing pragmatics from language and situation components. Their classification of approaches to pragmatics into the philosophical, cognitive and sociocultural is clearer than the hitherto available one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613476791">Haugh, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, some absences, theoretical treatments and stylistic issues in the text require comment. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445613476791">Thomas’s (1995)</xref> addition to Grice’s non-observance heuristic is not acknowledged by the editors (p. 15); the extract from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445613476791">Austin (1962)</xref> leaves out the definition of ‘locutionary act’ (see p. 94 of <italic>How to Do Things with Words</italic>), an omission which makes the post-reading task difficult for a new entrant in pragmatics; the treatment of neo-Gricean pragmatics is not representative without Larry Horn’s contribution; and, though Sperber and Wilson are represented, leaving out their <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445613476791">1986</xref> contribution creates a break, as evident in Blakemore’s reference to it in the very first sentence of her chapter. The definition of deixis (p. 169) is rather circular, and hardly any definition of pragmatic markers is provided in the chapter on that topic.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>The Pragmatics Reader</italic> is an excellent compendium that, for the most part, representatively defines the field of pragmatics in theory and practice. Its readership, therefore, transcends the editors’ intended audience of students. While many of the re-published papers would only suit the research interests of students and budding scholars, the newly authored ones and the editors’ evaluative input will offer good readings to professionals in pragmatics, discourse analysis and other applied areas of language studies.</p>
