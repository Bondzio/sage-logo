<title>Background:</title>
<p>Counselling and psychotherapy services have taken off with uneven speed across China since the 1980s after several years of stagnation. Researchers have attributed socioeconomic development (or the lack thereof) and regional differences as main barriers to the development in this field. However, little is known today about the status of counselling and psychotherapy services across China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0020764011413669">
<title>Aims:</title>
<p>To investigate and compare the current situation of practitioners and service delivery of counselling and psychotherapy in more developed and developing regions across China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020764011413669">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Convenience sampling methods from counselling and psychological services organizations in 29 Chinese provinces, municipalities or autonomous regions were used to recruit 1,543 participants to take part in the investigation by completing a 93-item self-designed questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020764011413669">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Organizations in developing and more developed regions in China varied in their current practices and employment situation of their practitioners, and in the quality of service delivery. However, counselling and psychotherapy offered at universities in both types of regions are of similar quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020764011413669">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>In China, the level of socioeconomic development significantly influences the development of professional counselling and psychotherapy services. Important progress is evident in the field; however, the lack of systematic training and the scarcity of professional practitioners remain a challenge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="section7-0020764011413669">
<title>Development of counselling and psychotherapy in China: A brief history</title>
<p>The field of counselling and psychotherapy services in China has progressed in the last century in a non-linear and uneven trajectory. Theories and techniques of western psychotherapy were introduced to China since the 1910s, only to be halted by onset of World War II. Development in the field since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 was hardly a smooth process, characterized by little progress under strong Soviet influence between 1949 and the late 1950s, and sparse attempts to practise psychotherapy by scientists in psychology and medicine until the onset of the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), during which the field of psychology and psychotherapy and its practitioners were publicly condemned as antagonizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011413669">Qian, 2002</xref>). The economic reform since 1976 propelled development forward. Since then, almost all major western theories and techniques of psychotherapy have been introduced to China and mostly applied extensively by local practitioners. Multiple sites began to offer psychological services across the nation, particularly in large urban areas: clinics in universities, medium-size and large general hospitals, professional centres for psychotherapy and counselling services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011413669">Chang, Tong, Shi &amp; Zeng, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The watershed moment came at the beginning of the 2000s, signifying the onset of professionalization in the field of counselling and psychotherapy services with three symbolic events. First, the Chinese Ministry of Labour and Social Security promulgated in August 2001 a state protocol stipulating the qualifications for professional counsellors in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011413669">Chinese Ministry of Labour and Social Security, 2002</xref>), and held the first qualifying examination in 2003. Second, the Chinese Ministry of Health and Ministry of Personnel began to develop guidelines to implement certification examination for psychotherapists in health care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764011413669">Specialist Group for National Examination for the Certificate for Professional Technique in Health Occupation, 2003</xref>). The first certification examination for psychotherapists was held in October 2002 and an annual examination has taken place thereafter. Third, the Chinese Psychological Society (CPS) set up a registration system for professional organizations and individual practitioners in clinical and counselling psychology, aimed to regulate and improve counselling and psychotherapy in China. The CPS also promulgated two significant regulations in February 2007: The Chinese Psychological Society Registration Criteria for Professional Organizations and Individual Practitioners in Clinical and Counseling Psychology and the Code of Ethics for Clinical and Counselling Psychological Practice of the Chinese Psychological Society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011413669">CPS, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011413669">2007b</xref>). The active participation by government and professional bodies in policy making and implementation has facilitated the development of counselling and psychotherapy in China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0020764011413669">
<title>Current issues facing the field of counselling and psychotherapy in China</title>
<p>China’s rapid economic growth has transformed the landscape of counselling and psychotherapy services in the nation. Three key types of challenges still concern the development of such services in the PRC.</p>
<p>First, there is a small practitioner-to-population ratio. An early national survey by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764011413669">Gong and Li (1997)</xref> indicated that only 10 institutions offer training programmes related to clinical psychology, with only 87 graduating with a master’s degree and 10 earning their doctoral between 1980 and 1995. Other authors have estimated that with a population as large as 1.3 billion, two million practitioners are needed to meet the growing demand for qualified psychological services. Unofficial data to date showed that 150,000 people have participated in short-term professional courses, only some of whom have since worked in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764011413669">Xiao, Shi, Tong, Qin, &amp; Wen, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, practitioners often lack systematic training in clinical and counselling psychology to cope with the increasing complexity of client cases. The issue is twofold. Currently, individuals with less than a university education and no specialized training in psychology can still practise as long as they obtain some short-term training and pass the qualifying examination for counsellors set out by the Chinese Ministry of Labour and Social Security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011413669">Chen, Chen, &amp; Qian, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011413669">Li, Jia, &amp; An, 2006</xref>). Also, Chinese universities often lack systematic training programmes in clinical and counselling psychology. Thus, even practitioners with master’s and doctoral degrees in psychology are ill equipped in actual practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011413669">Chen, Zhan, Gao, &amp; Qian, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Last but not least, effective professional regulation, management and development of professional counselling and psychotherapy in China remain as major challenges. No specific regulatory body has been established to monitor the professional competency of practitioners. An effective management system and standardized ethics protocol is still lacking within professional associations. For instance, the qualification criteria for counsellors set out by the Chinese Ministry of Labour and Social Security were too low. Interested applicants with merely a junior high school education can participate in training and the qualifying examination. In terms of professional associations, only the CPS put forward new regulations that established a registration system for practitioners and organizations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0020764011413669">
<title>Objective</title>
<p>Researchers in China indicate a large gap in the development of counselling and psychotherapy between rural and urban regions in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764011413669">Zhu &amp; Liu, 2007</xref>), stressing that uneven socioeconomic development across regions is a major barrier to the professional development of the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011413669">Xu &amp; Xu, 2007</xref>). However, official data are still lacking on dimensions as simple as the number of practitioners of counselling and psychotherapy in China. A cross-nation scan of the current status of practitioners and their practices is the critical first step towards professionalization. This survey is a timely nationwide investigation that compares regional differences and the development of counselling and psychotherapy services between more developed areas and developing areas. Taking into account the influence of the varied levels of economic development across regions, this study aims to uncover current issues facing the counselling, psychology and psychotherapy services delivery system in China and provide the evidence for proposing region-appropriate recommendations for systematic and continuous improvement towards professionalization and better care for the population.</p>

<sec id="section10-0020764011413669" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The researchers designed, tested, revised and implemented a five-part, 93-item questionnaire to collect data on the condition of counselling and psychotherapy. Twenty-nine provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions were involved. All surveyed locations were categorized either as more developed or developing regions, based on their gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011413669">National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2008</xref>). Regions with higher than RMB 20,000 yuan were categorized as ‘more developed regions’ while others were termed ‘developing regions’. The more developed regions included Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, Liaoning, Fujian and inner Mongolia. The developing regions consisted of Hebei, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Xinjiang, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Chongqing, Hunan, Ningxia, Shanxi, Qinghai, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Anhui, Yunnan, Gansu and Guizhou.</p>
<p>A total of 1,543 participants selected via convenience sampling completed the questionnaire. The average age of participants was 36.09 (SD = 8.81), 958 were female (62.10%) and 881 (57.10%) belonged to developing regions. SPSS 13.0 was used to analyse the collected data.</p>

Practitioners in more developed regions received significantly more training opportunities than those in developing regions (<italic>T</italic> = 5.082, <italic>p</italic> = .000); however, no significant difference was noted between the two in terms of total training hours (<italic>T</italic> = 0.377, <italic>p</italic> = .706). Moreover, practitioners in more developed regions practised significantly more years that those in developing regions (<italic>T</italic> = 3.54, <italic>p</italic> = .000), and their weekly hours spent on counselling and therapy were also significantly more than those in developing regions (<italic>T</italic> = 5.19, <italic>p</italic> = .000).</p>

<title>Characteristics of client served: Comparison between two different regions</title>
<p>A higher number of and more varied types of clients are served each month in more developed regions of China, except in the case of students. Moreover, more diverse counselling and psychotherapy services are delivered in more developed areas of China, which may have attributed to the more advanced development and professional competence of mental health services in correlation with higher socioeconomic development. Interestingly, more clients were diagnosed with having ‘general mental health’ problems in developing regions, which may signal a higher frequency of problematic diagnosis, clinical assessment, as well as a lower level of professional competence in such regions.</p>
<p>Key drivers of such regional differences in clients served and the quality of counselling and psychotherapy services are manifold. National policies have focused on the mental health needs of students. The Chinese Ministry of Education requires that every university be equipped with counsellors or psychotherapists, making counselling services more accessible to their students. Second, counsellors and psychotherapists practising in more developed regions are often equipped with a higher competency to deal with various types of clients, except in the case of students, leading to a more diverse client base in the organizations of the more developed areas. Third, the increased momentum for mental health promotion in more developed areas has enhanced public awareness of mental health and help-seeking. Finally, stress associated with the rapid socioeconomic development in regions may have contributed to more varied types of mental health issues. The public’s changing perception of mental health and help-seeking in a changing economic environment is a common phenomenon globally, especially given the growing economic consequence of mental health issues, the better understood linkage between mental and physical health, and the widespread population impact of the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011413669">Williams, Saxena, &amp; McQueen, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0020764011413669">
<title>Characteristics of clients served: Cross-nation overview</title>
<p>Clearly, the public need for professional mental health services in China is growing, as demonstrated by the number and the types of clients served across the nation. The increased number of clients suggests that the public have developed more positive attitude towards counselling and psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764011413669">Qian &amp; Ma, 2002</xref>). Second, the type of clients has evolved over time. Although general mental health problems still remain the key presenting problem of those seeking professional help, there are clients with more diverse types of mental health challenges as compared with results from the last national survey in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011413669">Gong &amp; Li, 1996</xref>). Such a shift suggests a possible improvement in practitioners’ ability in assessment and diagnosis as well as skills in providing therapy for mental health disorders. However, the majority of psychotherapy services is limited by three sessions or fewer, which does not fully meet more complex client needs and also demonstrates the impact of inadequate training in counselling and psychotherapy practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0020764011413669">
<title>Competency and maturity of the counselling profession: Comparison between two different regions</title>
<p>Counsellors and psychotherapists possess more years of practice experience and are able to provide more hours of services each week in more developed regions. Such a geographic difference reflects the longer history of professional development and greater public concern for better mental health in socioeconomically more developed areas. Regarding CPD, participants from more developed regions have dedicated significantly more time into case discussion and continuing education, with a higher percentage of practitioners participating in self-experiences. Such statistics indicate a higher focus on CPD on the job in more developed regions, which can compensate for the inadequacy of formal training for the betterment of mental health services. Overall, counsellors and psychotherapists in more developed regions generally have a significantly more advanced training background and CPD.</p>

<sec id="section18-0020764011413669">
<title>Competency and maturity of the counselling profession: Cross-nation review</title>
<p>A remarkable improvement is evident in the development of professional counselling and psychotherapy services across China today, compared with the national survey results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011413669">Gong and Li (1996)</xref>. In particular, practitioners surveyed often possess either a bachelor’s or a master’s degree, compared with the mere junior college education documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011413669">Gong and Li (1996)</xref>.</p>
<p>A large gap in the educational level of practitioners is still evident between developed countries and China. For instance, the basic educational requirement in the USA for a clinical psychologist is a doctoral degree and for those providing counselling services, a master’s degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764011413669">Freedheim, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011413669">Stricke &amp; Widiger, 2003</xref>). In China, not only are there few professionals meeting such a requirement, many of those who have a relatively advanced education still lack the practice competency due to an unsystematic education. Moreover, the national average for professional training is merely 138.84 hours (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0020764011413669">Table 5</xref>), which is quite low in comparison with requirements in developed countries. The European Association for Psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764011413669">EAP, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011413669">2006</xref>) requires that their member psychotherapists obtain at least 3,200 training hours within a seven-year period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011413669">Kryspin-Exner &amp; Pal-Handl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764011413669">Pritz, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Ongoing participation in skills and knowledge development activities such as self-experiences, case discussion and classroom learning is essential to develop competency in the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011413669">Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011413669">Elman, Illfelder-Kaye, &amp; Robiner, 2005</xref>). In China, however, the ratio of professionals receiving continuing education is generally low. For instance, developed countries such as the USA require 30 credits of continuing education, while no such condition is required in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764011413669">Zhao, Cong, &amp; Zhang, 2005</xref>). This survey shows that in China, although the total training hours is remarkably low, only about half of the total number of professionals surveyed have participated in case studies for CPD. In addition, national policies and regulations and their effective implementation will greatly facilitate the development of counselling and psychotherapy. The organizations in more developed areas in this survey set forth more regulations and implemented them more effectively than did those in developing areas. The overall implementation of ethical regulations is low, except in protecting client confidentiality. Response to client crisis also reveals gaps in proper intervention protocol. On the other hand, regulations for professional practice are quite comprehensive in developed countries such as the USA. For instance, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) details the regulation and management of organizations providing mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011413669">APA, 1989</xref>) and the British Psychological Society sets out in detail regulations for professional employment and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011413669">Division of Clinical Psychology, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011413669">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011413669">1998</xref>). Overall, practitioners’ competency and the maturity of the profession reflect its nascent state of development in China. A considerable improvement is evident since the last national survey in 1996, and further and contining quality improvement towards professionalism is a long-term journey.</p>

<title>Significance of the study</title>
<p>This study is the first nationwide survey of the status of counselling and psychotherapy practitioners and services in China in over 10 years. Remarkable progress in this field over the last 20 years is evident in China, yet there lacks a nationwide, comprehensive investigation in understanding this change. This study is also the first comparative investigation into the development of counselling and psychotherapy across regions in China distinguished by GDP indexes. The results attest that economic development does have significant influence on mental health services. Also, the survey results reinforce the important role played by government policies in promoting the development of professional mental health services, as evident in the case of college students. The findings inspire solutions to improve counselling services in China and to close the gap of professional practice and knowledge with more developed countries worldwide.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0020764011413669">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has its limitations. Recruitment by random sampling was undermined and later substituted by convenience sampling. The research team planned to select two cities in every province, municipality or autonomous region in the sample. In the chosen mental health organizations (including one or two general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, colleges and high schools, respectively) in each city, the team planned to have at least one professional member and one management member in each organization complete the questionnaire. However, some cities of medium or small size did not have the desired universities or psychiatric hospitals, so samples were drawn from cities of a larger size in the same region.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The impact of socioeconomic development influences professional development in the field of counselling and psychotherapy as well as mental health services delivery in China. As seen in this most recent nationwide survey in over 10 years, uneven development in this field is evident across various regions in China. Specifically, the training background, the professionalization of practice and the mental health services delivery are more advanced in more developed regions. Other factors also influence development in this field, particularly the nation’s policies and their implementation. This analysis, which takes into account the influence of economic progress, not only reflects the unique characteristics facing the development of professional counselling and psychotherapy in China, it also sheds light on proposing evidence-based recommendations for further development in the field that responds to local socioeconomic realities and client needs.</p>
