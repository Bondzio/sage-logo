<p>Social inequality/stratification is a core substantive area within sociology. Although social inequality and stratification are slightly different concepts—social inequality refers to differences in prestige, power, and wealth; stratification refers to structured ranking of groups that perpetuates these inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X11430400">Schaefer 2008</xref>)—they are typically dealt with concurrently, and the terms are frequently used interchangeably. In this article, I will primarily use the term <italic>stratification</italic> to describe both interrelated concepts.</p>
<p>The importance of stratification to the field of sociology is evident in a number of different ways. In terms of research, for instance, the International Sociological Association (ISA) includes a Research Committee on Social Stratification that has been active since 1950. Through this committee, there is a popular specialty journal published quarterly called <italic>Research in Social Stratification and Mobility</italic>. On the teaching side, there have been more than 50 articles in <italic>Teaching Sociology</italic> over the past 25 years dealing directly with social stratification. Moreover, even a cursory examination of introductory textbooks in sociology reveals that virtually all of them include an entire chapter, if not multiple chapters, devoted to stratification. But introductory courses are not the only exposure students can get to stratification. Most four-year institutions include a course on social stratification as one of their regular sociology offerings, and I have taught such a course for almost a decade.</p>
<p>There are a number of textbooks and readers available on the market for social stratification courses. But only 10 reviews of stratification textbooks/readers have been published in <italic>Teaching Sociology</italic> over the past 25 years—most of them on a single textbook/reader—and the most recent review was published more than five years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092055X11430400">Ito 2005</xref>). This leaves a significant gap in our present knowledge of the stratification books available on the market.</p>
<p>In this article, I conduct a comparative review of (a) four stratification textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092055X11430400">Gilbert 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X11430400">Hurst 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092055X11430400">Kerbo 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X11430400">Marger 2011</xref>) and (b) four stratification readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X11430400">Brueggemann 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092055X11430400">Grusky 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092055X11430400">Levine 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X11430400">Manza and Sauder 2009</xref>). I selected these books because they have all been published within the past five years (in fact, all four of the textbooks are newly released editions from the past year), and none of them have been reviewed before in <italic>Teaching Sociology</italic>. To guide my review, I discuss the themes/topics common to stratification courses. I then assess the degree to which the books adequately address these themes/topics before comparing/contrasting them more generally. I first explore the textbooks; I then examine the readers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0092055X11430400">
<title>Comparing Textbooks on Key Themes/Topics in Stratification</title>
<p>There a number of themes/topics relevant to social stratification. Some of these are quite central to the study of stratification—for instance, background information on stratification (history and theories), patterns of stratification (income/wealth, mobility, and legitimation/ideology), and traditional forms of stratification (class, race, and gender). But some themes/topics, albeit less central to the field, are nonetheless growing more important with time—for example, additional forms of stratification (sexual orientation, politics, global patterns) and the consequences of inequality (health outcomes and crime/violence).</p>
<p>In the following sections and subsections, I discuss these themes/topics in more detail and compare/contrast the textbooks in terms of how extensively they address them. I generally use three terms to describe the textbooks’ coverage of themes/topics: (1) <italic>extensive</italic>, meaning there are many and/or large sections/chapters of 10 or more pages devoted to the themes/topics; (2) <italic>modest</italic>, meaning there are some pages devoted to the themes/topics, but not many; and (3) <italic>minimal</italic>, meaning there is little/no coverage. As a way to concisely summarize, I also provide a table with these same terms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092055X11430400">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Background Information on Stratification</title>
<sec id="section5-0092055X11430400">
<title>History</title>
<p>The history of stratification goes as far back as the earliest human societies. Early human existence, built primarily around hunting/gathering, exhibited very little stratification; agrarian societies, however, produced extreme inequalities and became highly stratified with a select few at the top and the remaining populace falling into the peasantry; industrialism then produced its own unique forms of stratification out of the newly established labor market mode of production, creating, for instance, distinct social classes as well as significant gender inequalities.</p>
<p>In addition to this long-term view of stratification—spanning thousands of years and vastly different forms of human existence—there is, of course, a more abbreviated history of stratification unique to the United States. This includes issues such as slavery, various major industrial cycles (e.g., textiles, steel, automotive, and technology, among others), and the movement into postindustrialism, to name a few.</p>
<p>The four textbooks I review all address history, but to varying degrees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092055X11430400">Kerbo’s (2012)</xref> <italic>Social Stratification and Inequality: Class Conflict in Historical, Comparative, and Global Perspective</italic> (referred to hereafter as the “Kerbo text”) provides the most extensive long-term history of stratification. It discusses different historical periods in vivid detail and also addresses different characteristic systems of stratification (e.g., slavery, caste, estate). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092055X11430400">Gilbert’s (2011)</xref> <italic>The American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality</italic> (referred hereafter as simply the “Gilbert text”), on the other hand, provides the most comprehensive history of stratification in the United States of all the texts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X11430400">Hurst’s (2010)</xref> <italic>Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences</italic> (referred to hereafter as the “Hurst text”) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X11430400">Marger’s (2011)</xref> <italic>Social Inequality: Patterns and Processes</italic> (referred to hereafter as the “Marger text”) both address history, but not to the same degree or length as the Kerbo text and the Gilbert text.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0092055X11430400">
<title>Theories</title>
<p>Much like in other substantive subfields in sociology, theories and theorists play an important role in understanding social stratification. For instance, our “big three” sociological theorists—Marx, Weber, and Durkheim—all had much to say about stratification.</p>
<p>Marx, of course, built much of this theorizing and ideology around the issue of social class and corresponding issues of stratification/inequality. He felt that industrialism was giving rise to a major class divide between those who own the means of production—the bourgeoisie—and those who do not—the proletariat. Moreover, he and Engels famously argued that the proletariat should rise up against the bourgeoisie and overthrow the capitalist system. Weber was more multidimensional in his approach to stratification, discussing not only class but also status and other issues. He felt that social class and related statuses were of paramount importance, as they played a significant role in shaping peoples’ life chances. Durkheim, however, departed with Marx and Weber, building a foundation for the functionalist view of stratification by arguing that inequality can fulfill important functions in society and that the poor should be satisfied with their lot in life.</p>
<p>Three of the four textbooks—the Hurst, Kerbo, and Marger texts—provide extensive coverage of theories pertinent to social stratification. Each of these texts includes major sections and/or entire chapters devoted to theories. The Gilbert text, however, provides only modest coverage of theories. This may be in part because the Gilbert text is focused mostly on class structure in the unique context of the United States.</p>

<title>Patterns of Stratification/Mobility</title>
<sec id="section8-0092055X11430400">
<title>Income/wealth, mobility, and ideology</title>
<p>Patterns of inequality are clearly important to delineate when examining social stratification. Examples include the (unequal) distribution of income and wealth, trends in mobility (both inter- and intragenerationally), and issues related to ideology and the legitimation of stratification. All four of the textbooks provide extensive coverage of these topics. Moreover, there is very little meaningful variation between them. They all provide recent data (e.g., from Census Income Reports) while also providing coverage of classic pieces (e.g., the famous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X11430400">Blau and Duncan [1967]</xref> mobility study). But the textbooks differ considerably in their coverage of the traditional forms of stratification.</p>

<title>Traditional Forms of Stratification</title>
<sec id="section10-0092055X11430400">
<title>Social class</title>
<p>Although social class is a key concept in sociology—and is a major basis for stratification—there are in fact two very different ways of conceptualizing class, with multiple potential class schema falling under them. The first is a “gradational” conceptualization of class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X11430400">Ossowski 1963</xref>). In this model, class is derived from location on a distribution of scores/numbers (e.g., socioeconomic status or income)—in effect, lines are drawn on the distribution to produce different classes. This conceptualization of class is common in U.S. discourse (e.g., lower, middle, and upper class). The second is a “categorical” conceptualization of class. In this model, class is determined based on nominal categories (e.g., clusters of workers organized by occupational duties and/or their relationship to the means of production). This conceptualization of class was used by Marx (and Weber, though to a lesser degree) and remains popular among many sociologists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092055X11430400">Wright 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>The Gilbert text introduces the “Gilbert-Kahl” model of class, which had been developed in earlier editions of the book. This model is presented in two different ways: (1) in figure form in a shape resembling a raindrop (Figure 1.1 on p. 14) and (2) in table form (Table 11.1 on p. 244). The Gilbert-Kahl model of class is gradational and divides class into six categories: capitalist, upper middle, middle, working, working poor, and underclass.</p>
<p>The Gilbert-Kahl model is useful in many respects. The descriptions provided in Table 11.1 of different classes are quite illustrative. Indeed, some of the other textbooks cite and/or use this model in their respective sections on social class (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X11430400">Hurst 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X11430400">Marger 2011</xref>). But there are nonetheless some problems with this model.</p>
<p>Much like other gradational models of class, the appropriate boundaries between class categories are a bit unclear in the Gilbert-Kahl model. This is noted in the text: “the class categories [other than capitalist] are not so neatly defined”; some are “hazy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092055X11430400">Gilbert 2011</xref>:243). The Gilbert-Kahl model also suffers from another issue common to gradational models, which is that income is seen as a cause of class rather than a consequence (or, put differently, class is a range on a distribution of income rather than a social category that may lead to a particular income). Granted, the Gilbert-Kahl model partially addresses this by basing class on <italic>sources</italic> of income rather than income per se. But this is still quite different from categorical models of class, which get minimal attention in the Gilbert text. For this reason, I would judge the coverage of gradational class to be extensive in the Gilbert text, but categorical class is only minimal. The same is true for the Marger text.</p>
<p>After a brief discussion of different models of class, the Marger text adopts the Gilbert-Kahl model of class and uses this almost exclusively in the book. I already discussed the limitations of the Gilbert-Kahl model of class previously, so I will not repeat that discussion here, but suffice it to say that the Marger text carries the same limitations. An additional issue that arises in the Marger text is that the upper class is discussed alongside the “power elite” rather than the capitalist class. I am unsure why this wording was chosen, as the power elite of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X11430400">Mills (1956)</xref> is not the same as the capitalist class of the Gilbert-Kahl model (nor of Marx).</p>
<p>The Hurst and Kerbo texts both discuss categorical class a bit more than Gilbert and Marger. For instance, the discussion of class in the Hurst text builds a nice contrast between gradational models and categorical models; but it is also somewhat short and is folded into a larger chapter on “economic inequality,” which could confuse readers. The Kerbo text is more extensive.</p>
<p>The Kerbo text, like Hurst, provides more coverage of categorical class than Gilbert and Marger. It also produces its own unique gradational model of class that is then covered extensively. This model of class is multidimensional in that it is built upon a “convergence of occupation, power, and property . . . producing groups or classes that have common interests” (p. 143; see also Table 5-2 on p. 144). The resulting five class categories are: upper, corporate, middle, working, and lower. Including a “corporate” class between the upper class and middle class—a class that is <italic>not</italic> an owner of corporate entities, despite what the label might imply—is a bit confusing. Nonetheless, the Kerbo text’s coverage of class, in sum, is the most extensive of the four texts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0092055X11430400">
<title>Race/ethnicity, gender</title>
<p>Race/ethnicity and gender are important forms of stratification that ought to be discussed at some length in stratification textbooks. As noted earlier, U.S. history is marked by significant racial/ethnic stratification given our history of slavery (and other issues as well—e.g., the murder/displacement of Native Americans). Despite emancipation in the 1860s and the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, racial/ethnic inequality persists to this day. Yearly Census Income Reports continue to show significant disparities between the advantaged group, whites, and others such as African Americans. Additionally, the ratio of African American household wealth to white wealth has risen from 1:10 to 1:20 in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092055X11430400">Kochher, Fry, and Taylor 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As also previously noted, gender inequality became pronounced in early industrialism with the advent of the labor market mode of production. Early on, women primarily worked within the home in production for use value, while men worked outside the home in production for exchange. Although women have increasingly entered the workforce in late industrialism and postindustrialism, they lag behind their male counterparts in many ways. For instance, women still earn just $.77 for every $1.00 men earn in the United States according to the most recent Census Income Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092055X11430400">DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, and Smith 2011</xref>). Moreover, women continue to face barriers to upward mobility such as the glass ceiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X11430400">Cotter et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Three of the four textbooks provide nice, extensive coverage of race/ethnicity and gender: Hurst, Kerbo, and Marger. All three of these texts include entire chapters devoted to these topics (in fact, the Marger text includes two chapters on race/ethnicity) and offer great details. The Gilbert text, however, provides only minimal coverage of race/ethnicity and gender. This is likely because of its strong emphasis on (gradational) class as a form of stratification. But the fact that race/ethnicity and gender are virtually absent is a significant shortcoming of the Gilbert text.</p>

<title>Other Forms of Stratification</title>
<sec id="section13-0092055X11430400">
<title>Sexual orientation, political intersections, and global patterns</title>
<p>The three forms of stratification discussed earlier—class, race/ethnicity, and gender—are not the only forms of stratification. There are other aspects of individuals’ experiences that have implications for stratification. For instance, gays and lesbians face discrimination, which in turn has implications for their position in the stratification system. Politics plays a role in this and other forms of stratification. For example, there is plenty of evidence that the wealthy have a disproportionate influence on political decisions, which helps perpetuate and increase their advantage/wealth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092055X11430400">Domhoff 2009</xref>). Finally, there are large disparities in quality of life throughout the world, with some countries faring much better than others. This speaks to broader issues of global inequality.</p>
<p>The textbooks vary considerably in their handling of these different topics. Only the Hurst text delves seriously into the topic of sexual orientation. It includes an entire chapter devoted to how sexual orientation is related to inequality. Sadly, all the other texts provide minimal coverage of this topic.</p>
<p>The textbooks do a much better job of addressing political issues. Three of the four provide extensive coverage. The Hurst text boasts a chapter on “political inequality.” The Marger text includes both a political inequality chapter as well as a chapter on “public policy and the class system.” The Kerbo text addresses political issues in many places throughout the book, with numerous sections devoted to explaining the inequality/politics nexus. Only the Gilbert text provides more limited coverage of political issues.</p>
<p>In terms of global patterns, the books offer a mixed bag of coverage, but there is one text that provides much more extensive coverage than the others: the Kerbo text. In fact, three chapters in the Kerbo text are devoted to “social stratification beyond the U.S.” The first of the three addresses the “world stratification system” and presents world systems theory as well as other theoretical approaches. The second of the three chapters compares Germany and Japan, citing the authors’ own published research and other scholarship. Finally, the third chapter—the last in the book—discusses globalization and the global poor, also building on the authors’ original scholarly work on the topic. The only other text that comes close is the Hurst text, but it primarily deals with global issues within other topics/chapters rather than more explicitly.</p>

<title>Consequences of Inequality/Stratification</title>
<sec id="section15-0092055X11430400">
<title>Health outcomes, crime/violence</title>
<p>I believe it is important to explain to students why a substantive issue <italic>matters</italic>. Not only does this help complete the puzzle (“here is what it is, and here is why it matters”), but students seem to take more interest once it is clear that something actually has consequences. This is certainly true of stratification. Stratification has consequences ranging from differences in health outcomes—which matter considerably, especially when it comes to literal disparities in life length—and things such as crime/violence.</p>
<p>Much like with global issues mentioned previously, there is one text that provides much more extensive coverage of health outcomes and crime/violence than the others. But in this instance, it is the Hurst text. Although the others also touch on consequences of inequality—sometimes incorporating this within various chapters—the Hurst text is distinct in that it discusses consequences in separate chapters. Indeed, 3 of its 15 chapters deal with the consequences of inequality.</p>
<p>The first of these three chapters deals with “life chances” as manifested in physical health, psychological health, and hunger/homelessness. The following chapter discusses “social” consequences such as violence, crime, and environmental degradation. Finally, the last of the three chapters in this section discusses social movements as a consequence of inequality. I do question including social movements in this section (social movements are more an attempt to change inequality than a mere “consequence”), but I am nonetheless heartened by the fact that the Hurst text includes these chapters.</p>

<sec id="section16-0092055X11430400">
<title>Summary Comparison of The Textbooks</title>
<p>In comparing the texts more generally, it is worth first mentioning that all of them face common challenges. Probably foremost among these challenges is appropriately dealing with definitions of social class. Granted, this is a broader challenge facing the field. But the four texts address this in different ways.</p>
<p>Two of the texts address social class by creating their own models of class (largely within a gradational framework), one adopts the model developed by the first, and the fourth presents competing models and avoids settling on a concrete definition. Specifically, the Gilbert text constructs its own unique model of class—the Gilbert-Kahl model. The Kerbo text also constructs its own (unnamed) model of class. The Marger text adopts the Gilbert-Kahl model. Finally, the Hurst text compares gradational models (including Gilbert-Kahl) with work-based models and never officially adopts a single model.</p>
<p>On the positive side, despite the challenges they face, all the texts have various positive attributes. One could argue for using any one of them. Two sets of factors may help determine which text to use: (1) the desired substantive focus of the course (e.g., U.S. vs. global) and (2) the student composition of the course (e.g., early vs. advanced undergraduates).</p>
<p>Most of the texts cover core topics such as income/wealth, mobility, legitimation, and history pretty well. Where they differ is in their respective treatments of other topics, such as global patterns (covered well in the Kerbo text) or health outcomes (covered well in the Hurst text). As one can see from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092055X11430400">Table 1</xref> and the previous section, the Hurst text and the Kerbo text cover the widest range of topics—both of them extensively cover 10 of the 14 listed substantive topics. But this does not mean that other texts do not provide an equally extensive examination of certain specific topics. As noted earlier, for instance, the Gilbert text provides very extensive coverage of social class (particularly from a gradational view) and related issues but skips some other topics. Whether or not this matters is up to the discretion of individual instructors.</p>
<p>In terms of matching texts to the appropriate audience (student composition), I feel the Gilbert text is quite unique in its narrow focus and almost reads like a monograph rather than a textbook. It is also considerably shorter, with 312 pages and 11 chapters. The Kerbo text, on the other hand, is very large—672 pages long, to be exact. It is also the most “academic” of all the textbooks in that it reads at times like a (very long) scholarly article. It is therefore most appropriate for very advanced students. The Hurst text is well organized but lacks a bit in readability because of sometimes awkward writing. Finally, the Marger text is well written with nice updated tables/graphs but is oddly organized in a few spots (e.g., the separation of politically oriented chapters).</p>

<title>Comparing Readers on Key Themes/Topics in Stratification</title>
<p>As noted earlier, stratification textbooks are not the only materials available for teaching social stratification. There are also multiple readers on the market. In the following paragraphs, I compare four of these readers in the degree to which they address the key themes/topics addressed in the section on textbooks. Then I compare and contrast them more generally. As with the texts, I generally use three terms to describe the readers’ coverage of themes/topics: (1) <italic>extensive</italic>, in this case meaning there are three or more readings related to the themes/topics; (2) <italic>modest</italic>, meaning there are two readings devoted to the themes/topics; and (3) <italic>minimal</italic>, meaning there are one or zero readings related to the themes/topics. As a summary sheet, I also provide a table with these same terms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092055X11430400">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Background Information on Stratification: History, Theories</title>
<p>None of the readers provide much history of stratification. Many of the readers, however, do provide rich insights into the relevant theories—particularly classical theories. All of the readers provide selections from Marx and Weber; some of the readers also contain readings from other classic theorists such as Du Bois and Durkheim. This is true regardless of the number of articles in the reader and/or reader length.</p>
<p>For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X11430400">Brueggemann’s (2012)</xref> <italic>Inequality in the United States: A Reader</italic> (referred to hereafter as the “Brueggemann reader”) includes 35 readings. It includes selections from Marx, Weber, and Du Bois. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092055X11430400">Grusky’s (2008)</xref> <italic>Social Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender in Sociological Perspective</italic> (referred to hereafter as the “Grusky reader”) is a huge book with over 1,100 pages and around 100 readings. It contains readings from Marx, Weber, and Durkheim. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092055X11430400">Levine’s (2006)</xref> <italic>Social Class and Stratification: Classic Statements and Theoretical Debates</italic> (referred to hereafter as the “Levine reader”) is small and concise, with only 16 readings. But among those 16 readings are writings from Marx, Weber, and Du Bois. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X11430400">Manza and Sauder’s (2009)</xref> <italic>Inequality and Society: Social Science Perspectives on Social Stratification</italic> (referred to hereafter as the “Manza and Sauder reader”) is quite long, with 66 readings in all. It too provides selections from classical theorists such as Marx, Weber, and Du Bois and also includes an excerpt from the writings of Adam Smith.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0092055X11430400">
<title>Patterns of Stratification/Mobility: Income, Wealth, Mobility</title>
<p>All of the stratification readers address patterns of stratification/mobility to some degree, but there is considerable variation between them. The Grusky reader provides by far the most extensive coverage of this. It is also very “academic” in that many of its readings addressing stratification patterns come directly from top refereed scholarly journals such as the <italic>American Sociological Review</italic> and the <italic>American Journal of Sociology</italic>.</p>
<p>The Manza and Sauder reader is the next most extensive in coverage of stratification patterns. It includes, for instance, six readings on income/wealth distributions and three readings on mobility. The Brueggemann reader is less extensive, but still provides some coverage of stratification patterns. The Levine reader provides the least coverage, but it does, nonetheless, at least touch on the topic in some of its selections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0092055X11430400">
<title>Traditional Forms of Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender</title>
<p>Although the readers differ in the ways in which they cover the traditional forms of stratification, they all provide rather extensive coverage, particularly of race and gender. Again, given variation in the number of selections within each, the Grusky reader is the most extensive, followed by Manza and Sauder, Brueggeman, and Levine, respectively. One thing that is refreshing about the readers is that they all discuss both the gradational <italic>and</italic> the categorical versions of class, even if minimally. In fact, all of them include an excerpt of Wright’s (e.g., 1985) work on class, which is categorical.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0092055X11430400">
<title>Other Forms of Stratification: Orientation, Politics, and Global</title>
<p>All of the readers cover at least one of the other forms of stratification—orientation, politics, or global inequalities. But the books differ considerably in what they cover. Only one of the books contains a reading dealing directly with issues of sexual orientation—the Brueggemann reader.</p>
<p>As for political issues, all of them include selections related to politics. Again, the Grusky reader, given its sheer number of readings, scores well in this regard. But the Brueggemann reader also includes many political writings, and the Manza and Sauder reader is excellent in this respect. The Manza and Sauder reader is advertised as being strong on issues of political inequality, and it is true to its claims—it contains seven readings under that heading.</p>
<p>Finally, with regard to global patterns, the Grusky reader and the Manza and Sauder reader both provide rather extensive coverage. In the Grusky reader, the selections dealing with global issues do so indirectly (e.g., in the context of larger political systems and economic forms, such as industrialism). In the Manza and Sauder reader, however, the selections on global patterns (there are three of them) are more directly related to global inequality. Neither the Brueggemann reader nor the Levine reader provides much coverage of global patterns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0092055X11430400">
<title>Consequences of Inequality/Stratification: Health/Psychological, Crime/Violence</title>
<p>Only two of the readers have sections devoted to the consequences of inequality—the Grusky reader and the Manza and Sauder reader. Most of the readings related to consequences deal with things such as lifestyle/consumption and psychological consequences. None of them deal exclusively with crime/violence.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0092055X11430400">
<title>Summary Comparison of The Readers</title>
<p>The four stratification readers discussed previously each have various advantages, depending on the intent of the instructor. Two of the readers are quite comprehensive in scope: the Grusky reader, which is the most comprehensive of all and includes around 100 selections from classic and contemporary scholarly works in the field, and the Manza and Sauder reader, which includes classic pieces as well as original writings from significant scholars in the field. The Levine reader takes the opposite approach, as it is very concise and condensed, including selections from major theorists and key writings related specifically to class, race, or gender. The Brueggemann reader takes a middle path, with fairly extensive coverage, but not so much that it is overwhelming.</p>
<p>All four readers include primarily academic selections, pulled from either previously published books/articles or written by the scholars themselves for inclusion in the reader. But both Brueggemann and Manza and Sauder also include a few readings that are more journalistic in nature from famous economists and op-ed columnists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman.</p>
<p>In terms of scope—United States versus cross-national—all of the readers primarily contain U.S.-focused selections. But the Grusky reader and the Manza and Sauder reader also include some readings on global patterns.</p>
<p>If one is looking for a reader for advanced undergraduates or graduate students, the Grusky reader or the Manza and Sauder reader might be good picks given their comprehensiveness (although the Grusky reader may be best suited for graduate students only, given the heavy, academic nature of the writings). If one is seeking readers more suited to an eclectic audience, the Brueggemann reader or the Levine reader would be appropriate choices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0092055X11430400">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Social stratification is a central substantive focus in sociology. Virtually all introductory textbooks cover stratification, and most four-year universities include a social stratification course among their undergraduate offerings in sociology. Despite its importance to the field, there have been no reviews of stratification texts/readers in <italic>Teaching Sociology</italic> over the past five years. The purpose of this article is to fill this void by providing a comparative review of stratification texts and readers published in the past five years.</p>
<p>Despite challenges dealing with the topic of social class, most of the books reviewed do a fine job of addressing traditional forms of stratification such as race/ethnicity and gender. They differ substantially, though, in their coverage of additional forms such as sexual orientation, political intersections, and global patterns. Moreover, only one textbook and two readers deal in much depth with the consequences of inequality, such as health, crime, and violence, all of which are important as a way of underscoring to students the importance of social stratification. The relative weighting of these issues is ultimately up to individual instructors, but it is very encouraging to this instructor that some books are covering these additional topics, as I suspect they will be an increasingly important part of the stratification curriculum into the future.</p>
