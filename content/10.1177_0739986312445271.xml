<abstract>
<p>Latina college students are one of the fastest-growing segments of the college student population. Although there is evidence suggesting Latina high school students are at increased risk of engaging in suicidal behavior, it is unclear whether this risk continues in college. Over the course of 3 years, 554 Latina college students, the majority of whom were Dominican American or Puerto Rican, completed a series of self-report questionnaires assessing suicidal behavior, depression, hopelessness, loneliness, social problem solving, ethnic identity, and delinquent behavior. Twenty percent of Latinas reported current suicidal ideation and 15% reported a past suicide attempt. Multivariate regression analyses showed depression, loneliness, a less positive social problem-solving orientation, hopelessness, and delinquency, but not ethnic identification, were significant predictors of suicidality among Latina college students. Results are discussed as they pertain to prevention and intervention with distressed and suicidal Latina college students.</p>

<p>Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15- to 24-year-olds, and the second leading cause of death among the U.S. college student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0739986312445271">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2003</xref>). Approximately 1,100 U.S. college students die by suicide each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739986312445271">National Mental Health Association &amp; the Jed Foundation, 2002</xref>). Although numerous studies have examined suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and the correlates of suicidal behavior among college students, few have examined suicidality among Latina college students in the United States, a group that comprises a growing proportion of the U.S. college student population and a population that is potentially at high risk for suicidal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739986312445271">Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention [CDC], 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739986312445271">National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While little is known about suicidal behavior among Latina college students, recent examinations of suicidal behavior among Latina high school students have found higher rates of suicidal behavior among Latinas compared to their White peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739986312445271">CDC, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739986312445271">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739986312445271">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2001</xref>). Furthermore, according to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), within the past year, 20% of Latina adolescents self-reported making a suicide plan; 11.1% reported attempting suicide; and 2.7% reported making a suicide attempt that resulted in medical injury severe enough to require medical attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739986312445271">CDC, 2010</xref>). In another study, one out of every seven (14.0%) Latina high school students reported a suicide attempt in the past year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312445271">New York Department of Mental Health [NYDOMH], 2007</xref>). Latina high school students also endorse more risk factors for suicidal behavior such as depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and feelings of loneliness than their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739986312445271">CDC, 2010</xref>). Consequently, the CDC (2007) estimates that almost one in six Latinas will make a suicide attempt during adolescence. Although Latinos had traditionally been considered a population protected against suicidal behavior, in the past two decades, Latina adolescents have emerged as a population at high risk for suicidal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739986312445271">CDC, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0739986312445271">U.S. Public Health Service, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Latinas currently comprise 15% of the undergraduate student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0739986312445271">NCES, 2010</xref>), and the proportion of Latina college students is expected to rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739986312445271">NCES, 2005</xref>; White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans, 1999). Among the few studies that have explored the relationship between Latino ethnicity and suicidal behavior among college students, Gutierrez and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739986312445271">Gutierrez, Rodriguez, &amp; Garcia, 2001</xref>) found that Latino college students reported more past suicidal behavior and a greater repulsion toward life than their White peers. Group differences in suicidal behavior were also found in two other studies of diverse college students. In these studies, Latinos were more likely to report past suicidal behavior and a current suicide plan, but they were less likely to report current suicidal ideation than their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739986312445271">Del Pilar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986312445271">Muehlenkamp, Gutierrez, Osman, &amp; Barrios, 2005</xref>). Latinos also scored higher than Caucasian, Black, and Asian American students on an omnibus measure of attitudes toward, history of, and expectations for suicidal ideation and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986312445271">Muehlenkamp et al., 2005</xref>). None of these studies, however, examined suicidal behavior among Latinos and Latinas separately, despite consistent observations that rates of internalizing behaviors differ significantly among men and women of Latino ethnicity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739986312445271">CDC, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739986312445271">Fortuna, Perez, Canino, Sribney, &amp; Alegria, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Factors Contributing to Suicidal Behavior Among Latina College Students</title>
<p>Understanding of potential risk factors for suicidal behavior among Latina college students stems from empirical studies and theories of suicidal behavior among Latina high school students, the general college student population, and Latino college students. Depression, hopelessness, and delinquency are among those factors most often studied and most robustly associated with suicidal behavior among college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739986312445271">Heisel, Flett, &amp; Hewitt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739986312445271">Kisch, Leino, &amp; Silverman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739986312445271">Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Arata, Bowers, O’Brien, &amp; Morgan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0739986312445271">Stephenson, Pena-Shaff, &amp; Quirk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0739986312445271">Westefeld et al., 2005</xref>). Investigations of suicidal behavior among Latino college students show the relationships between hopelessness, depression, and suicidality persist among Latino college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739986312445271">Gutierrez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986312445271">Muehlenkamp et al., 2005</xref>). Sociocultural factors have also been found to be important in explaining suicidal behavior among Latina students. For instance, some researchers have suggested that suicidal behavior among Latina high school students results from poor interpersonal coping skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739986312445271">McAuliffe, Corcoran, Keeley, &amp; Perry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0739986312445271">Zayas, Lester, Cabassa, &amp; Fortuna, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, low perceived social support and loneliness have been found to significantly predict suicidal behavior in empirical studies of both minority high school students and Latino college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739986312445271">Chang, Sanna, Hirsch, &amp; Jeglic, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312445271">O’Donnell, Stueve, Wardlaw, &amp; O’Donnell, 2003</xref>). Regarding cultural factors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739986312445271">Zayas and Pilat (2008)</xref>, among others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739986312445271">Ng,1996</xref>), have offered that intrafamilial differences in acculturation underlie suicidal behavior among Latina adolescents. Interfamilial differences, and subsequent difficulties, have in fact been offered as a unique risk factor for suicidal behavior among young Latinas (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0739986312445271">Zayas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739986312445271">Zayas &amp; Pilat, 2008</xref>). Accordingly, empirical study has followed, with findings from a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986312445271">Baumann and colleagues (2010)</xref> specifying interfamilial communication difficulties between Latinas and their mothers on the trajectory to maladjustment and internalizing behavior among adolescent Latinas.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was twofold. First, the prevalence of suicidal behavior among a sample of Latina college students was examined. Second, whether variables associated with suicidal behavior among Latina high school students and college students, including depression, hopelessness, loneliness, problem solving, ethnic identity, and delinquent behavior, predicted suicidal behavior among Latina college students was examined. Based upon the current literature, it was hypothesized that depression, hopelessness, loneliness, and delinquent behavior would predict suicidal behavior among Latina college students while social problem-solving skills and ethnic identity would be negatively associated with suicidal behavior in this population.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0739986312445271">
<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>Archival data from 554 Latina undergraduate students were examined. The data were collected between 2005 and 2009 at an urban public college in New York City as part of a study examining stress and resiliency among college students. Approval for this study was granted by the Institutional Review Board at the college where the study was conducted. All individuals included in this study gave their informed consent prior to participating.</p>
<p>Students who were enrolled in a Psychology 101 class and who elected to participate in the study completed a series of questionnaires in a group setting in partial fulfillment of a department-wide research requirement. Upon completion or termination, all participants were debriefed and received a list of the symptoms of depression, local mental health resources, and emergency contact information. A licensed clinical psychologist trained in suicidal crisis intervention was also available for immediate assessment and referral for any participant who reported feeling imminently suicidal, although no such measures were needed throughout the course of the study.</p>
<p>Most participants were freshmen or sophomores in college (75%, <italic>n</italic> = 415). The average age of participants was 19 years (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.14). Regarding Latino subgroup, 35% of the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 125) identified themselves as Dominican American, 22% (<italic>n</italic> = 79) identified themselves as Puerto Rican, and 13% (<italic>n</italic> = 45) reported being of South American nationality. Others were Mexican (3.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 13), Hispanic (2.8%, <italic>n</italic> = 10), reported multiethnicity or did not specify their subgroup. Most participants (81%, <italic>n</italic> = 448) reported an annual family income, or an annual single income if independent, of less than US$50,000. Finally, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being <italic>total disbelief</italic> and 10 being <italic>very strong belief</italic>, the average level of religious belief reported by Latinas in this study was 6.7 (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.10).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>The following measures were administered to capture the variables of interest in this study. The measures were completed in the order in which they are presented as follows.</p>
<sec id="section6-0739986312445271">
<title>The Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739986312445271">Phinney, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0739986312445271">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>)</title>
<p>The MEIM is a 12-item self-report measure designed to measure ethnic identity exploration and commitment among members of all ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739986312445271">Phinney, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0739986312445271">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>). The MEIM measures both the cognitive and affective components of ethnic identification. Individuals rate the applicability of items to themselves on a 4-point scale, and the mean of the item scores is calculated to understand an individual’s overall level of ethnic identification. Scores range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating an individual feels a stronger sense of ethnic identification. The MEIM has been found to have adequate reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739986312445271">Phinney, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0739986312445271">Ponterotto, Gretchen, Utsey, Stracuzzi, &amp; Saya, 2003</xref>). The scale was developed on a sample in which the large minority was Hispanic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739986312445271">Phinney, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, the factor structure of the scale has been replicated in several largely minority samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0739986312445271">Worrell, 2000</xref>). The reliability of the MEIM in our sample, which was calculated using Cronbach’s alpha, was .95.</p>

<p>The LS is a 20-item self-report measure of loneliness. Scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating an individual feels lonelier more frequently. The LS has been found to have high internal consistency and good concurrent and discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739986312445271">Knight, Chisholm, Marsh, &amp; Godfrey, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0739986312445271">Russell et al., 1980</xref>).

<title>Beck Depression Inventory—II (BDI-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739986312445271">Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996</xref>)</title>
<p>The BDI-II is a 21-item, self-report instrument that assesses the depressive symptoms an individual has experienced over the past 2 weeks. Items capture both the cognitive and somatic-affective symptoms of depression. Items are scored on a 4-point scale, with higher scores—that is, scores closer to the maximum score of 36—indicating more diverse and severe symptomatology. The BDI-II has been found to have excellent internal consistency, including when used with a college student sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739986312445271">Beck et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0739986312445271">Whisman, Perez, &amp; Ramel, 2000</xref>), and good convergent, divergent, and content validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0739986312445271">Spencer, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739986312445271">Carmody (2005)</xref> has demonstrated that the scale maintains good reliability and validity when used as a screen for depression among diverse college students. The coefficient alpha for the study sample was .97, indicating the scale maintained good internal reliability within our sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0739986312445271">
<title>Social Problem-Solving Inventory—revised, short form (SPSI-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739986312445271">D’Zurilla, Nezu, &amp; Maydeu-Olivares, 2001</xref>)</title>
<p>The SPSI-R is a 25-item, self-report measure of problem-solving orientation and interpersonal problem-solving skills. The scale is comprised of five 5-item subscales that assess positive problem-solving orientation, negative problem-solving orientation, and avoidant, impulsive, and rational problem-solving styles. Individuals are asked to rate the degree to which each item aligns with their own style, with zero indicating <italic>not at all true of me</italic> and 4 indicating <italic>extremely true of me</italic>. In the current study, only the positive problem-solving orientation scale was used. Scores on this subscale can range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating a better problem-solving orientation. Studies suggest excellent test-retest and internal reliabilities and good concurrent validity for both the entire scale and the individual subscales, including in use with a Hispanic sample in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739986312445271">D’Zurilla et al., 2001</xref>; Morera et al., 2006). The coefficient alpha for the positive problem-solving orientation subscale in our sample was .95.</p>

<title>Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire—abbreviated version (SBQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739986312445271">Cole, 1988</xref>)</title>
<p>The abbreviated version of the SBQ is a 4-item self-report measure that employs a Likert-type scale to assess an individual’s attitude toward, history of, and expectations for suicidal ideation and behavior. The SBQ-Abbreviated Version has been found to have good internal consistency, test-retest reliability over the short term, and good convergent validity, including when used with college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739986312445271">Brown, 2002</xref>). The internal reliability of the SBQ in our sample was adequate (alpha = .77).</p>
<p>Additionally, to understand the prevalence of suicide attempt and current suicidal ideation among students, endorsement of two items from two scales were examined. Question 9 on the BDI-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739986312445271">Beck et al., 1996</xref>) was used to understand current suicidal ideation among students. This item asks respondents to choose the statement that best describes their suicidal ideation during the past 2 weeks. The four response options are as follows: “I don’t have any thoughts of killing myself”; “I have thoughts of killing myself, but I would not carry them out”; “I would like to kill myself”; and “I would kill myself if I had the chance.” For the purposes of calculating the prevalence rate of current suicidal ideation among Latinas, responses were dichotomized to capture whether any suicidal ideation, regardless of severity, was present. Scores on Item 7 from the <italic>Self-Harm Inventory</italic> (SHI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0739986312445271">Sansone, Wiederman, &amp; Sansone,1998</xref>), a well-established and often-used measure of self-injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739986312445271">Latimer, Covic, Cumming, &amp; Tennant, 2009</xref>), were used to understand the prevalence of past suicide attempt among Latina college students. This question asks, “Have you ever intentionally or on purpose attempted suicide, yes or no?”</p>

<p>The BHS is a self-report instrument that consists of 20 true-false statements. It measures the extent of positive and negative beliefs an individual has held about the future in the past week, with higher scores indicating an individual has felt more hopeless recently. The BHS has good psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739986312445271">Beck &amp; Steer, 1988</xref>).

<p>The SRDS is a 40-item self-report instrument that assesses the extent of an individual’s engagement in delinquent acts in the past year. Participants are asked to describe their participation (yes or no) in a wide range of acts, including their engagement in property damage, theft, assault, and substance use. A 31-item, modified version of the SRDS was used: Items that were not relevant to a college population, such as suspension from school and breaking city curfew laws, were removed from the instrument prior to administration. Higher scores indicate an individual has engaged in a greater range of delinquent behaviors. This scale has been found to have adequate reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739986312445271">Keating, Tomishima, &amp; Foster, 2002</xref>).

<p>Analyses were conducted using SAS software, Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sas.com">http://www.sas.com</ext-link>). Prior to conducting the analyses, the data were cleaned. Missing values for all scores, except the SBQ score, were mean replaced. As suicidal behavior was the main variable of interest, missing information on this variable served as an exclusion criterion for the entire record. To understand which factors predicted suicidal behavior among Latina college students, a multivariate regression analysis was run. Prior to finalizing the multivariate estimations in the linear regression analysis, the data were screened for and cleaned of multivariate outliers: Cook’s distances for each observation were calculated and reviewed, and scatter plots were visually inspected. This analysis controlled for level of religious belief as this demographic variable was associated with SBQ score in bivariate analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 554 Latina college students who participated in this study, 20% (<italic>n</italic> = 110) reported current suicidal ideation, as measured by Item 9 (suicidal ideation item) of the BDI-II, and 15% (<italic>n</italic> = 83) reported they had made a past suicide attempt on the SHI. Thirty-seven percent (<italic>n</italic> = 207) of Latinas also reported some expectations for and experiences with suicidal ideation and behavior, as indicated by a non-zero score on the SBQ (mean SBQ score for all participants = 1.6, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.12).</p>
<p>The result of the multivariate regression analysis, in which suicidal behavior among Latinas was predicted from depression, hopelessness, loneliness, social problem solving, ethnic identity, and delinquent behavior, is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739986312445271">Table 1</xref>. Thirty percent of the variance in scores on the SBQ was explained by this model (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .295). Suicidal behavior among Latina college students was predicted by loneliness (<italic>B</italic> = .08, <italic>t</italic> = 4.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), hopelessness (<italic>B</italic> = .13, <italic>t</italic> = 3.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), depression (<italic>B</italic> = .12, <italic>t</italic> = 7.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and delinquency (<italic>B</italic> = .15, <italic>t</italic> = 2.37, <italic>p</italic> = .018). A significant negative association was found between positive problem-solving orientation (<italic>B</italic> = –.09, <italic>t</italic> = 3.42, <italic>p</italic> = .001) and suicidal behavior among Latinas.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is one of the first to explore the prevalence and predictors of suicidal behavior among Latina college students. We found more than one in seven Latina college students had made a past suicide attempt, one in nine reported thoughts of engaging in future suicidal behavior, and one in five reported current suicidal ideation. This rate of current suicidal ideation among Latina college students is similar to 12-month prevalence rates of suicidal ideation observed among Latina high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739986312445271">CDC, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In our sample, suicidal behavior or expectations for suicidal behavior among Latinas was predicted by loneliness, hopelessness, depression, and a less positive problem-solving orientation. These findings extend the information available in the literature regarding factors that contribute to suicidal behavior among Latina high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312445271">Zayas, Kaplan, Turner, Romano, &amp; Gonzalez-Ramos, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0739986312445271">Zayas et al., 2005</xref>) and college students generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739986312445271">Gutierrez et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, these findings offer targets for interventions aimed at identifying and preventing suicidal behavior among Latina college students. Specifically, these findings suggest that Latina college students who lack social support or social skills may be particularly likely to engage in internalizing behaviors. Additionally, similar to known risk factors for suicidal behavior in the general population, Latina college students who experience symptoms of depression and hopelessness are at increased risk for engaging in suicidal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739986312445271">Canino &amp; Roberts, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739986312445271">Heisel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0739986312445271">Schwartz &amp; Friedman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Suicidal behavior among Latina college students was also predicted by delinquency. This finding aligns with information from studies of suicidal behavior and delinquency across populations. For instance, suicidal behavior and deviant behavior have been found to co-occur among college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739986312445271">Duane, Stewart, &amp; Bridgeland, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, in an analysis limited to predicting suicidal behavior among college women, delinquency, in addition to depression, remained a significant predictor in the multivariate model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739986312445271">Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739986312445271">Curry and Cuellar (2007)</xref> found that suicide attempts among Latina juvenile delinquents was related to specific drug use (e.g., marijuana and inhalants) and that gang membership was protective against suicidal behavior.</p>
<p>A relationship between ethnic identification and suicidal behavior was not observed in our sample, although relationships between acculturation, ethnic identity, and suicidal behavior have been proposed and empirically supported in the literature examining suicidal behavior among adolescent Latinas and Latina high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312445271">O’Donnell et al., 2003</xref>; Phinney et al., 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0739986312445271">Zayas et al., 2005</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0739986312445271">Turner, Kaplan, Zayas, &amp; Ross, 2002</xref>, for an exception). The failure of ethnic identity to predict suicidal behavior in our analyses may be explained by ideas and findings about acculturation and ethnic identity in the extant literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312445271">O’Donnell et al., 2003</xref>; Phinney et al., 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0739986312445271">Zayas et al., 2005</xref>). It has been postulated that the relationship between ethnic identity and suicidal behavior is moderated by a third variable. Both Phinney and colleagues and O’Donnell and colleagues have hypothesized that ethnic identity may only play a key role in esteem and behavior when the ethnic group comprises the minority rather than the majority population in an individual’s community. At the urban institution where this study took place, Hispanic individuals comprise 40% of the student population and are the largest racial and ethnic group in the college. Another explanation offered by Zayas and colleagues is that acculturative stress or discrepancies in acculturation between generations who reside together, as opposed to individual acculturation, contributes to suicidal behavior among Latinas.</p>
<sec id="section16-0739986312445271">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>While our study is one of the first to pinpoint factors contributing to suicidal behavior among Latina college students, more research is needed. Our model explained 30% of the variance in suicidality among Latina college students. Future studies may wish to devise and test more comprehensive models of suicidality among Latina college students. For instance, the relationship between suicidality among Latina college students and cultural factors linked to suicidality in adolescent Latinas, for example, differences in acculturation among family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0739986312445271">Zayas et al., 2005</xref>), merits further investigation. Intrafamilial communication difficulties, such as limited reciprocal communications between mothers and daughters, have also been linked to internalizing behavior, and indirectly to suicidal behavior, among Latina adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986312445271">Baumann et al., 2010</xref>). Whether intrafamilial difficulties continue to predict suicidal behavior among Latina college students has not been studied. Understanding of the applicability of current, sociocultural models of suicidal behavior in Latina adolescents, and thus the applicability of proffered recommendations for prevention and intervention with this population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739986312445271">Goldston et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739986312445271">Zayas &amp; Pilat, 2008</xref>), to Latina college students awaits such study.</p>
<p>To further understanding of cultural factors related to suicidal behavior among Latina college students, future studies may also wish to consider whether Latinos are a majority in the community and to investigate specific subgroups within the Latina population (e.g., Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, as compared to Dominicans and U.S.-born vs. foreign-born Latinas). Differences in suicidality and mental health problems among different groups of Latinos have been found, but results are preliminary and inconclusive (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739986312445271">Del Pilar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739986312445271">Fortuna et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, other types of state and trait factors that have been associated with suicidal behavior, especially among Latina high school students and/or Latino college students, may merit inclusion in future studies of suicidal behavior among Latina college students. For example, heavy, acute alcohol use has been associated with suicidal ideation among college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0739986312445271">Stephenson et al., 2006</xref>). Preliminary evidence further suggests the relationship between binge drinking and suicidal ideation may be moderated by ethnicity and that Latino college students are among those individuals for whom the positive relationship between binge drinking and suicidal behavior holds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739986312445271">Schaffer, Jeglic, &amp; Stanley, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, although our data indicated a significant minority of Latina college students currently had suicidal ideation and had made a lifetime suicide attempt, it may be that Latinas are at highest risk for suicidal behavior during adolescence, as findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739986312445271">Fortuna and colleagues (2007)</xref> suggest. Future studies capturing 12-month prevalence rates of suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts among Latina college students are needed to understand the prevalence of suicide attempts among Latinas <italic>during</italic> college. Our suicide-attempt data measured lifetime suicide attempts.</p>
