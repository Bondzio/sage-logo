<p>In his paper, Simon Appolloni confronts us with the question: <italic>to what end</italic> do we define environmentalism as religion, as Taylor does? Because of the authority or power the term bestows? Chris Hrynkow points out that religion and environmentalism may indeed share <italic>form</italic> and <italic>function</italic>, particularly as vocation, and that naming environmentalism as religion invites (perhaps forces) potentially beneficial emic and etic reflection; and yet, as Sarah Kleeb cautions, broad-based application of such a loaded term as “religion” to those who quite clearly reject it, or at least are uncomfortable with it, may constitute a kind of colonization of identity on behalf of scholars that should raise concern.</p>
<p>At the very least, it seems that we can safely conclude that Taylor’s dismissal of the debate over whether or not to use the term “religion” to describe deep environmental commitments as unimportant or irrelevant is unsatisfactory. Indeed, the matter obviously still has relevance; debates continue today over what exactly constitutes the subject of scholars of religion, how we should identify it, and how we should approach it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0008429813491675">1</xref>
</sup> This should in no way put into question the interesting and valuable observations and analyses put forth by Taylor and others about environmentalism and religion, or get in the way of such good work. It should, however, as all participants in the roundtable agree, give us pause to reflect on what it means to identify forms of environmentalism as <italic>religious</italic>. Though, no doubt, hard and fast boundaries between religion, spirituality, and ethics are problematic, and maybe no longer tenable, perhaps the Wittgensteinian “family resemblances” approach that conflates them for analytical purposes is a little too easy, and equally problematic.</p>
<p>For environmentalists who self-consciously identify as religious, this issue is a bit clearer (or different, at least). As David Chidester points out – and he is not the only one to do so – academics do not have sole authority in determining what counts as “religion” or “religious” (2005: 50).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429813491675">2</xref>
</sup> Thus, in the case of some environmentalists at least, we as scholars can take our cue from the language they themselves embrace (though of course this invites a different kind of analysis, including <italic>why</italic> such environmentalists would readily adopt the term “religious” – as is addressed by Simon).</p>
<p>Rather, as has been made clear by the papers here, the issue is with applying the terms “religion” and “religious” to those who would <italic>not</italic> be comfortable with them. Chidester’s point holds here as well. I suspect, based on the small sample of environmentalists in Toronto that I surveyed and interviewed, this would constitute the majority – though many (not all) would happily describe themselves as <italic>spiritual</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008429813491675">Maintenay, 2008</xref>; this is consonant with Chris’s experience with his Environmental Studies classmates). To do any justice to the people that are our subjects, this distinction needs to be honoured, even if we might question the rigidity of the boundaries. While it may be fruitful to find parallels to religion in forms of environmentalism – and indeed, genuine elements of religion and spirituality therein – to lump self-identified naturalists and secularists in the broad category of “green religion” (or “dark green religion”) might simply be too problematic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0008429813491675">3</xref>
</sup> What should be clear by now in any discussion of religious studies methodology is that the imposition of the notion of “religion” as a social-scientific category is fraught with difficulties and carries heavy, particularly Protestant, baggage, not so easily dismissed;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0008429813491675">4</xref>
</sup> particularly, as mentioned, when the <italic>subjects</italic> themselves reject the label “religious.”</p>
<p>There is another issue arising from this discussion. The idea of environmentalism as religion tends to include the assumption that religion is purely <italic>functional</italic>. Taylor himself certainly views it as such, at least personally, as he concludes his “Personal Coda” in <italic>Dark Green Religion</italic> by stating: “What I have been long looking for is a <italic>sensible</italic> religion, one that is rationally defensible as well as socially powerful enough to save us from our least-sensible selves” (222, emphasis mine).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0008429813491675">5</xref>
</sup> The assumption is that religion, like anything else, is invented for a purpose and serves a function in society and in people’s individual lives; but further, that it can and should be judged only on this basis. The trouble is not so much with the first part of this statement (obviously religion <italic>does</italic> serve a purpose and have a function), but rather the second: religion is either <italic>useful</italic> with respect to the particular function we wish it to perform, or not. This highly technocratic approach is problematic in itself,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0008429813491675">6</xref>
</sup> but also leads to disturbing consequences; who decides what purpose religion ought to serve (and thus how it should be manipulated, and/or imposed)? It also, as Simon points out, dismisses the ancient religious traditions to which the majority of the world’s population adheres, if such traditions are judged harmfully obsolete with respect to attitudes toward the environment. Environmentalism can serve as a “newer and better model” of religion, better serving the purpose of saving the planet and validating modern science. This, along with the already discussed conflation of the terms “religion” and “spirituality” for analytic purposes, makes dismissing definitional issues doubly problematic: the functionalist assumptions can be critiqued as too narrow an understanding of religion.</p>
<p>Without losing sight of these important points, let me return to what I emphasized in my introductory essay. Ultimately, this is not simply a question of labels and power-sharing – though it is that – but one of putting our finger on something unavoidably human: the act of meaning-making, including real, qualitative distinctions of worth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0008429813491675">7</xref>
</sup> This can be, and has been, labelled “religious,” “spiritual”, “ethical,” and still other things – or all of the above – without changing the fundamental act itself. But perhaps we have approached the issue the wrong way. To pretend there is a static thing called “religion,” however we might stipulate its exact definition to fit our observations, may lead to more snags than it is worth. Anne Taves provokes this thought in her 2010 Presidential Address to the American Academy of Religion. The following, I think, is particularly apt in the context of our present discussion:<disp-quote>
<p>In stipulating definitions, we tacitly acknowledge and attempt to get around the underlying problem that is dogging us: the historical instability of our object of study. What we and our subjects refer to as religion, religions, traditions, the sacred, magic, the occult, superstition, folk beliefs, fetishes, and so on implicitly embed claims about what is, or ought to be, valued. These claims, more often than not, can be located at sites of struggle where people contest the meaning of events and make claims about what matters most in the overall scheme of things. If our object of study is unstable and shaped in important ways by the point of view that scholars and subjects bring to it, then I think we should give up attempting to solve the problem of defining religion by offering stipulated definitions. Stipulated definitions artificially stabilize the processes whereby people decide on the meaning of events and determine what matters most. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0008429813491675">Taves, 2011</xref>: 290–291)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The <italic>process </italic>of valuation, then, becomes more important as the object of analysis than does a “thing” we identify as “religion” (or “spirituality,” or “ethics,” for that matter). In our context, the process of valuation would involve distinguishing environmental concerns (or the environment as a whole) as of particular worth, as what “matters most.”</p>
<p>I think Taylor would fundamentally agree with this. What are paramount are the phenomena themselves, not the terms we choose to describe them. Yet, Taves is clearly emphasizing <italic>subject-oriented</italic> analysis; the <italic>people</italic> who “decide on the meaning of events and determine what matters most.” Surely whether or not a person or group rejects the designation “religion” or “religious” in reference to his/her/their environmental beliefs and practices says something important about his/her/their process of valuation; the very contestation of these terms is an important part of our analysis of the “phenomena.” To place widely different forms of environmentalism under the umbrella of “religion” for analytical purposes thus ignores a key aspect of the phenomena. In fact, relating to the earlier point about functionalist assumptions: designating environmentalism as a “religion” may say more about the scholar, whose point of view shapes the object of study.</p>
<p>Taylor in fact does an admirable job of tackling the thorniness of the terms in the Afterword of his text. However, though it is true that “scholarly tropes are not magic and nobody owns them” (224), terms like “religion” (and thus tropes like “dark green religion”) are not neutral, nor purely functional, if we acknowledge even most basically the influence we as scholars of religion have over the object of our study with the terminology and approaches we use. Applying such terms to social movements such as environmentalism invites discussion, such as the present one; far from <italic>getting in the way</italic> of a better understanding of deep environmental commitment and valuation, such discussion, I think, further illumines it.</p>

<p>I should stress here that I am not denying wholesale the (etic) value of applying the term “religion” even in instances where such a term is not of indigenous use, or is explicitly rejected. Particularly if environmentalists are in some way appropriating or usurping (as Simon Appolloni puts it) power or, specifically, moral authority from traditional religion – even while rejecting religious language and symbols – scholars certainly have the responsibility to illuminate this process through religious studies methodology (and, as Simon further notes and as I touch on later, studies on scholar-activists themselves, like Taylor, who have particular agendas). Indeed, as Chris Hrynkow discusses – well enough that I do not feel I need to address it more fully here – such work can help secular environmentalists themselves better understand their own positions and commitments. Indeed, Taylor (114–115) gives an example of how surfers who read his article on surfing spirituality came to appreciate the previously unperceived or unacknowledged dimension of religion in their meaning-systems. Naming environmentalism as a religion can be both empowering and damning; thus this label is both sought and rejected by secular environmentalists themselves. (My thanks go to an anonymous reviewer for inviting this clarification.)</p>
