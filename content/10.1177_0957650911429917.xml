<abstract>
<p>The reduction of the pressure loss, applying a passive flow control method, was investigated in a three-dimensional, square cross-sectioned Borda–Carnot sudden expansion, representing a frequent element of pipe systems. The flow control elements were mini-flaps, placed on the edge of the step of the sudden expansion, forming a mini-diffuser. The angle of the mini-flaps, relative to the main flow direction, was changed, an optimum angle for reducing the pressure loss was found. The global flow parameters were determined based on static pressure measurements, while details of the velocity and turbulent intensity field were examined using Laser Doppler Velocimetry. Further analysis of the flow field, for different setups, was carried out by Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamic calculations. The method can be readily applied in practice with very low-investment costs and can enhance the efficiency of power generation and air conditioning systems as well.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0957650911429917"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In today’s industrial world, when designing certain system components incorporated in fluids engineering systems, like pipes between energy producing devices and other parts, (e.g. combined cycle power plants connection between the gas turbine and the heat recovery steam generator unit), energetically good performance is often of secondary importance. The industry has other requirements that need to be fulfilled, such as proper functionality of the technology, easy-to-manufacture and low-cost components and very often limited space allowance. The fulfillment of such demands usually undermines the energetically favourable behaviour of the system components, resulting in an increased pressure loss. It is beneficial to elaborate a concept for moderating pressure loss in fluids engineering system components, while simultaneously retaining the aforementioned benefits.</p>
<p>One possible solution is called flow control. The concept of flow control is the following: by introducing small, simple, and low-cost elements into the flow, its behaviour can be changed, so that it reaches a more desirable state, from an energetic point of view. The concept works properly, however, the vast majority of flow control researchers are mostly concerned with flows connected to aviation, mainly flows around airfoils or turbine blades [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650911429917">1</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650911429917">4</xref></bold>]. Also, the methods they use are usually sophisticated, and therefore would have a prohibitive price for the industry [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650911429917">5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650911429917">6</xref></bold>]. A great variety of passive (no external energy used for the control) and active (external energy is used for the control) methods have been elaborated. Applying some simplifying modifications, they could be used in industrial fluid delivery systems, e.g. to control duct flows or pipe elements such as: bends, diffusers, or Borda–Carnot sudden expansions, which frequently appear in power generation and air conditioning systems. The latter one has been selected as the subject for this research, as it is frequently present in industrial application. The setup is simple and as its pressure loss is fairly large, there is great potential in reducing it.</p>
<p>The complicated three-dimensional (3D) flow in a sudden expansion can be traced back to a simpler setup, the backward facing step. This configuration has been extensively examined numerically and experimentally as well, due to the many interesting flow features – separation at a given line, separation bubble, shear layer, reattachment – it exhibits. Most of the published studies are, however, reduced to two-dimensional (2D) cases [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650911429917">7</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650911429917">8</xref></bold>] and only a few articles are available for a more practical 3D turbulent case [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650911429917">9</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650911429917">13</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>The backward facing step setup is also favoured by flow control researchers [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650911429917">14</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957650911429917">15</xref></bold>]. Generally, their main control goal is to reduce the size of the separation bubble, as it is believed to cause negative effects, such as increasing pressure loss in the sudden expansions and diffusers. Therefore, the response of the separation bubble to certain flow control methods is thoroughly examined. However, data are sparse when it comes to improving global parameters [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957650911429917">16</xref></bold>], such as the loss coefficient.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to present a simple, easy-to-mount, economic, and robust passive flow control method, to reduce the pressure loss in a Borda–Carnot sudden expansion. The optimal size and position of the flow control elements are investigated by pressure measurements, Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The same concept can then be implemented in the real industrial devices, where optimal conditions for fluid flow cannot be provided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0957650911429917"><title>2 MEASUREMENTS</title>
<p>The measurements consisted of two parts: first, a preliminary test rig was setup to check the effects of the examined passive flow control elements based on simple static pressure measurements. Second, the effects of the passive flow control elements were examined in a Borda–Carnot sudden expansion by means of static pressure and LDV measurements. The measurements were carried out at a Mach number&lt;0.1, calculated from the average inlet velocity of the air (<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>) and the speed of sound in air at 20 °C; therefore, the flow is considered incompressible.</p>
<p>Before advancing further, it should be stated that all relevant values (i.e. important from the point of view of the measurement) are given in a dimensionless form: length scales are non-dimensionalized by the step height (<italic>h</italic>) of the examined Borda–Carnot sudden expansion, pressure is non-dimensionalized by the average inlet dynamic pressure (<italic>p<sub>dyn</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>) and velocity is non-dimensionalized by the average inlet velocity (<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>).</p>
<sec id="sec3-0957650911429917"><title>2.1 Experimental setup</title>
<p>A test rig was constructed to investigate the efficiency of the examined passive flow control technique. The apparatus consisted of two different test sections – one preliminary test section, and one Borda–Carnot sudden expansion – fixed onto a miniature wind tunnel, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650911429917">Figs 1</xref>(a) and (b), respectively. Note, that in reality, the two test sections had the same inlet cross-section, the preliminary test section in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650911429917">Fig. 1</xref>(a) is being scaled up for better visibility of the control elements. The wind tunnel consisted of a variable revolution per minute radial fan, leading to a settling chamber. The fan sucked air from the ambient atmosphere through a pipe. Its pressure side was left free, so it blew directly into the settling chamber, augmenting the pressure inside. This difference of pressure between the inside of the box and the atmosphere drove the air through a honeycomb and an attached smoothly converging duct, resulting in a uniform velocity distribution at the entrance of the test section. The uniformity was checked by Pitot-static tube measurements. Two pressure taps were placed on the side of the converging duct and calibrated in order to determine the flowrate.
<fig id="fig1-0957650911429917" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Sketch of the experimental apparatus: (a) test section 1: simple outlet (magnified) and (b) test section 2: Borda–Carnot sudden expansion</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911429917-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The preliminary test section consisted of a short segment (4 <italic>h</italic> long along the <italic>x</italic>-direction) of a duct of square cross-section (<italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub><italic> = </italic>3 <italic>h</italic> × 3 <italic>h</italic>), named as simple outlet. The walls of the simple outlet were made out of 9-mm thick plywood. The flow control elements – rectangular metal sheets of size: 0.4 <italic>h</italic> × 3 <italic>h</italic> – were placed on the edge of the outlet, at an angle <italic>α</italic> relative to the main flow direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911429917">Fig. 2</xref>). Four static pressure taps were placed on the four walls of the simple outlet, 1 <italic>h</italic> downstream of the inlet cross-section of the test section, enabling us to record the average static pressure in the test section. The second test section was a Borda–Carnot sudden expansion duct, with a smaller cross-section of <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub> = 3 <italic>h</italic> × 3 <italic>h</italic> and larger cross-section of <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> = 5 <italic>h</italic> x 5 <italic>h</italic>, resulting in a step height of <italic>h</italic> = 50 mm, and an area ratio of <italic>AR</italic> = <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub>/<italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub> = 2.78. The upstream part of the duct was 8 <italic>h</italic> and the downstream part 16 <italic>h</italic> long. Pressure taps were placed in the same manner, as for the simple outlet: 1 <italic>h</italic> downstream of the inlet cross-section (i.e. 7 <italic>h</italic> upstream of the sudden expansion). Due to certain limitations of the miniature wind-tunnel, the test sections had to be vertically placed, i.e. the main direction of the flow was vertical, which put a restriction on the maximum length of the test sections due to reasons of mechanical stability. Based on previous literature research, the channel was designed to be long enough to allow the reattachment of the flow; however, it did not result to be sufficiently long to allow pressure recovery of the flow, as it is shown later in this article. The walls of the Borda–Carnot test section were also made out of 9-mm thick plywood, except for one wall of the larger cross-section, which was made of a 5-mm thick optically clear plexi-glass, allowing for flow visualization and LDV measurements. The flow control elements were the same as described above, and they were placed on the edge of the step of the Borda–Carnot element. Both test sections were open to the atmosphere.

<sec id="sec4-0957650911429917"><title>2.2 Measurement principle</title>
<p>The most important goal of the measurement was to determine the relationship between the angle <italic>α</italic> of the flaps and the reduction in the pressure loss, and to explore the velocity field. Based on the preliminary studies, it turned out that the flow is highly sensitive to even the slightest change in <italic>α</italic>, therefore, a precise measurement technique was to be developed with a sufficiently high resolution of the angle measurement. The system is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911429917">Fig. 2</xref>.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0957650911429917"><title>2.2.1 Angle measurement</title>
<p>For determining angle <italic>α</italic>, a laser beam was projected on the metallic sheets (one at a time) and reflected by a mirror, stuck on the back of each metal sheet. The reflected beam reached a sheet with a scale on it, placed sufficiently far from the point of reflection, thus enlarging the small changes in the angle. The estimated absolute error of the optical angle measurement is <italic>δα<sub>opt</sub></italic> = 0.6°.</p>
<p>For the Borda–Carnot expansion, the optical method for setting the angle of the flow control elements described above could not be used because of lack of space, therefore, it was substituted by a simpler mechanical method. As this method was less accurate, the resolution of the measured angles was significantly reduced. The estimated absolute error of the mechanical angle measurement is <italic>δα<sub>mech</sub></italic> = 2°.</p>

<p>For describing the pressure loss of a given pipe element, the use of the so-called resistance coefficient is wide-spread, for which a general definition is given in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0957650911429917">equation (1)</xref> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650911429917">17</xref></bold>]

where <italic>ζ<sub>loc</sub></italic> (–) is the local resistance coefficient, without the frictional loss through the element, Δ<italic>p</italic>′ (Pa) the pressure loss, <italic>ρ</italic> (kg/m <sup>3)</sup> the density of the fluid, and v<sub>1</sub> (m/s) the average velocity of the flow upstream of the element. Although hydraulics is a popular topic among researchers and very detailed studies are available on the resistance coefficients of pipe elements, no indications were found by the authors of this article about between which two points the pressure loss Δ<italic>p</italic>′ of a Borda–Carnot sudden expansion has to be measured. Therefore, a pressure loss coefficient – valid for the present measurement only – was defined in the following way, in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0957650911429917">equations (2)</xref> to (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0957650911429917">4</xref>)

where <italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub> (Pa) is the static pressure measured 7 <italic>h</italic> upstream of the sudden expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650911429917">Fig. 1</xref>) and <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> (Pa) the atmospheric pressure, measured at the same height (<italic>x</italic>-coordinate) as <italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub>. Using Δ<italic>p<sub>meas</sub></italic>, the pressure loss Δ<italic>p</italic>′ can be calculated from the Bernoulli equation, as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0957650911429917">equation (3)</xref>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0957650911429917"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911429917-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub> (m/s) is the average flow velocity upstream, and <italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub> (m/s) is the average flow velocity downstream of the sudden expansion. From this, a pressure loss coefficient <italic>c<sub>pl</sub></italic> is according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0957650911429917">equation (4)</xref>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0957650911429917"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911429917-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The above-defined pressure loss coefficient has exactly the same form as the generally used <italic>ζ<sub>loc</sub></italic>. The main difference is that the two points, between which Δ<italic>p</italic>′ is supposed to be measured are exactly defined by the authors and are only valid for this measurement configuration. The absolute errors of the pressure difference measurements and the pressure loss coefficient are estimated to be <italic>δp</italic> = 1 Pa and <italic>δc<sub>pl</sub> = </italic>0.01, respectively.</p>

<p>For planning the measurements, six different dimensionless constants were considered, that can have an effect on the flow in a BC element. Three of them are geometrical: (1) the area ratio of the Borda–Carnot element (<italic>AR</italic>), (2) the angle of the flow control elements (<italic>α</italic>), and (3) the length of the flaps (<italic>l</italic>/<italic>h</italic>), and three are fluid dynamical: (4) the Reynolds number, (5) the inlet velocity profile, and (6) the inlet turbulence intensity. Numbers (3), (5), and (6) were only examined by CFD, for the rest of the parameters measurements and CFD calculations were carried out as well.</p>

The tendency can be clearly observed: the pressure loss coefficient is continuously decreasing as the angle is increasing, and it reaches a minimum at around <italic>α</italic> = 10°. Further increase of angle <italic>α</italic> results in the slope of the pressure loss curve turning positive, and at around <italic>α</italic> = 20°, the loss reaches the same value as it was at the beginning (which is the loss without any flow control elements), and it is even further increased by increasing the angle onward. The explanation for the shape of the curve can be the following: at the beginning, the metal plates work as a small diffuser attached to the end of the simple outlet, creating a suction effect at the end of the channel. After reaching a critical angle, the flow becomes separated, and no further reduction of the pressure loss coefficient is available with this setup. The results can be partially supported by literature data. According to Idelchik [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650911429917">17</xref></bold>], a diffuser of an opening angle up to 40° (angle <italic>α</italic> measured by the authors is half opening angle!) is more effective than a sudden expansion, however, for greater angles, the pressure loss exceeds that of a sudden expansion, which can be clearly seen from the present measurement data. However, the optimum angle for a square diffuser is said to be around 7°, which is much smaller than in our case: 2<italic>α</italic> = 20°. A possible explanation for this is that the metal flaps are so short that the flow is still able to overcome the increase in the static pressure without separation from the flaps. As a conclusion, the optimum angle of the metal flaps is at around <italic>α</italic> = 10°, which results in a 12 per cent reduction of the pressure loss coefficient of the simple outlet.

<p>For the Borda–Carnot sudden expansion, three different measurements were carried out: (1) determining the pressure loss coefficient as a function of the angle <italic>α</italic>, (2) static pressure measurements along the wall of the larger cross-section for determining Reynolds number dependency and gathering data for CFD validation, and (3) LDV measurements of velocity profiles also as a basis of comparison for CFD calculations at a later state of this research.</p>
<p>The relation between the pressure loss coefficient and <italic>α</italic> for the Borda–Carnot sudden expansion can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650911429917">Fig. 3(b)</xref> with a coarser resolution of the angle. The shape of the curve is very similar to that of the simple outlet, and even the minimum value of the pressure loss coefficient can be found at around the same <italic>α</italic> (<italic>α</italic> = 10 ± 2°). Therefore, it can be concluded, that the passive flow control elements work well also in the Borda–Carnot sudden expansion, reducing the pressure loss coefficient of our definition by 21 per cent relative to the case without any flow control.</p>
<p>Static pressure measurements for different Reynolds numbers, along the wall without flow control elements, can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650911429917">Fig. 4</xref>. The origin of the <italic>x</italic>/<italic>h</italic> axis is at the sudden expansion. The static pressure values (<italic>p<sub>stat</sub></italic>) were non-dimensionalized by the average dynamic pressure being present in the smaller cross-section (<italic>p<sub>dyn</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>). Two basic conclusions can be drawn from the diagram: (1) there exists a limit in the Reynolds number, above which the flow is Reynolds number independent <inline-formula id="ilm4-0957650911429917"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math4-0957650911429917"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Re</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>37</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (Reynolds number based on the inlet hydraulic diameter <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub> of the duct, average inlet velocity <italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>, and the kinematic viscosity of air <italic>ν</italic> pertaining to the measurement conditions) <inline-formula id="ilm5-0957650911429917"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math5-0957650911429917"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Re</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>46</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (Reynolds number based on the step height <italic>h</italic>); (2) the difference between the static pressure in the duct and the atmospheric pressure is continuously increasing after the expansion, and it does not reach a maximum after which the pressure would decrease again due to frictional losses. This indicates that the Borda–Carnot expansion still has an effect at the outlet; however, this fact does not influence the tendency of the relationship between the reduction in pressure loss and the angle of the metal flaps.

<p>LDV measurements were carried out at three different Reynolds numbers, as given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0957650911429917">Table 2</xref>, with the highest being the lowest in the Reynolds number independent range.

<p>Based on previous studies, the flow did not show any major asymmetries to the <italic>xy</italic> plane. Therefore, only half profiles were measured along the <italic>y</italic>-direction at <italic>z</italic>/<italic>h</italic> = 0, for six different step heights: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10 <italic>h</italic> along the <italic>x</italic>-direction downstream of the sudden expansion. The results of the dimensionless <italic>x</italic>-velocity (<italic>v<sub>x</sub></italic>/<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>) and the normalized Reynolds stress along the <italic>x</italic>-direction as a function of the dimensionless duct wall length (<italic>y</italic>/<italic>h</italic>) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650911429917">Fig. 5</xref>.

<p>The velocity profiles show how the jet, entering from <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub> to <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> is widening to reach a newly developed turbulent profile. Backflow in the separation bubble can be clearly observed, and the reattachment length is estimated to be around 8–9 <italic>h</italic>. Though the flow is able to reattach, for full pressure recovery and for a fully developed turbulent profile, a longer channel would be needed. Profiles of the normalized Reynolds stress along the <italic>x</italic>-direction indicate that maybe a longer averaging time is needed for better measurement results.</p>

Although the dimensionless static pressure curves indicate that for <italic>Re<sub>D</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> &lt; 1.37·5, the flow is Reynolds number-dependent, the dimensionless velocity and turbulent intensity profiles are rather coincident in the main flow region and show little discrepancy in the free shear layer and the separation bubble.

<sec id="sec11-0957650911429917"><title>3 CFD STUDIES</title>
<p>Two-dimensional CFD calculations were carried out by Ansys FLUENT software. As the simulations were done in 2D, while the flow is clearly 3D, the simulations are by no means to be validated by the measurements. CFD calculations served only as a further analysis of the flow, by checking parameters that could not be investigated by measurements, like sensitivity to the inlet turbulent intensity, inlet velocity profile, or length of the flaps.</p>
<p>Also, mesh independency study and calculations with different turbulence models (<italic>kω</italic>-SST and Reynolds stress models) were carried out to check whether the basic flow features are captured by the simulations.</p>
<p>The computational domain had the same dimensions as the Borda–Carnot test section along the <italic>x</italic>-direction, while along the <italic>y</italic>-direction, only half of the measurement geometry was modelled because of symmetry reasons. Three different meshes with different resolutions were generated to check mesh independency. The boundary layer was fully resolved by the computational mesh.</p>
<sec id="sec12-0957650911429917"><title>3.1 Comparison of measurement and CFD results</title>
<p>Though it was mentioned before that our CFD calculations cannot be validated by the measurements, still a comparison has been done to check whether the main flow features are captured well by the numerical simulation. Measurement data were compared with the numerical case carried out on normal mesh, with uniform velocity inlet, 5 per cent inlet turbulence intensity, and <italic>kω</italic>-SST model. Results of other CFD calculations are not shown, as there is no significant discrepancy between the calculated data of the different setups. The first row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650911429917">Fig. 7</xref> shows the comparison of CFD and measurement data of the velocity profiles, at three different step heights (2, 6, and 10 <italic>h</italic>) downstream of the sudden expansion. Data of the static pressure distribution on the wall are shown in the second row.
<fig id="fig7-0957650911429917" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Comparison of CFD and LDV measurement results for different step heights, in the Borda–Carnot sudden expansion without any flow control</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911429917-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650911429917">Fig. 7</xref>, the following things can be observed: calculated and measured velocity profiles coincide fairly well at the height of 2 <italic>h</italic>, while advancing further downstream, a more intense widening of the measurement results can be noticed. This can be due to the 3D effects (the jet has all directions to dilate) and uncertainties introduced by the turbulence models. Also, a slower mixing between the stagnant or slowly moving fluid and the main flow can be noticed. As for the static pressure curves, an observable difference also exits between the two curves. However, for this research, the two measurement points needed to calculate the pressure loss (static pressure at −7 <italic>h</italic> and the atmospheric pressure) are very well estimated by the calculations.</p>
<p>Altogether, a conclusion can be drawn that though the quantitative comparison between CFD and measurement results is to be treated with criticism, the main flow features are captured well by the 2D calculations. Therefore, they can be used for further analysis of the flow and its sensitivity to certain parameter changes. The angle dependence of the pressure loss coefficient was examined also by CFD calculations, and a minumum pressure loss was found at <italic>α</italic> = 12°, which is in good accordance with the measurement results. The minimum of the pressure loss coefficient was found to be <italic>c<sub>pl</sub></italic> = 0.37 ± 0.01 by the measurements at α = 10 ± 2° and <italic>c<sub>pl</sub></italic> = 0.37 by the CFD calculations for <italic>α</italic> = 12° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650911429917">Fig. 8</xref>).

</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0957650911429917"><title>3.2 Other CFD parameters</title>
<p>Two other parameters – the inlet velocity distribution and the length of the flaps (<italic>l</italic>) – were examined only by CFD calculations at the present state of the research. Due to the characteristics of the measurement facility, a uniform inlet velocity profile was examined primarily; however, in real duct systems, it almost never occurs. Therefore, the effect of the angle of the flaps on the pressure loss coefficient was examined for a fully developed turbulent inlet velocity profile. The result obtained for the fully developed turbulent profile and that obtained for the uniform inlet profile, are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650911429917">Fig. 8(a)</xref>. The most important feature of the diagram is that for the turbulent profile, there exists a minimum of the pressure loss coefficient as well, at around <italic>α</italic> = 11°, which indicates that the upstream velocity profile does not radically influence the effect of the flaps, the passive control can be considered robust. By slightly offsetting, artificially, the curve of the turbulent inlet results to match its minimum to the minimum of the result of the uniform inlet, it can be observed that the two curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650911429917">Fig. 8(b)</xref> are almost perfectly coincident in the region of the local minimum. There is a somewhat significant difference in the slope of the two curves, the turbulent one being the flatter, which means that the flow is less sensitive to the change in angle, at least in the examined range.</p>
<p>The other examined parameter was the effect of the length of the flaps on the pressure loss coefficient. The result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650911429917">Fig. 9</xref> for <italic>α</italic> = 12° and uniform velocity inlet. The calculated range lies between the case of no passive control (<italic>l</italic>/<italic>h</italic> = 0) and the case of a diffuser (flap reaches the duct wall). A continuous decrease in the pressure loss coefficient can be observed as the length of the flaps is increasing, which could easily lead us to the conclusion that the use of a diffuser is the most favourable case. However, it should be noted that the tendency of the curve is hyperbolic, which indicates a significant increase in the gain for short flaps and less significant gain for longer ones. If the whole gain (diffuser case) is considered as 100 per cent at <italic>l</italic>/<italic>h</italic> = 4.8, a flap of <italic>l</italic>/<italic>h</italic> = 2.4, which is half of the length of the diffuser, results in an improvement of 90 per cent in the pressure loss reduction. Therefore, the use of mini flaps can be economically favourable (easier and cheaper to fabricate than a diffuser) and in cases with lack of space as well.

<sec id="sec14-0957650911429917"><title>4 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PLANS</title>
<p>A passive flow control technique was investigated by the authors to decrease the pressure loss of a Borda–Carnot sudden expansion. The flow control elements were mini-flaps, placed on the edge of the sudden expansion, and their angle relative to the main flow direction was changed. The relationship between the angle of the flaps and the pressure loss was first shown by pressure measurements, finding an optimum angle at around <italic>α</italic> = 10 ± 2° for both the <italic>AR</italic> = ∞ and the <italic>AR</italic> = 2.78 aspect ratios, which resulted in a 12 per cent and a 21 per cent reduction in the pressure loss relative to the case without flow control, respectively. The flow was further examined by means of LDV measurements.</p>
<p>CFD calculations were carried out for many different cases, concerning different parameters, like sensitivity to inlet turbulence and velocity profile, mesh independency study, effects of different turbulence models, and effect of the length of the flow control elements. Although most of the calculations were performed in 2D, the most important flow features and global parameters, like pressure loss and the optimum angle of the flaps, were captured well. The optimum angle was found to be at 12°, where the pressure loss reduction was 16 per cent.</p>
<p>The relationship between the length of the flaps and the pressure loss was found to be of hyperbolic nature, resulting in a more significant increase in the gain for short elements. However, an important and interesting characteristic, namely the relationship between the length of the flaps and the optimum angle, was not a subject of this article, but is planned to be examined in the future.</p>
