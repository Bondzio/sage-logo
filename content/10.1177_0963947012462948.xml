<p>Internally focalized passages in narrative often employ metaphors to capture the experiential states of the focalizing character. My investigation of these metaphors – ‘phenomenological metaphors’, as I call them – has two important precedents in the fields of narratology and literary stylistics: Dorrit Cohn’s (1978) treatment of ‘psycho-analogies’ and Semino and Swindlehurst’s (1996) approach to metaphor and ‘mind style’. After positioning phenomenological metaphors vis-à-vis these related concepts, I put forward the central claim of this article: metaphorical language plays a role in readers’ engagement with focalizing characters because it can sustain readers’ illusion of experiencing a storyworld <italic>through</italic> the consciousness of a fictional being. But what is it about metaphorical language that makes it especially suited to bring about this effect on readers? In order to answer this question, I use Ian McEwan’s novel <italic>Saturday</italic> (2005) as a case study, presenting two different lines of argument. First, I contend that metaphors reflect, at a linguistic level, the seamless integration of perception, emotion and language that characterizes our everyday transactions with the world. Second, I look at the relationship between understanding metaphorical language and readers’ empathy for characters, arguing that the continuity between these psychological processes is grounded in their perspectival nature: just as metaphors invite recipients to adopt a new perspective on a conceptual domain, engaging with a focalizing character encourages readers to ‘try on’ his or her experiential perspective and worldview. Taken together, these hypotheses provide an explanation for the effectiveness of phenomenological metaphors at conveying to readers the qualitative ‘feel’ of characters’ experiences.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>This article investigates the use and function of a special class of metaphors in print narratives and in particular in contexts of internal focalization. My label for this class is ‘phenomenological metaphors’ – that is, metaphors that are meant to convey the phenomenology of a character’s experience, or ‘what it is like’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963947012462948">Nagel, 1974</xref>) for him or her to experience the world in a certain fictional situation. Many internally focalized texts are rich in metaphorical language, and the central claim of this article is that metaphors are highly instrumental (together with other stylistic devices on which I will not concentrate here) in bringing about an effect on readers: they create the illusion that readers are given an almost unmediated access to the conscious experience of the focalizing character, thus experiencing the storyworld <italic>through</italic> his or her consciousness. The term ‘illusion’ contains a reference to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963947012462948">Wolf’s (2004)</xref> account of ‘aesthetic illusion’ as a cognitive effect produced by some narrative texts. In Wolf’s words, such effect consists in ‘experiencing a [fictional] world in a mainly sensory (visual) and emotional way as if it were a slice of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963947012462948">2004</xref>: 331). In my view, the sense of experiencing a storyworld through the consciousness of a character – therefore developing a feeling of ‘closeness’ to that character – is a kind of aesthetic illusion that is worth exploring more carefully. Empathy, as a form of perspective-taking, can be identified as the psychological mechanism behind this illusion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947012462948">Eder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947012462948">Gaut, 1999</xref>). In the context of this article, I would like to present a speculative hypothesis concerning the possible role of phenomenological metaphors in triggering empathetic responses, thereby creating readers’ sense of intimacy with fictional characters.</p>
<p>In Section 2 I will build on ideas growing out of the fields of narratology and literary stylistics – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947012462948">Cohn’s (1978)</xref> treatment of ‘psycho-analogies’ and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963947012462948">Semino and Swindlehurst’s (1996)</xref> article on metaphor and ‘mind style’ – in order to argue that the connection between metaphor and phenomenology runs deeper than it may appear at first. Metaphor’s effectiveness at rendering the conscious experience of characters depends not only on the skill of individual authors but also on the nature and workings of metaphor itself. After having shown (in Section 3) how phenomenological metaphors are positioned in the landscape of today’s metaphor studies, I will put forward two lines of argument for the link between phenomenological metaphors and the cognitive illusion that internally focalized texts can create.</p>
<p>The first argument, presented in Section 4, has to do with metaphor’s potential for blending together different experiential domains. Synaesthetic metaphors are a striking example of this integration, since they build bridges between sensory modalities that we normally think of as independent. Highlighting the continuity between these metaphors and synaesthesia (a neurological condition in which a sensory stimulus leads to involuntary stimulation in another sensory modality), cognitive psychologists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963947012462948">Marks (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947012462948">Cacciari (2008)</xref> have argued that both phenomena reveal the imbrication of linguistic thought and sensory experience. By leveraging this intuition, I will claim that metaphorical language is uniquely suited to render characters’ experiences because of the way it simulates the cross-modal integratedness of everyday experience, intertwining verbal form, imagistic thought and pre-verbal consciousness. The reader’s imagination has a key role in turning the linguistic texture of phenomenological metaphors into an experiential texture.</p>
<p>The second argument, which I will put forward in Section 5, centres on the idea that there is an internal correspondence between metaphor and the processes of readerly engagement with focalizing characters. As cross-domain mappings, metaphors enable us to gain insight into the target conceptual domain by comparing and integrating it with the source domain. This ‘perspective-changing’ function, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963947012462948">Steen’s (2008)</xref> term, has a close parallel in the perspectival nature of readers’ empathy for characters. Just as phenomenological metaphors integrate different concrete images into a dynamic mental simulation, which enables readers to imaginatively apprehend a character’s perceptual or emotional experience, relating to a character over a long stretch of text may lead the audience to temporarily ‘try on’ his or her worldview. In turn, this perspective-taking can leave a mark on readers’ own worldview. Such structural resemblance between the workings of metaphor and the feedback effect of narrative empathy could explain why phenomenological metaphors can trigger empathetic responses, thus fostering the illusion that readers are experiencing a storyworld through the consciousness of a character.</p>
<p>Throughout the article, the theoretical discussion will be accompanied by the analysis of passages from Ian McEwan’s novel <italic>Saturday</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963947012462948">2005</xref>) – a brilliant example of internally focalized narration, and one characterized by a high occurrence of phenomenological metaphors. <italic>Saturday</italic> tells of a day in the life of Henry Perowne, a neurosurgeon at a London hospital, following him closely from the moment when he wakes up well before dawn to the moment when he falls asleep, almost 24 hours later. The plot revolves around a minor car accident, which results in a physical confrontation between Henry and a street criminal, Baxter, while a few blocks away a large crowd of demonstrators protest against the war on Iraq. Later on in the day, Baxter – who suffers from a degenerative neurological disease – breaks into the surgeon’s house, holding him and his family at knifepoint. But it is Henry’s consciousness that has center stage in the novel: the events of the day are densely interwoven with the character’s sensations, memories and reflections on themes that range from post-9/11 world politics to the ‘hard problem’ of reconciling mind and matter (the brain, of which Henry is – in his words – an expert ‘plumber’). Because of its meshing a thematic focus on consciousness with the convincing rendering of the protagonist’s own consciousness (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963947012462948">Thrailkill, 2011</xref>), McEwan’s novel provides an ideal case study for my exploration of phenomenological metaphors.</p>
<p>Before moving on, some caveats are in order. First, ‘phenomenological metaphors’ should be taken here to include similes. The relationship between metaphor and simile has been a topic of much debate within cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963947012462948">Croft and Cruse, 2004</xref>: 211–215), and there are good reasons to believe that – despite conventional assumptions – at least <italic>some</italic> metaphors should not be understood as implicit similes at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947012462948">Glucksberg and Haught, 2006</xref>). However, as I will point out in Section 3, the metaphors I am interested in here – phenomenological metaphors – are likely to involve a comparison or, more precisely, a mapping between two conceptual domains. Therefore, these metaphors may be associated with similes, since they share the same basic cognitive mechanism – namely, cross-domain mapping.</p>
<p>Another caveat is that the kind of empathetic engagement with characters I will posit in the following pages should not be overextended (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963947012462948">Kieran, 2003</xref>): I will use the phrase ‘readers’ engagement with characters’ as shorthand for readers’ relations with experiencing characters in internally focalized passages, especially when these characters provide the main focus of consciousness for long stretches of text (as with the protagonist of <italic>Saturday</italic>). It is well-known that the focalization concept was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947012462948">Genette (1980 [1972]</xref>) to replace older concepts such as ‘narrative perspective’ and ‘point of view’, and that it is still hotly disputed within narratology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963947012462948">Niederhoff, 2010</xref>). The definition of internal focalization I will adopt throughout this article is as follows: a text is internally focalized when it implements stylistic and representational strategies that invite readers to construe the storyworld ‘as perceived and registered (recorded, represented, encoded, modeled and stored) by some mind … which is a member of this world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963947012462948">Margolin, 2009</xref>: 42). In short, internal focalization creates a tension between the audience’s imaginative access to the storyworld and the mental processes they attribute to a character on the basis of textual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947012462948">Caracciolo, 2012a</xref>). Sometimes this tension may lead to empathetic identification or perspective-taking. In an experimental study, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963947012462948">Barbara Tversky (1996)</xref> found that in internally focalized narration the audience tends to imagine the storyworld from the perceptual perspective of the focalizing character. I will argue that phenomenological metaphors have a key role in creating and modulating this empathetic involvement.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the question of the epistemological status of my claims. It is important to stress that my argument about phenomenological metaphors and reader-response is purely speculative. Since this may appear problematic in times in which the empirical study of literature is gaining ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947012462948">Bortolussi and Dixon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963947012462948">Miall, 2006</xref>), I would like to point out that speculation is important – indeed, essential – as a heuristic tool for formulating hypotheses that may be tested empirically. Although the hypothesis I will put forward in this article has no direct empirical support, it is at least consistent with a number of empirical findings about narrative empathy. Through a series of experiments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963947012462948">Hakemulder (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947012462948">Kuiken, Miall and Sikora (2004)</xref> have suggested that empathy for characters is the principal means whereby narrative impacts readers’ worldview and self-concept. Along these lines, in Section 5 I will draw a connection between the psychological effects of reading and the ‘perspective-changing’ function of metaphor.</p>
<p>Further, in a seminal article <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963947012462948">Miall and Kuiken (1994)</xref> argued that strategies of stylistic foregrounding – unusual or striking stylistic forms – tend to heighten the audience’s affective involvement. Phenomenological metaphors, of course, can be considered one of these strategies, and as such they are likely to trigger empathetic responses. Keen spells this out clearly when she writes that, ‘following Miall, unusual or striking representations in the literary text promote foregrounding and open the way to empathetic reading’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947012462948">2007</xref>: 87). However, Miall and Kuiken seem reluctant to draw this conclusion, probably because no empirical evidence exists on this issue – neither in general nor in connection to metaphorical language in particular. My article paves the way for experimental research by proposing two complementary explanations for the close link between readers’ illusion of closeness to characters (with its roots in narrative empathy) and phenomenological metaphors.</p>

<title>2 Precedents: From psycho-analogies to mind style</title>
<p>One of the earliest attempts at isolating and describing a stylistic strategy similar to what I call ‘phenomenological metaphors’ can be found in Cohn’s seminal <italic>Transparent Minds</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947012462948">1978</xref>). Cohn’s preferred term for this device, ‘psycho-analogy’, appears for the first time in the section of her book devoted to ‘psycho-narration’ – (the narrator’s analysis of a character’s psychological life, as opposed to the direct presentation of the character’s thoughts – Cohn’s ‘quoted monologue’) and to the hybridization of the narrator’s voice with that of the character in free indirect discourse (Cohn’s ‘narrated monologue’).</p>
<p>Generally, psycho-narration takes the form of a summary of a character’s mental states over a period of time. By contrast, psycho-analogies have a punctual nature; they are metaphors or similes – although Cohn seems to place a premium on the latter – embedded in psycho-narration in order to ‘describe a mental instant’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947012462948">1978</xref>: 37). This feature explains why psycho-analogies ‘digress from or impede the sequence of recounted events, slowing the pace by continually expanding the time of narration over the narrated time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947012462948">Cohn, 1978</xref>: 43). An example would be this simile from McEwan’s novel:<disp-quote>
<p>Patients would be less happy to know that [Henry is] not always listening to them. He’s a dreamer sometimes. Like a car-radio traffic alert, a shadowy mental narrative can break in, urgent and unbidden, even during a consultation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963947012462948">2005</xref>: 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The psycho-analogy ‘Like a car-radio traffic alert’ renders the sudden intrusion of one apparently random thought into the flow of the character’s consciousness. It directs readers’ attention to the <italic>way</italic> in which this particular mental event plays out, thus slowing down the pace of the psycho-narration – an idea consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963947012462948">Miall and Kuiken’s (1994)</xref> finding that stylistically marked language increases reading times. But there is another, related, aspect that Cohn highlights in her treatment of psycho-analogies. This device, she argues, is particularly suited to ‘reach a sub-verbal stratum in [a] character’s mind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947012462948">1978</xref>: 43): in McEwan’s passage, for example, the simile conveys the mysterious – and seemingly random – way in which one thought grafts itself onto another. While the character’s thought has a linguistic or quasi-linguistic form (it is a ‘narrative’), its sudden onset or ‘transitive part’ – in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947012462948">William James’s (1950</xref>: 243) phrase – is too subtle to be verbalized in a non-metaphorical way. Hence, the author makes use of a simile to capture the subjective quality of this mental instant.</p>
<p>Moreover, the source of the analogy remains unclear: is it Henry himself who comes up with this simile, or is it rather the narrator who is trying to reach towards the character’s pre-verbal consciousness? While in other phenomenological metaphors the wording seems to belong to the character, here the analogy exists in the no man’s land between the narrator’s voice and the character’s consciousness – and this, of course, strengthens the impression that we are penetrating into a layer of Henry’s experience that cuts below his verbal stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>With these remarks, we are broaching the question of how literature, and narrative literature in particular, conveys what philosophers of mind call ‘qualia’ – the ineffable, qualitative properties of an experience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963947012462948">Tye, 2009</xref>). Being bound up with our phenomenology, qualia have to do not only with <italic>what</italic> is experienced, but also with <italic>how</italic> we experience it. And we have just seen that metaphorical language is often responsible for expressing this phenomenological ‘how’. Indeed, David Lodge has suggested that metaphors and similes are ‘one of the primary means by which literature renders qualia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963947012462948">2002</xref>: 13). Taking my cue from Lodge, I will explore the connection between phenomenology and metaphorical language in the next section. Before that, however, I would like to touch briefly on another research tradition that is clearly relevant to this discussion – namely, cognitive stylistics.</p>
<p>Together with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947012462948">Black (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963947012462948">Semino and Swindlehurst (1996</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963947012462948">Semino, 2002</xref>) have been among the first to stress the importance of metaphor in the creation of a character’s mind style. The concept of ‘mind style’ comes, of course, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947012462948">Fowler’s (1977</xref>: 76) work, where it is defined as a set of linguistic forms and structures that bear a character’s unique cognitive signature, revealing his or her psychological traits, dispositions and worldview. Semino and Swindlehurst’s central claim is that ‘the systematic use of a particular metaphor (or metaphors) reflects an idiosyncratic cognitive habit, a personal way of making sense of and talking about the world: in other words, a particular mind style’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963947012462948">1996</xref>: 147). Along these lines, many of the metaphors scattered throughout <italic>Saturday</italic> are tinged by the protagonist’s medical expertise, referring to anatomical structures or medical procedures in a way that clearly reflects the character’s training as a neurosurgeon: ‘These diaphanous films of sleep are still slowing him down – he imagines them resembling the arachnoid, that gossamer covering of the brain through which he routinely cuts’ (2005: 57).</p>
<p>Unlike Cohn’s psycho-analogies, the metaphors discussed by Semino and Swindlehurst seem to appear at a higher level of consciousness, one fully mediated by a character’s linguistic habits and psychological dispositions – to the point that they can be taken as symptoms of his or her worldview. These metaphors originate in and belong to the character’s own thought activity: in the words just quoted, for example, it is Henry himself who imagines the ‘diaphanous films of sleep’ as ‘resembling the arachnoid’. We know, therefore, that the character has drawn the latter comparison. By contrast, it is uncertain whether the metaphor ‘diaphanous films of sleep’ results from the narrator’s verbalization of Henry’s phenomenological state or if it already manifests itself in verbal form to the character. All in all, whereas the simile ‘he imagines them resembling the arachnoid’ is a clear pointer to the character’s mind style, the metaphor would count as a psycho-analogy, in Cohn’s term. And this indicates another difference between these two lines of investigation: whereas Cohn sees psycho-analogies as instantaneous ‘snapshots’ of a character’s mental state, Semino and Swindlehurst are interested in the recurring metaphorical <italic>patterns</italic> that run through a particular text, playing a role in the psychological characterization of a fictional being.</p>
<p>I believe there are cogent reasons for trying to integrate these approaches: as a philosophical tradition that goes back at least to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947012462948">William James (1950</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963947012462948">Pred, 2005</xref>) has stressed, experience cannot be reduced to a series of single, self-contained mental events (captured by psycho-analogies); on the contrary, it dwells in the interplay and interaction between these events and our psychological dispositions and traits (reflected in a mind style). This is what my concept of ‘phenomenological metaphor’ attempts to do: it spans the continuum between small-scale perceptual and emotional experiences and the worldview against which these experiences project themselves (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947012462948">Figure 1</xref>). In what follows I will refer to this feature of phenomenological metaphors as their ‘linking function’. But I would also like to argue that phenomenological metaphors fall into another continuum: that between the character’s and the narrator’s voice. At one end of the scale, the metaphor emerges in the character’s own stream of consciousness as an explicit verbalization. Therefore, readers are asked to attribute the metaphorical language <italic>to</italic> the character, interpreting it as an indicator of his or her worldview. At the other end of the scale, the metaphor or simile can be taken as an attempt, on the part of the narrator, to capture the character’s pre-verbal experiences. While some phenomenological metaphors are clear-cut instances of these limiting cases (they are either a product of the character’s or of the narrator’s voice), others seem to hover between the two horizontal poles of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947012462948">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the next sections I will trace a path through this diagram by focusing first on the relationship between phenomenological metaphors and pre-conceptual experience (Sections 3 and 4), arguing that readers’ mental imagery plays an important role in simulating characters’ perceptual and emotional experiences. (Here and elsewhere in this article I include in ‘perception’ embodied sensations such as pain, proprioception and kinaesthesia for brevity’s sake.) In Section 5 I will then turn to higher-order forms of engagement with characters, proposing a hypothesis of how phenomenological metaphors can accompany readers’ mental simulations from the pre-conceptual (perceptual and emotional) level to more complex forms of narrative empathy in which the audience adopts a character’s epistemic and axiological perspective.</p>

<title>3 Phenomenological metaphors in the landscape of metaphor studies</title>
<p>In the wake of Lakoff and Johnson’s influential <italic>Metaphors We Live By</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963947012462948">1980</xref>), the last 30 years have seen a steady rise of metaphor studies in the fields of cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics. This wave of interest reflects a more general tendency to shift the emphasis from metaphor as a linguistic and stylistic phenomenon to metaphor as a conceptual mechanism that underlies a wide range of phenomena. In the words of Kövecses, linguistic metaphors ‘(i.e., ways of talking) make explicit, or are manifestations of, the conceptual metaphors (i.e., ways of thinking)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963947012462948">2010</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>It may be wondered how the phenomenological metaphors I examine in this article relate to these much-talked-about conceptual metaphors. As shown in the last section, what is remarkable about phenomenological metaphors is that they often gesture towards a dimension of a character’s experience that <italic>precedes</italic> conceptual and verbal thought. Consider the following lines from <italic>Saturday</italic>, which convey Henry’s perceptual experience:<disp-quote>
<p>Walking up three flights of stairs has revived him, his eyes are wide open in the dark; the exertion, his minimally raised blood pressure, is causing local excitement on his retina, so that ghostly swarms of purple and iridescent green are migrating across his view of a boundless steppe, then rolling in on themselves to become bolts of cloth, swathes of swagged velvet, drawing back like theatre curtains on new scenes, new thoughts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963947012462948">McEwan, 2005</xref>: 37)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Very few of the metaphors that appear in this passage (‘ghostly swarms of purple and iridescent green’, ‘a boundless steppe’, and so on) can be made sense of in terms of the standard metaphorical patterns cognitive linguists label ‘conceptual metaphors’. This, of course, does not deny that linguistic representations – and therefore semantic representations or concepts – are involved in the reader’s comprehension of these lines. But it does press the point that the figurative language of McEwan’s passage has a different function from common manifestations of conceptual metaphors such as <sc>LIFE IS A JOURNEY</sc>. Rather than conceiving an abstract domain – life – in terms of a more concrete ‘spatial story’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963947012462948">Turner, 1996</xref>) – a journey through space – these metaphors render a concrete perceptual experience by way of equally concrete images taken from other domains of experience (swarms of insects, a steppe, cloth, theatre curtains).</p>
<p>This accumulation of concrete images aligns the figurative language used in McEwan’s passage with what Lakoff and Turner have called ‘image metaphors’ – metaphors that work by linking ‘one rich image with one other rich image’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963947012462948">1989</xref>: 99). As hypothesized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947012462948">Gleason (2009)</xref> in an article on readers’ visualization of Imagist poetry, engaging with image metaphors relies on a simulative process: readers fuse the source and the target domains of the metaphor into a dynamic mental image of the represented events. This claim finds support in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947012462948">Gibbs and Matlock’s (2008)</xref> review of the empirical evidence for the role of simulation in decoding metaphors. Of course, it may be speculated that readers do not form these mental images from scratch: they draw on their own past experiences, real or imaginary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963947012462948">Seilman and Larsen, 1989</xref>). Psycholinguists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963947012462948">Zwaan (2008)</xref> call the memories implicated in linguistic comprehension ‘experiential traces’, suggesting that they serve as building blocks for readers’ mental simulations. Taken together, these experiential traces form a repertoire of past sensations, acts of perception, emotions, and socio-cultural beliefs and values, which readers bring to bear on narrative and on their engagement with characters in particular (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947012462948">Caracciolo, 2012b</xref>). Through the activation of this repertoire at the perceptual and emotional level, phenomenological metaphors thus allow readers to simulate a character’s pre-verbal experiences. The key difference between this phenomenon and more standard conceptual metaphors is that in the former case the ‘cross-domain mapping’ (i.e. comparison and integration between different domains) is not purely conceptual, since it has a significant experiential component, drawing on experiential traces and giving rise to more or less conscious mental imagery.</p>
<p>However, research in psycholinguistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947012462948">Glucksberg, 2008</xref>) has produced evidence that, despite the claims of cognitive linguists in Lakoff and Johnson’s tradition, many metaphors are processed not through cross-domain mapping but through category extension. For example, understanding the sentence ‘that lawyer is a shark’ does not require actively comparing lawyers and sharks, but only extending the category ‘sharks’ in order to include all the entities that are malicious, dangerous, and so on. This has led to a rift between the cognitive-linguistic and the psycholinguistic approach to metaphor, since the first tends to see metaphor as an implicit comparison (a truncated simile), whereas the second holds that most metaphors work by category extension. My account of phenomenological metaphors follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963947012462948">Steen’s (2008)</xref> conciliatory suggestion: linguistic metaphors can be processed either through cross-domain mapping or through category extension, depending on the context, the degree of conventionality and the linguistic form of the metaphor itself. In particular, for Steen the key factor is the ‘deliberateness’ of the metaphor: ‘Deliberate metaphors are those cross-domain mappings that involve the express use, in production and/or reception, of another domain as a source domain for re-viewing the target domain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963947012462948">2008</xref>: 223). Similes – <italic>qua</italic> explicit comparisons – are therefore more likely to be processed as cross-domain mappings than metaphors proper. Creative metaphors also rely heavily on cross-domain mapping, since their novelty prevents recipients from understanding them through simple category extension (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947012462948">Bowdle and Gentner, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Do phenomenological metaphors involve category extension or cross-domain mapping? The hypothesis I will work on in the following sections is that, although some phenomenological metaphors could be understood through category extension, most of them require their recipients to perform a full-fledged cross-domain mapping. This mapping is at the core of the mental simulations described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947012462948">Gleason (2009)</xref>: readers are invited to fuse, in and through their mental imagery, the experiential traces activated by the metaphorical language. The simile that closes McEwan’s passage (‘drawing back like theatre curtains’) is likely to work in this way, whereas expressions like ‘swarms of purple’ are more ambiguous and may also be processed through category extension (‘swarms’ may be taken to mean anything that moves quickly in mid-air). On the whole, however, the novelty of most phenomenological metaphors in literary narrative turns them into good candidates for cross-domain mapping. We will see in the next section that this mapping (or blending of different conceptual domains) mirrors the integratedness of experience itself.</p>

<title>4 Metaphor, synaesthesia and the integratedness of experience</title>
<p>Is there a reason why metaphors can be so effective at expressing a character’s phenomenology – i.e. what it is like for him or her to experience the world? To begin with, let’s have a look at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947012462948">Figure 1</xref>. As I argued earlier, phenomenological metaphors seem to hover between the narrator’s and the character’s voice: at one end of the scale, the narrator attempts to capture the character’s experience through a comparison that never occurs as such to the character; at the other end, the comparison is already part of the character’s experience in verbal form. To this we may now add that readers’ imagination is instrumental in ‘converting’ the linguistic texture of phenomenological metaphors into the experience that is attributed to the character. The tension between verbal form, readers’ mental imagery and characters’ experience is therefore at the root of phenomenological metaphors.</p>
<p>Indeed, what makes metaphorical language so special is the way it can simulate the close integration between pre-conceptual experience, imagination and language that is inherent in our everyday contacts with the world. In order to mount a persuasive case for this view we would have to address the philosophical issues concerning the relationship between language and imagistic thought (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963947012462948">Hutto, 2008</xref>: 65–100); in this context, however, I would like to use as a shortcut a passage from McEwan’s novel where these issues are explicitly thematized. Again, it is uncertain whether these thoughts cross the character’s mind while he drives his car or whether they should be read as narratorial commentary:<disp-quote>
<p>The assertions and the questions don’t spell themselves out. He experiences them more as a mental shrug followed by an interrogative pulse. This is the pre-verbal language that linguists call mentalese. Hardly a language, more a matrix of shifting patterns, consolidating and compressing meaning in fractions of a second, and blending it inseparably with its distinctive emotional hue, which itself is rather like a colour. A sickly yellow. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963947012462948">2005</xref>: 81)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One thing that any cognitive scientist or philosopher of mind would note here is that the narrator’s (or the character’s) understanding of ‘mentalese’ is actually very liberal. While it is true that the term ‘mentalese’ was coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947012462948">Fodor (1976)</xref> as a nickname for the language of thought, Fodor’s view is radically different from the one outlined in this passage. In fact, Fodor conceives the language of thought as abstract, symbolic and fully disembodied (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963947012462948">Sterelny, 1999</xref>), whereas McEwan’s lines seem to go in the opposite direction: the character experiences his own stream of consciousness as ‘a mental shrug followed by an interrogative pulse’ – where both images, of course, hint at a dimension of our experience that is concrete, pre-verbal and embodied. Even more interestingly, this dimension is rendered through metaphorical language, in a way that highlights the complex interplay between linguistic and imagistic thought: the ‘assertions’ and ‘questions’ that are spelled out on the pages of McEwan’s novel immediately before this passage are here conveyed to the reader through an alternative – metaphorical – route, which is presented as a more accurate approximation of what the character feels as he steers his car into a fateful collision with Baxter’s.</p>
<p>The second part of the quotation offers an even more useful hint as to what makes metaphorical language well suited to express a character’s phenomenology. The hint comes in the form of a cross-domain mapping between the qualitative ‘feel’ of emotion and a perceptual experience (colour). First of all, we read that the embodied patterns that inform the character’s thoughts are tinged by an ‘emotional hue’ – which is in itself a metaphor, albeit of a conventional kind. As discussed earlier, conventional metaphors are often processed by category extension (here, for example, ‘hue’ may be taken as loose talk for ‘quality’). But in case the cross-domain mapping between affect and colour went unnoticed, the text redraws the comparison in a more explicit fashion: ‘which itself is rather like a colour. A sickly yellow’. This association has a synaesthetic aspect, in that it establishes a correlation between the phenomenology of emotion and the visual experience of colour; more standard cases of synaesthetic metaphor create a link between different sensory modalities – for instance, vision and hearing in ‘loud shirt’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947012462948">Day, 1996</xref>). We find another example of synaesthetic mapping in the following passage – where Henry receives a punch on the chest from Baxter:<disp-quote>
<p>The blow that’s aimed at Perowne’s heart and that he dodges only fractionally lands on his sternum with colossal force, so that it seems to him, and perhaps it really is the case, that there surges throughout his body a sharp ridge, a shock wave, of high blood pressure, a concussive thrill that carries with it not so much pain as an electric jolt of stupefaction and a brief deathly chill that has a visual component of blinding, snowy whiteness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963947012462948">McEwan, 2005</xref>: 92)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this case the sensation of pain is blended with proprioception (‘there surges throughout his body a sharp ridge, a shock wave, of high blood pressure’), with the perception of temperature (‘a brief deathly chill’), and again with visual perception (‘a visual component of blinding, snowy whiteness’). What can this synaesthetic strategy teach us about metaphor across the board? In the medical sense, ‘synaesthesia’ refers to a neurological condition in which stimulation in one sensory modality automatically leads to anomalous stimulation in a second sensory modality: in typical scenarios, subjects report a visual experience of colour upon hearing sounds (usually phonemes) or looking at letters and numbers. The secondary stimulation is therefore associated with <italic>linguistic</italic> or otherwise symbolic prompts, and is experienced as a mental image. The most common explanation for this phenomenon is neurophysiological: synaesthesia is thought to be caused by anomalous cross-wirings between brain areas, or by ‘leaks’ between neural pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963947012462948">Marks, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963947012462948">Ramachandran and Hubbard, 2001</xref>). Pursuing this line of thinking, scholars have hypothesized that synaesthesia as a neurological condition and synaesthetic metaphor may be intimately bound up: in different ways, they would both reveal that – despite conventional conceptual boundaries between sensory modalities – our experience is an integrated whole where language, sensory stimulation and imagistic thought converge and blend with one another. In Cacciari’s words, ‘metaphorical language is pervaded by cross-modality references that mirror, at a linguistic level, our neural architecture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947012462948">2008</xref>: 436).</p>
<p>By my lights, the last two passages from McEwan’s novel throw into sharp relief this integratedness of embodied experience, perception, emotion and language. In the first quotation, Henry’s linguistically mediated thoughts – perceived as embodied happenings – are said to be permeated by emotion, which in turn is seen through a visual lens. In the second quotation, the physical sensation of pain triggers associations with proprioception, vision and temperature. Needless to say, metaphor is the only linguistic device that can accurately capture the interpenetration between all these modes of engagement with the world: <italic>qua</italic> cross-domain mapping, metaphor can build bridges between them by blurring conceptual boundaries and blending conceptual domains (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947012462948">Fauconnier and Turner, 2002</xref>). This could explain why McEwan’s novel – and indeed any text that attempts to convey a character’s experience from the inside – is rich in phenomenological metaphors. Because of the tension between linguistic form, imagistic thought and experience that is built into phenomenological metaphors, relating to a character through metaphorical language gives recipients a strong sense that they are undergoing a cross-modal imaginative experience that is close to what the character’s own ‘qualia’ would be like (if he or she were a real being). To put the same point otherwise: phenomenological metaphors foster readers’ illusion that they can share the experience of a fictional character in its raw, unmediated form because they effectively integrate embodied, emotional and linguistically mediated kinds of engagement. In this way, metaphorical language can simulate the seamless flow of everyday experience.</p>

<title>5 ‘Perspective changing’ in readers’ engagement with characters</title>
<p>So far I have hypothesized that readers’ concrete mental imagery plays a role in understanding phenomenological metaphors, inviting them to simulate characters’ pre-conceptual experiences. But since, as discussed in the previous section, experience is an integrated whole, we may wonder how phenomenological metaphors can draw in their wake characters’ beliefs and value systems – and what forms of reader-response they prompt at this level. Here we may fall back on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963947012462948">Steen’s (2008)</xref> three-dimensional model of metaphor, and in particular on his third, communicative function of metaphor, which he labels ‘perspective changing’ or simply ‘changing’. This function, Steen argues, consists in changing ‘the addressee’s perspective on the referent or topic that is the target of the metaphor, by making the addressee look at it from a different conceptual domain or space, which functions as a conceptual source’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963947012462948">2008</xref>: 222). In other words: putting a conceptual domain (the target of the metaphor) into contact with another domain (the source) allows us to see the target in a new light. Consider the following lines from the ending of <italic>Saturday</italic>, where the protagonist thinks back to the events of the past day, including his encounter with Baxter:<disp-quote>
<p>It may be the thought of him [Baxter] that makes Henry feel shaky, or the physical effort of tiredness – he has to put his hand on the sill to steady himself. He feels himself turning on a giant wheel, like the Eye on the south bank of the Thames, just about to arrive at the highest point – he’s poised on a hinge of perception, before the drop, and he can see ahead calmly. Or it’s the eastward turn of the earth he imagines, delivering him towards the dawn at a stately one thousand miles an hour. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963947012462948">McEwan, 2005</xref>: 272–273)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage is rich in phenomenological metaphors, which are intertwined with the character’s own sensations – and imaginings – in an especially complex way. Henry’s exhaustion produces an illusory sensation of motion, which in turn gives rise to the simile: he is turning ‘like the Eye’, with a reference to a London landmark, the giant Ferris wheel on the south bank of the Thames. The comparison involves a cross-domain mapping where the character’s physical sensation is cast into a new light by the highly symbolic – and culturally loaded – image of the wheel, which seems to hint at the passage of time. The second part of the quotation further develops the simile – Henry is at the highest point of the Ferris wheel, where he seems to be calmly enjoying the view – before throwing in a variation: the Ferris wheel is now the Earth, thrusting the character forward into a new day. This elaborate description conveys the character’s state of mind at the end of an extremely long and taxing day, expressing his quiet confidence in front of forces that seem to tower above any human being’s efforts. As the readers of <italic>Saturday</italic> will know, the forces epitomized here by the Earth’s movement are both natural (Henry Perowne is a materialist and a firm believer in natural evolution) and historical, since throughout the day he has been obsessed with the global politics of the post-9/11 world. These thematic meanings are bound up with Henry’s embodied experience, revealing metaphor’s potential for providing a new perspective on the target domain – in this case, the character’s physical sensation – in a condensed and highly integrated form.</p>
<p>In this way, phenomenological metaphors guide readers’ understanding of the character’s state of mind by projecting his current mood against the background of the day through which we, as readers, have accompanied him – and against an indeterminate future. These considerations bring us back to the linking function of phenomenological metaphors – their establishing a connection between a character’s present mental state and his or her background of experiences and values (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947012462948">Figure 1</xref>). Just as metaphorical language can invite readers to imagine the pre-verbal experience of characters (through the mental imagery described in Section 3), it may prime the audience to engage with characters’ experiences at a higher level by adopting their epistemological and axiological perspective on the world. Indeed, there seems to be a close parallel between metaphor as a perspective-changing device (in Steen’s term) and the larger empathetic processes that underlie readers’ relationships with focalizing characters.</p>
<p>Philosophers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947012462948">Feagin (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963947012462948">Currie (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947012462948">Coplan (2004)</xref> have carefully explored the empathetic processes that lead story recipients to adopt, if only partially and temporarily, the perspectives of fictional beings. In particular, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947012462948">Gaut (1999)</xref>, I would like to draw a distinction between four levels of a character’s perspective that readers may simulate: perceptual (the character’s bodily sensations and acts of perception), emotional (his or her emotional responses to situations), axiological (the character’s values and motives), and epistemic (what he or she believes about the world). I have hypothesized in Section 3 that readers understand phenomenological metaphors by building a dynamic mental image, which provides the basis for their attributing a qualitative experience (a phenomenology) to a character. I have also suggested that these mental simulations allow readers to engage with the perceptual and emotional dimensions of a character’s experience.</p>
<p>But in other cases the audience may be invited to adopt a character’s perspective at a higher level. In Currie’s words, narrative fictions can be said to exploit our general tendency to ‘“try on” the views, values, and general outlook of others, to imitate, in a playful way, other perspectives on the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963947012462948">1997</xref>: 73). In relating to McEwan’s protagonist as they follow him through the day, for example, readers are confronted with an epistemic and axiological perspective that they attribute to a fictional being while getting the chance of imaginatively ‘trying it on’. In turn, this empathetic perspective-taking can produce shifts and changes in the reader’s worldview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963947012462948">Hakemulder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947012462948">Kuiken et al., 2004</xref>). The simulations involved in this process differ from the mental images evoked by phenomenological metaphors, since they occur at a fully cognitive and conceptually mediated level: they are directed at a character’s worldview and value system rather than at his or her pre-conceptual – perceptual and emotional – experiences. At the same time, both activities are inherently perspectival and rely on a simulative mechanism.</p>
<p>It is in this sense that readers’ engagement with focalizing characters dovetails with – and builds on – what phenomenological metaphors accomplish on a much smaller scale. Because of their perspective-changing potential, metaphors are a miniature dramatization of the process whereby we come to see our own worldview from a new perspective – that of a fictional character. By fusing together different concrete images (as in McEwan’s passage, which blends Henry’s physical sensation with the movement of the Ferris wheel, and then of the Earth), phenomenological metaphors can give rise to novel perceptual and emotional experiences – the characters’ – which are imaginatively apprehended and simulated by readers. But just as in the McEwan passage metaphorical language can ‘draw in’ the character’s materialist worldview, adopting the protagonist’s pre-verbal perspective through phenomenological metaphors paves the way for simulating his experience at an epistemic and axiological level – which, in turn, can invite readers to see in a different light their own beliefs and values.</p>
<p>The intuition here is that there is a continuity between simulating characters’ low-level experience via phenomenological metaphors and adopting their epistemic and axiological perspective on the storyworld: because of their linking function (discussed in Section 2), metaphors can encourage the audience to move along the continuum set up in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947012462948">Figure 1</xref> by trying on characters’ beliefs and value system. In my view, this phenomenon has its roots in the structural parallel between metaphor’s perspective-changing potential and the feedback effect on readers’ worldview of their empathetic relations with characters. Thus, phenomenological metaphors could be implicated in the illusion of ‘closeness’ to characters that engaging with narrative can create in the audience.</p>

<sec id="section6-0963947012462948" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>6 Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, I have explored the role of metaphorical language in readers’ imaginative engagement with characters in internally focalized narration. My central claim has been that a special class of metaphors – phenomenological metaphors, I have called them – can create and maintain readers’ illusions of experiencing the storyworld through the consciousness of a character. I have offered two arguments in support of this claim. The first turns on metaphor’s capacity for establishing links between linguistically distinct experiential domains – a capacity clearly illustrated by synaesthetic metaphors and mirrored, at a neurological level, by the condition known as ‘synaesthesia’. The key idea here is that metaphor is uniquely suited to translate into verbal form the experiential texture of our contacts with the world, since these contacts are inherently cross-modal (i.e. they integrate different sensory modalities) and involve a complex interplay between low-level experience and linguistically mediated thought. All in all, the integratedness of metaphor seems to reflect the integratedness of experience itself, and this correspondence could explain why phenomenological metaphors can give recipients a strong sense of ‘closeness’ to the conscious experience of a character.</p>
<p>Second, I have highlighted the similarity between the internal workings of metaphor as cross-domain mapping and the empathetic connection that readers can develop with characters: there is a correspondence between metaphor’s perspective-changing function and the psychological mechanisms that enable readers to ‘try on’ the worldview of characters, thereby getting the chance to revise their own worldview in a more or less self-conscious way. On my hypothesis, it is because of the perspective shift brought about by metaphorical language that the use of phenomenological metaphors can encourage recipients to adopt, however partially and temporarily, the axiological and epistemic perspective of a fictional being.</p>
<p>These claims are admittedly speculative, but they could provide both a theoretical framework and some working hypotheses to be tested out in future empirical research on the topic. If the effects of phenomenological metaphors on readers’ responses to characters were found to be consistent across readers, we would obtain an important piece of evidence regarding the link between metaphorical language and phenomenology – with potential implications for the theory of metaphor even outside of literary studies. At the same time, we would gain valuable insight into how stylistic devices can guide a recipient’s engagement with fictional beings. This would be a particularly welcome contribution to the field, since – although empathy for characters has been under the lens of philosophical and narratological scrutiny for some years – we still lack a clear picture of how specific textual strategies can influence this kind of reader response (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947012462948">Keen, 2007</xref>: 92–99). Finally, pursuing the line of investigation opened by this article would enable scholars to bring into sharper focus the illusion of direct access to a character’s consciousness produced by internally focalized texts. To what extent can this access be equated with our everyday interaction with other people’s minds? The question has been raised recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963947012462948">Herman (2011)</xref>, who has argued against any downright exceptionality of readers’ access to fictional minds. Empirically examining the role of phenomenological metaphors in triggering readers’ empathetic responses to characters promises to extend our understanding of the continuity between fictional and real minds.</p>
