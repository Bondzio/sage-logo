<p>The European Employment Strategy (EES) and Open Method of Co-ordination (OMC) in social policy (social inclusion, pensions, healthcare and care for the elderly) were developed to support welfare reform through multi-lateral exchange among Member State bureaucrats and stakeholders, facilitated by the EU level. These social OMCs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0958928711433629">1</xref></sup> were seen as a promising alternative – or step towards legislation – in areas where Community competences were weak, but where policy challenges were comparable in the wake of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) that constrains manoeuvre in fiscal policy. For each area where the OMC is applied, the policy cycle is iterative, though its frequency varies. First, policy objectives (in some cases accompanied by quantitative benchmarks) are proposed by the European Commission. Then, Member State representatives, first in Council formations and then at the yearly meetings of the Spring European Council, decide upon which objectives the Member States will pursue. Next, efforts to meet the objectives agreed for any given OMC process are reported by Member States, after which they are reviewed by peer Member States and by the EU level (Commission-Council) with assessments of performance, but no hard recommendations in the case of non-compliance.</p>
<p>From its inception, there has been much ado about the OMC. It has attracted the interest of academics, in particular political scientists and sociologists, who have analysed policy learning in the OMC, and lawyers, who have characterised the OMC as a new form of soft law. Most economists, meanwhile, have been very critical, judging the OMC tools too soft to address structural changes in labour markets and welfare state systems. What can we learn from the multitude of publications written on this topic? This article takes stock of the intellectual progress that has been made in the study of the social OMCs but does not aspire to be exhaustive. It analyses the literature from three theoretical perspectives: European integration, new modes of governance and Europeanisation. The first highlights the process of decision-making and institutional change of the OMC, while the second analyses the features of the OMC, comparing it with other forms of regulation and governance in the EU. The third perspective on Europeanisation focuses on how the OMC impacts welfare reform via policy learning. For each perspective, the review presents how the OMC has been approached theoretically and analytically and what the empirical findings are. In conclusion, we suggest how to take the analysis of the OMC forward.</p>
<sec id="section1-0958928711433629">
<title>European integration</title>
<p>Theories of European integration are relevant for understanding the development of the OMC, given the role of Member States and European institutions in this process. The intergovernmentalist explanation focuses on the power of Member States at crucial decision-making moments (on the basis of short-term political priorities), while the neo-functionalist explanation concentrates on the role of the European institutional actors, in particular the European Commission (on the basis of medium and long-term priorities, defined incrementally in sectoral directorate generals). Both have partial explanatory power and are therefore often combined by scholars who study the OMC.</p>
<p>The early literature focused on the importance of the intergovernmental conference leading to the Amsterdam Treaty, in which the EES was codified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928711433629">Goetschy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0958928711433629">Pochet, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0958928711433629">Szyszcak, 2000</xref>), and of the Lisbon Summit where the OMC was created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928711433629">de la Porte et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0958928711433629">Trubek and Mosher, 2003</xref>). Once institutionalised, alterations to the social OMCs in 2005 were instigated by intergovernmental initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928711433629">Armstrong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928711433629">de la Porte, 2011</xref>). This literature is relevant for the analysis of the emergence and evolution of OMC processes, as it focuses on agency, but as highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0958928711433629">Radaelli (2003)</xref>, it is also necessary to take account of the political and malleable nature of the OMC, rendering analyses on its development more complex. Indeed, political initiatives by actors within decision-making circles play an important role in the iterative re-definition of the OMC. The ‘advocacy coalition’ approach can usefully complement the intergovernmentalist approach, as it highlights the way in which actors sharing a normative aim are involved in lobbying for (political) objectives in the development of the OMC. Contrary to intergovernmentalism, it emphasises interest-based coalitions within which individual policy entrepreneurs, devising a political project, and policy-brokers, securing support for that project, play a crucial role. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0958928711433629">Van Riel and van der Meer (2002)</xref>, for example, have argued that in the aftermath of Maastricht, one advocacy coalition emerged among the social democrats in the European Parliament, the Commission and various Member States, and another among the conservatives, led by the British government. They argue that the former coalition, involving both governmental and non-governmental actors, managed for the first time to include employment as an issue on the agenda of the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) of 1996. Regarding the OMC in social policy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0958928711433629">Schäfer (2004)</xref> argues that the social-democratic governments in the Council mobilised support across the EU institutional spectrum in order to obtain support for the Lisbon Strategy and in particular its social dimension. In addition, experts – not belonging to EU institutions – have also contributed to the process through the development of knowledge and ideas about labour market and social policy reform, such as ‘flexicurity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0958928711433629">Wilthagen, 1998</xref>), ‘active ageing’ and a ‘lifecycle’ approach to labour market participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928711433629">Esping-Andersen, 2002</xref>) and combating child poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928711433629">Atkinson et al., 2004</xref>). These and other ideas proposed by experts – on the basis of requests for analytical knowledge by the rotating Presidencies to the Council or by the European Commission – have to some extent been adopted as objectives in the social OMCs. The role of experts in the development of the OMC is crucial, and can be captured within the advocacy coalition approach, which considers partisan interests, as discussed above, but also new ideas to support particular reform paths. This suggests that advocacy coalitions, emphasising political coalitions, interests and ideas through the role of various actors, can be combined with intergovernmentalism, which explains the central role of Member States in decision-making about the OMC.</p>
<p>However, another actor also needs to be considered theoretically: the European Commission. In the vein of neo-functionalism, the literature on the European level development of the OMC emphasises the role played by the European Commission in initiating institutional features of OMCs and in developing core ideas in the period of emergence of the OMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928711433629">de la Porte, 2011</xref>). The coordination model developed for the EES (and then for the OMC) was proposed by the European Commission on the basis of the coordination process for EMU, consisting of guidelines, benchmarks, national reporting, peer review and multi-lateral surveillance. In these OMCs, pivotal roles were played by the issue-specific advisory committees (Employment Committee for the EES and Social Protection Committee for the Social OMCs), which are akin to the EMU’s Economic and Financial Committee (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928711433629">de la Porte and Pochet, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928711433629">Goetschy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0958928711433629">Hodson and Maher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0958928711433629">Trubek and Mosher, 2003</xref>). In addition to playing a central role in the development of the institutional features of OMCs, the Commission played an ideational role by developing the first core objectives for the social OMCs. For example, concerning the policy objectives in the area of employment, the ideational role of the European Commission was considerable in framing the EU solution to employment policy in the years preceding the Amsterdam Treaty. Core policy aims of the EES have been traced back to the 1993 White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment and to the activities within the Commission in the run-up to the Amsterdam Treaty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928711433629">de la Porte, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928711433629">Goetschy, 1999</xref>). Similarly, in the social protection area, the framing of challenges and objectives has been traced back to ideas developed in a series of Commission communications from the mid-1990s (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928711433629">de la Porte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928711433629">Ferrera et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928711433629">Greer and Vanhercke, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This body of literature on decision-making and institutional change of the OMC captures the EU level dynamics by focusing on the key actors involved in the definition and re-definition of the OMCs. However, the OMC is but one instrument used in the Lisbon Strategy, that aims to promote growth, jobs and cohesion in the EU. In addition, the OMCs and the Lisbon Strategy in which they are embedded are moving targets: their governance structures and policy objectives were profoundly altered in 2005 and once again in 2010. In 2005, the EES became integrated with economic policy coordination in the form of ‘integrated guidelines’, with the hope of enhancing its salience in Member States. There were also changes to the other OMCs: prior to 2006, the social inclusion, healthcare and pensions OMCs had been autonomous, with independent reporting cycles and procedures, while after 2006, these three processes were merged together. In 2010, ‘Europe 2020’ replaced the Lisbon Strategy, affecting coordination processes as well as policy objectives. Within this new arrangement, there are ten guidelines, five core benchmarks and seven flagship initiatives, replacing the 20 ‘integrated guidelines’ that structured the Lisbon Strategy between 2005 and 2010. In employment policy there are now two guidelines, and in social exclusion there is one guideline. There is also a new guideline on education. As for poverty issues, these will be addressed through a ‘platform’, rather than through the OMC, although the implications are still unclear. Concerning pensions, the OMC process is now fully controlled by the economic policy actors (i.e. DG Ecfin and the Ecofin Council), which focus exclusively on the financial stability of pension systems. The fate of the healthcare OMCs remains uncertain at the time of writing this review. Parallel to modification of policy coordination processes, the EU social agenda has shifted towards retrenchment policies, including pay restraint, wage indexation, wage coordination and fundamental welfare reforms (pensions, healthcare), as well as labour market flexibility. The Stability and Growth Pact has been revised and its policy cycle has been re-organised around a ‘European semester’ in order to enhance its effectiveness. In addition, a ‘Euro-plus pact’ has been adopted by the Eurozone Member States and other countries on a voluntary basis, although its function is still indistinct.</p>
<p>The implication of these developments is that researchers need to distinguish between the EU’s overall ‘governance architecture’ re-defined at the annual Spring Summit, the institutional forms and instruments (such as the OMC) which are used in specific policy areas, the actors involved (and which role they play), as well as the alterations in policy objectives and benchmarks. Any analysis of policy co-ordination needs to take account of the fact that it is a shifting object in terms of governance structure and political objectives. The role of experts and the Commission in shaping ideas, policies and institutional instruments in policy co-ordination processes needs to be considered, as does the role of member states, individually and in the Council. Analysis of policy co-ordination should theoretically and analytically consider political initiatives, based on short-term (partisan) interests of Member States, as well as the role of ideas, which are shaped over the medium and long-term by experts and within the European Commission.</p>

<title>The OMC as a New Mode of Governance</title>
<p>In a second strand of the literature, the OMC has been identified and analysed as a New Mode of Governance (NMG) or ‘soft law’, with different forms of input and output legitimacy compared with the other modes of regulation and governance in the EU. There has been a political and academic interest in this NMG due to increasing policy interdependency among member states in the wake of EMU, together with more diversity in an EU of 27 Member States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928711433629">de la Porte et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0958928711433629">Scharpf, 2002</xref>). Legal scholars, who have contributed considerably to this debate, contrast the features of the OMC with those of other modes of regulation, while political scientists have singled out policy coordination as a specific mode of governance in the EU, parallel to other governance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0958928711433629">Wallace, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In an influential article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0958928711433629">Scott and Trubek (2002)</xref> associate a range of normative features with NMG: a broad range of actors are expected to be involved, thus developing a new form of input legitimacy. This input legitimacy is, in turn expected to enhance effectiveness, or output legitimacy, a normative expectation that is also at the heart of deliberative democracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0958928711433629">2</xref></sup> In the literature on the OMC as a NMG, authors highlight that its objectives are revisable, and that it is voluntary and non-justiciable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0958928711433629">Hatzopoulos, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0958928711433629">Mosher and Trubek, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the literature on the OMC has emphasised the dichotomy between old and new modes of governance, soft and hard law, law and non-law, which is rooted deeply in legal scholarship on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0958928711433629">Scott and Trubek, 2002</xref>). Recent contributions, however, suggest that such a binary distinction does not account for variations in policy development, implementation, assessment and justiciability of various instruments, such as regulations, directives, framework directives and, last but not least, policy coordination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928711433629">Armstrong and Kilpatrick (2007)</xref> note that these constructions ‘undersell and under-explain’ changes that are occurring in the functions and definitions of laws and governance. On the issue of justiciability and the EES, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0958928711433629">Smismans (2011)</xref> shows that it has – infrequently – been mentioned in the Opinions of the General Advocate, but that the issues raised with reference to the EES disappear in the final judgments. With regard to the OMC in areas that have an even weaker Treaty base, it is probably totally absent from the legal system, even in the Opinions of the General Advocate. This suggests that for the issue of justiciability, the distinction between soft and hard law remains a valid distinction, while for policy development, implementation and assessment, the boundaries between hard and soft are, indeed, more blurred. Some legal scholars now focus more on the combination and ambiguities of instruments – ‘instrument hybridity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0958928711433629">Hervey and Vanhercke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0958928711433629">Trubek and Trubek, 2007</xref>) – in areas such as gender equality and social dialogue, where there is also soft EU legislation. This literature suggests that soft law can be most effective in the shadow of hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0958928711433629">Heritier and Lehmkuhl, 2008</xref>). In cases where the Court does refer to soft law documents, it is because they are linked to binding provisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0958928711433629">Smismans, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>For political scientists, ‘policy coordination’ – the OMC – has been identified as a fifth mode of policy-making in the EU, parallel to the traditional Community method, regulatory policy-making, distributional policy and intensive transgovernmentalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0958928711433629">Wallace, 2010</xref>). The predominant focus has been on the extent of ‘learning capabilities’ in the operation of policy coordination – that is, the features that embody ‘mechanisms for learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0958928711433629">Trubek and Mosher, 2003</xref>). As we shall see, learning is believed to be the most effective operational mechanism of the OMC in Member States. While the OMC label is no longer used in the EU’s newest medium-term political project, Europe 2020, policy coordination remains a central component for policy-making in economic, employment, social and other policy areas. As discussed above, analysis of policy coordination should take account of the fact that the forms of governance and policies used in conjunction with socioeconomic development of the EU change over time. For example, policy coordination could now be analysed in conjunction with other instruments, such as ‘platforms’ or ‘flagship initiatives’ that have been introduced via the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0958928711433629">Trubek and Mosher (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928711433629">Hartlapp (2009)</xref> assess the EES’s theoretical learning potential, but without analysing this learning potential empirically. The former infer learning potential from the features of the EES, emphasising that it brings together governmental and non-governmental actors to address common challenges, a combination that is in turn expected to facilitate deliberation and problem-solving through socialisation. In investigating the potential of the various features of the OMC to lead to learning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928711433629">Hartlapp (2009)</xref> identifies a triptych of learning from the political science literature: reflexive learning through one’s own experience, learning from others and learning with others. For Trubek and Mosher, the overall objectives (reinforced through quantitative benchmarks) of an OMC represent a powerful learning instrument, insofar as they are expected to destabilise prior understandings of issues and thus lead to incremental changes via an ideational shift in framing policy problems. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928711433629">Hartlapp (2009)</xref>, on the other hand, the guidelines and recommendations are ‘unrealistic and uniform’, and embody a weak potential for learning. While the guidelines are uniform (at one moment in time), the recommendations are tailored to individual challenges faced by each country, which Hartlapp fails to point out. These two contributions reflect a divide in the literature on the OMC, between those that see potential in the OMC for policy learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0958928711433629">Trubek and Mosher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0958928711433629">Zeitlin, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0958928711433629">2009</xref>) and those who claim that this potential is weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928711433629">Hartlapp, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0958928711433629">Kröger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0958928711433629">Lodge, 2007</xref>). We shall see in the section on Europeanisation below that the divergent normative expectations are reduced considerably in analysing the integration of the OMC in national contexts.</p>

<title>Europeanisation via the OMC: policy learning</title>
<p>Most analyses on the national influence of the OMC use conceptual frameworks derived from the literature on institutionalisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0958928711433629">Hall and Taylor, 1996</xref>) and Europeanisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928711433629">Börzel and Risse, 2003</xref>) in order to theorise, analyse and interpret the impact of issue-specific OMCs. Researchers have been interested particularly in the extent to which the OMC has led to policy learning in specific empirical instances. How and under which circumstances does policy learning through the OMC take place? This is a central question in the broader literature on the role of ideas in reform decisions, for which the study of the OMC – as an ideational vehicle – provides considerable insight. There has also been interest in the impact of the OMC on the development of ‘institutional capabilities’, which will not be discussed here due to space limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0958928711433629">3</xref></sup> In the following, we discuss the literature on policy learning via the OMC in order to underline the main analytical contributions of the literature, the empirical findings and the missing gaps, and in particular, the weak causal linkage between policy learning via the OMC and policy change. We will also discuss how to methodologically advance the analysis of learning and policy change via the OMC.</p>
<p>Since the OMC is a soft mode of governance, promoting specific policies but with no mechanism of coercion, it lends itself best to analysis of ideational influence. Learning about new ideas or policy models is clearly the most prominent operational mechanism of the OMC, and the most studied aspect of the OMC. It has been informed by the theoretical features of the OMC itself, as well as by political science literature on policy learning (see discussion above). For analytical purposes, we distinguish here between learning from the EU level (in particular via the objectives, the indicators and benchmarks, as well as the ‘soft’ recommendations) and learning from peers (in the fora of the OMC, especially the committees and groups gathering civil servants and experts) that has been coined ‘maieutic learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928711433629">Ferrera and Sacchi, 2005</xref>). In these cases, learning from the OMC is direct and can be identified through careful process-tracing. In other instances, it can be indirect, where learning about ideas from the social OMC occurs in conjunction with funding made available through the European Social Fund, but where causal attribution of learning to the OMC is more difficult. In the process of identifying learning via the OMC, it is also crucial to identify which actors learn and for which purposes. The OMC process involves a limited number of actors: civil servants are central since they participate in EU level meetings and fora and non-governmental stakeholders can use the OMC for learning about experiences which relate to their activity.</p>
<p>Research on the OMC has been advanced not only in analysing who learns what from which aspect of the OMC, but also in identifying the mechanisms of change associated with the OMC. One key mechanism through which ideas can be transferred is socialisation, which is direct, but not always intentional, since it involves exposure to new information about an issue (problem and/or solution) in a forum associated with the social OMC (the social protection committee, peer review programme, specialised indicators group) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0958928711433629">Horvath, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0958928711433629">Jacobsson and Vifell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0958928711433629">Lopez-Santana, 2009</xref>). A second mechanism is reflexivity, which is learning about one’s own policies and institutions – strengths but also weaknesses – on the basis of information produced in or deliberated within the OMC process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0958928711433629">Zeitlin, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0958928711433629">2009</xref>). A third mechanism is the broader diffusion of an idea, which builds on the assumption that OMC ideas reach multiple outlets. Diffusion can take place among and between civil servants, parliamentarians, stakeholder organisations and experts, as well as in the media. These are but the main mechanisms of ideational change associated with the OMC, and they are not mutually exclusive. The OMC can also be used in other ways: as ‘leverage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928711433629">Ehrel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0958928711433629">Hamel and Vanhercke, 2009</xref>), whereby an actor intentionally uses the OMC as political opportunity structure. When used instrumentally, the OMC agenda can be adopted fully or partially, or it can be ignored. The mechanisms of change associated with the OMC and the strategic use of the OMC do not necessarily lead to policy change. In order for the OMC to lead to policy change, it is necessary for policy ideas and new knowledge associated with specific frames (of problems and solutions) to be transformed into initiatives and strategies. This necessarily involves some degree of ‘re-interpretation’, that is adapting to political preferences and institutional legacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928711433629">Barbier, 2008</xref>). It is the causal linkage between the OMC ideas and policy change on which there has been and still is most controversy in the literature. This is because of the difficulty of singling out the OMC as the main reason for theoretically expected change, and due to the difficulty of analysing the transformation of ideas. In other words, the controversy arises from the difficulty of measuring the ideational impact of the OMC in the process of policy change, for which there are rarely clear and measurable indicators in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928711433629">de la Porte, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0958928711433629">Weishaupt, 2010</xref>). The OMC objectives – while altering over time – are built on a combination of policy features common to the liberal and Nordic welfare state models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928711433629">Büchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0958928711433629">Jacobsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0958928711433629">Kvist, 2007</xref>). This suggests, on the basis of the fit/misfit hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928711433629">Börzel and Risse, 2003</xref>) that there would be more scope for change in countries from other welfare state regimes. In the following section, we present the main findings of the literature, including a discussion of some of the contradictory findings. The results are presented according to (five) different types of welfare state configurations: universal, liberal, conservative, Mediterranean and Post-socialist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928711433629">Aidukaite, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928711433629">Esping-Andersen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928711433629">Ferrera, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>For the Nordic countries, researchers concur that the main effect of the social OMCs has been reflexive learning, that is, learning about the strengths of their own universal welfare state model, and in the case of Denmark, its own ‘flexicurity’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0958928711433629">Kvist, 2007</xref>). However, governments and politicians have not actively used the social OMCs to reflect upon weaknesses arising from the ongoing reform of the universal model, particularly gender segregation on the labour market and discrimination against immigrants in Sweden and Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0958928711433629">Jacobsson, 2005</xref>), as well as emerging problems of poverty and exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928711433629">de la Porte and Al-Gailany, 2011</xref>). By contrast, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have used the OMC to frame problems and solutions (through socialisation and reflexivity) related to poverty. Furthermore, NGOs benefit from the peer review programme that has not only led to new ideas, but also to new initiatives, such as the development of a homelessness strategy in Denmark. Trade unions, on the other hand, did not gain from the policy ideas of the EES, as they already have strong channels through which to impact labour market policy. Concerning other major policy changes in the Scandinavian countries – in particular, participation of immigrants on the labour market or reform the pension system to extend working lives – these were initiated due to domestic reforms, where the OMC was one (rather weak) factor among others through which these policy solutions were proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928711433629">de la Porte and Al-Gailany, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0958928711433629">Jacobsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0958928711433629">Jacobsson and Johansson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0958928711433629">Jacobsson and Schmid, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0958928711433629">Lopez-Santana, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0958928711433629">Saari and Kangas, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>For liberal countries, the social OMCs have had more potential to contribute to policy reform, since they have high labour market participation, but a workfarist approach to enhancing labour market participation, a high proportion of low-skilled workers and intergenerational transmission of poverty. The OMC in social exclusion has been used for conceptualising and debating child poverty among governmental actors and NGOs, because this was in line with national priorities. However, when issues – such as up-skilling – were not framed according to the domestic agenda, the OMC was largely ignored by governments. In the UK and even more in Ireland, civil society has used the OMC and its policy agenda as leverage, to gain support for combating poverty, exclusion, workfarism and child poverty. This has led to some dialogue between government and non-state actors, but not to many new initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0958928711433629">Armstrong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928711433629">Büchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928711433629">Büchs and Friedrich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0958928711433629">Kröger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0958928711433629">Mailand, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0958928711433629">O’Donnell and Moss, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0958928711433629">van Gerven, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0958928711433629">Van Gerven and Beckers, 2009</xref>). The research on the social OMCs and liberal countries is consensual: governmental actors re-interpret OMC objectives in line with domestic priorities, rather than reflexively learning about weaknesses in domestic policy solutions, while social partners and NGOs engage in learning from the EU level, through socialisation and then use this for reflexive learning, pointing to the weaknesses in these countries.</p>
<p>The learning potential of OMC ideas in conservative welfare states is considerable. Concerning the influence of the EES in Germany, one set of researchers conclude that the influence on policy change in labour market and social exclusion policy is minimal, an effect that is captured by the concept ‘surface integration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928711433629">Büchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928711433629">Büchs and Friedrich, 2005</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928711433629">Büchs (2007)</xref>, the landmark Hartz reforms were driven by domestic concerns, and were barely informed by ideas associated with the OMC. By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0958928711433629">Preunkert and Zirra (2009)</xref> consider that the EES guidelines were and important lever for the initiation of the Hartz reforms. They conclude that there was a strong and direct effect of the EES ideas on labour market reform in Germany, where it had a decisive role in shaping policies, thus leading to ‘paradigmatic change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0958928711433629">Preunkert and Zirra, 2009</xref>: 194). The interpretation of the actual impact of OMC ideas on the process of policy change in Germany differs considerably, due in part to heavy reliance on interviews. Differences in interpretation beg for a counter-factual reflection: would the reforms have been undertaken without the existence of the OMC? Researchers need to specify who carried and OMC idea forward (as well as when and alongside which other ideas) and how it was transformed from an EU level idea to domestic policy. That is often the missing link. A constructivist analysis of transformation of a policy, where the OMC is contextualised, may be a promising way forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0958928711433629">Radulova, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>For the welfare state countries of the Mediterranean rim, as for the countries of continental Europe, the EES and the OMC in social policy addresses key challenges. These countries traditionally have low rates of labour market participation of women and older workers, few and underdeveloped care structures, as well as many low-skilled workers. Most of the literature highlights that concepts associated with social OMCs have been diffused widely. Ideationally, activation, female labour market participation, life-long up-skilling, flexicurity and social inclusion were novel ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928711433629">Adao e Silva, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928711433629">Ferrera and Sacchi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0958928711433629">Mailand, 2009</xref>). For the Spanish case, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0958928711433629">Mailand (2009</xref>: 163) argues that the ‘the preventive approach would not have been introduced without the existence of and pressure from the EES,’ while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0958928711433629">Lopez-Santana (2009)</xref> argues that ideas about activation were already present in national thinking due to the European Social Fund (ESF). Ideas about activation have been diffused broadly via both the ESF and the EES. Concerning the use of the OMC on the basis of short-term priorities, empirical analyses in Italy and Spain show that the EES has been used as a political opportunity structure. But, it was for a neo-liberal reform agenda, in order to enhance the development of precarious contracts and to increase flexibility on the labour market, rather than for developing a more comprehensive flexicurity reform agenda. Furthermore, availability of affordable and high quality childcare institutions, highlighted through the OMC process, remains a problem in the southern European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928711433629">Ferrera and Sacchi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0958928711433629">Lopez-Santana, 2009</xref>). Thus, ideas developed within the EES and OMC have been used selectively and have been re-interpreted entirely, in line with political priorities. This points to the importance of scrutinising how ideas developed with the social OMCs have been transformed.</p>
<p>The social OMCs have had a major potential for being used constructively in the new member states. They have framed problems, such as inadequacies of education systems, an issue addressed in recommendations to most Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928711433629">de la Porte and Jacobsson, 2011</xref>). The national reports of the CEE prepared in the context of the OMCs reveal that there is an awareness of these and other issues. On the surface, the EES and OMC’s ideas, such as flexicurity and lifelong learning, resonate with key reform responses developed in the CEE in recent years. However, a closer analysis reveals that the terms are used broadly, but without the intended connotation. Flexicurity has most often been interpreted as deregulation by governmental actors and politicians in these countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928711433629">de la Porte and Jacobsson, 2011</xref>), apart from some exceptional cases such as Slovenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0958928711433629">Lajh and Silaj, 2010</xref>). Social partners are weak, while civil society actors are even weaker, neither having benefited from the potential of the OMC as leverage. In fact, even if these actors are opposed to some government reforms as stated in the national reports to the EU, they rarely have enough leverage to make themselves heard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928711433629">de la Porte and Jacobsson, 2011</xref>). Overall, there has been no real desire by governments to engage in reflexive learning about weakness in these countries, particularly because, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0958928711433629">Orenstein (2008)</xref>, many of the CEE aim to ‘out-liberalise’ the EU-15, which involves welfare state retrenchment rather than a more balanced approach to reform, which is behind the social OMCs.</p>
<p>The OMC’s main effect across welfare states has been socialisation for governmental actors, but ironically, they are the ones that are least willing to use it to reflect upon how to alter problem and/or solution framing in the process of ongoing welfare state reform. Governmental actors (re)-interpret EU concepts, exemplified, for example, by policies associated with flexicurity. This does not mean the OMC has no ideational impact, but that governmental actors use it to learn from the EU or from peer countries only when it coincides with the national political agenda. Using information produced within the OMC for reflexive learning is strongest for non-state actors, particularly large NGOs linked to an EU umbrella organisation. They seek to use OMC concepts to bargain preferences vis-a-vis their respective governments, although the OMC is not always powerful enough to be effective as leverage, particularly in the new member states. Social partners have been less interested in the OMC, as they have other channels for impacting policy development and implementation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928711433629">Barbier (2008)</xref> suggests that the genuine learning potential of the OMC is weak because terms introduced through the OMC are ambiguous. This means that the scope for interpretation according to national political, cultural and legal frames of reference is considerable. The national interpretation of the OMC merits more attention in the literature.</p>
<p>All rigorous research on the ‘power of ideas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928711433629">Béland, 2010</xref>) should collect and use data from various types of data sources, rather than relying too heavily and uncritically on interviews, for this has sometimes led to opposing interpretations of the facts. Since only a handful of people are involved with the EES and the OMCs, their assessment of the role of the OMC in the process of policy change can have a significant impact on the researcher’s interpretation of data. A civil servant working with the OMC may claim – and may even believe – that the OMC has had a considerable impact on policy reform, even if its actual role was minimal. Conversely, civil servants may minimise the role of the OMC on new ideas and policy change, even if it did contribute to ideational agenda-setting or new reform initiatives. It may be useful to move towards working with ‘data-points’ that represent different types of primary sources of data, such as interviews, but also participation in meetings and observation of discussions, which has only been used minimally in OMC research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928711433629">Brandsten et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, data and discourse analysis software could support analysis about the impact of OMC ideas. Furthermore, the OMC should be considered for what it is: one (soft) mechanism through which ideas about policy reforms and solutions could be introduced. One of the main challenges for the research on the OMC is to distinguish its influence from that of other factors, such as domestic reforms or the role of (other) international organisations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which also provides expert advice on issues addressed by the EES and the OMC in social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928711433629">Casey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928711433629">de la Porte, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0958928711433629">Duina and Nedergaard, 2010</xref>). In federal countries, the dynamics are even more complex, particularly in areas where federal entities have shared power with the national level, such as labour market and social policy. It is necessary, then, to carefully account for the possible influence of different actors, levels of governance and instruments, in domestic policy reform processes. This would contribute to contextualise the OMC as one of the many channels through which ideas can be introduced or policy changes channelled.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This review has examined the intellectual progress in the analysis of the OMC, in order to determine whether it is still worthy of academic study, and if so, how. The analyses of the European level development of the OMC have provided nuanced knowledge about how and under which circumstances different actors play a role in its development. As has been done in the past, analysis of policy co-ordination should theoretically and analytically consider the political nature of the OMC, which we know is determined by short-term (partisan) interests of Member States but also by ideational actions, which are shaped over the medium and long-term by (external) experts and within the European Commission. It is crucial, in addition, to take account of the continuity and changes in the EU’s socioeconomic agenda, now coined Europe 2020, in which OMCs are embedded. Policy coordination is a fundamental mode of EU policy-making that does provide member states with ideas about reform solutions in the process of labour market and welfare state re-structuring. Analysts should on the one hand consider economic pressure for welfare state reform from the EU, in particular from DG Ecfin and the Ecofin Council (using the Stability and Growth Pact, now re-packaged cyclically around a ‘European semester’), but also from the OECD’s economics department, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and other domestic or international financial actors, such as credit-rating agencies. On the other hand, analysts should consider the social pressure for welfare state reform pushed by DG Employment and the Employment and Social Affairs Council (through some employment policy guidelines, the left-overs of the social OMCs and the newly established poverty platform) as well as by the OECD’s directorate for employment, labour and social affairs and other international and domestic socially oriented actors. It may not be the institutional affiliation of actors that is important to consider, but rather their reform agendas and their power (conditionalities, money, political bite, consequences of non-compliance, etc.). With regard to the OMC analysed by legal scholars as an NMG, it should be pursued if an OMC objective mirrors an objective in another legal instrument, whereby it can have influence in the shadow of hierarchy. Its impact in the legal sphere has otherwise been negligible and that is not likely to change.</p>
<p>Concerning Europeanisation via the OMC, based on policy learning, the literature has shown that knowledge achieved through the OMC directly or indirectly is used selectively and politically by actors, and what is more, it is interpreted according to domestic institutional frames of reference and political priorities. This suggests that the fit/misfit presumption of potential OMC impact is too simplistic, which echoes findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928711433629">Falkner et al. (2005)</xref> about the impact of social policy framework directives in Member States. While research on the national influence of OMC has increasingly become specialised, scrutinising the mechanisms through which the OMC can have an influence, it sometimes omits the bigger picture, in particular the broader economic context and political developments. It is crucial to consider a reform process comprehensively, in which the OMC is but one soft and highly politicised mechanism through which ideas about policy reforms and solutions could be introduced. Research on the OMC at national level should include analysis of pressures for reform not only from the domestic level, but also from the EU and international levels, as discussed above. The cumulative influence of different actors and instruments on core decisions should be considered, because it would provide a more complete account of any reform process. Furthermore, we know from the research on the OMC that it has never been the single cause of policy reform towards activation or combating child poverty, to name but two of the social OMCs core aims. It has always been one factor among others in a given reform process, hence the understandable difficulty for researchers to attribute the weight of the OMC in policy change. The interesting aspect of reform processes is to obtain a full picture of which actors are involved and with which instruments, and not to designate precisely how important the OMC has been.</p>
<p>While the interest in the OMC has led to a particular strand of Europeanisation scholarship, sometimes setting aside the broader political and economic context, comparative welfare state researchers focus on national reform processes, and they barely, if at all, consider the effect of the OMC. By considering policy coordination broadly within the process of domestic reform, the scholarship on Europeanisation and comparative welfare state reform should come closer together and not move further apart. In other words, it is necessary to shift from much ado about very little to take full account of the context in which reform solutions are discussed, devised and implemented. Researchers interested in reform processes from a domestic or a European perspective should have similar objects of study – how can a particular reform be understood, what are the ideas and interests behind it and how did it come about – and comparable analytical frameworks, even if they are still likely to differ slightly in what they concentrate on.</p>

<p>The social OMCs include all OMCs applied to the labour market and social policy area: the EES, the OMC in social inclusion, the OMC in pensions and the OMC in healthcare and care for the elderly. Note that since 2005, the EES has been linked more closely with economic policy coordination and that the remaining social OMCs have been joined in a single ‘social protection OMC’. In 2010, there were yet another series of alterations to these OMCs, in terms of governance structure as well as policy objectives, which will be discussed throughout the article.</p></fn>

<p>Normative theories of deliberative democracy emphasising open-ended deliberation, were associated with the OMC when it was nascent. This scholarship claims that the legitimacy and effectiveness of the OMC would be enhanced if relevant stakeholders were involved at all stages of the OMC process, from decision-making through to implementation and assessment. A crucial aspect of the modus operandis of these theories is that they are based on preference molding of participants, through open deliberation and learning about the best way to confront challenges. This distinguishes deliberative democracy from classical theories of democracy, which are based on preference aggregation of citizens, via political parties and political institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0958928711433629">Jacobsson and Vifell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0958928711433629">Zeitlin, 2005</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Institutional capability refers to the development of policy through careful planning – rather than ad hoc initiatives – and with regular evaluations and assessments. In a sense, it refers to the professionalisation of policy development, with regular assessments, and adaptation to policy in the view of lessons learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928711433629">Ferrera and Sacchi, 2005</xref>). In the literature the OMC is seen as a vehicle for the development of institutional capability, through the process of benchmarking, national reporting, peer review and assessment. The empirical evidence suggests that in some countries the OMC has contributed to more planning and evaluation in policy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928711433629">Adao e Silva, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928711433629">Ferrera and Sacchi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0958928711433629">Hamel and Vanhercke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0958928711433629">Jacobsson and West, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0958928711433629">Mailand, 2009</xref>).</p></fn>
