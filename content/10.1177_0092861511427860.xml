   <body>
      <p>It is always a pleasure to read a book that is well written, such as this second edition of Barton Cobert’s comprehensive and readable work on pharmacovigilance. Its relaxed and enthusiastic tone makes the reader feel that there is a conversation taking place with a friendly professor during a college course on drug safety.</p>
      <p>A second edition was needed because of the many changes in drug safety that have occurred since publication of the first edition in 2007. Certainly, the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act in September 2007 was one of these factors.</p>
      <p>However, society itself also had changed, including the development of new electronic technology that has affected adverse event reporting. This book addresses these, including, for instance, the fact that there is a standardized form for spontaneous reporting of adverse events available as an “App” for the iPhone and other smartphones to facilitate reporting by patients, physicians, and others.</p>
      <p>The past 2 decades have led to increasing harmonization of safety reporting and safety databases throughout the world, but nuanced differences in requirements and definitions still exist in different regions. This book carefully but clearly identifies those differences and then observes in an amused tone that we haven’t even harmonized the spelling of “harmonization” yet throughout the English-speaking world (spelled with a “z” in the United States and with an “s” in the United Kingdom).</p>
      <p>This is a very good book for anyone who wants to learn about pharmacovigilance, including regulatory affairs professionals who are in the early or middle stages of their careers. It is comprehensive but covers too much elementary material for those with advanced regulatory experience. The author suggests in the introduction that experienced regulatory professionals would find the book and accompanying compact disk useful as reference tools, and that is probably a valid suggestion.</p>
      <p>A few inaccuracies should have been detected by a good editor. For instance, the book says that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “put forth the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act” (page 52), whereas clearly Congress is the only group that can enact federal laws in the United States, whereas the FDA expands and clarifies the law through regulations and guidance documents. In another place, the FDA Amendments Act is incorrectly called “the 2007 PDUFA/FDAAA legislation,” and the US laws for regulating drugs for pediatric patients are incorrectly described as being 2 parts of the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), instead of 1 part PREA and 1 part the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) (page 56).</p>
      <p>The book’s coverage is broad, with chapters on definitions of different types of adverse events, regulations, and other directives related to pharmacovigilance, mathematical models of pharmacovigilance, pharmacovigilance for special patient groups, coding adverse events, types of reporting, types of available databases, and so on. The details of US, European Union, Canadian, and, to some extent, other countries’ adverse event reporting and pharmacovigilance are well covered. Unusual but interesting chapters include those on ethical issues of pharmacovigilance, on the pharmacovigilance of “natural health products,” and on the sharing of safety data between collaborating business partners.</p>
      <p>This book is enjoyable to read, and its broad coverage makes it useful for anyone learning about pharmacovigilance. It would also be a good reference work for advanced regulatory specialists.</p>
