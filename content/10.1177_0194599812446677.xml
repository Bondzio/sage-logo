<p>Anatomy of the floor of mouth and tongue base can be readily depicted with ultrasonography.

<body>
<p>The current accepted practice for obtaining tissue diagnosis of tongue base tumors is transoral biopsy performed under general anesthesia in the operating room. Despite being standard of care, operative transoral biopsy is not without its disadvantages, including subjecting the patient to the risks of general anesthesia, incurring additional cost, and delaying tissue diagnosis beyond the date of initial evaluation.</p>
<p>Ultrasound is an imaging technology that is nontoxic to the patient, is low cost, and provides real-time feedback to the sonographer. Use of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has increased significantly over the past decade for various pathologies of the head and neck, including thyroid nodules, salivary gland masses, and enlarged lymph nodes of undetermined origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812446677">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812446677">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>We sought to determine if it is possible to perform ultrasound-guided transcervical FNA of base-of-tongue tumors. Such a procedure can potentially be done in the clinic setting, which would reduce costs of going to the operating room, reduce the risks encountered with general anesthesia, and diminish the delay to diagnosis and treatment. This cadaver study was designed to describe floor-of-mouth and tongue base anatomy as seen on ultrasound, as well as assess the feasibility of using ultrasound to visualize needle placement and dye injection within the base of tongue, serving as a surrogate for FNA.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812446677" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We analyzed 37 human cadaveric specimens donated to the University of Tennessee Health Science Center for the express purpose of medical research and instruction. Cadavers were fixed in a solution of 75.68% isopropanol, 18.92% dipropylene glycol, and 5.4% formalin. Exempt status was obtained from the University of Tennessee Health Science Center Institutional Review Board under Federal Regulations 45CFR46.102(f) definition of “Human Subjects.” These cadavers were used by first-year medical students for an anatomy dissection course. Our intervention was performed a few days prior to beginning dissection of the head and neck region.</p>
<p>The sex and age (if known) of each cadaver specimen were recorded. Measurements of the neck circumference of each specimen were taken from the base of the occiput to the hyoid bone. A General Electric Medical Systems LogiQe (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin) diagnostic ultrasound machine fitted with a 7.5- to 13-MHz linear array transducer was used to scan each specimen in a transverse plane from the level of the hyoid bone to the mentum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812446677"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Visualization of the mylohyoid, geniohyoid, genioglossus, and intrinsic muscles of the tongue base was confirmed. In total, 0.1 mL of 0.25% methylene blue was placed in a syringe attached to a 1½-inch 23-gauge needle preloaded with normal saline, which was used to avoid tracking any dye through the specimen. The needle was placed in the midline neck, halfway between the hyoid bone and the mentum. Ultrasound was used to guide needle placement and dye injection into either the right or left base of tongue, which was predetermined with the first half of specimens receiving an injection into the right base of tongue and the second half receiving an injection into the left base of tongue. All injections were performed by 2 of the authors (R.K.M. and M.E.S.), who analyzed each specimen together with ultrasound just prior to injection.</p>

</fig>
<p>Cadaver heads, including the tongue, were bisected in the midline by medical students during their normal course of dissection. Cadavers were inspected to determine the accuracy of dye injection. A positive result was considered to be dye that was located within the genioglossus muscle and/or the intrinsic tongue muscles between the circumvallate papillae and the epiglottis with the majority of the dye on the correctly predetermined right or left side. Two authors (R.K.M. and M.E.S.) subjectively determined if the dye was accurately placed.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Thirty-seven cadavers were available for study. Five cadavers, one of which had a segmental mandibulectomy with a reconstruction bar in place, were felt to have poorly defined anatomy on ultrasound and were neither injected nor analyzed. Thirteen cadavers (40.6%) were male and 19 (59.4%) were female. The mean age at time of death was 74.5 years (range, 51-97 years). Neck circumference had a mean of 38.0 cm (range, 30-48 cm). Tongue and floor-of-mouth musculature was identified on ultrasound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812446677"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Needle placement with notable bloom on injection was well visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812446677"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ultrasound as an imaging modality is attractive for a variety of reasons. It is low cost, provides real-time feedback to the clinician, and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. Its use within the head and neck region has become increasingly popular. Ultrasound of the thyroid and parathyroid glands is now a mainstay in diagnostic workup and management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812446677">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812446677"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812446677">3</xref></sup> Ultrasound-guided FNA is well accepted to gain tissue diagnoses of salivary gland, thyroid, and cervical lymph node pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812446677">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the tongue base (UGFNATB) is not currently an established practice to gain tissue diagnosis of the base of tongue, although tumors in this region can be visualized with ultrasound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599812446677"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). This begs the question of whether these tumors may be biopsied with UGFNATB. This cadaver study indicates that accurate placement of the needle within the posterior base of tongue is possible. Our success rate for dye localization in the base of tongue was 78%.</p>
<fig id="fig5-0194599812446677" position="float">

<p>One limitation of using fixed cadaveric specimens is stiffness of the soft tissues, which makes positioning the specimen with neck extension somewhat difficult. A flexible neck and pliable soft tissues in the living patient might yield higher rates of localization success, but this has not been studied. Five of the 37 cadavers were excluded from this study because they were felt to have distorted anatomy on initial ultrasound evaluation. The unrecognized anatomy may have been caused by inadequate neck extension compounded by the probe not fitting between a tucked chin and the anterior neck. One other nuance of using ultrasound in cadaver specimens is the inability to use color Doppler to identify flow through blood vessels. Not many studies have examined the difference of ultrasound between the living and cadaveric specimens. One study in the anesthesia literature analyzed ultrasound-guided cervical nerve blocks in both fresh and embalmed cadavers and found that visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, scalene muscles, and thyroid gland was similar in both groups but determined that needle visualization was slightly better in the embalmed group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812446677">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>We had hypothesized that increased neck thickness might be an impediment toward accurate placement of dye within the tongue base due to the increased amount of soft tissue between the skin and the target site. However, accuracy of dye injection was not found to be dependent on neck thickness (<italic>P</italic> = .75). Despite our results, however, we believe that in some patients with increased anterior neck thickness and small base-of-tongue tumors located near the mucosal surface, a longer needle, such as a spinal needle, would be helpful for reaching the tumor.</p>
<p>In this study, we used a midline (rather than lateral) transcervical approach through the skin and then aimed the needle toward the right or left side of the tongue base. The rationale for using a midline approach during UGFNATB is to avoid damage to critical neurovascular structures. The hypoglossal and lingual nerves as well as the lingual artery should lie lateral to the trajectory of the needle.</p>
<p>Future application of UGFNATB in the clinical setting may have some limitations. Patients may not tolerate the pain of UGFNATB while awake. In addition, biopsy of a tongue base lesion could prove challenging given the fact that the tongue is a dynamic mobile muscle. As of yet, there are no studies indicating whether UGFNATB can be performed in the living patient with accuracy or with pain tolerance.</p>
<p>We anticipate that some clinicians would hesitate to perform UGFNATB in lieu of triple endoscopy (direct laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy), which has been considered the “gold standard” for years but is not without controversy. Davidson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812446677">5</xref></sup> in 2000 reviewed 25 studies over the previous 25 years and found that the average rate of synchronous upper aerodigestive tract tumors was 4% with a range of 1.5% to 18%, and after analyzing their own series of 224 patients with only 2.6% having synchronous upper aerodigestive tract malignancies, they concluded that triple endoscopy was not indicated in diagnosing second primary tumors. Data available in the literature suggest that the yield of bronchoscopy over chest X-ray is &lt;1%, and the yield of esophagoscopy over barium swallow is &lt;2%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812446677">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812446677"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812446677"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812446677"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812446677"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812446677">11</xref></sup> Routine use of chest computed tomography (CT) to rule out metastatic spread to the lungs would seem to make routine triple endoscopy even less meaningful in the workup of second primaries. Although UGFNATB could potentially replace operative endoscopy for the purpose of obtaining tissue biopsy, some surgeons might schedule an operative endoscopy for the purpose of defining the extent of a given tumor, something UGFNATB cannot assess.</p>
<p>Use of UGFNATB in the clinic setting in place of transoral biopsy in the operating room may reduce the delay to pathological diagnosis and treatment. Delay has been measured from the time of onset of symptoms to the time of diagnosis. Yu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812446677">12</xref></sup> looked at 1 large retrospective study and 1 large prospective study of oral cavity tumors and noted that median time of symptom onset to evaluation by a medical professional was 4.5 weeks, median time from evaluation of a medical professional to time of tissue diagnosis was 11.8 weeks, and total time from symptom onset to tissue diagnosis had a median time of 22.5 weeks. UGFNATB could conceivably shave 2 to 3 weeks off of the delay to diagnosis. An additional potential advantage of UGFNATB is cost savings, although we do not attempt here to perform a cost-benefit analysis between the 2 techniques.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates a potential novel application of ultrasound, which has had expanded use within the head and neck area over the past decade as new studies have described. In an Italian study in 2007, Ansarin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812446677">13</xref></sup> demonstrated the use of ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of 10 patients with bulky laryngopharyngeal masses. They approached the tumor through either the thyrohyoid membrane or the cricothyroid membrane and achieved diagnosis in 9 of 10 patients. Recently, Lopchinsky et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812446677">14</xref></sup> described a case report of using ultrasound to guide a transthyrohyoid membrane FNA of a supraglottic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>Although our study is encouraging that UGFNATB may have a useful clinical application, there are as yet no trials confirming its feasibility in the living patient. Additional study needs to be carried out in a clinical setting to compare the diagnostic yield of UGFNATB with traditional transoral biopsy for tongue base tumors.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This cadaver study indicates that anatomy of the floor of mouth and tongue base can be readily depicted with ultrasonography. After reasonable success of injecting dye into the tongue base in this cadaver feasibility study, there appears to be a future clinical application of ultrasound-guided FNA of the tongue base for tongue base lesions.</p>
