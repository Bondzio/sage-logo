<abstract>
<p>Both undergraduate and graduate nursing students are expected to write numerous papers in their educational programs; however, most of these papers are never published. Many students and faculty lack the skills needed to convert a course assignment paper to a publishable manuscript. The purpose of this article is to describe 10 steps that can transform a course assignment paper into a publishable manuscript. These steps include outlining, clarifying the topic, clearly stating the purpose, identifying an appropriate audience, revising with faculty’s feedback, querying journal editors, revising to conform to journal’s author guidelines, requesting and responding to peer feedback, and finally editing and proofreading prior to submitting the manuscript. Faculty members are encouraged to make writing assignments that students can then convert to publishable manuscripts. Such publications form an essential cornerstone of professional holistic nursing.</p>

<p>Writing for publication is an explicit mandate for nurse educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112453328">Wills &amp; Kaiser, 2002</xref>). Perhaps it should also be expected of nursing students. Nursing students are required to write numerous papers to meet the requirements for undergraduate and graduate degrees. Many of these papers may be worthy of publication, but few of them are ever read by anyone other than the faculty member who assigned the paper (<italic>N</italic> = 1). Many nursing students aspire to be published authors, but few of them have the courage and skills needed to convert an assigned paper to a publishable manuscript. Frequently, faculty members assign papers that are not easily converted to publications, but some faculty also lack the skills needed to assist students in revising and rewriting such papers. The purpose of this article is to describe 10 steps that can be followed to transform a holistic nursing course assignment paper into a publishable manuscript.</p>
<sec id="section1-0898010112453328">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Professional nurses at all levels need to be able to express novel and complex ideas in writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112453328">Bickes &amp; Schim, 2010</xref>). Such ideas are essential for building a knowledge base for a professional discipline. Ideas that are written and shared through publications can also save others valuable time in “reinventing the wheel” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112453328">Cleary &amp; Walter, 2004</xref>, p. 206). Publications add to the knowledge base, which is essential to maintain the professional status of the discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112453328">Bennett, 2010</xref>). A published concept analysis, for example, of a new phenomenon in nursing helps nurses understand the phenomenon in terms of its uses, defining attributes, antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112453328">Walker &amp; Avant, 2010</xref>). Such papers demonstrate the evolving vocabulary of the discipline. A concept analysis paper is not reserved just for academics but may be written by any nurse or nursing student when there is a need to add to the conceptual base of the discipline.</p>
<p>Other course assignments that may be converted to publishable manuscripts include case studies, philosophical essays, systematic literature reviews, and pilot study outcomes. Each of these types of papers has the potential to add something of value to the profession. Nursing literature that is grounded in reality and clearly conveyed can change and improve nursing practice. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112453328">Hegyvary (2005)</xref> stated in her editorial in the <italic>Journal of Nursing Scholarship</italic>, “Choose something worth saying, and say it well” (p. 193).</p>
<p>Nursing faculty and students alike may experience barriers to writing for publication. Although nurses in academic settings are all too familiar with the adage to “publish or perish,” nurses in clinical practice work in a culture that often does not endorse this philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112453328">Heyman &amp; Cronin, 2005</xref>). Nurses in clinical practice, for example, cite their lack of time and skills as barriers to publication, thus giving writing for publication a low priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112453328">Cleary &amp; Walter, 2004</xref>). Nursing faculty bemoan their perception that “students today don’t know how to write” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112453328">Heinrich, Neese, Rogers, &amp; Facente, 2004</xref>). In response, many colleges and schools of nursing have introduced writing intensive courses to provide students more experience in writing scholarly papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112453328">Bickes &amp; Schim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112453328">McMillan &amp; Raines, 2010</xref>). Despite this response, many publishable course assignments are never revised and submitted as manuscripts. This results in wasted time and efforts on the parts of student and faculty and impedes further development of the discipline’s knowledge base.</p>

<title>Converting the Course Assignment</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010112453328">Table 1</xref> is a comparison of the characteristics of a course assignment paper with a scholarly, publishable paper. Course assignments vary in length and complexity and so do published papers. Some course assignments are done primarily to assure the faculty member that the student knows something about a specific topic. Such papers are rarely published, even if written well, because a “report” of this kind rarely adds anything new to the published literature in a discipline. The student writer is at the mercy of the faculty when required to write a paper that has little potential to influence the field. It is then up to the student to put an original “spin” or “slant” on the topic so that the paper can influence the thinking or practicing of the members of the nursing discipline.</p>

<sec id="section3-0898010112453328">
<title>Outline Course Assignment Paper</title>
<p>A distinct advantage of outlining a paper is that it helps with organization. Organization of the paper is important because it keeps you on the right track and helps the reader be interested in your topic and comfortable learning more about it. The use of headings will help you organize your message and direct the reader to the points that are important.</p>
<p>If you didn’t make an outline when you wrote the original paper for a class assignment, now is the time to do that. Outlining gives you a good picture of both the structure and the content of the paper and allows you to consider changes at a conceptual level. Many writers don’t enjoy outlining because it seems like a waste of time when they want to get on with the project, but it is a really useful skill. In outlining your assigned paper, you may find sections that were included to meet the requirements of the course assignment. These sections, while interesting and necessary to meet the faculty’s expectations, may not be needed in your manuscript. Since you no longer have to meet the course requirements for the paper, deleting a section or two and adding other information may strengthen your argument and your message. Don’t lose sight of your purpose; revisit it often while writing the remainder of the paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898010112453328">
<title>Clarify Topic/Phenomenon of Concern</title>
<p>One of the first steps in transforming a course assignment paper into a publishable manuscript is to clarify the topic. For your assignment, did you write about an abstract and global phenomenon such as <italic>stress</italic>, or something more concrete such as <italic>allostatic load</italic>? Reread your student paper several times to be sure you know what the topic is. The topic should be of some importance to members of your discipline. Are you writing to describe a new method of assessing stress in a specific category of patient? Are you writing to compare the several ways that stress is measured in children? Whatever your topic is, it should be timely, original, and focused. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112453328">Belcher (2009)</xref>, a writing instructor and author, asserts, “A publishable article is organized around a single significant new idea that is demonstrably related to what has come before” (p. 49). In clarifying your topic, you will situate it within the context of what is already known about that topic.</p>
<p>One group of nurse educators developed a writing workshop for their graduate students to help them develop skills in writing in a scholarly manner. They provided a simple equation for writing a manuscript: “Idea + Slant + Audience + Vehicle” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112453328">Heinrich et al., 2004</xref>). The idea, or topic, is one that you take a specific position toward (slant). The audience and vehicle refer to the type of people for whom you are writing the manuscript (potential readers) and the vehicle is the journal. These are addressed in more detail later in this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0898010112453328">
<title>Clearly State Purpose</title>
<p>After you clarify the topic of your paper, clearly state the purpose. You would be surprised at how many student papers, as well as submitted manuscripts, are unclear about the topic that is the focus of the paper. In addition, many such papers and manuscripts also are missing a statement about the purpose of the paper. This frustrates reviewers, editors, and journal readers. It might also have frustrated the faculty member who read your original paper, but you might not have lost any points because of that; however, journal reviewers and editors will be less forgiving on this matter. Having a clearly stated purpose will also help you stay focused on the topic and why you are writing the paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0898010112453328">
<title>Identify Intended Audience and Appropriate Journals</title>
<p>Who will be reading your paper? Who do you want to influence or inform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112453328">Cleary &amp; Walter, 2004</xref>)? Will it be health care providers in general, mental health nurses, pediatric nurses, student nurses, or nurse researchers? This is important for at least two reasons: (a) it helps you focus your writing on a particular group of readers and (b) it helps you limit the journals to which you might submit the final paper. Unlike a student assignment that had only one reader (your faculty member), a submitted manuscript will first be reviewed critically by two or three experts among the audience you have identified as needing more information on this topic. If these experts give you the green light to go ahead with publication, your manuscript will become a published article that will be read by thousands of readers. And although you intend for your audience to be circumscribed (e.g., pediatric nurses only), if your topic is of great interest and your paper is written well, it will be read by many other audiences. For example, physicians and postdoctoral research fellows may also be very interested in what you have to say on your particular topic. But at the outset, it will be less intimidating to the novice author if you will just focus on the intended audience.</p>
<p>Once you have identified your audience, you need to identify at least three journals to which you will submit your manuscript. For obvious reasons, it’s important to identify more than one in case your first-choice journal turns you down. Sometimes a journal rejects a paper because it is not a good “fit” with the purpose and scope of the journal. Other times, a journal rejects a paper because it is not written as well as it could be. If a journal turns you down for this reason, you must learn from the critiques, rewrite the paper, and turn to the next journal on your list. But how do you come up with a list of three to five appropriate journals in the first place?</p>
<p>One source that I recommend to my students is JANE, which stands for Journal/Author Name Estimator. JANE is at home at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biosemantics.org/jane/suggestions.php">http://www.biosemantics.org/jane/suggestions.php</ext-link> or you can simply Google JANE, and she will pop right up. JANE is friendly to novice and expert authors alike. When you reach this website, you can either type in a sentence or two about your paper, or if you have an abstract prepared already, you can just paste it in the box provided. In moments, JANE comes back with a very helpful list of journals that have articles similar to the words you entered. In perusing this list, you can determine which titles sound closest to your intended audience. You can then go to that journal’s website to learn more about the scope of the journal and the author guidelines. In addition to this list, JANE also gives you the opportunity to see the articles in a particular journal about your topic. Moreover, she gives you the impact factor of each journal, if one is available. An impact factor basically tells you the status of a journal. The higher the impact factor is (e.g., 1.87781 vs. 0.66345), the higher the status of the journal. A journal has a higher impact when authors cite the papers published in that journal more often than they cite papers published in other journals with lesser status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0898010112453328">
<title>Revising the Assigned Paper</title>
<p>In revising your course assignment paper for publication, begin with your outline of the paper and the faculty member’s feedback. Also, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0898010112453328" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Is the topic interesting and important to the discipline?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is there a clearly stated purpose?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the introduction logical and compelling?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are terms clearly defined?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is there a logical flow of ideas that reflect the purpose statement?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do I understand my instructor’s comments about the paper?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do I understand what must be done to improve the paper?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is missing?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As you answer these questions, keep in mind the principles of clarity and conciseness. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112453328">Zinsser (1994)</xref>, good writing is “using the English language in a way that will achieve the greatest strength and the least clutter” (p. 6). Zinsser elaborates on this statement by showing the reader how writing simply is more powerful than writing with “pompous frills and meaningless jargon” (p. 7). Other experts agree that, in general, writers use too many words to convey their messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112453328">Belcher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112453328">Williams, 2005</xref>). As a student, you may have been guilty of using too many words because you needed to “fill” 15 pages to meet the requirements of the course assignment. As you revise and rewrite, it’s a good time to “cut the fat.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898010112453328">
<title>Query Journal Editors</title>
<p>After you clarify the topic, clearly state the purpose of your paper, and narrow down your audience and their specific journals, you can proceed with writing query letters to several editors. You can actually send a letter to the editors of as many journals simultaneously as you want to ask if they might be interested in reviewing your paper. But it’s important to remember that once you decide to send a manuscript to a journal, you may submit to only one journal at a time.</p>
<p>Some journals invite prospective authors to submit query letters whereas others do not. With the current ease of communication by e-mail, most editors or managing editors are happy to respond to authors’ queries about manuscript submission. The author query letter can be very simple. The purpose of such a letter is to determine the “fit” of your paper to a specific journal. JANE is usually right, but occasionally her information can be misleading. For example, in writing this article, I submitted a synopsis to JANE, and she responded with <italic>Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute</italic>. I didn’t see the connection, so I clicked on “show articles” and found only one identified for that journal. The title was “How to Write an Oncology Manuscript” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112453328">Gaafar, 2005</xref>). The focus of that article was on the correct way to write up the findings from a research project about oncology medicine. Clearly, the readers who are interested in that article are probably not very interested in this one!</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0898010112453328">
<title>Continue Revisions Using Author Guidelines</title>
<p>In the process of preparing any manuscript for publication you will make revisions based on the specific instructions provided by journals in their author guidelines. After identifying the audience to which you will write the paper and the journals that are read by that audience, review the author guidelines or instructions for each journal. Be sure to note if there are page or word limitations (e.g., don’t submit a 4,200-word paper to a journal that accepts only papers of 3,000 words or less). Be sure to note what format is required. Many nursing journals require that submitted manuscripts adhere to the formatting of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010112453328">American Psychological Association’s (2010)</xref> <italic>Publication Manual</italic>. This manual will tell you how to use headings, how to structure tables, and how to cite your references correctly. This manual also will tell you about the publication process and what your responsibilities are as an author. Other journals require other formats. For example, the journal <italic>Advances in Nursing Science</italic> uses the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112453328">American Medical Association (2007)</xref> <italic>Manual of Style</italic> and provides detailed guidelines for references using this format on their website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112453328">“Information for Authors,” 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0898010112453328">
<title>Inviting Peer or Local Critiques</title>
<p>Invite peers and faculty members at your school to read your draft and provide critiques. Feedback from others is essential in understanding how readers might respond to your writing. Feedback from peers and faculty members at one’s educational institution is an important building block in writing scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112453328">Heinrich et al., 2004</xref>). Students may also benefit from forming writing groups in which you can experiment with both giving and receiving critiques from others. Together you can identify and discuss the strengths of the paper, determine if the topic and slant would be of interest to the intended audience, identify a place or places in the paper where the reader lost interest or was confused, and identify and discuss ways to improve the paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112453328">Belcher, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0898010112453328">
<title>Using Feedback</title>
<p>Although the steps in transforming a student assignment in holistic nursing into a publishable manuscript are not linear, they appear that way in this article. You may find, as I do in all of my writing, that the process is iterative. You may very well have started revising your student assignment long before you identified your audience or queried the editors. That’s fine, let’s just look at that in more detail here.</p>
<p>To begin with, pay attention to the feedback from the faculty member who assigned you the paper originally. What did he or she like or not like about it? Make a list of the comments written in the margins of your paper. Do they deal with the topic? Do they address the clarity of the writing? Do they question the coherence or how well the paper hangs together? Are the comments about conciseness and economy of language? Was the faculty member concerned about grammatical errors in your paper? After listing the comments, group them together by theme, that is, where are the comments about the topic, the clarity, the coherence, the conciseness, or the grammar? Then put these thematic comments in a table format so that you can easily correct them. Below is an example of such a table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898010112453328">Table 3</xref>). In the first column, write the heading Faculty Member’s Critique, and in the second column, write the heading Author’s Response. Then list the criticisms from your faculty member, and in the second column, write what you will do in response to those criticisms.</p>

<title>Edit, Proofread, Submit</title>
<p>Three skills that all writers need are revising, editing, and proofreading. Revising refers to making big changes such as adding or deleting content, whereas editing refers to making small changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112453328">Glatthorn, 2002</xref>). Editing is done primarily to correct grammatical errors such as misspelled words, agreement of noun and verb (e.g., the nurses station are is busy), using passive rather than active voice, or using a misplaced modifier. Most word processors have tools that can assist you in correcting grammar and spelling errors. There are several websites that are useful in determining the correct word to use. For example, Paul Brians’s “Common Errors in English Usage” at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/errors.html#errors">http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/errors.html#errors</ext-link> has a comprehensive list online of words from A to Z that are commonly misused in written and spoken English. For example, if you are confused about whether to use the word <italic>accept</italic> or <italic>except</italic>, you can click on the term and find an illustration of each term used correctly and a mental hint about how to differentiate the two terms.</p>
<p>When you are finally satisfied with your revisions and edits, make a final check by proofreading. Make sure that the manuscript has no grammatical, spelling, or typing errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112453328">Bennett, 2010</xref>, p. 229). Also be sure to check that all references are complete and formatted correctly for the specific journal. Check for redundant or duplicate references and delete all references not included in the final manuscript.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Holistic nursing is a professional discipline. An important characteristic of a discipline is the body of knowledge accredited to it. Such knowledge accumulates through published works that reflect the philosophies, theories, and best practices of the members of the discipline. Although holistic nursing students learn many skills as they mature as professionals, writing for publication often does not get the attention it deserves. The steps described above may assist students and faculty in transforming holistic nursing course assignment papers into publishable manuscripts.</p>
