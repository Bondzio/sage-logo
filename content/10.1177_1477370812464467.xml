<abstract>
<p>For criminologists, Belgium is at once an interesting and a very complex country. Belgium is one of the first European countries where criminology became institutionalized in the universities. As for criminal justice, in many ways Belgium can be situated in the European middle. One feature of Belgium is its institutional complexity, with a push towards devolving decision-making powers from the federal level to its entities. This recently led to the longest period of post-election government negotiations in a democratic country: for more than 500 days, the country had no real federal government. Current agreements on a future sixth reform of the federal state include devolving matters of justice to the regions and language-based communities. Moreover, since the mid-1990s Belgium has been going through a period of unprecedented criminal justice reform, in various key areas such as policing, the prison system and victim policy. However, the persistent overcrowding of Belgian prisons has hampered various reform efforts and has determined the course of penal policy in recent decades.</p>

<p>For criminologists, Belgium is at once very interesting and incredibly complex. The country has a long tradition in research of criminologically relevant themes and topics. Belgium has been a European leader in terms of institutional criminology, with schools of criminology established already in the first part of the 20th century (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1477370812464467">Tonry, 2004</xref>). Also, Belgian history provides many examples of important interchange between theory and practice in criminal justice. When, for example, Thorsten Sellin visited Belgium during the interbellum period, he was amazed by the then ongoing Social Defence-oriented prison reform. Amongst others, he was impressed by the amount of data collected on every prisoner (over 1300 items) and on the prison population as a whole, which he described as ‘a mine of incomparable value to the research student’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370812464467">Sellin, 1926</xref>: 268). This has changed, but not for the better, as briefly explained below. The other side of the coin is that Belgium, given its increasingly complex federal institutional set-up, its internal differences, the close-knit ties between criminology and criminal policy, alongside other factors, is nothing less than a challenging country for criminologists, both nationals and foreigners.</p>
<p>Criminologists in Belgium, while gradually turning towards their own language communities, also participate in great numbers in a range of international forums. For example, at the annual meetings of the European Society of Criminology, Belgium is always well represented (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477370812464467">Nobli and Crocitti, 2008</xref>: 3). This international dimension is not new; Belgian criminologists and penal theorists have long participated in international and supranational scientific and criminal policy-oriented meetings and networks. In the last decade or so, Belgian criminologists served as presidents in, for instance, the International Society for Criminology and the European Society of Criminology. Furthermore, internationally respected criminologists have been awarded honorary doctorates from Belgian criminology departments, including John Braithwaite in Leuven (2008), David Garland in Brussels (2009) and Cyrille Fijnaut in Ghent (2010).</p>
<p>This article provides a cursory overview of criminology, crime and criminal justice in Belgium. We begin by contextualizing our subject matter by reference to Belgium’s institutional complexity and the ways in which this has pushed towards devolving decision-making powers from the federal level to its various entities. Attention is then paid to the historical development of criminology in Belgium, especially its early institutionalization in universities. After a presentation of some basic statistical information on crime and criminal justice, criminal justice policy in Belgium is examined, with particular emphasis on policy reforms that have taken place in relation to sentencing and the prison system.</p>
<sec id="section1-1477370812464467">
<title>A complex context</title>
<p>Belgium is a small country with approximately 10.8 million inhabitants (as measured on 1 January 2010). Around 6.2 million inhabitants live in Flanders, 3.5 million in Wallonia and 1.1 million in Brussels. Dutch (‘Flemish’) is the official language in Flanders, French in the largest part of Wallonia (although both French and German in the German community in the east), and both Dutch and French in Brussels.</p>
<p>In terms of institutional complexity, Belgium is second to none. In 1830, upon becoming independent from the Netherlands, the country started as a unitary state, with one official language, French, whereas the majority of the people spoke a variant of Dutch (‘Flemish’). Gradually, over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Dutch obtained the status of an official language. After the First World War, in 1920, a small part of Germany (with a population of some 75,000 people) became part of Belgium. As of 1962, German was recognized as the country’s third official language.</p>
<p>Over recent decades, developments relating to language and territory have led towards greater autonomy. Although much of the complexity has been due to political tensions, so far these have always been resolved in peaceful ways, through negotiations and political agreements. From 1970 onwards, the state of Belgium went through five major reforms, each one according more powers to three territory-based regions (Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels) and to the three language communities (Flemish, French and German). Since 1993, based on the fourth state reform, Belgium has been a federal country. Each of the regions and language communities has its own government and parliament (in Flanders, regional and community matters are dealt with by one Flemish government). This means that policy-making in Belgium, in terms of complexity, is akin to rocket science: regional and community governments and the federal government all have their own decisional powers, which implies that a number of policy domains are distributed over different governments.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, most Flemish political parties have been pushing towards even greater autonomy. A further state reform became the major focus of federal elections in 2007. When the government fell, precisely over the issue of state reform, this issue moved again to the centre of political attention in view of the elections of 2010. At the time of writing, the longest period of negotiations for the formation of a government in the federal state of Belgium has finally come to an end. On 6 December 2011, 540 days after the elections, a new federal government was instated (Di Rupo I). Ironically, however, now that the long-awaited new government has finally taken office, there remains only limited time for policy-making decisions before the next federal elections are conducted in 2014. It is an open matter whether the current government can put a stop, however temporary, to political instability in the country.</p>
<p>Much of the federal political standstill has to do with the two major language communities in the country, and the ways in which they have long tried to deal with differences by reforming the state towards greater autonomy for the communities and regions involved. Thus, recent decades have already given rise to what two eminent lawyers call ‘a federal structure of mind-boggling complexity that both reflects and reinforces the organization of political, social, and cultural life on the basis of language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1477370812464467">Mnookin and Verbeke, 2009</xref>: 153). Since the last federal elections in 2010, a range of political scenarios have been discussed, all revolving around the breadth and depth of the next state reform. The recent – almost exclusively political – turmoil led some politicians to start talking about ‘Plan B’: a full secession between the francophone and Dutch-speaking parts, thus bringing an end to the existence of the country (and opinion polls have already been conducted in both the Netherlands and France on how the public would position themselves in the event of a split-up of Belgium). Currently, however, political tensions seem to have been funnelled and channelled towards yet another reform of the federal state, the sixth in a period of some three decades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1477370812464467">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both linguistic tensions and the continuous political reorganization of the state have left their traces and made their mark on the institutional history of criminology in Belgium, as well as creating opportunities for criminology to develop further. A few examples will be mentioned further on. It is to be expected that, in the foreseeable future, the complexity of the state will be reflected more and more in criminological endeavours, as certain matters of justice, including the application of community sentences and juvenile justice, will be largely devolved to the different communities across the country.</p>

<title>Criminology in Belgium</title>
<sec id="section3-1477370812464467">
<title>Predecessors</title>
<p>Among key figures in criminology, most criminologists would include Adolphe Quételet, a Belgian astronomer and statistician who, in the first half of the 19th century, developed what he called ‘Moral Statistics’, which included the first criminal statistics. Indeed, Quételet can be considered as one of the founding fathers of quantitative criminology (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477370812464467">Amatrudo, 2010</xref>). Other illustrious Belgians include Edouard Ducpétiaux and Adolphe Prins. Ducpétiaux, himself imprisoned by the Dutch authorities during the struggle for Belgian independence, became the first Belgian inspector-general of the prison system. He shaped the Belgian prison system according to the Pennsylvanian model of solitary confinement, while writing prolifically on themes such as the death penalty and poverty, and participating as an important voice in a broader European debate on ‘the ideal prison’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370812464467">Vanhulle, 2010</xref>). Prins was among the leading legal European scholars at the end of the 19th and in the early 20th century, co-founded the <italic>Internationale Kriminalistische Vereinigung</italic> (International Organization of Criminal Law) together with Van Hamel and von Liszt, and translated ideas from the Italian Positivist School into penal law and policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1477370812464467">Ponsaers and Hebberecht, 2000</xref>: 47–8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1477370812464467">
<title>Institutionalizing criminology</title>
<p>Belgium is among the first European countries where criminology became institutionalized in the universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1477370812464467">Tonry, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1477370812464467">2010</xref>). The first criminological developments in Belgium were strongly inspired by the Social Defence movement. At the end of the 19th century, in 1890, legal scholar Prins and psychiatrist Héger established a <italic>cercle universitaire pour les études criminologiques</italic> (university group for criminology studies) at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477370812464467">Durviaux, 1990</xref>). During the following decades, a number of initiatives were undertaken in the criminal justice system, aiming to put Social Defence ideas into practice: young delinquents were placed in institutions, while being submitted to study and ‘treatment’; likewise, in the prison system, initiatives were introduced to study offenders and ‘treat’ them. Criminal law scholars, psychiatrists and medical doctors wanted to integrate these activities of studying and treating offenders in academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370812464467">Bruinsma and Walgrave, 2009</xref>: 136). Criminology in those days was very closely tied to criminal justice policy and was seen as an auxiliary science – an academic ‘sidekick’ – to criminal law.</p>
<p>The foundation of schools of criminology in the universities soon followed suit: in Leuven in 1929, in Brussels in 1936, in Ghent in 1938 and in Liège in 1938. With the exception of the school of criminology in Ghent, all schools of criminology were francophone, although in 1968 Dutch programmes were introduced in Brussels and Leuven for Flemish students. Eventually, language tensions led to a total split-up of the universities of Brussels and Leuven (legally, the secession of both universities occurred in 1970). The francophone University of Leuven was relocated to a newly built university campus of Louvain-la-Neuve (literally ‘the new Leuven’), while the Dutch-speaking part remained in Leuven. In Brussels, the university split-up gave way to the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, alongside the francophone Université Libre de Bruxelles. In 1978, the francophone Département de Criminologie et de Droit Pénal left Leuven and found a new home in Louvain-la-Neuve. There are now six schools of criminology, three Flemish (in Brussels, in Ghent and in Leuven) and three francophone (in Brussels, in Liège and in Louvain-la-Neuve) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370812464467">Bruinsma and Walgrave, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1477370812464467">Ponsaers and Hebberecht, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477370812464467">Snacken, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1477370812464467">
<title>Studying criminology</title>
<p>Until the late 1960s, criminology could be studied only after completion of a degree in another academic discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370812464467">Dantinne and Duchêne, 2010</xref>). As of 1968, a full university programme (four years of study) was established in Leuven. Two years later, Ghent also introduced a four-year programme, but it was not until 1992 that the Flemish School of Criminology in Brussels proceeded to do so as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370812464467">Bruinsma and Walgrave, 2009</xref>). In francophone schools, criminology has continued to be a complementary field of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477370812464467">Snacken, 2003</xref>). This distinction has survived the Bologna reform, which was implemented in Belgium in 2004. Flemish universities offer both a three-year undergraduate and a one-year postgraduate programme in criminology, as well as offering particular criminology modules and even an entire postgraduate degree in English. The Walloon universities of Liège and Louvain-la-Neuve and the francophone university in Brussels offer a two-year postgraduate degree, but no undergraduate degree, in criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370812464467">Dantinne and Duchêne, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477370812464467">Snacken, 2003</xref>). The difference is also reflected in the numbers of students. The four-year programmes at the Flemish universities are highly popular. In the academic year 2007–8, spread over the three Flemish schools of criminology and over different academic years, some 2000 students were enrolled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370812464467">Bruinsma and Walgrave, 2009</xref>: 148). This contrasts significantly with the situation in francophone schools, where around 300 criminology students were enrolled. Such differences have important implications, including for the number of staff in criminology departments: the higher the number of students, the greater the financial means accorded to a school, and the greater the number of personnel that may be hired to teach and do research. The schools of criminology in Ghent and Leuven are at this point among the largest in terms of criminology staff worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1477370812464467">Tonry, 2004</xref>): when including professors, researchers and teaching assistants, they each have more than 50 members of staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1477370812464467">
<title>Criminological research</title>
<p>Until the late 1960s and early 1970s, criminology in Belgium was predominantly focused on criminal law, psychiatry, psychology and medical aspects of crime and offenders. Most of the professors teaching criminology were practitioners working in the criminal justice system (as psychiatrists, prison governors or judges, for example). Almost exclusively, until the advent of critical sociological approaches, criminology in Belgium was closely tied to criminal justice. It was mainly a ‘governmental criminology’, which fell under the large umbrella of criminal justice and criminal law – it could be characterized as ‘an absorbed science … under the banner of criminal law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477370812464467">Kaminski and Mary, 2007</xref>: 236). In the 1960s and 1970s, under the influence of anglophone (mainly American) developments, criminology in Belgium became ‘sociologized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370812464467">Goethals, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1477370812464467">Ponsaers and Hebberecht, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1477370812464467">van Swaaningen, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>For a long time, there were no full-time researchers in criminology in Belgium, with one exception at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. Systematic empirical research in criminology took off in the early 1970s, most notably when a collaboration between the schools of criminology and the prison system started (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370812464467">Bruinsma and Walgrave, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370812464467">Daems and Hutsebaut, 2011</xref>). Since then, criminological research in Belgium has flourished, focusing on themes such as juvenile delinquency, crime prevention, policing, criminal justice decision-making, imprisonment and early release, community sentences, and victimology and restorative justice. However, important lacunae remain, including such fundamental issues as the impact of imprisonment or community sentences on recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370812464467">Dantinne and Duchêne, 2010</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1477370812464467">Wartna and Nijssen, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, as a Dutch colleague has observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1477370812464467">van Swaaningen, 2000</xref>), criminology in Belgium seems to be less sensitive to scientific ‘fashion trends’ than is the case in the Netherlands. Much criminological research draws on qualitative methodologies. To some extent, this can be explained by the deplorable state of Belgian criminal justice statistics. However, quantitative criminology seems to be on the rise in the country. So far, there have not been overt methodological struggles – in general, criminologists in Belgium seem to recognize the advantages of both qualitative and quantitative approaches and of their various combinations.</p>
<p>Most criminological research is undertaken in universities, although government departments have also created research departments such as the National Institute of Criminalistics and Criminology, the Department for Penal Policy and the General Police Service (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477370812464467">Snacken, 2003</xref>: 12). Funding for research is granted by governmental scientific foundations: Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO) in Flanders, and Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS) in francophone Belgium. Universities also sponsor doctoral and other research projects, but most criminological research is sponsored by governmental departments, including cities and municipalities, federal entities (the communities or regions), the federal state (particularly the Ministry of Interior or the Ministry of Justice) or, at the European level, the European Union or the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>In terms of scientific exchange and communication, linguistic differences seem to have had important implications for criminology in Belgium. There is no bilingual criminology journal in the country. The two main criminological journals are the francophone <italic>Revue de Droit Pénal et de Criminologie</italic> (founded in 1907) and the Dutch-language <italic>Panopticon</italic> (founded in 1979). Criminologists, especially in Flemish universities, also increasingly turn towards anglophone criminology journals as a forum in which to communicate their research findings. Similarly, the Belgian Society of Criminology organized its last bilingual conference in the mid-1990s and has since receded to the background of academic criminology in Belgium. On the other hand, the Flemish Society of Criminology was founded in 2007 (Vlaamse Vereniging voor Criminologie, VVC), and francophone colleagues have been increasingly participating in the broader Association Internationale des Criminologues de Langue Française (AICLF – International Association of Francophone Criminologists). Criminologists in Belgium have had and continue to have strong participation in European and international associations and research networks.</p>

<title>Trends in crime and criminal justice</title>
<p>Sellin’s brief remark about the quality of Belgian prison statistics in the early 20th century does not hold for the current state of affairs. Indeed, Belgium today has a very poor record in terms of statistical data on crime, victimization and criminal justice processes. This situation has been criticized repeatedly by Belgian criminologists (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370812464467">Devroe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812464467">Maes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1477370812464467">Ponsaers and Bruggeman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1477370812464467">Snacken, 2007</xref>) and it inevitably limits the scope of our own analysis below. It is still possible, however, to discuss some basic trends and developments in crime and criminal justice in Belgium.</p>
<sec id="section8-1477370812464467">
<title>Crime, victimization and fear of crime</title>
<p>The rate of crime, as registered by the police, has increased over the past decade. More specifically, one can observe an 8.8 percent overall increase in the volume of registered crimes, from a total of 993,796 offences in 2000 to 1,081,477 in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477370812464467">Federale Politie, 2012</xref>). As a rate per 1000 inhabitants, crime has increased by 1.7 percent: from 97.1 in 2000 to 98.8 in 2011. However, to a large extent, this increase can be explained by a rise in infringements of local police regulations (from 774 in 2000 to 52,091 in 2011), minor offences that concern, for example, the breaking of local regulations on closing hours for pubs, letting animals stray and making excessive noise.</p>
<p>The most common offences registered by the police in 2011 were theft and extortion (41.4 percent of the total), violence against property (11.4 percent of the total) and offences against physical integrity (8.2 percent of the total, excluding sexual offences). The last two categories have risen since 2000: violence against property by 17.3 percent (from a total of 104,894 in 2000 to 123,027 in 2011; or, from 10.2 to 11.2 per 1000 inhabitants), and offences against physical integrity by 37.4 percent (from a total of 64,654 in 2000 to 88,857 in 2011; or, from 6.3 to 8.1 per 1000 inhabitants). There have also been increases for a number of other crimes such as infringements of immigration laws and the civil registry (both more than doubled), violations of legislation on arms and explosives (by 84 percent), and on inebriation and alcohol (by 94.5 percent). Some new types of crime such as cybercrime and trafficking in human beings were only recently included in police statistics. Between 2005 and 2011, the occurrence of both cybercrime and trafficking in human beings increased (by 248.4 percent and 1330.4 percent, respectively), yet there was a drop in the occurrence of other types of crime such as deceit (by 44.1 percent), theft and extortion (by 8.8 percent), and drug-related offences (by 5.1 percent). Findings from national victim surveys confirm that the evolution of crime in Belgium in recent years has varied according to the type of offence. Between 1997 and 2008, for example, there was a rise in the number of citizens who reported having fallen victim to burglary, vandalism of cars and thefts from cars, theft without violence, and physical violence. On the other hand, self-reported victimization in terms of theft of cars, offences related to bikes and motorcycles, violent theft, and sex offences either decreased or remained stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1477370812464467">Van den Bogaerde et al., 2009</xref>; see further <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477370812464467">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Trends in fear of crime among the public in Belgium do not seem to accord with trends in police-registered crime rates and self-reported criminal victimization in the country. In a nationwide public survey conducted in 2008, for example, the proportion of citizens who responded they ‘always or often feel unsafe’ was found not only to stand at a low 7.9 percent, but also to have dropped from the 12.4 percent rate that had been recorded in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1477370812464467">Van den Bogaerde et al., 2009</xref>). In the 2005 European Survey of Crime and Safety, 26 percent of all respondents in Belgium reported ‘feeling unsafe or very unsafe in the street after dark’, but this was below the international average of 27 percent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1477370812464467">Van Dijk et al., 2007</xref>: 131). It is unsurprising that there has been a parallel upward trend in terms of public trust towards the police and the justice system; indeed, the majority of the Belgian population express trust in these institutions, and this to a greater degree than they do towards the parliament, the press and religious institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1477370812464467">Parmentier and Vervaeke, 2011</xref>: 290–1). Similarly, findings from international comparative research have demonstrated that the level of satisfaction with the police among the Belgian population exceeds the international average (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1477370812464467">Van Dijk et al., 2007</xref>: 115).</p>

<title>Prosecution, sentencing and imprisonment</title>
<p>In 2007, for the first time since the penal repression of Nazi collaborators in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the prison population exceeded 10,000. On 1 September 2009, the prison population rate per 100,000 population was 101.4 (including electronic monitoring, or 93.1 when excluding electronic monitoring; <italic>N</italic> = 10,901, of which 895 were under electronic monitoring), well below the European average of 143.8 and the respective median of 119.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812464467">Aebi and Delgrande, 2011</xref>: 26–7). At the end of 2011, there were over 11,000 prisoners behind bars in Belgium. Most of them were male (96 percent) and relatively young (33 years old on the average), while about 4 out of 10 (40.8 percent) did not have the Belgian nationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812464467">Aebi and Delgrande, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As in many other European countries, the overall prison population in Belgium has increased substantially in recent decades and years. Between 1980 and 2010 the average daily prison population increased by 85.6 percent, from 5677 to 10,536 (or from 57.6 prisoners per 100,000 inhabitants in 1980 to 97.2 in 2010). It should be noted that this percentage is to some extent an underestimate, given that some categories of prisoners are no longer counted in national statistics (for example, prisoners placed under electronic monitoring, mentally disordered offenders interned in non-federal institutions). Over a longer-term perspective, the prison population in Belgium has been somewhat more stable. With the exception of a notable decrease around 1980, the average daily prison population hovered around 6500 from the late 1960s to the late 1980s. The upward trend started in the early 1990s, when the average daily prison population increased from 6549 in 1990 (65.8 per 100,000 inhabitants) to 7693 in 1995 (75.9 per 100,000 inhabitants) (see further <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477370812464467">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812464467">Maes, 2010</xref>: 48–9). Depending on the period under consideration, this upward trend can be attributed either to an increase in the use of imprisonment or to a lengthening of the average time spent in prison. It should be noted, however, that the average time spent in prison underwent an increase in the 1990s – it was 4.1 months in 1991 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812464467">Maes, 2010</xref>: 51) and reached 7.3 months in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1477370812464467">Tournier, 2001</xref>: 32) – but decreased slightly in the 2000s (by 2008, for instance, it had fallen to 6.7 months; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812464467">Aebi and Delgrande, 2011</xref>: 83).</p>

<p>The substantial rise in the prison population of Belgium has occurred despite the fact that the caseload dealt with by the prosecution service of the country has decreased in recent years (for example, from 925,522 cases in 2003 to 719,695 in 2009) and prosecutors tend not to refer cases to courts. In 2009, for instance, prosecutorial referrals to the court or to the judicial council (with a view to a possible referral to the court) amounted, respectively, to 3.0 percent and 2.4 percent of all prosecutorial decisions. Conversely, a little over 70 percent of all cases dealt with by the prosecution service resulted in a waiver, whether due to technical considerations such as the inability to identify a suspect (‘technical waiver’) or because referral of the case to a court was not desirable (‘opportunity waiver’). The use of transactions (settlement by payment of an amount of money) and penal mediation, on the other hand, still remain marginal (they represented, respectively, 0.9 percent and 0.3 percent of all prosecutorial decisions in 2009; see, further, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477370812464467">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The increase since the early 1990s in the average daily prison population in Belgium has mainly concerned two categories of prisoners. First are sentenced prisoners, whose average daily population increased by 124.6 percent between 1980 and 2010, from 2544 to 5714 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812464467">Maes, 2010</xref>: 52; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370812464467">DG EPI, 2011</xref>: 162). In particular, the number of prisoners serving correctional prison sentences<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1477370812464467">2</xref></sup> of five years and more underwent a sharp, nearly 10-fold overall rise between 1980 and 2005, from 220 to 2071, which was largely due to the common practice of harsh sentencing by judges (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812464467">Maes, 2010</xref>: 64–5) and the tightening of eligibility criteria for early release of long-term prisoners (see further below). Prisoners serving sentences of five years or more (including temporal criminal prison sentences and life sentences) have grown to be the most prevalent category among sentenced prisoners in Belgium, at a notably higher level than in other European countries such as France or the Netherlands (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812464467">Aebi and Delgrande, 2011</xref>: 76). Also, the number of prisoners serving sentences of between three and five years increased almost four-fold during the same period, from 374 to 1406, and the number of lifers increased more than three-fold, from 75 to 235 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812464467">Maes, 2010</xref>: 55–6). The number of prisoners serving shorter sentences has fallen by half over the last two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812464467">Maes, 2010</xref>: 55–6) as a result of the practice of non-execution of short custodial sentences, the expanded use of electronic monitoring (on which more below), and the introduction and application of early (quasi-automatic) release. Over 80 percent of all released sentenced prisoners were released by way of ‘provisional release’ (a quasi-automatic early release scheme) in 2009, compared with 10 percent in 1980 and 50 percent in 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812464467">Maes, 2010</xref>: 57–9). The most common offences among sentenced prisoners span robbery, theft, drug-related offences and physical assault (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812464467">Aebi and Delgrande, 2011</xref>: 70). The second category of prisoners who have been most affected by the rise in the average daily prison population in Belgium are remand prisoners. Their average daily population increased by 150 percent over the past 30 years, rising from 1458 in 1980 to 3638 in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812464467">Maes, 2010</xref>: 52–3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370812464467">DG EPI, 2011</xref>: 162).</p>
<p>Recent years have also seen an impressive increase in the number of mentally ill prisoners in Belgium; whereas, for instance, the total number of mentally ill prisoners amounted to 589 in 1999 (on 1 March), it stood at 1089 in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370812464467">Federale Overheidsdienst Justitie, 2010</xref>: 56). On the other hand, a decrease has taken place in the cases of minors, vagrants and illegal immigrants (incarcerated solely because they were in the country illegally) in Belgian prisons. The number of imprisoned vagrants fell as a result of the decriminalization of vagrancy in 1993, and illegal immigrants are currently held in closed institutions that come under the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs. In 2010, Belgium had six such institutions, which admitted a total of 6533 illegal immigrants. The average total capacity of these institutions was 582 places and their average daily population was 495 detainees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477370812464467">Dienst Vreemdelingenzaken, 2011</xref>: 128, 130).</p>

<title>Alternatives to custody and early release from prison</title>
<p>Parallel to the rise in the use of imprisonment in Belgium, both alternatives to custody and early release from prison have also undergone a significant expansion. As concerns alternatives to custody at the criminal investigation and sentencing stages, the total number of offenders placed under probationary supervision in lieu of remand custody (release under conditions) increased from 609 in 1995 to 4949 in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370812464467">Federale Overheidsdienst Justitie, 2010</xref>: 66; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477370812464467">Service Social d’Exécution de Décisions Judiciaires, 1996</xref>). The number of offenders placed under supervised community service (also known as ‘supervision for work penalty’), a stand-alone form of sanction that was introduced in the Belgian penal code in 2002, rose from 4537 in 2003 to 10,112 in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370812464467">Federale Overheidsdienst Justitie, 2010</xref>: 66–7). The use of ‘probation’ (deferral of judgment and suspension of the execution of the sentence with special conditions) increased in the early 2000s (the total number of offenders on ‘probation’ rose from 4473 in 1999 to 7430 in 2002), but has dropped in recent years (probationers amounted to 6700 in 2009, for example; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370812464467">Federale Overheidsdienst Justitie, 2010</xref>: 67). That these alternative measures have not yet had an effect on the size of the prison population may be explained, at least in part, by the fact that they do not apply to the ever-increasing number of cases of offenders who receive long-term custodial sentences.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to early release from prison. The case of early quasi-automatic release for short-term prisoners (‘provisional’ release) has already been mentioned. Prisoners serving sentences longer than three years may also be released early, under the discretionary conditional release scheme. The number of prisoners released under this scheme stood at 711 in 2009, and decreased significantly compared with the beginning of the 1990s, mainly because of an extension of quasi-automatic release schemes. Also, the time lag between prisoners’ date of eligibility for discretionary conditional release and the date of their actual release has increased substantially over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812464467">Maes, 2010</xref>: 62–3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370812464467">Rihoux, 2000</xref>). In 2007, for instance, the average time lag was 14.5 months, compared with 5.2 months in 1990 and 6 months in 1994/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477370812464467">Deltenre, 2008</xref>: 50; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477370812464467">Maes and Tange, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Electronic monitoring, which in Belgium is considered not as a form of early release but as a means for carrying out prison sentences, is used as both a front- and a back-door strategy (that is, to avoid incarceration in cases of shorter prison sentences, and to be discharged from prison at a certain time before obtaining conditional release or when reaching the end of a sentence). Electronic monitoring as a way of implementing prison sentences was introduced experimentally in the prison of Saint Gilles in Brussels in the late 1990s. Its use was gradually extended to the rest of the country, and the total number of prisoners placed under electronic monitoring increased from 167 in 2002 to 928 in 2010 (population on 1 March; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370812464467">Federale Overheidsdienst Justitie, 2010</xref>: 56).</p>

<title>Criminal justice reform since the late 1990s</title>
<p>Over the past 15 years, the Belgian criminal justice system has gone through a period of unprecedented reform. Even though the notorious Dutroux case of 1996 was not the starting-point for this attention to criminal justice affairs, it definitely did function as a catalyst. In October 1996, the Dutroux case, which concerned the kidnapping and murder of four young girls, brought some 300,000 people with white balloons onto the streets of Brussels. This unique collective citizen initiative entered Belgian history and collective memory as the White March. The Dutroux case brought some important failures of the criminal justice system to light, including the lack of empathy towards the plight of the victims of crime and their relatives, as well as various problems of communication and rivalry between the various police forces of the time. Many of these problems (as well as various of their proposed solutions) were widely discussed and criticized in the public (televised) hearings of the case and the reports of the parliamentary inquiry commission that ensued.</p>
<p>In May 1998, a grand reform plan – the so-called ‘Octopus agreement’ – was being negotiated by eight major political parties in order to undertake in-depth reform of the Belgian criminal justice system. Towards the end of that year, a first important hurdle manifested itself: the Act of 7 December 1998 (which came into force in 2001) integrated and reorganized the three police forces of the country (the gendarmerie, the judicial police and the local police) into a police force structured at two levels, the federal and the local. Even though several criticisms have been raised since then, of the police reform itself (in terms, for example, of the lack of a clear division of tasks between the federal and the local police); of the different authorities involved (Minister of Justice, Minister of Internal Affairs, mayor, etc.); of the multiplication and complexification of advisory boards, commissions, etc.; and of the way in which it has been evaluated, both police officials and academics appear to have assessed the reform process to have been successful overall (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370812464467">Bruggeman and Ponsaers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477370812464467">Bruggeman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477370812464467">Federale Politieraad, 2009</xref>). Another major outcome of the reform process was the creation of a High Council of Justice in 1999, which plays a key role in the appointment of judges and public prosecutors and deals with complaints against the judiciary. Also, the Act of 12 March 1998 reinforced the legal position of victims in criminal procedures, as well as expanded and professionalized victim support services, and the Act of 5 March 1998 introduced hearing and information rights for certain types of victims in the post-sentencing phase, which were further extended by the Act of 17 May 2006.</p>
<p>In this victim-sensitive climate, other initiatives and especially those related to restorative justice have also been able to flourish. This has often happened in collaboration with criminology departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477370812464467">Aertsen, 2006</xref>). The Act of 22 June 2005 on mediation, for example, stipulates that anyone who has a direct interest in a particular case can, at any stage of the criminal procedure as well as in the post-sentencing phase, make a request for mediation. Moreover, restorative justice ideas have even found their way into Belgian prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1477370812464467">Robert and Peters, 2003</xref>), although the idea of ‘restorative prisons’ seems to have receded into the background in recent years, when the professional function of restorative consultants was given a different and more elaborate job description (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370812464467">Daems, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1477370812464467">Robert and Peters, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As concerns penal policy, its planned reform has been much less successful. In 1996, the then Minister of Justice gave a new impetus to penal reform in a much-welcomed white paper on penal policy and imprisonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1477370812464467">Minister van Justitie, 1996</xref>). This white paper offered an analysis of the various problems that the penal system was facing and acknowledged the limits of penal measures. It was argued that priority should be given to alternative sanctions and that the legal position of prisoners (inside prison institutions as well as in terms of release from prison) needed to be elaborated. However, the timing of the publication of the white paper could hardly have been worse: from August 1996 onwards, the Dutroux case grabbed all media and political attention, and priorities soon shifted. The government made funding available for the construction of two new prisons, the reform of conditional release was completed faster than initially expected, and sexual offences took centre stage.</p>
<p>At some distance from the political turmoil, however, an expert commission started to work on the reform of the legal position of prisoners, as was announced in the white paper of 1996. The commission based its work on a draft text written by Professor Lieven Dupont, of the University of Leuven. In February 2000, the commission delivered its report, but it would take another five years before the relevant Prison Act would be passed. In the meantime, another expert commission was formed to promote the establishment of a new system for parole and various forms of prison furlough, the creation of tribunals for the execution of sanctions, and reform of the sentencing process. This commission was active from March 2000 to mid-2003. The first two parts of its assignment eventually resulted in two new laws in May 2006, which, however, have not been implemented adequately, if at all, in actual practice (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477370812464467">Daems, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477370812464467">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1477370812464467">Snacken et al, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A long-standing problem in Belgium’s criminal justice system has been prison overcrowding. In 2009, there were 117.9 prisoners per 100 places (excluding electronic monitoring) in Belgium, well above the European average of 98.4; indeed, only a small number of countries (for example, Serbia, Spain, Italy) fared worse than Belgium in this respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812464467">Aebi and Delgrande, 2011</xref>: 26). Overcrowding can be found in almost three out of every four Belgian prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370812464467">DG EPI, 2011</xref>: 157) and is especially acute in large institutions for remand prisoners (for example, the prisons of Vorst, in Brussels, and Antwerp). An array of measures have been taken to reduce pressure on overcrowded prisons, from the non-execution of custodial sentences up to six months, to the quasi-automatic provisional release of prisoners with sentences of up to three years after serving one-third of their sentence, to the expansion of the electronic monitoring of offenders. But although these measures appear to have a humane aspect and have helped to keep the Belgian prison population rate below the European average, one should not lose sight of the fact that the current release policy in Belgium is more the result of bureaucratic control and crisis management than a deliberate and well-designed policy aimed at the reintegration of offenders.</p>
<p>In April 2008, and in light of the persistent problem of prison overcrowding, the Belgian government launched a master plan for renovating and enlarging some of the existing prisons, closing down some older ones and, in particular, building several new establishments. It is planned that four new prisons (Beveren, Dendermonde, Leuze-en-Hainaut and Marche-en-Famenne), with a total capacity of about 1344 places, will open their doors in mid-2013, and construction plans for additional new prisons are currently under review. The new prisons will be built and run in cooperation with the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477370812464467">Federale Overheidsdienst Justitie, 2011a</xref>). The whole operation should be finalized by 2016 and lead to an overall increase of over 2500 places, compared with the situation today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477370812464467">Beyens and Janssens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370812464467">Daems, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, at the end of 2009, the Belgian government decided to rent a prison in the Netherlands. This was announced as a temporary measure, until the building of new prisons has been completed. According to the relevant agreement of 31 October 2009 between Belgium and the Netherlands, the Belgian authorities can make use of the Dutch prison cells until the end of December 2012 (with the possibility of a one-year extension). In early 2010, 500 prisoners were transferred to the prison of Tilburg, and in November 2010 the Belgian government decided to rent an extra 150 cells. Interestingly, this means that the largest Belgian prison for long-term convicted prisoners is currently situated in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477370812464467">Robert, 2011</xref>). It is also planned, meanwhile, that as of 1 January 2012 short prison sentences of eight months or less will be carried out at home, under a regime of home detention that utilizes voice recognition technology for surveillance purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477370812464467">Federale Overheidsdienst Justitie, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Against the background of incomplete legislative reforms and a continuing crisis in the country’s prison system, it should not come as a surprise that Belgium has received criticism from various European watchdogs that monitor detention conditions and respect for human rights (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370812464467">Commissioner for Human Rights, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370812464467">CPT, 2010</xref>). Moreover, there does not currently seem to be any particular philosophy underpinning or guiding the Belgian criminal justice system, as was emphasized even by the Minister of Justice in February 2010 in his commentary on the planned revision of the Belgian code of criminal law procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370812464467">Minister van Justitie, 2010</xref>: 18). Unfortunately, the emphasis in Belgian penal policy has thus far been overwhelmingly on reducing impunity and restoring the credibility of the sentencing system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477370812464467">Beyens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370812464467">Daems, 2009</xref>), which implies that care has not been taken to match particular sanctions or other measures to given types of offence or offender, and little attention has been paid to the goals that sentencing decisions should serve.</p>

<p>Correctional prison sentences are sentences for misdemeanours or correctionalized felony crimes that are generally imposed by the correctional courts. The length of these sentences may vary from 8 days to 5 years; in some cases, correctional sentences of a longer duration (a maximum of 20 years) can be given. Temporal criminal prison sentences are sentences imposed by the Court of Assizes for non-correctionalized felony crimes, and range from 5 years to 30 years maximum.</p>
