<abstract>
<p>Preliminary efficacy data are reported for a research-based reading intervention designed for struggling readers in high school. PHAST PACES teaches (a) word identification strategies, (b) knowledge of text structures, and (c) reading comprehension strategies. In a quasi-experimental design, 268 intervention and 83 waiting list control students meeting criteria for reading disability were assessed before and after their semester. After 60 to 70 hours of PHAST PACES instruction, struggling readers demonstrated significant gains on standardized tests of word attack, word reading, and passage comprehension and on experimental measures of letter–sound knowledge and multisyllabic word identification relative to control students. An average effect size of .68 was revealed across these outcome measures. One year follow-up data on 197 PHAST PACES students revealed an average trend to decelerated growth after the intervention, except for passage comprehension outcomes that demonstrated continued growth over follow-up.</p>

<p>There is widespread consensus regarding the importance of programming initiatives to promote reading development in the early grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219410371678">Foorman &amp; Moats, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219410371678">National Reading Panel [NRP], Report of the Subgroups, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022219410371678">C. E. Snow, Burns, &amp; Griffin, 1998</xref>), and there is ample evidence of the costly results of delaying intervention efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022219410371678">Torgesen, 2005</xref>). Yet recent data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022219410371678">U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0022219410371678">2007</xref>) estimate that less than one third of middle and high school students in the United States meet the standard of reading “proficiently” for their grade level. In typical high-poverty, urban schools, approximately half of all new ninth grade students were found to read at a sixth or seventh grade level, and, on average, African American and Hispanic twelfth grade students read at the same level as White eighth grade students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0022219410371678">U.S. Department of Education, 2006</xref>). The 2007 NAEP results revealed no gains for lower income eighth grade students over the past few years. This revelation is particularly troubling given results from a recent study of high school students identified with reading disabilities; Individualized Education Program (IEP) data revealed that there existed <italic>no</italic> plans to address the basic reading skill deficits of these students at the high school level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219410371678">Catone &amp; Brady, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the United States, reading underachievement among school-age children has been a focus of major political and public interest, resulting in legislative reform and a change in how many states approach reading instruction in the early grades. In the US, it has been reported that 25% of adults read below the fourth grade level nationally, with illiteracy rates rising to 37% in high poverty areas such as Washington, D.C. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219410371678">Moats, 2001</xref>). In Canada, functional illiteracy in adulthood was estimated at 24% two decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219410371678">Calamai, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022219410371678">Statistics Canada, 1990</xref>). Approximately 44% of adults in the most populated and most prosperous province of Canada (Ontario) fell into the two lowest levels of literacy skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022219410371678">Statistics Canada, 1995</xref>). Canadians with the lowest levels of literacy had the highest rates of unemployment (26%), in comparison to a 4% unemployment rate among those Canadians at the highest literacy levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219410371678">Canadian Language and Literacy Research Network [CLLRnet], 2003-2004</xref>).</p>
<p>There is clear evidence of widespread literacy problems among teenagers in North American high schools: Some 25% of high school students in Ontario typically fail one or both components of the provincial literacy test, threatening their opportunity to achieve a secondary school diploma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219410371678">Education Quality Accountability Office, 2001-2002</xref>). These figures include 15% of those in an academic program (students headed for postsecondary education) and 55% of students in an applied program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219410371678">CLLRnet, 2003-2004</xref>). In the United States, the U.S. Department of Education has established and evaluated two supplementary literacy programs in ninth grade, an attempt to improve the reading comprehension skills and school performance of struggling readers in the first year of high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219410371678">Corrin, Somers, Kemple, Nelson, &amp; Sepanik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219410371678">Kemple et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022219410371678">Somers, Corrin, Sepanik, Salinger, Levin, &amp; Zmach, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It has long been recognized that children and adolescents do not grow out of reading problems. Data from the Connecticut Longitudinal Study revealed that 74% of children defined as reading disabled in third grade still met criteria for reading disability in ninth grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219410371678">Francis, Shaywitz, Stuebing, Shaywitz, &amp; Fletcher, 1994</xref>). Research on adolescent and adult outcomes of children with developmental reading disorders (RD) indicates that the core learning deficits of RD clearly persist into adulthood, even in cases with good literacy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219410371678">Bruck, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219410371678">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022219410371678">Scarborough, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022219410371678">Shaywitz et al., 1999</xref>). Problems persist with spelling accuracy, word recognition speed, and reading rate, particularly in the reading of more technical expository text. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219410371678">Beitchman, Wilson, Douglas, Young, and Adlaf (2001)</xref> conducted a long-term prospective study of young children with speech and language disorders and concluded that persistent learning disorders in adolescence (at ages 12 and 19; including reading, spelling and/or math disorders) were associated with an elevated risk for adverse outcomes in young adulthood, including lower family socioeconomic status, lower IQ scores, and lower educational and occupational attainments at age 19.</p>
<p>The NRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219410371678">2000</xref>) emphasized the need for reading instruction that encompasses multiple dimensions of proficient reading skill: phonemic awareness, phonics and decoding, reading fluency, reading comprehension, and vocabulary development. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219410371678">Fletcher, Denton, Fuchs, and Vaughn (2005)</xref> suggest, multiple reports now support the conclusion that teachers must <italic>integrate</italic> instruction involving multiple domains of reading skills (decoding, word recognition, fluency, and text comprehension) for their students to become truly proficient readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022219410371678">C. E. Snow et al., 1998</xref>). Few studies have been reported, however, that provide a controlled evaluation of multiple component reading remediation programs with these specific instructional emphases.</p>
<p>The problem is particularly acute when the instructional needs of older students with RD are considered; there is a need for comprehensive effective remedial reading programs for adolescents with RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219410371678">Fisher, Schumaker, &amp; Deshler, 2002</xref>). Meta-analyses of prior research on improving the reading and reading comprehension skills of students with RD have confirmed the superiority of remediation programs that combine direct instruction and strategy-based instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022219410371678">Swanson, Hoskyn, &amp; Lee, 1999</xref>). In the following section, we review what is known about how to address the remedial needs of struggling readers in their middle and high school years.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022219410371678">
<title>What Is Needed to Improve Reading and Text Comprehension in Older Disabled Readers?</title>
<p>Struggling readers in high school frequently exhibit sizeable gaps in their decoding abilities and letter–sound knowledge. Persistent deficits in basic word identification skills require direct remediation of phonologically based reading skills, systematic and explicit instruction in letter–sound and letter cluster–sound mappings, and reinforcement of word identification learning through ample text reading practice using controlled decodable reading vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219410371678">Rayner, Foorman, Perfetti, Pesetsky, &amp; Seidenberg, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Converging evidence has demonstrated that significant improvement on measures of basic reading skill can be achieved for both elementary-school-age disabled readers and young children at risk for reading disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219410371678">Foorman, Francis, Fletcher, Schatschneider, &amp; Mehta, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219410371678">Lovett, Lacerenza, Borden, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022219410371678">Lovett, Steinbach, &amp; Frijters, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219410371678">Olson, Wise, Ring, &amp; Johnson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022219410371678">Torgesen, Wagner, &amp; Rashotte, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0022219410371678">Vellutino et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0022219410371678">Wise, Ring, Sessions, &amp; Olson, 1997</xref>). Less evidence exists, however, on the effective treatment of reading problems in adolescence. Favorable results from our earlier research demonstrate that reading gains from remedial programs <italic>can</italic> be achieved in older elementary-school-aged children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219410371678">Lovett &amp; Steinbach, 1997</xref>) and in struggling readers in seventh and eighth grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219410371678">Lovett et al., 1996</xref>). These data suggest that intensive remedial training can lead to positive outcomes for adolescents.</p>
<p>Research is required to specifically demonstrate whether systematic remedial interventions at the high school level can be effective. An evidence base, including more randomized controlled trial (RCT) results, is needed to guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive effective remedial reading programs for disabled readers in the high school environment. The first large-scale RCT study of this type has been undertaken in the United States—the Enhanced Reading Opportunities Study (ERO) conducted by the U.S. Department of Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219410371678">Corrin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219410371678">Kemple et al., 2008</xref>). The sample for this study included cohorts of ninth grade students with reading comprehension test scores 2 to 5 years behind grade level. The ERO evaluation randomly assigned eligible high schools to one of two supplemental literacy programs and eligible students within these schools to the literacy intervention or to a control condition (participation in a regular ninth grade elective course). The two interventions were Reading Apprenticeship Academic Literacy Course, developed by WestEd, and Xtreme Reading, developed by the University of Kansas Center for Research on Learning, the former far less scripted and directed than the latter. The proximal outcome of interest was performance on the GRADE (Group Reading Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0022219410371678">Williams, 2001</xref>), and rigorous fidelity and implementation data were being collected in this research. Overall findings revealed modest improvement in students' reading comprehension scores and academic grades over the ninth grade year (effect sizes of 0.09 and 0.07), but no continued benefit after the ERO programs ended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022219410371678">Somers et al., 2010</xref>). More well-designed RCTs of this type are needed to address literacy learning issues in the high school population. One of the positive features of the ERO study is the attempt to provide a meaningful period of intervention; although not all ERO schools were ready to start the program at the beginning of the school year, the intent was to provide these supplemental literacy programs for almost a full school year.</p>
<p>Much research has been conducted regarding the acquisition of basic decoding and oral reading skills in younger students with RD, but much remains to be learned about remediation of the accompanying fluency and reading comprehension problems. Disabled readers are known to struggle with text structure and the complex comprehension demands of reading in context. High school disabled readers are particularly challenged by the level and type of comprehension processing required for reading in different courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022219410371678">Scruggs &amp; Mastropieri, 2004</xref>): High school texts are typically far more abstract, dense, and complicated than the types of text encountered in the elementary and middle grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219410371678">Apthorp &amp; Clark, 2007</xref>). Printed text provides none of the prosodic and nonverbal cues that facilitate oral language comprehension, and many students need explicit instruction on written cues and signals to meaning in text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219410371678">Carlisle &amp; Rice, 2002</xref>). Many disabled readers are handicapped by a deficient or poorly organized knowledge base with respect to text structure and text conventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219410371678">Armbruster, Anderson, &amp; Ostertag, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219410371678">Lovett et al., 1996</xref>) and appear to have difficulty in their selection and use of specific reading strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219410371678">Brown &amp; Campione, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022219410371678">R. E. Snow &amp; Lohman, 1984</xref>) and in their ability to monitor strategy implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219410371678">Carlisle &amp; Rice, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219410371678">Chan, Cole, &amp; Barfett, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Comprehension strategy instruction has been identified as one of the most effective interventions to improve the comprehension of students with RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219410371678">Forness, Kavale, Blum, &amp; Lloyd, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219410371678">Kamil, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219410371678">NRP, 2000</xref>) and is considered most effective when it focuses on the use of <italic>metacognition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219410371678">Malone &amp; Mastropieri, 1992</xref>) and <italic>attributional retraining</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219410371678">Borkowski, Weyhing, &amp; Carr, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022219410371678">Schunk &amp; Rice, 1992</xref>) and includes ample opportunities for <italic>practice and generalization</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219410371678">Pressley, Goodchild, Fleet, Zajchowski, &amp; Evans, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219410371678">Pressley, Johnson, Symons, McGoldrick, &amp; Kurita, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219410371678">Pressley &amp; Wharton-McDonald, 1997</xref>). Effective strategy implementation requires understanding of the strategies, including when and why to use them in comprehending text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219410371678">Mason, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022219410371678">Sinatra, Brown, &amp; Reynolds, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0022219410371678">Vaughn et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet relatively little evidence exists evaluating the efficacy of strategy instruction for high school students who are struggling with reading comprehension. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219410371678">Apthorp and Clark (2007)</xref> undertook an extensive review of the literature seeking well-designed studies that evaluated strategy instruction as a means of helping struggling high school students improve their reading comprehension. Only a single study could be identified as relevant and sufficiently rigorous to report. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219410371678">Fuchs, Fuchs, and Kazdan (1999)</xref> evaluated the impact of peer-assisted learning strategies on the reading comprehension skills of struggling high school students. Peer-assisted learning strategies were associated with a positive change of 13 percentile points on average on an experimental reading measure, an effect that failed to reach significance in the study but which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219410371678">Apthorp and Clark (2007)</xref> considered “substantively important and positive” based on the standards of the What Works Clearinghouse. A more recent meta-analysis by Edmonds and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219410371678">Edmonds, Vaughn, Wexler, Reutebuch, Cable, Tackett, &amp; Schnakenberg, 2009</xref>) found that explicit instruction in comprehension practices and strategies was associated with improved reading comprehension by older struggling readers. This meta-analysis included studies of participants from middle school and high school. Another meta-analysis report, however, has suggested that effect sizes are larger overall on studies with middle school struggling readers than on those with high school participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022219410371678">Scammacca, Roberts, Vaughn, Edmonds, Wexler, Reutebuch, &amp; Torgesen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, the efficacy of short-term reading remediation for high school students with reading disabilities is examined. A sample of struggling readers in high school, referred by school staff, were assessed to determine their reading disability status. Students meeting low achievement criteria for reading disability were assigned to a semester of reading remediation using a research-based intervention or to a waiting list control condition. The reading program offered a combination of strategy instruction in word identification and text comprehension processes and phonologically based remediation of decoding skills. In the second semester, control students participated in the reading intervention. All participants were assessed on reading and reading-related skills at the beginning and end of the semester. Intervention participants were assessed also at a 1-year follow-up. This quasi-experimental study was designed to assess whether meaningful gains could be demonstrated following a short-term remediation program for disabled adolescent readers. It was asked whether phonologically based decoding skills were still amenable to intervention in adolescence or whether reading rate and reading comprehension performance were more likely to be affected. Finally, if remediation was associated with improved reading skill, it was asked whether benefits would differ for students who varied in phonological processing skill, receptive vocabulary, or primary language status at entry.</p>

Participating schools were selected by school district administrators to allow equal geographical representation across the city, with first priority given to schools with the greatest academic need. The schools represented a cross-section of socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds as confirmed by school district demographic data.</p>
<p>Students were referred to the study by teachers concerned about their reading achievement. Many of the study participants received intervention in their first year of high school; referral of these students was made by their eighth grade teachers and school administrators.</p>
<p>After receiving written consent from a parent or legal guardian and verbal assent from the student, a brief screening assessment of the student’s word identification, word attack, passage comprehension, and receptive vocabulary skills was conducted by research psychometrists from the Learning Disabilities Research Program (LDRP) of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. To qualify for participation, students had to score 1 standard deviation or more below age norm expectations (standard score [SS] ≤ 85) on the averaged standard score obtained from three of four reading achievement tests (<italic>Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests–Revised</italic> [WRMT-R] Word Identification, Word Attack, and Passage Comprehension subtests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0022219410371678">Woodcock, 1987]</xref>; <italic>Wide Range Achievement Test</italic>, 3rd ed. Reading subtest, Blue Form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0022219410371678">Wilkinson, 1993]</xref>). Across the four screening measures, 74.6% of qualifying participants had standard scores less than 90 on all four measures, and 91.5% of qualifying participants had standard scores less than 90 on three out of four measures. Of the 8.5% of participants with standard scores less than 90 on fewer than three measures, significant delays were observed on one or two measures (<italic>M</italic> = 78.2, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.7). Analyses reported below were conducted both with and without these participants, and model results were substantively equivalent. English language learner (ELL) students who had been in Canada for less than 2 years were not included in the sample. Students were classified as ELL if the primary language spoken at home with their parents when they were first learning to speak was a language other than English. This classification is similar to that used in a large Canadian longitudinal study of first- and second-language learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219410371678">Lipka &amp; Siegel, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A total of 351 students meeting criteria for reading disability participated in this research. Overall, participants were 14.7 years of age at entry (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.8). Within the full sample, students in their ninth grade year composed 197 students in the intervention group and 71 students in the control group. The sample included 164 females and 187 males. A total of 191 students were coded as English as a first language (EFL; 54.4%), and 160 students were coded as ELL (45.6%).</p>
<p>The sample included a group of adolescent struggling readers who replicated substantial achievement deficits on the standardized reading measures. Overall, their average reading performance was between 1.5 and 2 standard deviations below age expectations at program entry (WRMT-R Word Attack <italic>M</italic> SS = 74.3, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.4; WRMT-R Word Identification <italic>M</italic> SS = 71.5, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.5; WRMT-R Passage Comprehension <italic>M</italic> SS = 73.1, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.5). Their receptive vocabulary skills were on average a full standard deviation below age norm expectations (<italic>Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test</italic> [PPVT-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219410371678">Dunn &amp; Dunn, 1997]</xref> <italic>M</italic> SS = 84.2, <italic>SD</italic> = 13.7). Their phonological blending skills, assessed at pretest, were similarly below age expectations (<italic>Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processes</italic> [CTOPP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0022219410371678">Wagner, Torgesen, &amp; Rashotte, 1999]</xref> Blending Words <italic>M</italic> scaled score = 7.3, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.9).

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>The study was quasi-experimental in that randomization of participants to the treatment or control condition was contaminated. The control group consisted of students scheduled to receive the PHAST PACES program in the second semester of the school year. Because students received a course credit for participation in the PHAST PACES program, assignment to the intervention classes was ultimately under the control of secondary school personnel responsible for arranging student courses in the first and second semester and generating individual timetables for each student. There was a bias by high school staff to get as many struggling readers as possible into the intervention program in the first semester of the school year.</p>
<p>Despite that fact, there were no significant differences between the PHAST PACES and the control samples in level of reading underachievement at entry. The only differences revealed from <italic>t</italic> tests on entry descriptive statistics involved the proportion of EFL and ELL students assigned to treatment versus the waiting list control condition: More EFL than ELL students were assigned to the waiting list, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03. In addition, students who qualified for the study beyond ninth grade were more likely to be assigned to the intervention condition than to the waiting list condition, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 5.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02.</p>
<p>PHAST PACES students were instructed in small classes of 5 to 10 students, all of whom met the inclusion criteria described above. The program was taught as a regular course (usually an Essentials or Locally Developed English course), and students received a credit for its successful completion. Although the complete PHAST PACES program is approximately 80 hours, the students in this study completed only 60 to 70 hours of instruction. The PHAST PACES instructors were English or Special Education resource teachers in the participating high schools specially trained and mentored to deliver the program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022219410371678">
<title>Teacher Training</title>
<p>All teachers were trained to implement the program through professional development training that was spread over two semesters (September to June). On-site visits to the teacher’s class were an essential component of the training model. Senior teachers from the LDRP served as mentor teachers under the direction of the second author. The mentor teachers are experienced in teaching the intervention and have trained and mentored teachers in our previous research. Mentor teachers conducted the 8 to 10 days of in-service training, typically in workshop format, and visited each teacher’s PHAST PACES class regularly to observe program implementation, provide constructive feedback, model new program content, and offer ongoing support. Regular on-site visits by the mentor teachers were considered an essential component of the professional development model as studies have demonstrated that the attrition of skills following in-service training is significant and has been reported to be as high as 85% within 3 weeks of training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219410371678">Fox, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The training model for PHAST PACES teachers has been described in detail in a separate report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219410371678">Lovett, Lacerenza, et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>The Reading Intervention Program: PHAST PACES</title>
<p>The PHAST PACES program integrates word identification and text comprehension strategy instruction. The program offers a decoding track (the PHAST Track) and two integrated comprehension tracks, the Text Knowledge and Comprehension Strategy Tracks. These two instructional comprehension tracks can be taught in parallel with the PHAST Decoding Program or independently, according to the needs of the instructional group. The three tracks are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022219410371678">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The Phonological and Orthographic Knowledge (or Decoding) Track (Track 1) teaches students five specific word identification strategies along with a metacognitive organizational plan that supports flexible strategy application. The word identification strategies are Sounding Out, Rhyming, Peeling Off, Vowel Alert, and Spy. The Text Knowledge Track focuses on understanding the structure of narrative, expository, and graphical texts at both micro and macro levels of written language structure. Students learn to recognize specific text features and signaling devices that authors use and learn how to use these signals to increase their understanding of what they are reading. Lessons include work on signaling devices, sources of confusion, elements of plot, organizational text structures, text mapping, and text coherence. The skills taught and practiced in the Text Knowledge Track serve as springboards to the comprehension strategies taught in the Comprehension Strategy Track. The two tracks are sequentially integrated to allow prerequisite training and smooth transition among the strategies taught. The Comprehension Strategy Track introduces five specific text comprehension strategies (<italic>P</italic>redicting, <italic>A</italic>ctivating Prior Knowledge, <italic>C</italic>larifying, <italic>E</italic>valuating Through Questioning, and <italic>S</italic>ummarizing [PACES]) and is taught with ongoing instruction in strategy monitoring and evaluation.</p>
<p>Instructional features to promote learning and transfer of learning are inherent to the three tracks. Lessons combine direct instruction and dialogue-based metacognitive training, present material in a sequential and structured manner, and teach all prerequisite skills to mastery. The metacognitive instruction is scaffolded and teaches explicit self-monitoring and evaluation skills. Each lesson includes guided and independent practice and offers diverse lessonware and text materials. Secondary school curricular materials and texts appropriate for adolescents and young adults are used in the program. In the greater Toronto area, efforts were made to meet the ninth grade Ministry of Education expectations for literacy in the province of Ontario.</p>
<p>In the PHAST PACES program, there is an attempt to include all of the instructional, implementation, metacognitive, and contextual features identified to be important from previous efficacy studies with older struggling readers. PHAST PACES provides explicit instruction on multiple aspects and dimensions of text structure <italic>and</italic> explicit instruction on the best validated text comprehension strategies and how to apply them and monitor their success. As with the PHAST word identification strategy instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219410371678">Lovett, Lacerenza, &amp; Borden, 2000</xref>), preskills are taught to facilitate effective strategy learning, strategy application, and strategy monitoring. Some of these preskills include specific teaching about text structures and detailed vocabulary instruction and elaborations. Comprehension strategies are directly explained and modeled through a scaffolding and mentorship model adapted from reciprocal teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219410371678">Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984</xref>). Small instructional groups allow the inclusion of cooperative learning experiences. Finally, metacognitive training on comprehension monitoring and attributional retraining components are woven into the dialogue structures used in strategy acquisition and application.</p>
<sec id="section7-0022219410371678">
<title>Track 1: The Phonological and Orthographic Knowledge (or PHAST Decoding)</title>
<p>Track. In an earlier report, we have described a research-based intervention, PHAST Reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219410371678">Lovett, Lacerenza, &amp; Borden, 2000</xref>), designed to remediate the phonological and decoding deficits of struggling readers and to teach a set of word identification strategies that allow them to become independent successful decoders. Intended for small groups of struggling readers from first grade to eighth grade, the PHAST program was designed based on findings from our previous research that better outcomes and faster learning resulted when disabled readers received both phonologically based and strategy-based instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219410371678">Lovett, Lacerenza, Borden, et al., 2000</xref>). The program has been demonstrated to be effective for children of different IQ levels and socioeconomic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219410371678">Morris et al., 2010</xref>) and for children for whom English is a second language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219410371678">Lovett, De Palma, et al., 2008</xref>). Track 1 of the PHAST PACES program was developed as a more senior level of PHAST, based on speculation that the same programming principles may be relevant to struggling readers in high school who have gaps in letter–sound knowledge and for whom decoding is still a challenge.</p>
<p>To encourage generalization of the skills and strategies taught, content-related word analysis and identification activities offer challenging vocabulary that students may encounter in their high school courses. Challenge words are drawn from ninth and tenth grade textbooks in biology, chemistry, mathematics, photography, technology, auto mechanics, geography, and accounting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022219410371678">
<title>The Comprehension Tracks</title>
<p>Tracks 2 and 3 of the PHAST PACES program focus on teaching students explicit text comprehension strategies for both narrative and expository texts. These two tracks are closely integrated and are taught together. The Text Knowledge Track teaches the skills required for successful application of the five comprehension strategies introduced in the Comprehension Strategy Track. Comprehension instruction (PACES) can run in parallel with the decoding lessons (PHAST) by giving each equal time within the program lesson hour or can be added at a later time or run separately. The goal of the PACES lessons is to help students become purposeful and active readers by applying specific comprehension strategies on a variety of text materials and with different types of text formats.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022219410371678">
<title>Track 2: The Text Knowledge Track</title>
<p>The Text Knowledge Track lessons are designed to help the students understand the author’s plan for a text—why the author selects particular words, sentences, and paragraphs and how this facilitates understanding of the information presented.</p>
<p>Students are taught the various signaling devices used by authors and how these signals can help the reader to make predictions, set reading goals, activate prior knowledge, identify organizational plans, and focus on important information. Lessons in Track 2 introduce structural text analysis at the micro (signaling devices, sources of confusion, and questioning skills) and macro (narrative and expository organizational text structures, text unity and coherence) levels. Students are exposed to a variety of texts and learn that they must bring a separate set of skills to narrative, expository, and other text genres. All of the skills taught in Track 2 are necessary for successful application of the five comprehension strategies, and the scaffolded nature of the program ensures that these prerequisite skills are in place before each strategy is introduced in the Comprehension Strategy Track.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022219410371678">
<title>Track 3: The Comprehension Strategy Track</title>
<p>As the skills from the Text Knowledge Track are acquired, the five comprehension strategies together with self-monitoring and evaluative skills are taught in parallel. The strategies, <italic>P</italic>redicting, <italic>A</italic>ctivating Prior Knowledge, <italic>C</italic>larifying, <italic>E</italic>valuating Through Questioning, and <italic>S</italic>ummarizing (PACES), have been designed to reflect the processes used by skilled readers to access a text’s meaning. A metacognitive PACES Plan prompts the use of all the strategies, and guides and supports students through the application of each comprehension strategy with specific dialogue or scripts. The goal of the PACES Plan is to have students become independent, active, and self-regulated readers as they work with confidence on a variety of text materials.</p>
<p>Instruction in the PHAST PACES program employs both direct explanation and a strategy instruction model, wherein dialogue and scaffolded student-teacher interaction are key instructional features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219410371678">Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984</xref>). The students first experience the comprehension strategies when an expert reader, the teacher, models the strategies, thinking aloud as he or she reads. The teacher’s self-talk serves as a script that students acquire to guide their application of the strategies. Strategy instruction is highly scaffolded; the teacher instructs one strategy at a time, models and reviews strategy dialogue daily, provides individual instruction and ongoing support, reinforces successful strategy use and provides corrective feedback, and adjusts and fades prompts gradually over time. Providing strategy dialogue and scaffolded, contextual instruction encourages students to apply the strategies independently and to generalize strategy use to other texts and settings.</p>
<p>Text reading follows a general format. Teacher and students, one at a time, read sections of the text and model application of the strategies as required. If a reader has difficulty with execution of a particular strategy, then the teacher, as a coach, prompts and supports the student. Students use their PACES Plan to guide themselves through predicting, activating prior knowledge, clarifying, evaluating through questioning, and summarizing. Narrative and expository reading selections of varying length are drawn from the ninth and tenth grade curriculum and other sources; novels are integrated once students reach a level of strategic proficiency. More details about the program are provided in the Appendix.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section11-0022219410371678">
<title>Test Measures</title>
<p>All PHAST PACES students were individually assessed before and after their program on a battery of experimental and standardized measures; control students were assessed at comparable time points. The WRMT-R reading subtests were administered as pre- and posttest measures, as were the Blending Words subtest of the CTOPP, the Sound Combinations subtest of the <italic>Sound-Symbol Test</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219410371678">Lovett et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219410371678">Lovett, Lacerenza, Borden, et al., 2000</xref>), and the <italic>Challenge Words Test</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219410371678">Lovett et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219410371678">Lovett, Lacerenza, Borden, et al., 2000</xref>). The experimental measures have been used in previous intervention studies conducted by our group, have been revealed to be sensitive measures of change in reading-related processes, and have been established to demonstrate sound psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219410371678">Cirino et al., 2002</xref>). The Sound Combinations task requires students to provide pronunciations for a set of 30 letter cluster sounds (prompting for alternate pronunciations when appropriate) including vowel digraphs (<italic>ee, oa, ai, igh</italic>), diphthongs (<italic>oo, oy, oi, ou</italic>), and vowel-controlled consonants (<italic>ge, gi, ce, ci</italic>). The Challenge Words are difficult multisyllabic words that are not introduced in the PHAST PACES classes (e.g., <italic>disenfranchised, unpretentious, uninhabitable</italic>). The remedial outcome battery was composed of standardized measures of reading achievement and experimental measures of remedial response and generalization of learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022219410371678">
<title>Fidelity of Implementation</title>
<p>Fidelity of program implementation was monitored in several ways. All PHAST PACES teachers were trained by senior research teachers who followed training guidelines that specified methods for delivery of instructional content and a timeline for introducing particular skills. Teacher fidelity was checked a minimum of four times during the 70 hours of programming for every instructional group. In addition, PHAST PACES teachers completed a lesson diary on a daily basis. In the diary, teachers recorded the content and strategies introduced and practiced each day, the activities completed, and the student responses. Diaries were reviewed for fidelity checks and to allow determination of the number of lessons completed, number of comprehension strategies introduced, time spent on narrative and expository texts, and so on.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0022219410371678" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The results are described in two sections below. Treatment and control group comparisons were evaluated through a set of hierarchical linear models comparing outcomes and growth for students in the two conditions; these analyses included 268 PHAST PACES and 83 control participants. The long-term impact of the intervention was assessed in a second set of models, including in these hierarchical models only those 197 PHAST PACES participants who contributed pretest, midpoint, posttest, and 1-year follow-up data. Follow-up data were not available on the control participants who crossed over into the intervention condition following posttesting at 70 hours. The outcomes of interest in this design included the three standardized WRMT-R reading subtests and the two experimental measures (Sound Combinations, Challenge Words).</p>
<p>The design of the present intervention models included three hierarchically nested levels: (a) repeated measurement of reading outcomes, (b) individual students, and (c) instructional groups, acknowledging that potential variability in final outcomes and rate of growth might vary by individual student and/or by instructional group. In cases of repeated measurement involving more than two time points, growth curve modeling provides more robust estimates of change over time than either ANCOVA models or difference score calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219410371678">Rogosa, Brandt, &amp; Zimowski, 1982</xref>). The present design, like many intervention designs, also involves hierarchical nesting with instructional group. In the presence of any significant intraclass correlation at higher levels of nesting, analyses using posttest–pretest difference scores cannot account for the effect of this nesting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219410371678">Bryk &amp; Raudenbush, 1987</xref>). Based on both considerations, the present analysis utilizes multilevel growth curve models. In the case of both intervention and follow-up outcomes, model specification followed the heuristic guidelines found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022219410371678">Snijders and Bosker (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022219410371678">Singer and Willet (2003)</xref>. Random effects were evaluated first, followed by the inclusion of a set of fixed effect predictors, with additional model specification to optimize fit.</p>
<sec id="section14-0022219410371678">
<title>Assessing the Efficacy of PHAST PACES: Intervention and Control Comparisons</title>
<p>A common set of predictors was established to evaluate individual differences in treatment outcomes in the models: These included intervention condition (PHAST PACES or waiting list control), age, sex, receptive vocabulary (raw scores on the PPVT-III), and phonological blending (raw scores on the CTOPP Blending Words subtest). Because the model explicitly included age as a predictor, other predictors were incorporated as raw scores rather than age-normed standardized scores. Including both predictors allowed the model to evaluate an overall developmental effect, along with the effect of absolute vocabulary and phonological awareness skill levels. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022219410371678">Table 1</xref> includes the preintervention means and standard deviations of each predictor with the exception of sex (53.3% male). Each of these predictors represents scores obtained prior to the start of intervention, and each predictor was grand-mean centered prior to inclusion in the models. During model fitting, predictors of final status were retained for every model, but only significant predictors of change in reading skills over time were retained to ensure the most parsimonious model of skill growth. Results from the most parsimonious models for each outcome measure are summarized below and detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022219410371678">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Overall, significant intrastudent variation in final status at posttest was observed across all outcome measures (all σ<sup>2</sup>
<sub>0</sub> at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), indicating that students varied systematically in final reading ability. For the two experimental outcome measures related to program content or strategies, Sound Combinations and Challenge Words, significant variation was observed in both final status (Sound Combinations σ<sup>2</sup>
<sub>1</sub> = 6.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Challenge Words σ<sup>2</sup>
<sub>1</sub> = 79.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and rate of growth (Sound Combinations σ<sup>2</sup>
<sub>2</sub> = 0.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; Challenge Words σ<sup>2</sup>
<sub>2</sub> = 2.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), indicating meaningful group-to-group variation in both final reading ability and rate of growth.</p>
<p>Results from the models of Word Attack standard scores as the outcome measure revealed significant fixed effects for intervention condition, γ<sub>01</sub> = 6.45, <italic>t</italic>(345) = −4.23, linear growth, γ<sub>10</sub> = 3.96, <italic>t</italic>(617) = 17.56, and the interaction of these effects, γ<sub>11</sub> = 2.93, <italic>t</italic>(617) = −6.32, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .0001. The PHAST PACES students on average grew at a rate of 4 standard scores per testing point and at the end of the semester were approximately 6.5 standard scores ahead of the control participants. Of the control variables, only CTOPP Blending Words revealed a significant fixed effect, γ<sub>05</sub> = 1.05, <italic>t</italic>(345) = 5.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001; higher Blending scores at pretest were associated with better Word Attack outcomes, but there was no interaction of Blending with intervention condition or with growth.</p>
<p>Similar results were obtained from the models of Word Identification standard scores as outcomes. Intervention condition, γ<sub>01</sub> = 4.03, <italic>t</italic>(345) = −2.6, growth, γ<sub>10</sub> = 2.01, <italic>t</italic>(617) = 11.65, and their interaction, γ<sub>11</sub> = 1.45, <italic>t</italic>(617) = −4.09, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001, produced significant fixed effects. PHAST PACES students gained on average 4 standard scores per testing point and ended the program significantly ahead of the control students. Age, γ<sub>02</sub> = −4.69, <italic>t</italic>(345) = −5.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, produced a significant fixed effect, with younger participants having an advantage on Word Identification posttest outcomes. Receptive vocabulary, PPVT γ<sub>04</sub> = 0.12, <italic>t</italic>(345) = 3.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and CTOPP Blending Words, γ<sub>05</sub> = 0.57, <italic>t</italic>(345) = 3.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .003, produced significant fixed effects in the model, but the magnitude of their coefficients was small.</p>
<p>Models for Passage Comprehension standard scores revealed fixed effects for intervention condition, γ<sub>01</sub> = −4.32, <italic>t</italic>(344) = −3.98, growth, γ<sub>10</sub> = 3.86, <italic>t</italic>(614) = 12.45, and their interaction, γ<sub>11</sub> = 2.24, <italic>t</italic>(614) = −4.09, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001. PHAST PACES students gained on average almost 4.5 standard scores per testing point and finished the program significantly ahead of the control group students. Sex, γ<sub>03</sub> = −3.97, <italic>t</italic>(344) = −4.00, and receptive vocabulary, γ<sub>04</sub> = 0.32, <italic>t</italic>(344) = 11.19, both <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001, produced significant fixed effects, with female students at an advantage on posttest Passage Comprehension scores and children with better receptive vocabulary at pretest also at an advantage. Similarly, age, γ<sub>02</sub> = −1.97, <italic>t</italic>(344) = 2.94, and CTOPP Blending, γ<sub>05</sub> = 0.42, <italic>t</italic>(344) = 2.82, both <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01, produced significant fixed effects, with younger children and children with better blending scores achieving superior posttest scores.</p>
<p>The two experimental outcome measures, Sound Combinations and Challenge Words, assessed change on treatment-related dimensions of sound–symbol learning and multisyllabic word identification. Both measures demonstrated robust fixed effects for intervention condition, γ<sub>01</sub> = 7.35 and 15.18, <italic>t</italic>(10) = −8.86 and −5.27, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001, growth, γ<sub>10</sub> = 3.07 and 6.96, <italic>t</italic>(733) = 18.84 and 22.35, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001, and their interaction, γ<sub>11</sub> = 2.96 and 3.31, <italic>t</italic>(733) = −8.67 and −5.21, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01. PHAST PACES students acquired sound symbol correspondences at a rate of 3 more per testing point and finished the program almost 7.5 items ahead of the control students. Similarly PHAST PACES students were able to correctly identify 7 more multisyllabic Challenge Words every testing point and finished the program more than 15 words ahead of the controls. CTOPP sound blending produced significant fixed effects on both measures, γ<sub>05</sub> = 0.15 and 0.75, <italic>t</italic>(733) = 3.35 and 2.81, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01. Children with better sound blending skills at pretest enjoyed a posttest advantage on both experimental measures. CTOPP sound blending also interacted with rate of growth over time (γ<sub>13</sub> = −0.07 and -0.16, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05), but the pattern of the effect was different. Children with poorer sound blending skills demonstrated relatively greater growth on these measures although the size of the coefficients was small. Receptive vocabulary produced a fixed effect for Challenge Words at posttest, β = .12, <italic>t</italic>(803) = 2.54, <italic>p</italic> = .01; higher PPVT scores were associated with better Challenge Words scores at posttest, although again the effect was a modest one.</p>
<p>To summarize this set of models, for every outcome, PHAST PACES students achieved higher posttest scores than control students (all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001, with parameters ranging from a 4.03 WRMT-R Word Identification standard score advantage to a 15.18 Challenge Words advantage). Age was associated with posttest status as well: Younger students finished the intervention with higher standard scores on WRMT-R Word Identification and Passage Comprehension. Better developed receptive vocabulary and phonological blending skills at entry were also associated with higher final status across three and five reading outcomes, respectively. Participation in the PHAST PACES intervention was associated with a greater rate of increase in reading skill across all five outcome measures, and these were robust effects. The intervention advantage in per time point skill growth ranged from 1.45 (γ<sub>11</sub>, WRMT-R Word Identification SS) to 3.31 (γ<sub>11</sub> Challenge Words). On the two program-related outcomes (Sound Combinations and Challenge Word reading), lower initial phonological blending ability was associated with greater rates of skill growth. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022219410371678">Table 3</xref> includes model-derived estimates for pretest, midtest, and posttest scores for both intervention and control participants on the five reading outcome measures reported. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022219410371678">Figure 2</xref> depicts change on these model-derived performance estimates over the intervention period by intervention and control groups on the WRMT-R Word Attack and Passage Comprehension subtests.</p>

<title>Effect Sizes for Intervention Outcomes</title>
<p>Effect sizes (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) for the difference in mean outcomes for PHAST PACES versus control students were calculated using the model-predicted post-intervention values for each outcome measure. The average effect size was 0.68 across all measures. The effects ranged from large effects for intervention-related outcomes (Sound Combinations <italic>d</italic> = 1.91) to medium effects for complex multisyllabic word reading (Challenge Test <italic>d</italic> = 0.57) and nonword reading (WRMT-R Word Attack SS <italic>d</italic> = 0.45). Smaller effects were observed for single-word identification (WRMT-R Word Identification SS <italic>d</italic> = 0.15) and comprehension outcomes (WRMT-R Passage Comprehension SS <italic>d</italic> = 0.34). Because there is not consensus on the calculation of effect sizes in multilevel models, especially for fixed effect predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022219410371678">Roberts &amp; Monaco, 2006</xref>), effect sizes were also calculated for the PHAST PACES–control difference in growth <italic>rates</italic> through the intervention period. Effect sizes were calculated via the <italic>t</italic>-statistic for the Growth × Group fixed effect parameter. The sizes of these effects were similar (<italic>M d</italic> = 0.66) to those observed when using postintervention means as the basis for effect size (Sound Combinations <italic>d</italic> = 1.01, Challenge Test <italic>d</italic> = 0.61, WRMT-R Word Attack <italic>d</italic> = 0.74, WRMT-R Word Identification <italic>d</italic> = 0.48, WRMT-R Passage Comprehension <italic>d</italic> = 0.48).</p>

<title>Long-Term Efficacy: Intervention Follow-Up Findings</title>
<p>The second set of hierarchical models included only those 197 PHAST PACES participants who contributed pretest, midpoint, posttest, and 1-year follow-up data. The additional time point provided by the follow-up assessment afforded greater complexity in the random effects portion of the models, allowing for the incorporation of group-level random effects and associated group-level fixed effects. The same student-level predictors that were used in the intervention outcome models (age, sex, receptive vocabulary, and phonological blending) were also incorporated into the follow-up models. In addition, two instructional group-level predictors were included: (a) instructional group size and (b) whether the teacher of that instructional group had previous experience teaching the PHAST PACES program. Follow-up data were collected on four of the five reading outcomes assessed above, the three WRMT-R subtests and the experimental Challenge Words measure. Results from analyses of these four follow-up measures are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022219410371678">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022219410371678">Figure 3</xref>, the 1-year follow-up period, from posttest to follow-up testing, was characterized by an average trend to deceleration. On three of the four outcomes, the intervention gains observed from pre- to posttest flattened out in the year from posttest to follow-up assessments; this observation is confirmed in the deceleration coefficients γ<sub>20</sub> recorded in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022219410371678">Table 4</xref>. One follow-up measure did not demonstrate deceleration effects, however: No overall deceleration occurred for scores on the Passage Comprehension outcome, and no fixed effects for quadratic change were revealed in the follow-up models for Passage Comprehension. On Word Attack, Word Identification, and Challenge Words outcomes, fixed effects were revealed for the deceleration coefficients, γ<sub>20</sub> = −8.89, <italic>t</italic>(583) = 6.54, −4.32, <italic>t</italic>(584) = 4.02, and −15.80, <italic>t</italic>(716) = 10.53, respectively, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Patterns similar to the pre- to posttest outcome models were observed for predictors of follow-up status at follow-up. Age was a negative predictor of final status, with younger students having higher standard scores on WRMT-R Word Identification, γ<sub>02</sub> = −2.56, <italic>t</italic>(190) = 2.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and Passage Comprehension, γ<sub>02</sub> = −2.45, <italic>t</italic>(191) = 2.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, at the time of follow-up assessment. Across all outcome measures except WRMT-R Word Attack, higher initial receptive vocabulary was associated with superior reading skills at follow-up, ranging from WRMT-R Word Identification, γ<sub>04</sub> = 0.08, <italic>t</italic>(190) = 2.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, to WRMT-R Passage Comprehension SS, γ<sub>04</sub> = 0.27, <italic>t</italic>(191) = 8.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Similarly, across all outcome measures higher phonological blending skills were associated with greater follow-up skills, ranging from WRMT-R Passage Comprehension, γ<sub>05</sub> = 0.54, <italic>t</italic>(191) = 2.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, to Challenge Words Test, γ<sub>05</sub> = 1.23, <italic>t</italic>(716) = 3.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Stronger phonological blending skills prior to intervention were associated with greater growth rates on the Challenge Test, γ<sub>13</sub> = 0.93, <italic>t</italic>(716) = 2.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; likewise, greater receptive vocabulary was associated with greater growth rates on WRMT-R Word Attack standard scores over the whole pretest to follow-up period, γ<sub>13</sub> = 0.14, <italic>t</italic>(583) = 2.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>The greater complexity of the follow-up hierarchical models permitted an initial examination of implementation variables that may influence outcomes. In general, a somewhat complex set of associations between teachers’ experience with the intervention (first vs. subsequent PHAST PACES group taught) and instructional group size was observed within the follow-up models. An overall trend was observed for subsequent-taught groups to have a faster growth rate (see γ<sub>14</sub> coefficients for each outcome measure in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022219410371678">Table 4</xref>), with a significant deceleration through the end of intervention and through to the follow-up assessment (see γ<sub>24</sub> coefficients). Larger instructional group size appeared associated with slower growth rates and a more severe deceleration in skill growth, but these effects occurred only for WRMT-R Word Identification outcomes, rate of growth γ<sub>15</sub> = −1.89, <italic>t</italic>(584) = −2.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; deceleration γ<sub>15</sub> = −1.24, <italic>t</italic>(584) = −2.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022219410371678">Table 5</xref> summarizes model-derived performance means for the follow-up sample at each testing point across the four follow-up outcomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent demographic data from Canada and the United States indicate the prevalence and persistence of literacy learning problems among teens and young adults. Yet little evidence exists as to the amenability of reading problems to later intervention and the essential components of effective intervention for this group.</p>
<p>In the present article, we describe a remedial reading program specifically designed to address the decoding, word identification, fluency, and reading comprehension needs of struggling readers who enter high school still lacking basic reading skills. The program is composed of three overarching instructional tracks working on (a) gaps in letter–sound knowledge, strategic word identification, and word identification speed (the Decoding Track); (b) knowledge of text conventions at many different levels of written language structure, from signaling words and anaphoric reference to narrative and expository text structures (the Text Knowledge Track); and (c) acquisition of a set of effective reading comprehension strategies appropriate to a variety of text genres (the Comprehension Strategy Track). Students acquire explicit strategies to guide their responses when faced with unfamiliar decoding or comprehension challenges and a plan for evaluating the success of strategy implementation and what needs to be pursued next to facilitate reading with full and fluent comprehension. The PHAST PACES program is an extension of our earlier research on the components of effective remediation for school-aged children with severe reading disabilities and capitalizes on everything we have learned to date about systematic multiple component intervention for struggling readers of any age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219410371678">Lovett, De Palma, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022219410371678">Lovett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219410371678">Lovett, Lacerenza, &amp; Borden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219410371678">Lovett, Lacerenza, Borden, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219410371678">Morris et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Results from the present evaluation revealed that students who received the PHAST PACES intervention achieved higher posttest scores on all reading outcomes relative to students in the waiting list control group. After 60 to 70 hours of small group intervention, these struggling readers achieved significant and meaningful gains on several indices of reading skill, including standardized measures of word attack, word identification, and passage comprehension. An average effect size of 0.68 was revealed across all measures. Small to medium effect sizes were found on standardized measures of word attack (<italic>d</italic> = 0.45), word reading (<italic>d</italic> = 0.15), and passage comprehension (<italic>d</italic> = 0.34). Larger effect sizes were revealed for experimental measures of letter cluster–sound knowledge (<italic>d</italic> = 1.91) and multisyllabic word identification (<italic>d</italic> = 0.57). Methodologically, larger effect sizes are generally found on “treatment-inherent” measures that assess intervention-specific content and skills in contrast to independent measures that by definition assess uninstructed content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022219410371678">Slavin &amp; Madden, 2008</xref>). Better developed receptive vocabulary and phonological blending skills at entry were associated with higher final status on a majority of reading outcomes. Lower phonological blending skills at entry were associated with greater growth on the experimental measures.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the battery included only one measure of reading comprehension—the Passage Comprehension subtest of the WRMT-R, a cloze measure, which does not measure application of the reading comprehension strategies or the text analysis skills taught in PHAST PACES. Measurement of reading comprehension ability for this population of older readers remains a substantial challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219410371678">Keenan &amp; Betjemann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219410371678">Keenan, Betjemann, &amp; Olson, 2008</xref>). As noted in a recent meta-analysis by Edmonds and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219410371678">2009</xref>), intervention effects demonstrated on training and near-transfer measures with older struggling readers typically do not generalize to more general comprehension measures.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219410371678">Rapp, van den Broek, and colleagues (2007)</xref> argue that the products of comprehension may reveal what a readers knows and understands after a reading activity, but it is the processes of comprehension, “those cognitive activities by which a reader arrives at those products” (p. 291), that are equally if not more informative to comprehension assessment. Comprehension assessment and instruction, however, focus almost exclusively on product-oriented measures (e.g., story recall, answering text-based questions). Much remains to be developed regarding reading comprehension assessment in children and adolescents; future studies with more sensitive measures of reading comprehension performance clearly are needed so that the comprehension components of PHAST PACES can be properly evaluated.</p>
<p>The fact that substantial change was demonstrated on measures tapping phonological reading processes is important because it demonstrates the continued amenability of phonological processing deficits to focused intervention into adolescence. It has been an unfortunate assumption that if students enter high school still lacking basic decoding and literacy skills, other skill areas are more appropriate to target during their secondary school years. In this study, we have demonstrated, however, that even with relatively short-term intervention, high school students <italic>can</italic> improve phonological processing skills, acquire letter–sound knowledge, and gain half a standard deviation on a standardized measure of decoding skill. PHAST PACES students achieved an average gain of 7.9 standard scores on the Word Attack subtest relative to control gains of 2.1 standard scores. This result confirms that the PHAST PACES students made gains sufficient to achieve <italic>some modest</italic> narrowing of the gap with their normally achieving peers. Their gains on a measure of letter–sound knowledge revealed that these students were able to fill in gaps in letter–sound knowledge with directed remediation: PHAST PACES students gained an average of 6.1 scores in their ability to provide correct pronunciations and alternate pronunciations for vowel digraphs (<italic>ee, oa, ai, igh</italic>), diphthongs (<italic>oo, oy, oi, ou</italic>), and vowel-controlled consonants (<italic>ge, gi, ce, ci</italic>), whereas control students demonstrated no change on this measure. The extent of gains on the Challenge Words test affirms that these students can apply their newly acquired skills and word identification strategies to difficult multisyllabic words, many that probably exceed the difficulty level of vocabulary they will encounter in curricular texts (<italic>disconcertingly, recuperative, unpretentious</italic>). These results support the conclusion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219410371678">Joseph and Schisler (2009)</xref> that teaching word reading skills to adolescents can produce positive outcomes on reading achievement.</p>
<p>The greatest average gains in standard scores were observed on Word Attack and Passage Comprehension subtests of the WRMT-R. PHAST PACES participants gained on average 5.86 standard scores more than the control group on Word Attack, 2.91 more on Word Identification, and 4.46 more on Passage Comprehension. To focus on reading comprehension scores, the intervention group gained on average 7.72 standard scores and the control 3.26 standard scores over a one semester period (e.g., September–January or February–June).</p>
<p>The PHAST PACES program as described here offers only one semester of instruction and clearly does not provide sufficient remediation to “close the gap” for adolescent readers functioning many years below grade level. The adolescents participating in this study met low achievement criteria for reading disability and were globally deficient on virtually every dimension of reading skill measured. For these students, subsequent semesters of PHAST PACES remediation would be recommended. A second semester PHAST PACES program has been developed and is being piloted in seven Toronto secondary schools. The second semester program works to consolidate the word identification and comprehension gains of the first semester and to extend the PHAST PACES comprehension instruction both to more complex forms of literature and into the writing domain. Students read informational texts and news reports, study mythology, poetry, and drama, and complete a novel study. Students are taught a metacognitive writing plan, and work through a variety of assigned activities including writing a myth, a journal, a bio-poem, a talk show interview, and a formal essay. The second semester also includes a formal written evaluation component; students keep a metacognitive journal and learn how to prepare and answer exam-type questions and to write for formal written evaluations.</p>
<p>Results to date confirm that it is <italic>not</italic> too late to address basic reading skill deficits in older struggling readers. An instructional framework must be sufficiently comprehensive, intensive, and linguistically informed, however, to remediate the extensive gaps in letter–sound, vocabulary, and text knowledge, the decoding and reading strategy impairments, and the maladaptive reading habits that have accumulated for these students. In addition, it is critical that age-appropriate and engaging text materials be used regardless of the limited decoding skills of the group. Working on basic reading skills is an unappealing task for struggling readers of any age, but particularly for adolescents. Student engagement will depend on many factors—positive instructional group dynamics, affiliation with the teacher, the inclusion of enjoyable texts and activities, and, critically, the students’ perceptions of their own improvement. As one Grade 10 student told us, after PHAST PACES, he could read a chapter book on his own—for the first time.</p>
<p>It is easier to address reading disabilities in the primary grades, but it is important not to abandon the hundreds of thousands of adolescents and young adults who are reading impaired and who will still commit to reading instruction. These young people deserve the opportunities that improved levels of literacy functioning will afford them and the best instruction that can be offered based on current research.</p>

<title>Description of the PHAST PACES Progra</title>
<sec id="section19-0022219410371678">
<title>Track 1: Phonological and Orthographic Knowledge (or Decoding) Track</title>
<p>The PHAST Decoding Track focuses on teaching students effective word identification strategies and integrates phonological and strategy-based reading instruction in a series of 70 half-hour lessons. This instructional track is designed for students with poor or insufficient word attack skills, facilitating their development into flexible strategic readers with the skills and strategies necessary for independent decoding with good reading comprehension.</p>
<p>Five carefully sequenced decoding strategies are taught: a phonological letter–sound decoding strategy (Sounding Out), a word identification-by-analogy strategy (Rhyming; see Note <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022219410371678">1</xref>), a strategy for identifying affixes in multisyllabic words (Peeling Off), a strategy for attempting variable vowel pronunciations (Vowel Alert), and a strategy for seeking familiar parts of unfamiliar words (Spy). Each strategy builds and depends upon the mastery of the previously taught skills and strategies. The rate at which the teacher and students move through the PHAST strategies depends on the prior knowledge that students bring to the program and how quickly they acquire what is presented in the daily lessons. The teacher can adjust his or her lesson plans at any time during the program to meet the learning needs of the group. The goal is to advance the students as far as possible while maintaining a high mastery criterion of the component skills being taught.</p>
<sec id="section20-0022219410371678">
<title>I. Sounding Out Strategy:</title>
<p>To successfully apply the Sounding Out Strategy, students must know (a) all the phonemes and how they are represented in the English language, and (b) how to blend these sounds together to form words. Through explicit direct instruction, these sounds are systematically presented, practiced, and continually reviewed. Daily lessons focus on filling in any gaps that may exist in the students' knowledge and encompass a review of known sounds, correction of poorly articulated sounds, and/or training of unknown sounds. Controlled vocabulary and texts that are read aloud form part of each lesson. Portions of the Corrective Reading Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219410371678">Engelmann et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219410371678">Engelmann, Carnine, &amp; Johnson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219410371678">Engelmann, Meyer, Johnson, &amp; Carnine, 1988</xref>) are used in the Sounding Out section of the program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0022219410371678">
<title>II. Rhyming</title>
<p>For successful application of the Rhyming strategy, students require a number of prerequisite skills including a complete understanding of concepts such as rhyming (words that share the same spelling pattern), spelling pattern (the vowel and what comes after it), keywords (words that represent 120 of the most common spelling patterns in English), and word identification by analogy (“if I know <italic>x</italic>, then I know <italic>y</italic>”). To ensure successful strategy application, students are taught a structured dialogue. As skills and keywords are acquired, students work on progressively more difficult words and text materials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0022219410371678">
<title>III. Peeling Off</title>
<p>The Peeling Off strategy can be applied to most multisyllabic words with Latin or Greek bases. Students learn to identify, segment, and pronounce affixes at the beginning (e.g., <italic>un-, re-, mis-, con</italic>-) and end of a word or word part (e.g., <italic>-ing, -ment, -tion, -ual</italic>), thereby reducing the unknown word to a smaller root. If the student cannot read the root, one of the other PHAST strategies is used until all word parts are identified accurately and can be blended together. As many as 110 affixes may be introduced during the program, at a general rate of 2 new affixes per lesson. Peeling Off Worksheets present lists of multisyllabic words and provide the students with the opportunity to locate and circle affixes and identify them using the strategy dialogue, “I peel off [affix] at the beginning (or end) of the word. The root is ____. The word is _______.” Each worksheet offers many challenging words such as <italic>unobtainable, transfiguration, misconception</italic>, and <italic>advantageous</italic>, facilitating the use and consolidation of the different strategies as they are acquired.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0022219410371678">
<title>IV. Vowel Alert</title>
<p>Students quickly learn to appreciate the complexity of the vowels and to become “alert” to possible decoding difficulties. They learn to “stop” if unsure of a vowel sound, to “be flexible,” and to try alternate pronunciations for the vowel or vowel combination. In decoding <italic>steady</italic>, students stop and try the three most prevalent pronunciations for <italic>ea</italic> (as in <italic>bead, head</italic>, and <italic>break</italic>) until the correct pronunciation is selected. Students learn and have flexible use of the variable sounds of single vowels (<italic>a, e, i, o, u, y</italic>), vowel digraphs (<italic>ea, oo, ow, ie</italic>), and <italic>l</italic>-controlled vowels (<italic>al, ol, ul</italic>). Students practice with consonant clusters, such as <italic>ck/ke, ch/tch, ge/dge, ch, ph</italic>, and <italic>gh</italic>, and are taught that the vowel sound can also signal the spelling of a preceding consonant sound. Regular oral rehearsal of the variable sounds of both single vowels and vowel combinations promotes fluency and flexible use of the Vowel Alert strategy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0022219410371678">
<title>V. Spy</title>
<p>The Spy strategy allows students to use their existing word knowledge to recognize small known words or parts of longer, unknown words. Students learn that this strategy is most effective when confronted with compound words such as <italic>clockmaker, marketplace</italic>, and <italic>midday</italic>. Caution is taken to ensure that this strategy is not overgeneralized because the Spy strategy has the potential to sabotage or limit decoding efforts; spying the words <italic>red, is</italic>, and <italic>cover</italic> does not help students to successfully read <italic>rediscover</italic>.</p>
<p>Smooth transition among these five strategies is achieved by continually building on the skills and strategies previously learned. A new strategy is introduced only when the prerequisite skills have been acquired. For example, students must master variable vowel pronunciations before the Vowel Alert strategy is taught. A metacognitive organizational structure called the Game Plan is introduced after students have learned the first three strategies to help them orchestrate the appropriate <italic>S</italic>election, <italic>A</italic>pplication, <italic>M</italic>onitoring, and <italic>E</italic>valuation (SAME) of the PHAST strategies. Using a sports analogy, students learn that like skilled athletes, good readers are strategic, attentive to details, purposeful, and flexible.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0022219410371678">
<title>Track 2: The Text Knowledge Track</title>
<p>The Text Knowledge Track lessons are designed to help the student understand the author’s plan for a text—why the author selects particular words, sentences, and paragraphs and how this facilitates understanding of the information presented.</p>
<p>Students are taught the various signaling devices used by authors and how these signals can help the reader to make predictions, set reading goals, activate prior knowledge, identify organizational plans, and focus on important information. Lessons in Track 2 introduce structural text analysis at the micro (signaling devices, sources of confusion, and questioning skills) and macro (narrative and expository organizational text structures, text unity, and coherence) levels. Students are exposed to a variety of texts and learn that they must bring a separate set of skills to narrative, expository, and graphical texts. All of the skills taught in Track 2 are necessary for successful application of the five comprehension strategies, and the scaffolded nature of the program ensures that these prerequisite skills are in place before each strategy is introduced in the Comprehension Strategy Track.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0022219410371678">
<title>Track 3: The Comprehension Strategy Track</title>
<p>As the skills from the Text Knowledge Track are acquired, the five comprehension strategies together with self-monitoring and evaluative skills are taught in parallel. The strategies, <italic>P</italic>redicting, <italic>A</italic>ctivating Prior Knowledge, <italic>C</italic>larifying, <italic>E</italic>valuating Through Questioning, and <italic>S</italic>ummarizing (PACES), have been designed to reflect the processes used by skilled readers to access a text’s meaning. Explicit instructional lessons, text samples, and activity sheets have been designed to introduce each strategy dialogue, along with what, when, why, and how each strategy is used.</p>
<p>A metacognitive PACES Plan prompts the use of all the strategies and guides and supports students through the application of each comprehension strategy with specific dialogue or scripts. The students first experience the comprehension strategies when an expert reader, the teacher, models the strategies, thinking aloud as he or she reads. The teacher’s self-talk serves as a script that students acquire to guide their application of the strategies. Strategy instruction is highly scaffolded; the teacher instructs one strategy at a time, models and reviews strategy dialogue daily, provides individual instruction and ongoing support, reinforces successful strategy use and provides corrective feedback, and adjusts and fades prompts gradually over time. Providing strategy dialogue and scaffolded, contextual instruction are essential if students are to apply the strategies independently and to generalize strategy use to other texts and settings.</p>
<sec id="section27-0022219410371678">
<title>I Predicting and II. Activating Prior Knowledge</title>
<p>Predicting and Activating Prior Knowledge are the first two strategies introduced in Track 3. In the Text Knowledge Track, students learned the various text signals that authors use (e.g., titles, topic statements, textual cues, pictures, signal words), on which good predictions can be based. Track 3 teaches students the importance of making good predictions along with a script or “strategy dialogue” that prompts predicting. Students ask themselves, “What do I predict I will read or learn about?”, “Based on the title, I predict that . . .”, and “Based on what I have already read, I predict that. . . .” Once comfortable with the Predicting strategy, students are asked to reflect on what they are bringing to the reading process by asking themselves, “What do I already know about the subject or topic of the text?” Explicit instruction on how to activate existing knowledge helps students engage with text materials and also facilitates comprehension.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0022219410371678">
<title>III. Clarifying</title>
<p>In Track 2, students were alerted to the types of words that could cause confusion. In worksheets, students practiced spotting and clearing up various sources of confusion, such as referents, omissions, difficult vocabulary, and vocabulary with multiple meanings. In the Comprehension Strategy Track, students are taught how to clarify these confusions while reading to restore comprehension. Students learn that Clarifying is a two-step process: First, the reader must recognize that comprehension has broken down and, second, know how to clear up <italic>what</italic> is confusing them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0022219410371678">
<title>IV Evaluating Through Questioning and V. Summarizing</title>
<p>The Evaluating Through Questioning strategy teaches <italic>why</italic> it is important to monitor comprehension as we read—to test our understanding of what we have read, to focus on information that is important, and to predict the kinds of questions we might be asked on a test or exam. Students learn <italic>how</italic> to monitor by asking themselves questions that evaluate both narrative and expository text structures. For narrative texts, students learned to use the “plot graph” together with the “4W+3W+2H evaluative questions” as they read through the beginning, middle, and end of a selection. These self-monitoring questions allow students to check their understanding while reading. If a student cannot answer the 4W questions at the beginning of a story, then he or she must go back and reread that section. Once the narrative lessons have been taught, teachers may choose to introduce a novel study. A novel or short story, grade appropriate and of interest to the group, can become part of the daily text reading requirement. The teacher and students would select vocabulary words, develop the plot graph, and apply both the decoding and comprehension strategies (PHAST PACES) as they read. As the PACES strategies are being consolidated with narrative texts, lessons on expository texts are introduced.</p>
<p>Students learn a separate set of self-evaluative questions and five different text maps to guide their understanding of expository texts. They monitor comprehension by asking the “3W2 evaluative questions.” These questions require a focus on the important information in a text and supply the structure for a text summary. Students find this formulaic approach particularly useful when asked to write summaries of what they have read (narrative summary = 4W+3W+2H and expository summary = 3W2).</p>
