<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Three different techniques of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction—conventional (transtibial) single bundle (CSB), anatomic single bundle (ASB), and anatomic double bundle (ADB)—have been described.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> To determine if double-bundle reconstruction is needed to restore rotational stability or if anatomic placement of a single bundle can yield similar results.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> From December 2005 to December 2007, 320 patients were prospectively randomized into 3 groups: ADB, ASB, and CSB reconstruction. The average follow-up was 51.15 months (range, 39-63 months). At the final follow-up, 281 patients were available. In all groups, hamstring tendons were used with suspensory fixation on the femoral side and bioabsorbable interference screw fixation on the tibial side. The outcomes were evaluated by an independent blinded observer using the Lysholm score and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form. The KT-1000 arthrometer was used to evaluate anteroposterior stability, and the pivot-shift test was used to determine rotational stability.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Anatomic single-bundle reconstruction resulted in better anteroposterior and rotational stability than CSB reconstruction (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 1.6 mm in the ASB group vs 2.0 mm in the CSB group; <italic>P</italic> = .002). Negative pivot shift was 66.7% vs 41.7% (<italic>P</italic> = .003). In other parameters, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. The results of the ADB group were also superior to the ASB group for anteroposterior and rotational stability (average side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation was 1.2 mm in the ADB group vs 1.6 mm in the ASB group; <italic>P</italic> = .002). Negative pivot shift was 93.1% vs 66.7%, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and range of motion was also significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = .005). The Lysholm score was 90.9, 91.8, and 93.0 in the CSB, ASB, and ADB groups, respectively. The difference was significant only when we compared ADB and CSB (<italic>P</italic> = .025). Subjective IKDC scores were 90.2, 90.6, and 92.1 in the CSB, ASB, and ADB groups, respectively. The difference was not significant.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction is significantly superior to conventional single-bundle ACL reconstruction and better than anatomic single-bundle reconstruction. Anatomic single-bundle reconstruction was superior to conventional single-bundle reconstruction. However, these differences are small and may not be clinically relevant.</p>

<p>Complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture can lead to recurrent knee instability, meniscal tears, and articular cartilage degeneration. The ACL does not heal when torn, and surgical reconstruction is the standard treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511426416">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511426416">12</xref></sup> Reconstruction aims at restoring the kinematics and stability of the injured knee to prevent future degenerative changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511426416">22</xref></sup> Reconstruction of the ACL has become a commonly performed procedure, and good to excellent results have been reported. However, a critical review of the literature reveals that the success rates vary between 69% and 95%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511426416">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511426416">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511426416">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546511426416">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0363546511426416">48</xref></sup> Conventional reconstruction techniques are mostly successful in limiting anterior tibial translation but may be insufficient in controlling combined rotatory loads of internal and valgus torque.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511426416">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511426416">30</xref></sup> In addition, a significant portion of patients with ACL reconstruction will not return to their previous level of sporting activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511426416">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511426416">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511426416">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511426416">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546511426416">46</xref></sup> This suggests that there remains considerable room for improvement in ACL reconstruction.</p>
<p>It has been well described in the literature that the ACL can be divided into 2 major functional bundles: the anteromedial (AM) bundle and the posterolateral (PL) bundle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511426416">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511426416">16</xref></sup> Biomechanical investigations have indicated that anatomic ACL double-bundle reconstruction restores knee stability closer to normal than conventional single-bundle ACL reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511426416">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511426416">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546511426416">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546511426416">43</xref></sup> In a cadaveric study, Musahl et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511426416">31</xref></sup> found that double-bundle reconstruction offers better anterior and rotational stability than single-bundle. However, they compared an anatomic double-bundle technique with a single-bundle technique using traditional transtibial tunnel positions. These anatomic and biomechanical considerations have recently sparked an interest in double-bundle reconstruction techniques and anatomic ACL reconstruction methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511426416">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511426416">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511426416">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511426416">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546511426416">39</xref></sup> Many prospective comparative clinical studies with level I or II evidence reported superior results of anatomic double-bundle reconstructions compared with single-bundle reconstructions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546511426416">‖</xref></sup> On the other hand, some studies reported that there is no difference between single-bundle and double-bundle ACL reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511426416">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546511426416">38</xref></sup> Also a meta-analysis performed by Meredick et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511426416">28</xref></sup> showed that there is no significant statistical subjective clinical difference between the patients treated with either method. However, for all the aforementioned studies, it remains unclear if both the single- and double-bundle ACL reconstructions performed in these studies were anatomic. In many studies, the surgeon drilled the femoral tunnels transtibially, in both the single-bundle reconstructions and the anteromedial bundle in double-bundle reconstructions. Tunnel mismatch is common when the femoral (AM) tunnel is drilled in a transtibial fashion and can result in tunnel placement outside of the native insertion site, which can result in abnormal knee kinematics, limited range of motion, higher than physiologic graft tension, and, ultimately, graft failure. Biological healing of the graft-bone interface may also be affected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546511426416">¶</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study compares results of 3 different techniques of ACL reconstruction: conventional single bundle, anatomic single bundle, and anatomic double bundle. The aim of this study is to determine if double-bundle reconstruction is needed to restore rotational stability or if anatomic placement of a single bundle can yield similar results. Our hypothesis is that anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction is superior to conventional single-bundle ACL and that anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction is superior to both conventional and anatomic single-bundle.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>From December 2005 to December 2007, we performed a prospective randomized clinical study to evaluate the results of these 3 different methods of ACL reconstruction. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board and from the national medical ethics committee. Patients were randomized into 3 groups during their office visit: conventional single-bundle group (CSB group; n = 85), anatomic single-bundle group (ASB group; n = 85), anatomic double-bundle group (ADB group; n = 160). Randomization was performed using a computer with randomization software. Twice as many patients were identified for the last group as it was uncertain whether these patients had a 1-bundle rupture and only needed augmentation surgery. If this was the case, patients were excluded from the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511426416">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Inclusion criteria were an ACL rupture in active patients with a closed growth plate. Exclusion criteria were multiligamentous injuries, severe arthritic changes (grade 3 or greater), total or subtotal meniscectomy, contralateral ACL-deficient knee, and patients with partial ACL rupture. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: in the conventional single-bundle group, 3 patients were undergoing revision ACL reconstruction, 2 had contralateral ACL injury and reconstruction, and 3 were moving out of the region. In the anatomic single-bundle group, 1 patient was undergoing revision ACL reconstruction because of injury, and 1 patient had contralateral ACL injury and reconstruction. In the anatomic double-bundle group, 2 patients were undergoing revision ACL reconstruction, 3 had contralateral ACL injury and reconstruction, 5 patients were moving out of the area, and 19 suffered only a 1-bundle tear and underwent augmentation surgery. All these patients were excluded from the study, and a total of 281 patients were randomized for the 3 procedures: 72 patients in the CSB group, 78 in the ASB group, and 131 patients in ADB group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511426416">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Preoperatively, all patients had complete examination to exclude multiligamentous injuries and other pathologic changes. All patients underwent preoperative examination, including Lachman, anterior drawer, pivot-shift testing, and KT-1000 arthrometer with the knee flexed 30° at 134 N and manual maximum force (MEDmetric, San Diego, California). We examined the injured and the contralateral knees. All patients were evaluated objectively and subjectively. The objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511426416">5</xref></sup> form was completed by 1 orthopaedic surgeon who was blinded to the group of the subject. All patients completed the questionnaires necessary to calculate the IKDC subjective score and Lysholm score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511426416">27</xref></sup> Standard radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had been obtained for all patients. There were no demographic differences between the 3 groups, and the preoperative examination was similar, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511426416">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511426416">2</xref>.

<title>Operative Techniques</title>
<p>The knee was prepared and draped in the standard fashion, and arthroscopic portals were established. The anterolateral portal was placed a little above the inferior pole of the patella at the lateral border of the patellar tendon. The anteromedial portal was placed just below the inferior pole of the patella, approximately 1 cm medial to the medial edge of the patellar tendon. Finally, an accessory inferior medial portal was marked medial and distal to the inferomedial portal slightly above the meniscus and was established later in the procedure.</p>
<p>The semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were harvested with a closed tendon stripper through a longitudinal anteromedial incision on the medial side of the proximal tibia, over the insertion of the pes anserinus. Graft preparation was initiated on the back table. Each graft was trimmed to the appropriate diameter. Before graft passage, an EndoButton CL (Smith and Nephew, Andover, Massachusetts) was attached, with a loop length based on measurements of tunnel lengths.</p>
<p>Before assessment of the ACL, any meniscal or chondral injuries were addressed.</p>
<p>Next, the accessory medial portal was established using an 18-gauge spinal needle under direct visualization. This portal was essential to allow improved visualization of the lateral wall of the intercondylar notch and achieve correct placement of the PL femoral tunnel. Next, the rupture pattern of the AM and PL bundle was carefully evaluated using a thermal device. Special attention was given to the remaining fibers of each bundle, and the insertion sites of the AM and PL bundle were very carefully visualized through the lateral and medial portals. This was not always possible, especially in chronic cases. Then we visualized and identified the bony landmarks, especially the lateral intercondylar ridge and the lateral bifurcate ridge. Then we marked the location of the native femoral and tibial footprint, corresponding to their positions in the normal ACL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511426416">Figure 2</xref>). We performed no notchplasty.</p>

<p>With the scope in the medial portal, a 3/32 Steinman pin was introduced through the accessory medial portal and was placed at the center of the PL femoral insertion site. In chronic cases, we placed it below the lateral intercondylar ridge and anterior to the bifurcate ridge. This was approximately 6 mm arthroscopically posterior to the anterior articular cartilage border and 3 mm superior to the inferior border. The knee was held in 90° of flexion for this step because the position of the femoral insertion sites changes with the knee flexion angle. After verification of correct pin position, the knee was flexed to 120°, and the pin was malleted into place. An acorn reamer was inserted over the guide wire with special attention taken to avoid injury to the articular surface of the medial femoral condyle. The PL tunnel was drilled to a depth of 25 mm and, depending on overall tunnel length, may later be hand-drilled to a final length. The far cortex was breached using a 4.5-mm EndoButton drill (Smith and Nephew), and total tunnel length was measured with a depth gauge. The AM femoral tunnel was established in a similar way. In chronic cases, we placed it below the lateral intercondylar ridge and posterior to the bifurcate ridge. This is approximately 2 mm posterior to the posterior rim of the PL tunnel, in a horizontal or slightly superior position.</p>
<p>Next, attention was turned to the tibial tunnels. An ACL tibial tunnel director guide (DePuy Mitek, Raynham, Massachusetts) set at 55° was placed in the insertion site of the PL bundle, based on anatomic landmarks and previous marking. The position of the director guide on the tibial cortex was just anterior to the superficial fibers of the medial collateral ligament. After PL guide pin placement, the guide was set to 45° and was positioned in the AM tibial footprint. The starting point of the AM tunnel on the tibial cortex was more anterior, central, and proximal than the starting point of the PL tunnel. The AM tibial guide pin was placed, and both pin positions were verified before tunnel drilling.</p>
<p>For PL graft passage, a beath pin with a long loop suture attached was passed through the accessory medial portal, femoral PL tunnel, and lateral thigh, with the knee hyperflexed to protect the peroneal nerve. The suture was retrieved through the PL tibial tunnel using an arthroscopic suture grasper. The PL graft was passed, and the EndoButton was flipped in the standard fashion to achieve femoral fixation. The AM graft sutures were passed in a similar fashion. The crossing pattern of the 2 bundles of the ACL can be observed by taking the knee from flexion to extension. The AM graft was then passed and the EndoButton was flipped in the standard fashion for femoral fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511426416">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The knee was cycled from 0° to 120° approximately 25 times for preconditioning of grafts. Each graft was fixed with a bioabsorbable interference screw (DePuy Mitek). The PL graft was tensioned with the knee held in 0°, and the AM graft was tensioned with the knee in 60° of flexion by manual tensioning. After fixation, the knee was tested for range of motion and stability, and the wounds were closed in the standard fashion.</p>

<title>Anatomic Single-Bundle Reconstruction</title>
<p>The procedure of anatomic single-bundle reconstruction was similar to anatomic double-bundle reconstruction. We addressed the femoral tunnel first and performed it through the accessory medial portal, but we placed the femoral tunnel in the center of the marked insertion sites. The position of the femoral tunnel was between the target point of the AM bundle and PL bundle in the double-bundle ACL reconstruction. In chronic cases, we placed it below the lateral intercondylar ridge, at the lateral bifurcate ridge. If these bony landmarks could not be identified, we placed it in the lower third of the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle. Next, attention was turned to the tibial tunnels. An ACL tibial tunnel director guide (DePuy Mitek) set at 55° was placed in the center of the ACL tibial insertion site, based on anatomic landmarks and previous marking. The position of the director guide on the tibial cortex was 3 cm medial to the tibial tubercle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546511426416">Figure 4</xref>). The graft was then passed and the EndoButton was flipped in the standard fashion for femoral fixation. The knee was cycled from 0° to 120° approximately 25 times for preconditioning of the graft. The graft was fixed using a bioabsorbable interference screw (DePuy Mitek) with the knee at full extension with a forced posterior drawer.</p>

<title>Conventional Single-Bundle Reconstruction</title>
<p>The tip of the tibial guide was introduced through the medial infrapatellar portal and put at the center of the most posterior aspect of the normal ACL insertion between the medial and lateral tibial eminence. A guide wire was inserted into the tibia through the sleeve. A tibial tunnel was created with a cannulated drill with a diameter matched to the width of the prepared graft. A Kirschner wire was then drilled into the lateral femoral condyle at the 1:30-o’clock (or 10:30-o’clock) position, using the transtibial tunnel technique. We used a 5- or 6-mm offset guide system (DePuy Mitek). Then the drill system for EndoButton fixation was used to create a femoral tunnel. Graft passage and fixation was performed in the same way as in the anatomic single-bundle reconstruction group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546511426416">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Rehabilitation</title>
<p>Postoperative management followed our standard ACL protocol for all groups. Continuous passive motion stretching was initiated on the first postoperative day. Crutches were used for 1 week, but patients were allowed to bear weight as tolerated. Return to full activities was typically allowed at 9 months postoperatively.</p>

<sec id="section7-0363546511426416">
<title>Follow-up</title>
<p>In the first 2 hours after the surgery, an anteroposterior and lateral radiograph of the knee was performed. All follow-up examinations were performed by a blinded investigator who was not involved in the surgery. The initial and follow-up examinations were performed by the same observer. International Knee Documentation Committee subjective and Lysholm scores were used to evaluate the subjective outcomes. The skin incisions were identical for all 3 techniques, so the investigator did not know to which group the patients were assigned. The patients were not blinded because the surgeon informed them about details of the operative technique they had.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 15.0 software package (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Illinois). The calculations between the differences of means were done by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and an independent samples <italic>t</italic> test, and those of the frequencies were done by the χ<sup>2</sup> test. For deficit of flexion and deficit of extension, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was employed. The significance level was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>Before the investigation was initiated, the sample size was estimated on the basis of the hypothesis that there was no difference between the treatment groups. The power analysis was done on the basis of the preliminary anticipation that the pivot-shift category “0” for anatomic double-bundle treatment would improve in a range of 25%, from approximately 50% to approximately 75% success. The initial 50% success rate in the pivot-shift category 0 for anatomic single-bundle treatment was set according to our previous experience. The expected improvement between control and test group in pivot-shift category 0 is statistically estimated as a medium effect size. For a χ<sup>2</sup> test at α = 0.05 and 3 degrees of freedom, to achieve 0.8 power, we needed a sample size of 120 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511426416">10</xref></sup> The 25% improvement in pivot-shift category 0 for anatomic double-bundle treatment would not only result in a statistical significance but also represent a meaningful clinical significance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study compared conventional single-bundle, anatomic single-bundle, and anatomic double-bundle reconstruction for ACL rupture. Preoperatively, there were no significant differences in demographics between the 3 groups. However, the rate of cartilage injury in the ASB group was twice as high as that in the other 2 groups. The most important finding of the present study was that the results of anatomic single-bundle reconstruction were superior to conventional single-bundle reconstruction for anteroposterior and rotational stability. Anatomic double-bundle reconstruction was superior to both conventional and anatomic single bundle. When comparing anatomic double bundle to conventional single bundle, it resulted in superior outcome for all objective and subjective outcome measurements, except subjective IKDC. When comparing the anatomic double-bundle group to the anatomic single-bundle group, there were significant differences in anteroposterior and rotation stability and range of motion. However, most of these differences were small, and the clinical relevance of this difference is not known.</p>
<p>Most of the published clinical studies comparing single- and double-bundle reconstruction do not present a fair comparison because often one or both surgical techniques were not performed anatomically. For example, some studies compared transtibial single-bundle reconstruction with anatomic double-bundle reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363546511426416">#</xref></sup> In contrast with other studies, in our study, we looked at the results of the conventional single-bundle reconstruction group separately from the anatomic single-bundle group and compared them with each other and with those of an anatomic double-bundle group. Another issue is that anatomic ACL reconstruction has not yet been well defined. Some authors have attempted to provide guidelines, definitions, and criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546511426416">39</xref></sup> but none of these is generally accepted.</p>
<p>Yasuda et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546511426416">44</xref></sup> performed a prospective comparative study on anatomic double-bundle, single-bundle, and nonanatomic double-bundle procedures in 72 patients. They reported that the results of anatomic double bundle are significantly better than single bundle based on anteroposterior and rotation stability. There was no significant difference between the single-bundle and nonanatomic double-bundle groups. Also, they found no significant difference between the 3 groups in the IKDC evaluation, range of motion, and muscle torque. In our study, we compared anatomic double bundle to conventional and anatomic single bundle, which will help us to conclude if better results are due to 4 tunnels, to a more anatomic position of the tunnels, or both. Kondo et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511426416">25</xref></sup> in a prospective comparative study of 328 patients, reported that anatomic double bundle is superior to single bundle. The double-bundle group had significantly better results in terms of anterior laxity and pivot shift. But there were no significant differences in terms of IKDC, subjective scores, range of knee motion, muscle torque, and rate of return to sports activities between the 2 procedures. However, this study was not randomized. In addition, they used a transtibial technique to place the femoral tunnels. Aglietti et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511426416">3</xref></sup> in a randomized single-blinded study with a minimum follow-up of 24 months, reported that double bundle showed significantly better results in terms of anteroposterior stability measured with the KT-2000, visual analog scale, and objective IKDC. But there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the pivot shift and subjective measurements. A limitation of this study was that only 70 patients were included, with a follow-up of only 24 months, which is shorter than in the present study.</p>
<p>Some studies show that there is no significant difference in any of their clinical evaluations between single-bundle and double-bundle groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511426416">20</xref></sup> Park et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511426416">32</xref></sup> in prospective study with 113 patients, found that double-bundle reconstruction of the ACL using 2 tibial tunnels and 2 femoral tunnels showed no differences in stability results or any other clinical aspects in terms of patient satisfaction when compared with single-bundle reconstruction. In both studies, they used a transtibial technique and the “o’clock” method to place the femoral tunnels.</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that using transtibial drilling leads mostly to nonanatomic, consistently anteriorly positioned femoral tunnels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511426416">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511426416">37</xref></sup> In addition, with the transtibial tunnel technique, there is some difficulty in obtaining the correct femoral anatomic position for the PL bundle. Furthermore, using the “o’clock” method can often lead to misconceptions because of the 3-dimensional nature of the intercondylar notch, where the clock face can be put anywhere along the anterior-to-posterior axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511426416">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511426416">35</xref></sup> In contrast with the studies performed by Ibrahim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511426416">20</xref></sup> and Park et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511426416">32</xref></sup> the present study showed a significant difference between groups. One possible explanation for this difference could be that we separated the conventional and anatomic single-bundle groups. In addition, the femoral tunnels in our anatomic double-bundle group were drilled freehand and, as such, independent of the respective tibial tunnel position, without use of the “o’clock” reference. The fixation on the femur was the same for all groups, in contrast with their studies, in which they used hybrid fixation.</p>
<p>Sastre et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511426416">34</xref></sup> in a randomized prospective study with 20 patients in each single- and double-bundle group, put the femoral tunnels more horizontal in both groups and found no significant differences between them. The authors concluded that placing the femoral tunnel in a more horizontal position in the single-bundle group produced similar rotatory and anteroposterior laxity control to that obtained with the double-bundle technique in patients with low functional demands. In contrast, in our study, we did find a significant difference between anatomic single and double-bundle groups probably because in our study, we put the femoral anteromedial tunnel in a more anatomic position through the accessory portal, whereas they drilled it through the tibial tunnel. Also, they had a small number of patients (n = 40).</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. The first limitation is that we had different numbers of patients in the groups, especially in the ADB group. We did not individualize our surgery (to determine the type of reconstruction, graft type, and size depending on patients’ individual measurements of the ACL insertion sites and intercondylar notch) because the patients were randomized to 1 of 3 reconstruction methods before the surgery, regardless of the intra-articular anatomy. The anatomy can be very different between individuals, but individualization cannot be performed because of the randomized nature of the study design. There is a need for future studies that will individualize the surgery and probably will be more anatomic than ours.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction is superior to both conventional single-bundle ACL reconstruction and anatomic single-bundle reconstruction. Anatomic single-bundle reconstruction is superior to conventional single-bundle reconstruction. This implies it is most important to perform ACL reconstructions anatomically. Adding a second bundle may also provide additional stability.</p>
