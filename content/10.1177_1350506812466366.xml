<p>Every now and then you find yourself in the swirl of a conjunction of events that lead you to look at something afresh and ask new questions. This happened to me recently in relation to the concept of ‘minority’ and its implications for feminist research, a concept that I have long held an ambivalent relation to not least because of the ways in which it has and continues to be used in policy making and implementation and deployed in the political rhetoric of professional politicians and others. Despite this ambivalence, I have adopted a social constructionist approach and referred to processes of minoritization, aiming to draw attention to the constituted, as opposed to the pre-givenness, of the status of minority (and minor).</p>
<p>But recently I was at a concert of the Arkestra named after Sun Ra: the jazz man from Chicago and Saturn who traced his lineage and influences through the Nation of Islam, ancient Cairo, the Nubians, Duke Ellington and the creative energies of inter-cosmic force. The Sun Ra Arkestra as it is still known, now under the direction of Marshall Allen, continues to bring the expansive joy of Ra’s music to the world, continuing to transform its listeners into participants filled, if they dare, with curiosity about how exactly all things might be connected even when seemingly so diametrically opposed; what might be required of the participants to be able to make and sustain such a curiosity; and why such a sustained curiosity is essential if something different and not yet known is to emerge.</p>
<p>A few hours before that concert I had been at a seminar of European feminist academics who had gathered to launch and discuss two books that offered some of the findings and analyses of the EU-funded FEMCIT<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350506812466366">1</xref></sup> project. The books were a collection of essays on gender and citizenship in multicultural Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506812466366">Halsaa et al., 2012</xref>) and another on majority–minority relations in contemporary women’s movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506812466366">Predelli and Halsaa, 2012</xref>). I was at the seminar in my capacity as an invited panel speaker and because I had been a member of the steering group. What struck me about this conjunction of events was that despite their very different forms and modes of practice participants in both the concert and the seminar were being presented with the same problematic. This is the question of how to conjure spaces and modes of practice (musical in the one, feminist academic in the other – though both oriented towards a set of differentiated publics in the making) that enable engagements with multiplicity, difference and the unknown in conditions that are uncertain, highly contested and demanding. Because while it may seem self-evident that a group of feminist academics engaged in the process of researching gender and citizenship in multicultural Europe are necessarily invested in exploring this question, readers should be in no doubt that this too is the question animating and posed by the musicality and creations of the Sun Ra Arkestra who have been working at this since the 1950s.</p>
<p>Of course, despite the claims by some about the inherent uniqueness, democratic impulse and tolerant attitude of Europe and Europeans, Europe is itself a space of indeterminacy or what Ash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812466366">Amin (2012)</xref> has referred to as,<disp-quote>
<p>… a public sphere that is sufficiently incomplete to gather new counterforces to repel gathering suspicion and revulsion of the stranger. … Europe as an idea of attachment gathers diverse sentiments brewing quietly under the surface, periodically breaking the surface to colonize collective consciousness; today in the form of aversion towards minorities and strangers, exploited by conservative forces with devastating outcomes for the stranger. Yet the fact that such rushes can capture the collective imaginary with affective charge is also reason to hope that alternative sentiments of togetherness might come to the fore in the still imprecise space called Europe. In Europe, unfinished as a collective culture, another sense of unity actively promoted by progressive social movements, political parties, educational and cultural institutions, policy initiatives, and opinion makers, could make a difference – but only if it is able to find affective grip, and secure the same kind of emotional energy that its counterpart has managed to gather. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812466366">Amin, 2012</xref>: 112)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It seems to me that in researching the impact of women’s movements on citizenship across Europe that FEMCIT was both investigating and implicated in this terrain: i.e. the struggle to construct a field of counterforces that might resist a conservative and oppressive version of Europe in the interests of pursuing transformations in the economies of gender that have and continue to cause such harm. My focus here is not to consider what the FEMCIT researchers have found (the publications that are emerging do that far more effectively) but rather to share a few hesitant thoughts about the implications of the conceptual categories we deploy as we, feminist activists and researchers of diverse ethnicities and working in different national, social, cultural, institutional and policy contexts, go about our business. These thoughts arose for me in that conjunction occasioned by my reading the <italic>Majority–Minority Relations</italic> book and attending the seminar, and were echoed as I was immersed in the pleasures and challenges of the Arkestra as they took us on an interstellar journey.</p>
<p>The importance of <italic>Majority–Minority Relations</italic> lies in its insistence on the systematic exposition, mapping and analysis of the forms assumed and relations within and between women’s movements and their claims making in three European countries – Norway, Spain and the UK. Its particular significance and contribution is that the authors produce their mapping and analysis via a double comparison – across three nation-state formations, marked by their particular histories, policy regimes and institutional forms; and a comparison of feminist and/or women’s movement organizations that are defined as majority or minority. In this double comparison, they have captured the variable and shifting temporalities; the multiplicities of form and claim; the tensions, conflicts, negotiations and alliances; and the differentiated impacts on policy and advancement of citizenship enactment associated with women’s movements in the three nation-state formations and among the ethnically diverse constellations of women’s movement organizations operating within and across these nation-state formations. Similarly, they have done this double comparison via the application of a set of conceptual resources and methodological approaches that allowed them to take seriously the notion that structures of alterity are always relational, involving positions of privilege and subordination or exclusion. Moreover, and significantly, this conceptual and methodological scaffolding allowed them to take seriously the idea that transformation of such structures of alterity requires those positioned as unmarked and privileged to examine the conditions that produce such relational effects and the investment of the unmarked/privileged in that privilege.</p>
<p>Framing the research in this way has resulted in an inclusive research document that shows the relative, contextually contingent achievements, failures and particularities of feminist and women’s movement activism and claims making. In keeping with the movement of double comparison they have also attempted to identify the points at which there has been an expansion, i.e. a move towards greater inclusivity, among what they term majoritized women’s movement organizations and policy actors. And there should be no doubt at all about the labour involved in carrying out this double-comparison: intellectual, practical, emotional labour that needs to be recognized and applauded. This is nowhere less true than in terms of the memory work that the researchers engaged in as they sought to unravel the ways in which forms of gendered whiteness became constituted as an unmarked category and yet which was foundational to processes of identity formation and feminist practice for many ‘majoritized’ feminists in Europe. In this the book contributes to the ever expanding archive of feminist whiteness studies but here bringing it into alignment with feminist research on citizenship policy and practice.</p>
<p>Such a contribution is important and readers of the book will be invited to make their own assessments and raise their own questions about the relationship between whiteness, gender and citizenship claims as manifest in the activisms of women’s movements in the last three to four decades. The big question that arose for me turned on the issue of what might be the effects of the conceptual categories deployed in pursuit of feminist investigation. More specifically: what is it about the concepts deployed in any piece of intellectual labour that carries so much? What is the relational field constituted and constellated via a discourse of minoritized and with what potential effects? <italic>Majority–Minority Relations</italic> offers one response.</p>
<p>Yet I think it is possible to craft another constellation of relationality if the enquiry about majority/minority feminisms is staged in the context of a conversation not with feminist citizenship scholarship but with a parallel archive of feminist theory. This is the feminist scholarship within the field of critical race and postcolonial studies that had, in an earlier moment, engaged the question of minority discourse and the notion of minoritized. It seems to me that going back to this work and re-routing the path of the conceptual category ‘minority’ shifts the balance of the conversation, paying less attention to the issue of expansion (i.e. pressing for greater inclusivity within a conceptual or policy frame that remains basically intact such as ‘citizenship’).</p>
<p>This re-routing foregrounds an alternative conceptualization of what might be involved in a project aimed at undermining the norms of intelligibility and their attendant inequalities and power relations, including disrupting relations staged as minoritized/majoritized. It is a re-routing that forces attention onto the sense-making effects that concepts have and the impact that things called ‘minor’ might have on that process of sense-making. For example, feminist writers such as Caren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506812466366">Kaplan (1987)</xref>, writing on the deterritorializing effects of certain feminist approaches to questions of home and exile, showed how feminists writing from the position of ‘minor’ enabled other, as yet unknown, potential communities of association and identification to emerge. Crucially a deterritorialization of ‘home’ and the known (and this known could be that of citizenship, even in expanded form) is never achieved once and for all nor does it involve a process of emulation in which the ‘major’ imagines itself to become like the ‘minor’. Of course, in part the yearning for new, as yet unknown, assemblages of association and connection needs to be grounded around the paradox of engagement with existing inequalities of power whilst attempting to disrupt them. But crucially, such a yearning requires an ability to become and remain open to the ‘what might be’ signalled in the everyday negotiations of and around power that are as much a description of the boxing and coxing around the double impossibility of working and not working in the terms set by the ‘major’ concepts and categories that structure the social, as it is of ordinary encounter and intersubjectivity that marks our interactions one with another.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it is this terrain that is opened up by the concept ‘minor’ and it does so in a way that re-inflects the social constructionist understanding of minoritization. Of course it is an understanding of ‘minor’ that follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506812466366">Deleuze and Guattari (1986)</xref> for whom ‘Minor-ness … consists in practices of reterritorialization that are simply discontinuous with the telos of dominance, in other words, immune to the inducements of either hegemony or canonicity’, as postcolonial scholar Leela Gandhi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506812466366">2011</xref>: 35) has recently phrased it. Moreover, the deterritorialization that ‘minor’ effects turns on the ways in which the disruptive force of ‘minor’ (and for Deleuze and Guattari it is minor literature, or the language of minor literature) exposes the way that things coalesce into unstable constellations and gathers the energies that lie in practices ‘elsewhere’ to the major but significantly does so <italic>within</italic> the major not alongside it. Minor’s deterritorializing potential lies in its capacity for irruption from inside as opposed to beside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506812466366">Deleuze and Guattari, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Such a conceptualization of ‘minor’ can have clear implications for how feminists working in the field of citizenship studies both deploy the concept ‘minor’ and maintain its analytical integrity by holding onto its radical potentiality. This is a radical potentiality beyond the more ‘simple’ project of expansion. Thus in regard to ‘citizenship’ the re-routing I am referring to, the question posed becomes in what ways could it be possible to deploy the concept of ‘minor’ in ways that disrupt (as opposed to expand) the sense-making attained by the concept ‘citizenship’? As already suggested, one possibility might be to refocus attention on the configurations and effects that take shape from the shifting alignments of forces and objects inside domains of the major as they are reconfigured in the practices of the minor. It might be to explore ways of repositioning outside of a logic of expansion and more in terms of a logic of implosion and the unimagined/yet to become both in relation to women’s movements and in relation to those constellations of agencies, policies and personnel charged with patrolling the boundaries of citizenship in Europe. The issue is not (only) to explore and chart how social movements convened under an identity or sign that marks them as majority have or have not expanded in their orientation as a result of the challenge of those marked as minority. Nor is it (only) to explore similar processes (or not) of expansion to meet the claims of minoritized actors by the policy actors of other agents involved in practices of governance. To do so sustains a logic of expansion within a more or less stable framing of the problem space of claim and the space of negotiation in conditions of plurality and uncertainty. Rather, it is (also) to explore and chart how the practices of those deemed minor have resulted in a deterritorialization of the very frame and space of negotiation. How, for example, what constitutes women’s movements, or anti-racist movements, or feminism or indeed citizenship itself is displaced and replaced/reframed. In such a move recognition of the irreducible insiderness of the ‘minor’ in the ‘major’ is not foreclosed and the logics of enquiry and possibilities of embedded in the conceptual categories deployed are held intact.</p>
<p>The Sun Ra Arkestra tells that <italic>Space is the place</italic> where the unknown and its potentialities for newly crafted selves and possibilities of encounter might be made and maybe if we dare Europe could be such a space/place – so long as we maintain the integrity of our conceptual tools with the same precision and care as we try to apply to our politics and desires.</p>
