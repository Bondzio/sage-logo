<p>This is an important book for group analysis. After many years of practice, training and reflection, no doubt plenty of discussion with colleagues and more self-reflection, Tom Ormay has written a book that provides group analysis with something that it has definitely been lacking since Foulkes wrote his first essays, which is a worthy extension to Freud’s second model of the mind. It is pitched at the same level of theoretical seriousness as Freud’s <italic>The Ego and the Id</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0533316412453912">1923</xref>). He incorporates into Freud’s tripartite theory of the model of the human mind what it has lacked since its inception in 1923, the group or social self as a grounded theoretical concept that is now also backed by neuro-scientific research. He has named this concept <italic>nos</italic>, from the Latin. Despite the avoidance of the colloquial—no ‘we-ness’ or ‘us-ness’—<italic>nos</italic> seems right, in using a word from an old shared language across the European sub-continent and the world for 1500 years, and which still has immediate recognition and currency in many Romance languages around the world.</p>
<p>The book is immediately different; no other group-analytic text starts each chapter with not only epigrams and epigraphs but entire poems or a large section of a poetic speech: with such meaningful flourishes does Tom Ormay announce his chapters. Each is pertinent to the matter of each chapter, which flags our interest in both what he has to say and links to the poetic and creative in humanity and not solely the scientific or the scientistic.</p>
<p>In his time as a group-analyst and as refugee from the Hungarian uprising in 1956, and grounded in the Marxist socialist teaching of the Hungarian State University, he came to know group analysis as a therapeutic method and hermeneutic learning situation. He qualified as a psychotherapist and then as a group analyst at IGA (London), and taught in several colleges while also conducting therapeutic and experiential groups. Like so many group analysts he wondered at what it was that groups provided for their members that was not covered by the textbooks in a theoretical way. Foulkes and his followers certainly knew that groups stimulated change—usually creatively though sometimes destructively—but there seemed still only the framework left by Freud with which to describe the personality. Freud’s two models of mind, (1) the topographical model of conscious, subconscious and unconscious becoming ever deeper; and (2) the id, ego and superego, still dominated how psychoanalytic therapists and group analysts understood the human interactive mind. Such models require mental and linguistic gymnastics in order that they might describe how individuals related to one another and to the group as a whole. Ormay came to realize that there was something missing that needed separating out, analysing and describing. What seemed missing was a social instinct that was of the same status as id, ego and superego, and that did not damage Freud’s existing structure while extending its range into territory that accepted and honoured the social instinct in humanity.</p>
<p>Ormay’s model acknowledges what is integral to psychoanalytic and therapeutic language, indeed it is part of the language of most psychology and psychiatry texts. Id as unconscious is firmly in place; ego is ‘me as I understand myself and my abilities and shortcomings’; superego is parental and social pressure to conform to basic norms. Superego largely needs diminishing in the journey to adulthood due to its demanding nature; a main reason for the lived experience of adolescence is to achieve that. At a mature level as an adult, social reality and social norms are undeniably present not only as expectations to keep to but also as a body of pressure that one interacts with. If ego is all each of us amounts to, we have little indeed. Ormay posits <italic>nos</italic> as the present and later replacement for superego, as that invisible and powerful ‘social’ fourth factor in the psychic constitution of any individual and any group.</p>
<p>Freud’s conception of ego, while it has been almost universally accepted, was nevertheless founded upon the 19th and 20th centuries’ model of what capitalism expects an individual to be: a fully functioning and autonomous entity—‘me-against-the-world’—who achieves by acting in his own right after his own reflection and decision, an entrepreneur to his actions and his own soul: Daniel Defoe wrote about him—created him? —in ‘Robinson Crusoe’. Such a person is isolated and easily overwhelmed by prevailing circumstances (read Joseph Conrad’s take on Decoud’s isolated island living in <italic>Nostromo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412453912">1904</xref>)). Foulkes identified this in 1948 when asking ‘Where had the idea of the individual come from?’ but he left the question hanging. That the achievement and maintenance of ego as sole target of all psychiatry and most psychotherapy nowadays, unassisted by other humans in at least its formally recognized guises, is a stark indicator of how restrictive has been ego’s rule for the last 100 years. In the UK, the NIHCE concentration on symptomology and the ‘discovery’ of ever more categories and sub-categories of illness with their accompanying numbered classifications—the psychiatric equivalent of the ward round’s ‘the renal failure in room 14 . . . the hernia in room 18’—suggests that the mental health of the isolated individual will be dominated for some time yet by the autonomy model of psychological health.</p>
<p>Ormay explains himself with erudition, wide reading and considerable authority from several areas of learning, knitting together the latest learning on genetics and bio-analysis, seeking knowledge that demonstrates the rightness of psychoanalysis and group analysis 50–100 years before any laboratory came up with definitive proof. Hungary is rich with new learning on neurobiology and brain research and he uses this recent knowledge to bear out his argument for <italic>nos</italic> as a biological social instinct. We cannot live without one another and living with one another needs acknowledging as a right and proper and evolutionary process for humans to engage in. Therapeutic groups regularly provide all who conduct them with ample evidence of their beneficial containing properties, the opportunities for members to engage with one another in leisure and anger, argument and consolation, boredom and discontent, grief and joy.</p>
<p>The book is composed of nine chapters. Tom is a poet himself and translates poetry between Hungarian and English. He outlines the current situation and then proceeds through the chapters to describe in detail what he sees as the shortcomings of the current model followed by and interspersed with detailed description of how the idea of <italic>nos</italic> alters how we can understand ourselves and understand our patients and clients. Part I works through ‘Instincts and psycho-analysis’ and ‘Instincts and group-analysis’. Part II investigates ‘The Meaning of <italic>NOS</italic>’, including a long chapter on <italic>nos</italic> and group-analysis, while Part III provides both a definition of <italic>nos</italic> across a full range of different functions and Ferenczi’s 1932 notes that have a considerable taste of group analysis in them. Most interestingly Ferenczi notes the link that the then prevailing idea of ego had to the concept
<disp-quote><p>“. . . of <italic>autarchy</italic> according to which an isolated part of the world-total (organism) possesses in itself—as far as possible—independent of its environment, all the conditions for its own existence or development and tries to preserve them. The corresponding scientific attitude is extreme materialism and mechanism (Freud), and denial of the real existence of ‘groups’ (family, nation, horde, mankind, etc, Roheim).” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0533316412453912">Ormay, 2012</xref>: 184).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This personalised idea of autarchy has a sense of spiritual apartheid about it, that the individual can only announce him/herself as an individual when s/he thrives quite separately from any other person close to them.</p>
<p>Tom Ormay pulls us into the worlds of philosophy, psychoanalysis and group analysis. Freud’s group thinking, Ferenczi’s brief prefiguring of group analysis, the phenomenology of the self from Husserl and Heidegger, Elias’s sociology and Foulkes’ radical aspects of group analysis; he involves us in the explanation of <italic>nos</italic> as our elemental social function that has not had due recognition in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis since their inception. All has been dominated by the nursing couple of mother and baby in isolation, and not seen fully as happening itself within a familial and social setting. The achievement of a functioning ego—‘Where id is, there ego shall be’—as the <italic>sine qua non</italic> of human personal achievement has its limitations illuminated while the restrictions imposed by manoeuvring around outdated linguistic ties of ego and id and superego and their sub-categories, are exposed. Now this might be rendered, ‘Where id and superego are, there ego and nos shall be’. Ormay posits that <italic>nos</italic> will provide us with a collective configuration that reconfigures the individual into the figure-and-ground that is otherwise lacking; a place in the world of people, and in the cosmos, thus avoiding the chaos of man alone and unredeemed.</p>
