<sec id="sec19-0036933013482634">
<title>Background and aim</title>
<p>To determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) initiation in people with diabetes is monitored as recommended by recent guidelines and the incidence of associated adverse renal events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-0036933013482634">
<title>Design</title>
<p>Retrospective population database analysis of 4056 people in Tayside, Scotland with type 2 diabetes prescribed an ACEI/ARB between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2009.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-0036933013482634">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Measurement of urea and electrolytes (U&amp;Es) before and after ACEI/ARB initiation and renal adverse events; defined as a ≥30% rise in serum creatinine and post-initiation potassium of ≥5.6 mmol/L. Associations of adverse events with patient demographics or co-prescription of drugs with known renal effects were examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-0036933013482634">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Overall, 89% of initiations were with an ACE inhibitor. A total of 18.84% (CI 95% 18.82–18.86) of patients initiating ACE inhibitor or ARB had U&amp;Es measured in the 90 days before initiation and within 5–14 days after initiation. Only 1.7% of patients had an adverse renal event. Patients prescribed with an ARB were less likely to be monitored than those prescribed with an ACE inhibitor, but no less likely to suffer harm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0036933013482634">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Current clinical practice of biochemical monitoring of ACE inhibitor/ARB is poor, but adverse events are rare. Further studies with serial U&amp;Es are needed to establish the critical time window for adverse renal events and evaluate whether intensive biochemical monitoring recommended is required in low-risk groups.</p>

<p>Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are frequently used to treat a range of conditions including hypertension, diabetic nephropathy and left ventricular dysfunction. Both classes of drugs have potentially serious adverse renal effects, including deterioration in renal function and hyperkalaemia which can be life threatening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482634">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0036933013482634"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482634">7</xref></sup> A variety of national guidelines recommend that renal function should be checked before and within 1–2 weeks of ACEI/ARB initiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482634">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482634"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482634">4</xref></sup> Indications for stopping an ACEI/ARB are a rise in serum potassium to greater than 6.0 mmol/L providing other drugs known to promote hyperkalaemia have been discontinued, and a rise in creatinine of ≥30% from baseline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482634">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482634">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482634">4</xref></sup> However, previous studies have shown that less than one-third of patients had adequate monitoring, that many general practitioners (GPs) did not regularly monitor renal function even in ‘high-risk’ groups, and that GPs are less likely than specialists to monitor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482634">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482634">9</xref></sup> Risk factors include increasing age, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, congestive cardiac failure, renal dysfunction, raised pre-treatment potassium and co-prescription of spironolactone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482634">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0036933013482634"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0036933013482634">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The documented incidence of adverse renal events varies widely within the literature, complicated by the lack of consistent definition of hyperkalemia and wide variations in the study cohort populations. An ambulatory study of US veterans described a hyperkalaemia prevalence of 11% in patients prescribed with ACEI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0036933013482634">19</xref></sup> while the CHARM and SOLVD studies in patients with symptomatic heart failure documented incidences of clinically important hyperkalaemia of 5.2% and 6.4% over a 4- and 2-year period, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0036933013482634">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0036933013482634">14</xref></sup> More recently a large-scale US study of initiation of ACEI/ARBs in diabetic patients documented an incidence of hyperkalaemia of 0.7% and suggested that monitoring reduced the incidence of hyperkalaemia adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0036933013482634">11</xref></sup> From the literature it remains unclear how common harm is in the primary care population and how often harm occurs around the time of initiation, as published studies are often of annual monitoring rather than monitoring at initiation.</p>
<p>This study aims to measure adherence to current recommendations for monitoring ACEI/ARB initiation in people with type 2 diabetes, a known high-risk group, to determine the proportion of patients who develop adverse renal outcomes at the time of initiation, and to examine associations of both with patient characteristics.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0036933013482634"><title>Patients and variables</title>
<p>Fully anonymised linked data were obtained from the University of Dundee Health Informatics Centre (HIC), which holds linked data for all residents of the Tayside region of Scotland on community-dispensed prescriptions, laboratory test results and the regional diabetes register (SCI-DC). All people with type 2 diabetes recorded on SCI-DC with a first prescription for an ACEI or an ARB between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2009 were identified. ACEI were defined as drugs in British National Formulary (BNF) chapter 2.5.5.1 and ARB as drugs in BNF chapter 2.5.5.2. Each patient could only be included once (a patient who discontinued an ACEI and started an ARB would only be included for the ACEI initiation). For each patient, age in years at initiation, sex and postcode-assigned Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) score were extracted. Age and SIMD were treated as categorical variables in all analyses. For each patient, prescriptions for other drugs with significant renal effects were extracted (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) BNF 10.1.1 and diuretics BNF 2.2). Co-prescription at the time of initiation was defined as relevant drugs being prescribed within both the 84 days before <italic>and</italic> the 84 days after the first prescription for an ACE/ARB. Finally, laboratory data on all serum potassium and creatinine measurements were extracted, irrespective of whether GP or hospital requested. Data were linked by HIC and anonymised before being passed to the researchers. Research Ethics Service review of the project was not required because all linkage and anonymisation followed HIC Standard Operating Procedures, which have been approved by the NHS Tayside Research Ethics Committee and Caldicott Guardian.</p>
<p>For each patient, four binary outcomes were measured. Adequate pre-monitoring of renal function was defined as the presence of a serum creatinine measurement (as a proxy for urea and electrolyte (U&amp;Es)) in the 90 days before initiation. Appropriate post-initiation monitoring was defined as measurement of serum creatinine within 5–14 days of prescription date. Two adverse renal outcomes were defined: hyperkalaemia (potassium ≥5.6 mmol/L) and a rise in serum creatinine of ≥30%. Analysis of adverse renal outcomes used laboratory data from patients who had U&amp;Es measured up to 180 days before initiation <italic>and</italic> within 5–56 days after initiation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0036933013482634"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>Univariate associations between outcomes and a range of potential independent variables were examined using univariate logistic regression. Multivariate analysis was performed using stepwise logistic regression to examine adjusted associations. All analyses were conducted in SPSS v17.0 (www.spss.com/uk).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0036933013482634" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>During the 5-year study period, 4056 people with type 2 diabetes were initiated on an ACEI/ARB. Mean age was 65.2 years (95% CI 64.8–65.6), 54.9% (95% CI 53.5–56.4) of the study population were male and 88.9% (95% CI 88.4–89.4%) were prescribed an ACEI at initiation. Mean time since diagnosis of diabetes was 3.88 years (95% CI 3.83–3.93). Almost one-third of patients (31.1%, 95% CI 29.4–31.8) were in deprivation quintile 4 of SIMD5. The rest of the patients were spread evenly throughout the other quintiles. Eleven percent (<italic>n</italic> = 450) of patients were prescribed an ARB, the remainder were prescribed an ACEI.</p>
<p>U&amp;Es were measured in 69.2% (95% CI 68.5–69.9) of patients in the 90 days before starting treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0036933013482634">Table 1</xref>). With increasing age, a patient was more likely to have their U&amp;Es measured pre-treatment, but there was no association with sex or deprivation. Co-prescription of other drugs affecting renal function was not significantly associated with U&amp;E measurement pre-initiation, but patients initiated on ARBs were less likely to have pre-treatment monitoring. After adjustment, patients were significantly less likely to have their U&amp;Es measured if initiated on an ARB compared to an ACEI (64.2% vs ACE 69.8% adjusted OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61–0.92), whereas older patients were more likely (aged 80 and over 74.9% vs 65.9% aged &lt;60, adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.22–1.96).

<p>A total of 2488 patients had a serum potassium measurement in the 5–56 days after ACEI/ARB initiation, of whom 41 (1.65%, 95% CI 1.64–1.66) developed a potassium ≥5.6 mmol/L (Table 4). Three patients had a potassium of 7 mmol/L or more, 11 patients 6–6.9 mmol/L and 27 5.6–5.9 mmol/L. A total of 1897 patients had a valid serum potassium measurement in the 180 days before initiation <italic>and</italic> the 5–56 days after initiation (the difference from serum creatinine being likely due to haemolysis of old samples preventing potassium measurement). Thirty-two (1.69%, 95% CI 1.67–1.70) developed a potassium ≥5.6 mmol/L, of whom 2 had a potassium of 7 mmol/L or more, 8 patients 6–6.9 mmol/L and 22 5.6–5.9 mmol/L. Three variables were associated with a post-initiation potassium ≥5.6 mmol/L: being on a loop diuretic before and after initiation (adjusted OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.44–8.31); having a pre-initiation potassium of ≥5.1 mmol/L or more (adjusted OR 9.39, 95% CI 4.34–10.31); and having a pre-initiation creatinine ≥150 µmol/L (adjusted OR 7.29, 95% CI 2.80–19.01). Only 17 of the 32 (53.1%) patients with hyperkalaemia post-initiation had one or more of these risk factors, and 4 of the 10 patients with potassium ≥6 mmol/L had none of them, meaning that focusing monitoring only on these patients would not be safe. However, only 2 patients aged less than 60 had hyperkalaemia (neither with any risk factors, but both a post-initiation potassium of 5.6 mmol/L), indicating that a combination of age and specific risk factors might be able to identify a very low-risk group.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0036933013482634"><title>Summary of main findings</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that 81% of patients initiated on ACEI/ARB and considered to be at high renal risk by virtue of having diabetes were suboptimally monitored compared to national guideline recommendations, primarily because of lack of post-initiation U&amp;E.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482634">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482634"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482634">4</xref></sup> Patients prescribed with an ARB were significantly less likely to be monitored both pre- and post-initiation. However, less than 2% of patients developed either significant hyperkalaemia (potassium ≥5.6 mmol/L) or a significant rise in creatinine. Co-prescription of a loop diuretic, a pre-treatment potassium ≥5.1 mmol/L and pre-treatment creatinine ≥150 µmol/L were all associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia. Loop diuretic prescription is probably a marker for more severe cardiovascular disease (heart failure in particular) rather than a direct drug interaction. Older people had an increased risk of a ≥30% increase in creatinine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0036933013482634"><title>Comparison with existing literature</title>
<p>Encouragingly pre-initiation monitoring has significantly improved since the 1999 study of Kalra et al.; 45% at 3 months compared to 69.2% at 90 days in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482634">8</xref></sup> Almost all patients in this study (94%) had their U&amp;Es measured at some point pre-initiation, a large improvement from the 49% of patients in the previous study who did not have any monitoring of renal function pre-ACEI/ARB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482634">8</xref></sup> Post-initiation monitoring has also improved, with 70% of patients (2840/4056) in this study having had their U&amp;Es measured within 90 days of commencing an ACEI/ARB, compared to 29% in the previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482634">8</xref></sup> but it remains concerning that less than a third had their U&amp;Es measured within 5–14 days. These figures are similar to a recently published Dutch study but our study uses a narrower monitoring window as recommended by current national guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482634">9</xref></sup> With increasing age, patients are more likely to have co-morbidities and intercurrent illnesses and may therefore have more opportunities to have their U&amp;Es measured. This may explain why increasing age is associated with increased monitoring of U&amp;Es pre-initiation, although absolute differences with age are small. The presence of other markers of increased renal risk including drug co-prescription and pre-initiation hyperkalaemia and raised serum creatinine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482634">1</xref></sup> was not associated with higher rates of monitoring, implying that monitoring is haphazard rather than targeted. The low incidence of significant renal complications may be one reason why monitoring is relatively poor, since GPs will not commonly see problems post-initiation. The less frequent monitoring of ARB is not justified by any evidence of lower risk of adverse renal events.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies identifying higher risk groups for renal adverse events (elderly, elevated pre-treatment creatinine or potassium).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482634">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482634">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0036933013482634">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0036933013482634">20</xref></sup> Although we did not find that co-prescription of other renal active drugs was associated with post-initiation complications, few patients received such drugs and the study is therefore underpowered to detect even quite large associations. The widespread variation in published incidences of hyperkalaemia is likely due to different definitions of hyperkalaemia, and to variation in the population studied. The CHARM study describes a higher incidence, but participants had symptomatic heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0036933013482634">10</xref></sup> A study in American veterans found a prevalence of 11% having potassium &gt;5.1 mmol/L, although &lt;2% when the measured outcome was potassium ≥5.6 mmol/L whereas Raebel et al. described an incidence of 0.7% based on an endpoint of potassium &gt;6.0 mmol/L together with hospitalisation, emergency department visit and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0036933013482634">11</xref></sup> A recent Dutch study using a 3-week post-initiation window suggested an incidence of adverse renal outcome of 11%, but used a creatinine rise ≥25% and potassium ≥5.4 mmol/L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482634">9</xref></sup> Despite differing end points, our study is generally consistent with the previously documented incidence of hyperkalemia in ambulatory studies but crucially our study focuses on whether monitoring occurs in the recommended monitoring period covering initiation as this is when the risk of nephrotoxicity is thought to be greatest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482634">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0036933013482634">19</xref></sup> Arguably, a potassium ≥5.6 is less clinically significant than a potassium ≥6.1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482634">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0036933013482634">19</xref></sup> but there were too few patients developing severe hyperkalaemia to meaningfully analyse, even in a study of this size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0036933013482634"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
<p>Our study is the first to assess renal monitoring of patients initiated on ACEI/ARBs as recommended by national guidelines, and therefore used narrower monitoring windows than previous studies. It uses outcomes that are significant in clinical practice, and focuses on monitoring in diabetic patients who are a known high-risk group. However, we were only able to consider adverse renal outcomes on around 50% of the study population because many patients were not monitored, or had haemolysed samples meaning that serum potassium was not measured. Unless these patients died suddenly out of hospital from a hyperkalaemia-induced cardiac arrest, it is unlikely that they developed major adverse outcomes since hospital attendance almost always involves measurement of U&amp;Es. We were also unable to identify whether the ACEI/ARB were initiated within the hospital environment, therefore it would theoretically be possible for their post-initiation U&amp;Es to be measured as an inpatient (although the majority of admissions are too short for this to happen). Our data are also based only on the patient’s first U&amp;Es post-initiation and did not consider subsequent U&amp;Es, potentially missing later adverse renal outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0036933013482634"><title>Implications for future research or clinical practice</title>
<p>In summary, clinical practice of biochemical monitoring of ACEI/ARB has improved but remains sub-optimal, and high-risk groups identified in previous studies were no more likely to be monitored. However, adverse events were rare. Laboratory monitoring of medications is expensive and time consuming for primary care staff and patients, and guidelines for monitoring are often based on consensus opinions with limited evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482634">2</xref></sup> Given this, perhaps now is the time to consider whether current monitoring guidelines appropriately balance cost and benefit to both patient and the health service. Large-scale studies with serial measurement of U&amp;Es after ACEI/ARB initiation in people with a range of underlying conditions would be required to examine whether it is possible to stratify the risk of renal complications well enough to differentially monitor patients, and to assess the cost effectiveness of different monitoring regimes, particularly in younger people without pre-existing renal disease.</p>
