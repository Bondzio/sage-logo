<p>In this book the author, Professor Seyed Javad Miri, does exactly what the title suggests; the work is indeed a thoughtful and critical introduction to the philosophy of Allama MT Jafari. Miri’s book offers a philosophical anthropology that, if taken seriously, could become the basis for cross-cultural conversations among Western and Islamic sociologists seeking to find common ground for critical sociology. To that end Miri is unafraid to develop such concepts as ‘human being’, ‘human nature’, and the ‘human condition’ by drawing on a wisdom tradition that long predates Biblical and Islamic cultures and makes any notion of a clash of civilizations seem antique.</p> <p>For Miri, the task of a critical sociology requires the sociologist to inquire just how a social order reflects and enhances or diminishes and demeans human beings. Human beings, moreover, embody a wisdom that is fundamentally metaphysical. That is, human nature is oriented toward a virtue that far predates any of the cultural deposits we now associate with one or another religious tradition. The nature of the human is to employ reason in the service of virtue: to realize the possibilities for humanity that are both ancient and universal. In Old Persian, as Miri points out, there is one word that connotes both conscience and religion.</p> <p>The task of a critical sociology, then, is to see to what extent the human is permitted or valued, sacrificed or enshrined within any social order. Because the human condition is marked by a fundamental differentiation between what is and what ought to be, it is all the more incumbent on sociologists to fully understand what is possible, and what is missing in any social order with regard not only to human happiness but to the soul.</p> <p>How could any sociologist, Muslim or Christian, understand the thousands upon thousands of individuals who march in Syria chanting that they are the boy whose mutilated body was returned to his father by Syrian intelligence, or the tens of thousands who chanted that they are the young Tunisian vendor who immolated himself in protest against the repression and corruption of the Tunisian regime? How could a critical sociology other than one fully versed in ‘philosophical and religious conceptions of existence … conceptions of humanity, the existence of Gods, the soul, and the afterlife’ (p. 66) understand how a society could be moved by a punk band whose members are in jail for blasphemy, having danced in a Moscow cathedral while imploring the Mother of God to drive Putin from office?</p> <p>Miri challenges sociologists to consider the human subject as equipped with body, psyche, and soul. Without such concepts, I would agree, sociologists will not understand what is at stake as thousands in Moscow chant ‘We exist’ while holding over their heads iPods instead of the traditional icons. They will not understand loneliness and despair or the revolutionary potential of the sacred in modern societies.</p> <p>Miri offers sociologists a chance to restore a notion of the individual to the center of any critical sociology that seeks both to chart the sacrifices required by modernity and to imagine the possibilities for human community and connection that transcend every known religious or cultural, political or social difference. At the very least, Western sociologists who read and are moved by Miri’s book will seek every opportunity for conversation with Miri and his Iranian colleagues. In the interest of full disclosure, I wish to add that Professor Miri has arranged for the translation into the Persian of a book I have written on <italic>Key Thinkers in the Sociology of Religion</italic>. His commitment to a cross-cultural conversation with sociologists will enable us all to rethink the assumptions and categories which we bring to the understanding of tradition and modernity, the sacred and the secular. Central to that rethinking will be a reimagination of the possibilities that we assume to be embedded in human beings. That task is now more pressing than ever, given the revolutionary potential of many current conflicts that are as global as they are regional.</p>
