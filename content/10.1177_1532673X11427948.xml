<abstract>
<p>Party identification is notoriously “sticky,” yet over the last three decades the California electorate has changed tremendously. A once red state has become one of the most reliable Democratic strongholds in the nation. What explains this change? One common explanation rests with population shifts and macropartisan trends. Another claims the combination of a rapidly expanding Latino electorate and a series of high-profile anti-immigrant ballot initiatives supported by the state’s Republicans drove partisan change in California. Building off of previous research, we seek to reconcile the differential impacts of these factors on the state’s Latinos and non-Hispanic Whites. Our analyses partially confirm and clarify previous findings regarding Latino partisan change, while directly challenging findings regarding partisan change among non-Hispanic Whites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>California, the land of Reagan and long a Republican stronghold in presidential elections, turned an increasingly dark shade of blue in recent years. Since 1992, Democrats have not lost the state and Barack Obama won a whopping 62% of the two-party vote in the 2008 Presidential election. The conventional wisdom about this rising blue tide is that the California electorate has changed tremendously, largely though migration and immigration. Furthermore, the ballot-initiative process compounded these effects as policies proffered by California Republicans—notably anti-immigrant and antiaffirmative action laws—severed bridges that might have brought the emergent Latino electorate into the Republican fold. In addition, these race-baiting initiatives have turned off non-Hispanic Whites, leading to a further marginalization of the Republican brand among all voters in the state. Taken together, these trends place Republicans at a significant disadvantage not only in California politics but also in the race for the nation’s richest electoral prize.</p>
<p>Of course, acceptance of the conventional wisdom has a number of theoretically important implications for students of American politics. First and foremost, it suggests that flows into, out of, and within states and localities have meaningful effects for political systems. Furthermore, it examines the strategic choice parties face when new electoral groups emerge. Should they pursue policies designed to appeal to these emerging electorates, or should they back policies inimical to the emerging group’s interests, yet designed to appeal to older, more established electoral groups? Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it breathes new life into the controversial study of party identification because it indicates that state-level processes can alter the partisan composition of the electorate. As such, state-level factors potentially affect national politics and, although this story is Californian, these findings are all potentially exportable to other states undergoing rapid demographic changes, especially those where the ballot initiative is used.</p>
<p>To be sure, some research has attempted to address these questions; however, systematic empirical testing of these propositions has focused overwhelmingly on California-specific reasons for changes in party identification. If there are indeed California-specific reasons for the dominance of the Democratic Party over the past two decades, then we must be able to uncover evidence that this process diverges from general national trends. Otherwise, the importance of state-level determinants of party identification uncovered in previous work may be undermined.</p>
<p>Building off of the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11427948">Bowler, Nicholson, and Segura (2006)</xref>, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11427948">Korey and Lascher (2006)</xref> and others, using Field poll data from 1980 to 2002, we model partisan change in California as a function of national partisan change, a rapidly changing electorate, individual-level determinants (e.g. ideology and socioeconomics), and reaction to a series of ballot measures which were directed at the emergent Latino immigrant population in the state during the 1990s. Our findings clarify and confirm certain findings in previous work, while offering several notable amendments along the way. In general, we conclude that Latinos, while already moving toward the Democratic Party in California in the early 1990s, reacted negatively to the Republican Party’s sponsorship of Proposition 187 and others. Notably, Latino party identification appears to move independently of national trends in party identification and to be considerably more volatile. For Whites, however, we find no evidence of a meaningful reaction to the racially and ethnically charged ballot measures of the 1990s, which contrasts with previous studies. Indeed, White party identification tracks national trends much more closely than Latino party identification, and Republican losses among Latinos were not offset by electoral gains among non-Hispanic Whites. Consequently, these findings also address the relative “stickiness” of party identification as well as the distinctive nature of party identification acquisition among immigrant and nonimmigrant groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1532673X11427948">
<title>Party Identification Change: Macropartisanship, Ballot Initiatives, and Ethnicity</title>
<p>The central concern of this study is to explain the apparent growth of the Democratic Party’s advantage in California. Our theoretic contributions are threefold. First, our analysis addresses a common concern regarding the durability of party identification and the “macropartisanship” claim that party identification is continuously updated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X11427948">Johnston, 2006</xref>). Based on this, changes in party identification in California’s electorate are only interesting insofar as they are away-from-national-trend estimates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11427948">Korey and Lascher (2006)</xref> do account for this, noting that the overall trends appear to be similar, but that the 1990s surge in Democratic party identification in California appears to outpace the national trend.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532673X11427948">1</xref></sup> They do not, however, attempt to definitively tease out the cause of the over-time trend toward the Democratic Party. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11427948">Bowler et al. (2006)</xref> connect the movement toward the Democratic Party in the 1990s not to national-level “macropartisanship” factors but rather to anti-immigrant and anti-affirmative action ballot propositions.</p>
<p>The literature, however, dictates caution when considering a state-level explanation of partisan change. Party identification is remarkably stable, with large changes typically occurring only in response to major national events, or gradually over a long period of time. Identification implies just what it says—identity—which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11427948">Green, Palmquist, and Schickler (2002)</xref> juxtapose with the much more malleable concept of “evaluations.” Of course, others have argued that partisanship is not entirely stable, and changes occur in predictable ways in response to the political environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532673X11427948">Erikson, MacKuen, &amp; Stimson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X11427948">Fiorina, 1981</xref>). Although the causes of partisan change remain contested, scholars are in general agreement that large shifts are uncommon, highlighting their importance if and when they do occur. Moreover, most arguments about partisan change focus on how it occurs in response to the complex political environment and overlapping debates that occur about national politics (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X11427948">Carmines &amp; Stimson, 1989</xref>). Further buttressing this claim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11427948">Green et al. (2002)</xref> find no distinction between a person’s state party identification and their national party identification. Given the preeminence of national politics, shifts in partisan change are usually thought to originate at that level. To be sure, the influential work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X11427948">Erikson, Wright, and McIver (1993</xref>) also demonstrates that state effects can and do affect state party identification cross-sectionally. Although their models do not test for dynamic changes, Erikson et al. do note that “the pattern . . . does not dictate that state electorates frequently change their partisan character in response to short term ideological maneuvering by state parties.” Rather, “it represents the influence of state party positions over the long haul” (p. 133). Although this provides a strong theoretic basis for the idea that state macropartisanship is responsive to state-level factors, it is less clear that we should expect short-term forces and policy posturing via the initiative process to prompt partisan change.</p>
<p>Irrespective of long- or short-term state effects, national shifts in party identification may have important implications for California’s changing electorate. For all Californians, the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, himself a Californian and popular former two-term Governor, may have moved them toward the Republican Party. Relatedly, national trends in party identification demonstrate not only an increase in support for the Republican Party during the 1980s but also a marked decline in support for the Democratic Party. Although more than 40% of the national electorate identified as Democratic throughout the 1970s, Democratic identification dipped below 30% by the mid-1990s (Gallup various years) before rebounding later in the decade. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11427948">Korey and Lascher (2006)</xref> demonstrate that macropartisanship in California seems to have trended Republican from 1980 to 1991 but shifted toward the Democratic Party starting in 1992. These trends beg further empirical examination to see if changes in party identification among California’s populace are predictable with national trend changes.</p>
<p>Our second contribution to the theory of party identification change focuses on the distinct processes by which non-Hispanic White and Latino party identification shift in response to these national forces. We know that non-Hispanic Whites in California are substantially older than other ethnic groups, with 41% above the age of 45. Given the trend in national politics of White, older voters moving toward the Republican Party since the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11427948">Abramowitz &amp; Saunders, 2006</xref>), this may also explain the drift of California’s non-Hispanic Whites into the Grand Old Party (GOP). It is also important, however, to keep in mind that this segment of the population has continued to decline relative to other ethnic groups from 1980 to 2000, going from 75% of the population to just 43% in 2006 (U.S. Census Bureau, various years).</p>
<p>These same national trends may have also affected party identification among California’s burgeoning Latino population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532673X11427948">2</xref></sup> On one hand, research has argued that Latino party identification is less stable than for other segments of the population. This is because (a) the foundations of Latino partisanship are largely political and (b) Latinos do not share the long or common history of partisanship of other groups (e.g., Whites and Blacks). As research has continued to show, much of partisan identification is transferred socially, either through parents or significant life events shared by generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532673X11427948">Campbell, Converse, Miller, &amp; Stokes, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11427948">Green et al., 2002</xref>). Immigrants and their children are less likely to acquire firm party attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11427948">Cain, Kiewiet, &amp; Uhlaner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532673X11427948">Uhlaner &amp; Garcia, 2005</xref>) and more likely to change their party loyalties due to a lack of affective bond to parties provided by parental socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X11427948">McAllister &amp; Makkai, 1991</xref>). As a result, Latino voters may be particularly receptive to changes in national macropartisanship.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a strong a priori expectation that the Latino electorate in California may have been fundamentally altered starting in the early 1990s due to a new generation of U.S.-born Latinos as well as increased naturalization rates for foreign-born Latinos. This may have been due to the Immigration Control and Reform Act of 1986 (although evidence on the direct impact of IRCA has been muted), which offered a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the 1980s. From 1980 to 2000, the Latino share of the state’s population grew from 19.2% to 32.4%. Furthermore, the percentage of registered Latinos in California steadily increased during the 1980s and 1990s, from approximately 8% in 1984 to 15% in 2000 (Gey, Jiang, Stiles, &amp; Einowski, 2004). This trend is even more impressive, substantively, when considering it outstripped the growth of the Latino population during the same period. What sparked this rise in registration is debatable but is likely the confluence of the addition of eligible voters and Latino opposition to the state’s anti-immigration ballot initiatives in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532673X11427948">Barreto, Ramírez, &amp; Woods, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532673X11427948">3</xref></sup> When these citizens registered to vote also reveals a great deal of information about the makeup of the Latino electorate. For instance, of those who registered after 1994, 50% were between the ages of 18 and 29 compared with just 9% of prior registrants. In addition, almost 50% were foreign born, unlike those registered before 1994 where only 12% were immigrants. Moreover, recent registrants were less educated and less wealthy than those Latinos registered prior to 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X11427948">The Field Institute, 2000</xref>). Overall, these demographic data indicate a swelling of the Californian Latino electorate in the past 15 or 20 years that is larger in numbers, younger, more likely to be foreign born, less educated, and less wealthy, relative to older Latino voters. The combination of these characteristics would seem to suggest that the Democratic Party would be more appealing to newer Latino voters than older Latino voters and that California’s Latinos might resist national trends in macropartisanship.</p>
<p>The final contribution we make to the theory of change in party identification focuses specifically on the potentially distinct effect of parties’ position-taking on policies of interest to emerging versus older electoral groups. As new voting groups emerge, parties may support policies that seek to incorporate these new groups, or they may support policies that marginalize these groups in an attempt to garner support from more established voting groups. Nixon’s Southern Strategy marginalized African American voters, yet these lost votes were more than offset by Republican vote gains among White voters in the South (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X11427948">Polsby &amp; Wildavsky, 1971</xref>). At the state level, California’s frequent use of the ballot initiative gives parties an additional tool to mobilize or marginalize voting groups. It is entirely possible that this common, subnational policymaking tool, addresses policy issues that are important enough to a substantial proportion of the state’s electorate to shift the underlying dynamics of party identification in the state.</p>
<p>What policy issue may have shocked California’s electorate? The 1980s witnessed the emergence of groups like U.S. English that sought to pass constitutional amendments at both the state and federal level declaring English to be the official language. These efforts, although not completely devoid of partisanship, were arguably less partisan and less political than those that would follow. For example, in 1986, Proposition 63 was placed on the ballot in California seeking to declare and preserve English as the official language of the state. It would ultimately pass with close to 75% of the vote. Two of its sponsors, writing in favor of the initiative on the actual voter’s guide, were Republican Senator and cofounder of U.S. English, S. I. Hayakawa and Stanley Diamond, chairman of the California English Campaign. Despite his friendship with Senator Hayakawa and being president of U.S. English at the time, Stanley Diamond was far from a Republican Party operative and only left the Democratic Party temporarily to support the efforts of his friend, returning later to endorse Barbara Boxer and Nancy Pelosi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X11427948">Nolte, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>By the early 1990s, however, a series of overtly anti-immigrant and anti-affirmative action initiatives sponsored by conservative groups and endorsed by prominent California Republicans such as Governor Pete Wilson began appearing on the ballot. The first of these, Proposition 187 in 1994, would have denied most social services to illegal immigrants and children of illegal immigrants, including access to public schools for U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. Proposition 187 passed easily with 59% of voters supporting the measure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532673X11427948">4</xref></sup> Typical racial/ethnic politics explanations for the vote have been supported in empirical research. A majority of Latinos opposed the proposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X11427948">Hajnal, Gerber, &amp; Louch, 2002</xref>), although non-Hispanic Whites supported it. Furthermore, a racial-threat explanation predicted White support for the measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X11427948">Alvarez &amp; Butterfield, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11427948">Branton, Dillingham, Dunaway, &amp; Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532673X11427948">Tolbert &amp; Hero, 1996</xref>). Courts were quick to rule the measure unconstitutional, and what was left in its stead were strained relationships between Whites and Latinos in California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11427948">Schrag, 1998</xref>). In the following two elections, two additional racially/ethnically charged initiatives passed muster with the voters. In 1996, affirmative action in state hiring and education was effectively ended with Proposition 209, and in 1998, bilingual education programs were ended with the passage of Proposition 227.</p>
<p>How might these ethnically/racially charged ballot propositions backed by conservative and Republican leaders influence party identification across California’s increasingly diverse ethnic groups? For non-Hispanic Whites, who voted for Proposition 187 by a whopping 28-point margin, we might expect these propositions to contribute to their move to the Republican Party. This corresponds with recent research showing that ballot measures can have spillover effects on voting for Republican or Democratic candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X11427948">Donovan, Tolbert, &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11427948">Nicholson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532673X11427948">Smith, DeSantis, &amp; Kassel, 2006</xref>). Alternatively, there is some theoretic footing for the notion that Whites might respond negatively to racially and ethnically charged issues that are explicit in their intent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532673X11427948">Mendelberg (2001)</xref> demonstrates that the race card is less effective when it is overt because of ambivalence about racially charged issues. If White Americans suspect that a candidate is making an explicitly racial appeal, this will violate norms of racial equality. Proposition 187, in particular, was an overt appeal to anti-immigrant sentiment. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11427948">Bowler et al. (2006)</xref>, using an individual-level design with aggregate trend measures for the presence of the ballot measures, find that non-Hispanic Whites moved toward the Democratic Party in response to Propositions 187, 209, and 227.</p>
<p>For California’s Latinos, these propositions may have nudged a quickly changing electorate into the arms of political party that largely opposed the initiatives, the Democrats. Many Latinos viewed these propositions not simply as anti-immigrant, but as anti-Latino, and the association of the Republican Party of California with these propositions combined with the socioeconomic characteristics mentioned previously might explain party change among Latinos. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11427948">Korey and Lascher (2006)</xref> conclude that party identification in California trended Democratic both because of a changing electorate and (potentially) because of a response to racially and ethnically charged ballot initiatives like Proposition 187, 209, and 227. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11427948">Bowler et al. (2006)</xref> find that Latinos moved strongly toward the Democratic Party in response to Propositions 187, 209, and 227.</p>
<p>Building on and extending this research, we now turn to testing the relative merit of national- and state-level political processes on party identification across California’s diverse population. Given recent changes in national macropartisanship, the continued growth of the Latino electorate, contentious debates about immigration policy in the halls of congress, and the continued presence of anti-immigrant ballot initiatives in states like Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, and Oregon, our research has important implications for the future of party identification in America.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1532673X11427948">
<title>Research Design and Data</title>
<p>To test these competing theories, our choice of data and models closely follow the important contributions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11427948">Korey and Lascher (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11427948">Bowler et al. (2006)</xref>. We draw on pooled cross-sectional data of 23 surveys over 23 years of the Field poll, a nonpartisan polling organization operating in California.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532673X11427948">5</xref></sup> Although there are some limits to using commercial polling data for academic purposes, the Field poll is by far the best time-series data resource for studying attitude change at the state level. Not only is its time-span unmatched within the state of California but accessing detailed state-level individual data is also not possible in the vast majority of states.</p>
<p>Specifically, we use data from the last Field poll of every survey year from 1980 to 2002. This choice allows us to demonstrate the ease of replicating models presented in previous studies, buttressing the confidence we have that our original results are not due to data-collection discrepancies. Particular issues regarding the replication are detailed in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1532673X11427948">appendix</xref>. We hasten to note that we can generate similar findings by substituting Field polls (e.g., by substituting the second to last poll from a given year) and therefore do not find that our results are sensitive to data choice.</p>
<p>Our unit of analysis is the individual. The dependent variable is coded as a 3-point scale of party identification: Democrat, independent, and Republican. It is possible that this coding misses a part of the story as it conflates leaners with pure independents, groups who are behaviorally quite distinct, and distinguishes between leaners and weak partisans, two groups that are behaviorally indistinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11427948">Keith et al., 1996</xref>). However, we also used an alternative coding of party identification using a 5-point scale that scored leaners the same as weak partisans. This alternative coding scheme did not substantively alter our results.</p>
<p>The central independent variable of interest for exposure to ballot initiatives in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11427948">Bowler et al. (2006)</xref> was an integer measure ranging from 0 to 3 based on the year of the survey. Respondents from 1980 to 1994 take on the value of 0, respondents after Proposition 187 in 1994 through 1996 take on the value of 1, respondents after Proposition 209 in 1996 through 1998 take on the value of 2, and respondents after Proposition 227 in 1998 through 2002 take on the value of 3.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532673X11427948">6</xref></sup> Control variables include the change in the unemployment rate and a respondent’s political ideology, age, level of education, income, and gender. The results are demonstrated using an “all respondents” model with additional dummy variables for Latinos and African Americans, followed by subsequent models for non-Hispanic Whites, Latinos, and African Americans, respectively. One control variable included in the model which deserves a more thorough discussion—time—is measured as a linear time trend from 1980 to 2002. To understand this, it is important to get a sense of how partisanship in California varied from 1980 to 2002 among Whites and Latinos.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532673X11427948">Figure 1</xref> presents the aggregation of the individual surveys by year to get a measure of macropartisanship of White Californians. The figure shows the variation between Republican, independent, and Democratic party identification by using cumulative percentages on the <italic>y</italic>-axis and year on the <italic>x</italic>-axis. Note that the stability in this trend is more pronounced than any underlying variation. To be sure, there is an apparent increase in Republican party identification during the 1980s that appears to have decayed entirely by 2002. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11427948">Korey and Lascher (2006)</xref>, we note that the trend appears to move toward the Democratic Party starting in 1991, prior to any of these propositions appearing before the California electorate. Contrast this with the movement in Latino party identification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1532673X11427948">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Consistent with the literature, Latino party identification seems to be far more volatile than non-Hispanic White partisanship. This is, of course, not all that surprising as Latinos would be less likely to have socialization influences which would deeply root their partisanship. Despite the more aggressive peaks and valleys in the trend, there is a similar overall relationship to the movement in White partisanship. Although Latino party identification is more Democratic over the entire time period, there is a clear trend toward the Republican Party in the 1980s, which appears to have reversed course in the early 1990s. Again, this movement back toward the Democratic Party seems to precede these anti-immigrant/anti-affirmative action propositions, though the trend appears to accelerate after Californians approved these measures. In addition, most of the volatility appears to occur between 1994 and 2000, which is consistent with the theory that states that Latino partisanship is more malleable; if party identification is more prone to change among Latinos, then we would expect to see volatility in the midst of political changes. To be sure, we can only speculate as to why we see a spike in Democratic identification in 1996 that falls off in 1997 and then reappears in 1998, but it likely has something to do with the campaign-specific forces at work.</p>
<p>While these distributions give us a sense of what to expect in the multivariate analysis, more to point, we get a clearer picture of what the imposition of a linear time trend will do in this data set. Both of these distributions are parabolic, not linear. Therefore, the imposition of a time trend, using an ordinal variable to account for response to Propositions 187, 209, and 227, will pick up the time trend apparent in the data for the zero category (1980-1994) and leave the explanatory power of the propositions variable to pick up the upswing in trend. This is not a problem, per se, if we a priori anticipate that partisanship has been trending toward the Republican Party since 1980. However, if we anticipate that macropartisanship is nonlinear, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532673X11427948">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1532673X11427948">2</xref> seem to indicate, then the imposition of the time trend biases the model into finding an effect that may not be there. The easy way out of this conundrum is to add a measure of national macropartisanship to gauge whether these California changes in party identification are exceptional. Using aggregated CBS/NYT surveys, we observe this trend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1532673X11427948">Figure 3</xref>. The most important feature to note is that the trend in macropartisanship at the national level is clearly not a linear trend toward increasing Republicanism. This suggests that a model that imposes a linear trend is predisposed toward finding an effect for ballot propositions; this is corrected by adding a national trend for macropartisanship.</p>

<p>We begin with a simple replication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11427948">Bowler et al’s (2006)</xref> innovative study which we present in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11427948">Table 1</xref>. The key findings are that among both non-Hispanic Whites and Latinos, there appears to have been a cumulative effect of Propositions 187, 209, and 227 in the mid-1990s which moved both groups of Californians to the Democratic Party. We also find that among African Americans, there appears to be a marginally significant result of a movement toward the Republican Party. Although given that African Americans typically have party loyalty rates for the Democratic Party between 80% and 90%, any trend is probably masking the reality of voting behavior. With regard to the time trend, in the non-Hispanic White, Latino, and all-respondent models, the propositions coefficient works counter to the time coefficient. In essence, the two variables pick up the parabolic nature of the time trend in the data that apparently goes above and beyond differences in individual-level controls.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11427948">Table 2</xref>, we add a control for Republican macropartisanship, measured yearly as the two-party percentage of Republican identifiers from CBS/NYT.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532673X11427948">7</xref></sup> In constructing this measure, we make sure to exclude California respondents so as not to introduce endogeneity into the model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532673X11427948">8</xref></sup> In the all-respondents model, the Propositions coefficient remains significant but decreases in magnitude by more than half from the previous model. The trend in macropartisanship is also significant, meaning shifts in California party identification is at least partially explained by national trends. Little else in the model changes, save for time, which now has no effect. We see the differing ethnic dynamics of macropartisanship by examining the model for non-Hispanic Whites and Latinos (Latinos I). For Whites, the addition of macropartisanship reduces the effect of the propositions coefficient to statistical insignificance. The linear time-trend variable is also insignificant. Therefore, the changes observed in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11427948">Bowler et al. (2006)</xref> among White Californians is not away from trend. White partisanship levels do not appear to have been affected by racially and ethnically charged ballot propositions but instead simply follow national trends in party identification.</p>

Simply, changes in party identification among Whites in California from 1980 to 2001 appear to be unremarkable, once we account for changes in national macropartisanship. In short, while the California Republican Party won the 1994 gubernatorial election and did not suffer any backlash among non-Hispanic Whites from these ballot propositions, it also failed to gain electoral support among non-Hispanic Whites the way it did with the Southern Strategy.</p>

<p>The Latino model stands in stark contrast to that of non-Hispanic Whites. The variable for Republican macropartisanship is not statistically significant, whereas the coefficient for ballot propositions remains essentially unchanged from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11427948">Table 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532673X11427948">9</xref></sup> Therefore, the movement of Latinos toward the Democratic Party in California in the 1990s appears to be more than a reaction to national forces. There remains a question of whether this movement occurred because of fundamental population changes due to immigration and naturalization or because of a response to ballot propositions. Without more detailed survey data (preferably panel data), these effects are difficult to parse out. However, in the 4th model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11427948">Table 2</xref> (Latinos II), we present some evidence that both the new population and response-to-initiatives hypotheses are supported in the data. In the Latinos II model, we add a dummy variable that takes on the value of 0 from 1980 to 1991 and 1 from 1992 to 2002. The 1992 election is the first year in which the Latino immigrants naturalized under the Immigration and Control Act of 1986 would have been eligible to vote. It is also the first year in which the Field poll began conducting its polls in both English and Spanish, and, by all data accounts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1532673X11427948">Figure 2</xref>), is the beginning of the shift in the California registered voter population to include a greater share of Latino identifiers. The effect of this variable, controlling for both the time trend of the 1980s and the propositions that occurred starting in 1994 demonstrates a surge away from the Republican Party and toward the Democratic Party that started prior to the passage of Proposition 187 in 1994. The propositions variable, however, retains its significance in this model. The substantive effects for California’s Latinos are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11427948">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>Given that there are numerous time-trend variables in the model, we calculated predicted probabilities of Latino party identification while varying the time and propositions variables simultaneously. We do this by varying the propositions variable, the 1992-2002 dummy variable, and the imposed time trend simultaneously, while holding all other variables constant at their mean or modal value. We present probability estimates from 1980, 1991, 1992, and then every year following the passage of propositions 187, 209, and 227. The probabilities reveal the parabolic nature of party identification among Latinos in California from 1980 to 2002. The net change in Republican identification is essentially zero when comparing 1980 with 2002. However, between 1980 and 1991, there is clear evidence of an upward trend in Republican partisanship among Latinos by a factor of about 20 percentage points. The probability of being a Republican versus being a Democrat increased by almost 30 percentage points over this time period. The trend, however, begins to reverse itself starting in 1992. Between 1991 and 2002, the full 30-point swing to the Republican Party seen during the 1980s erodes. The model predicts that effectively one third of this trend (or a 10 percentage point pro-Democratic change) appears to have occurred prior to the passage of Proposition 187 in 1994, whereas the other two thirds of the trend (or a 20 percentage point pro-Democratic change) occurred after the passage of 187, 209, and 227. In sum, California’s Latinos shifted away from the Republican Party prior to the passage of these controversial propositions, but the propositions appear to have accelerated this movement, partially costing the Republican Party the nation’s richest electoral prize and turning California a deep shade of blue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532673X11427948">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>What is to be made of these results? The first point is quite clear. The finding from previous research that Whites in California had a delayed negative reaction to the Republican Party due to race-baiting behavior through the proposal and passage of Propositions 187, 209, and 227 receives no support here. We had theoretical concerns about the derivation of this hypothesis and with a more stringent empirical test find that this result is not robust to the inclusion of a control for macropartisanship. White Californians simply followed national partisan trends.</p>
<p>With regard to Latinos, the story is considerably more complicated as we are limited in the scope of fully understanding the dynamics of partisan change without the benefit of panel data. Nevertheless, making the best use of available data, we contend the previous claim that Latinos began to trend toward Democratic Party identification in California in reaction to contentious ballot initiatives is supported by the data. Approximately two thirds of the movement toward the Democratic Party/away from the Republican Party that occurred in the 1990s occurred after the passage of Proposition 187 in 1994. Yet we also find some evidence, even when controlling for individual-level factors such as age, education, and income, that Latinos in California were trending toward greater Democratic Party identification prior to 1994. Both of these results are away from national trends in macropartisanship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1532673X11427948">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over the course of the campaign for Proposition 187 in 1994, some high-profile proponents, including Republican Governor Pete Wilson, admitted that they fully expected the measure to be challenged and declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11427948">Schrag, 1998</xref>). Given that it appears as though Republican sponsorship of 187 and subsequent measures may have accelerated trends toward the Democratic Party among an emerging Latino population, can this strategy be interpreted as ill conceived? Perhaps, but the possibility exists that Republicans were already aware of the demographic changes that were taking place and decided instead to try to maximize White support by explicitly appealing to racial-threat tendencies. However appealing this strategy may have appeared to some party leaders, it stands in contrast to the evidence presented here and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Had the party’s time horizon been extended beyond its immediate election prospects, it might not have traded short-term gains for long-term losses. The current debate within the Republican Party nationally over how best to represent themselves to the throngs of Latino voters entering the electorate each year mirrors the dilemma faced by California Republicans in the 1990s. Our null result regarding the effects of these race-baiting propositions on White Californians may indicate that reconciling the party’s position on immigration with Latino voters is not a delicate balancing act. Nativist appeals to non-Hispanic Whites alienate a rapidly growing segment of the electorate and they do nothing to improve the party’s standing among White voters.</p>
<p>Whether Republicans learn from their experience in California remains to be seen, but there are some early indications. President Bush, for example, made a conscious effort to attract Latino voters and was often at odds with members of his own party over guest worker programs, bilingual education, and his more accommodating stance toward immigration in general. The conspicuous absence of a protracted focus on immigration policy in the campaigns of the 2008 Presidential election also seemed to foreshadow a change in strategy. By the 2010 midterm elections, however, immigration issues had returned with a vengeance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1532673X11427948">12</xref></sup> Some Republican candidates like Meg Whitman, in her unsuccessful bid for Governor of California in 2010, tried to appeal to Latino voters by running ads in Spanish and declaring her opposition to Proposition 187 and Arizona’s recent immigration law. Unfortunately for Whitman, the goodwill she cultivated with the Latino community, along with her lead in the polls, quickly evaporated once it was revealed she had fired her Mexican housekeeper of 9 years for being in the United States illegally and then subsequently pushed for her deportation. Other Republican candidates, such as Carly Fiorina and Sharon Angle, instead communicated traditional racial-threat messages like those seen in California during the 1990s but to no avail. Republicans hoping to succeed in 2012 would be best advised to avoid these campaigns designed to galvanize White support, especially in areas of the country with ever increasing Latino populations. The evidence suggests that contrary to popular intuition, such strategies do little to influence the party identification of White voters and, at the very least, sufficiently motivate Latino voters to side with Democrats, offsetting any potential gains for Republicans.</p>

<title>Replication Notes</title>
<p>In attempting to replicate the analysis, we ran into a number of problems and ambiguities. We address them here. In almost all cases, the ambiguities occurred because of a desire to generate as accurate as possible a replication. While all of these decisions cause slight changes in coefficient estimates, standard errors, and sample size, none of our findings are different based on these specifications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1532673X11427948">
<title>Sample Sizes</title>
<p>The closest estimate that we generate in terms of sample size and coefficient estimates to the all-respondents model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11427948">Table 1</xref>, column 1) has 17,137 respondents, compared with BNS’ 17,390. Our initial sample sizes were much higher than this by well more than 1,000. To get to this level, we recoded the 3-point party identification variable by setting “don’t knows” and “no party” responses to missing, although in our earlier models they were included as independents. We also assumed that since the publicly available field poll data have a data error, whereby the gender variable is missing, we assumed all of the 2002 cases were deleted listwise.</p>
<p>The sample sizes for each racial cohort, however, is a bit of a mystery. BNS say that they exclude Asian Americans from their analysis, and so we proceed by constructing an all-respondents model that includes only Whites, Latinos, and African Americans. The sum of our non-Hispanic White, Latino, and African American models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11427948">Table 1</xref>) sum to our sample size from the all-respondents model: 13,438 + 2,616 + 1,132 = 17,186. Forty-nine respondents claimed to be both African American and Latino, which accounts for the difference in our summation and our all-respondents model <italic>N</italic> of 17,137. In BNS, however, their separated models do not sum up. There are 13,208 non-Hispanic Whites + 2,077 Latinos + 990 African Americans = 16,275 respondents, whereas their all-respondents model has 17,390 cases. Absent specific coding available in the original piece, we are unable to find the missing 230 Whites, 539 Latinos, and 142 African Americans. Despite these differences, our all-respondents model is extremely accurate, and we find no real substantive or statistical differences in our results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1532673X11427948">
<title>Unemployment</title>
<p>BNS include a measure of state unemployment for year. We attempted a number of specifications—yearly average changes, monthly changes, and quarterly changes—and were unable to exactly replicate the coefficient produced by BNS. The results are not sensitive to different specifications, however, and so we are confident that any differences we report are not due to measurement of unemployment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1532673X11427948">
<title>Education</title>
<p>Our findings for education also diverge from those reported by BNS. There are some coding differences between surveys, but overall, we estimated the model using the Field Poll’s standard 10-point education scale. Having checked the coding of this variable multiple times, we are unable to explain the differences in our model specification. However, given the accuracy of our replication among subgroups, we do not believe that differences in education coding are changing any of the substantive interpretations offered.</p>

<p>The Field poll conducts multiple, random digit dial surveys of all Californians each year. The number of surveys varies from year to year. As is also noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11427948">Korey and Lascher (2006)</xref>, we use unweighted data given the inconsistencies over time in constructing weights. Ideally, we would have access to properly weighted panel data for the entire time period under study. Unfortunately, this does not exist, so we use the best available data—the Field poll.</p></fn>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11427948">Bowler, Nicholson, and Segura (2006)</xref> test for the specific effects of individual propositions and attempt to estimate the size of partisan shifts in the wake of each by including a series of dummy variables that score a “1” for each year after each proposition appeared on the ballot. In an attempt to replicate their study, we ran models using this same system of dummy variables (results not shown). This alternative approach, which disaggregates the initiatives, does nothing to alter our conclusions regarding the effects of macropartisanship and initiatives on non-Hispanic Whites and Latino voters in California. To be sure, neither strategy definitively parses causation as we have a series of cross-sectional data sets that we are trying to assess the differences between, rather than the same, respondents tracked over time. Therefore, we would add a strong caveat that the design presented in previous studies and ours has some limitations that make us cautious in generalizing too extensively from the results. One validity check which does improve our confidence in the results is the fact that in both 1994 and 1996, Field asked respondents about their awareness of Propositions 187 and 209, respectively. The results show that both Latinos and non-Hispanic Whites were overwhelmingly aware of these propositions. 68% of Latinos and 74% of Whites expressed knowledge of Proposition 187, whereas a whopping 75% of Latinos and 88% of Whites reported knowledge of Proposition 209. Given how little Americans typically know about politics, particularly state politics, the high levels of knowledge relating to the propositions, though imperfect and indirect, appear to bolster our causal arguments.</p></fn>

<p>The model is not sensitive to this specification and produces nearly identical results if the measure using California respondents is included. This is not especially surprising given the findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X11427948">Erikson, Wright, and McIver (1993</xref>, p. 132) which show that California has one of the least unique cultural effects among all states.</p></fn>

<p>One potential criticism with this approach is that a measure of national macropartisanship more accurately reflects <italic>White</italic> macropartisanship, and therefore we would not expect it to be related to affect changes in party identification among Latinos as it does among Whites. To address this potential concern, we constructed an alternative measure of Latino-specific macropartisanship from 1986 to 2001 using only Latino respondents to the CBS/NYT polls (before 1986, CBS/NYT did not routinely ask for Latino ethnicity data from respondents). We then replicated the Latino I and II models from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11427948">Table 2</xref> (columns 3 and 4) substituting this new measure for the standard macropartisanship measure; these results appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1532673X11427948">appendix Table A1</xref>. The results of this robustness check confirm the findings from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11427948">Table 2</xref>. The effect Propositions 187, 209, and 227 appear to affect Latino Party ID, whereas national trends in Latino macropartisanship do not appear to ultimately affect changes in party ID for California Latinos.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-1532673X11427948">
<label>10.</label>
<p>As an aside, we also ran the models, restricting the results for several different age groupings (18-29 and then all respondents below the median age). In no instance did our results change, and so we omit these results from the final model specification. This does provide some support to speculate that it is the Latino community’s lack of socialization and not their age that make their party identification more volatile but fully answering that question is beyond the scope of this article.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-1532673X11427948">

<p>To be sure, a careful reading of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11427948">Table 3</xref> demonstrates that the so-called “blue tide” in California, especially among Latinos, is more of a return to the levels of Latino Democratic macropartisanship from the early 1980s. Although this is true, this trend also outpaces national trends. Although we take this to mean that there was a significant shift in Latino macropartisanship in response to ballot propositions, we are also limited by our inability to produce a dynamic measure of national Latino macropartisanship. Although the results for Latinos are firmly rooted in theory, we caution that this result should still be interpreted cautiously and that more analysis of this point would be welcomed.</p></fn>
