<p>In her book <italic>The Artifice of Love: Grotesque Bodies and the Song of Songs</italic>, Fiona C. Black demonstrates a compelling understanding of imagery of the body as grotesque. In this effort she probes the depth of mysticism through the work of Teresa of Avila. In so doing, Black unearths bias pertinent to gender politics and the image of the feminine body.</p>
<p>Black structures her 280-page book into an introduction, 4 chapters, and a conclusion. Her table of contents clearly identifies the subject of each chapter. Specifically, “The Problem of the Body in the Song of Songs”; “Uncovering the Grotesque Body”; “Revealed and Concealed: The Grotesque Body in the Song of Songs”; and “On Reading the Grotesque Erotically.” Likewise, her bibliography indicates a thorough review of scholarship. The book concludes with an index of bible passages and an index of names, which serves to support her work as it provides the reader access to her research.</p>
<p>Black’s introduction quickly moves to identify five key sections within the Song of Songs – 4:1–5; 4:9–16; 5:10–16; 6:4–7; 7:1–10. All of these passages are rife with images of creation – be they animals, fruits or landscapes. This imagery symbolism is typically identified in scholarship as “wasf” and relates the images of creation to the bodies of the lovers. Black identifies the imagery of the female body in these passages as “grotesque.” This serves as her heuristic to “elucidate the dynamics of the imagery in the text, and later, how it might shed light on related issues” (120–121). Furthermore, Black lays a groundwork of tension as she weaves together contrasting imagery related to the body, through location and dislocation via domestic urban and wild rural motifs (9, 13, 20–21). Thus, location refers to the imagery of the idyllic Garden of Eden and its innocence; whereas dislocation indicates awakening of knowledge and the sophistication of the urban society. Potentially, rural location could allude to embodiment; in contrast, dislocation suggests the loss of innocence. Nevertheless, contemporary scholarship aids Black in flipping this issue of rural and urban on its head as it ascribes value to acquired knowledge, and the discovery of the body to political insight and realization.</p>
<p>Chapter One draws attention to the issue of imagery in the Song of Songs, most notably with regard to cultural dislocation and understanding of textual imagery of the body. Black notes that the language of this textual genre is culturally and historically dislocated from today’s readers. Therefore, by the artistic movement of imagery from “wild” and “rural” to “urban” and “domestic,” Black endeavors to bridge the context of the historic text into contemporary urban representations. Thus, Black establishes a leap in meaning, verbally and contextually, which impacts on the understanding of imagery prevalent in the text.  </p>
<p>Buried within these culturally dislocated images are dichotomies united in the living of life. For example, the body, as an image created by God with aesthetic beauty, stands in contrast to Black’s grotesque body with all its “cycles of growth and decay, the grim reminders of life mixed with death – all written upon the body” (13). Potentially connected to Black’s assertion of the body as grotesque are a variety of issues, most notably greed and waste; decay and food; death and nature. Her use of imagery opens the door to further discussion of the body as grotesque as it pertains to understandings of body fluids in homosexual and heterosexual; male and female; romance and lust. In the playing out of Black’s work is a compelling drama that calls the reader to engage in an array of research in both Biblical and Theological Studies.</p>
<p>Chapter Two draws upon the work of Roland Barthes and Michel de Certeau. Barthes explores the artistic work of Arcimboldo’s heads, which he considers to portray esoteric semblances of the human form, composed of animals in one case and a tree trunk and branches in another (76). Each semblance depicts a distortion that reflects issues of nature, death, and the grotesque, in a state that deviates from the aesthetic of beauty and divine image. Here, Black states that “the combination of the Bible and the grotesque, moreover, must still have been within the realm of what was theologically and morally acceptable, probably because the biblical material itself was not ‘grotesquified’, but merely enhanced by the grotesque ornament that surrounded it” (83). </p>
<p>Further to the understanding of these works is Harpham’s assertion that the grotesque is the “art of the fringes” (83). These edgy artistic notions disrupted and challenged the status quo of political and religious society. In this context, Black clarifies the influence of moral, financial and theological systems upon the interpretation of the Bible, and its theological spinoffs that impact on the artistic imagination pertinent to the grotesque. In like manner, Certeau presents Hieronymus Bosch’s depiction of <italic>The Garden of Earthly Delights</italic>, which is reflective of a type of hell on earth. It carries the theme of the grotesque forward into the skewed reality of distorted images, and alters perceptions of the divine image. This fracturing of images culminates by probing the deeper nuances of the human consciousness through the use of language, and perpetuates an altered reality in identity and self-awareness (120). </p>
<p>Chapter Three delves into the movement of time through the hiding and revealing of the erotic. This takes place in the midst of nature, which involves images of wild gazelles and doves, in contrast to the domestic goats, sheep and pomegranates. Further, architectural imagery is used, as the lover’s neck is presented as “a tower of David.” It is this use of the wild, the domestic and architecture that Black identifies as “startling and somewhat grim in its dehumanizing of the body through architecture and the gore of war” (131). Behind this “metamorphosis” of the body is neurotic insecurity, as the female lover wonders: “Has the lover changed his mind about what he sees?” (137). This transformation pushes through anxiety to reveal the inner dimensions of the self. Yet, within the ebb and flow of dissolving apprehension is the discovery of erotic love as the juice of life. As Black says, “Volatile and thus grotesque, the body here is fluid, leaking and heady with scent. ... The abundance of liquid suggests sexual fluids and their accompanying odors” (148). </p>
<p>Chapter Four emphasizes the work of Teresa of Avila, followed by a discussion of differences in the body in relation to “gender politics,” which flows out of Teresa’s perspectives (186). Specifically, in Black’s section titled “Beauty or the Beast?” she discloses the assumption present in the relationship of the lovers, by calling on the wisdom of Teresa of Avila. The internal beast of apprehension is confronted, to reveal the beauty and ecstasy of erotic love consummated. The beast unearths the vitality of life, which conjoins with the essence of the garden, thereby yielding the fruit and marrow of life. This is where Teresa shines her therapeutic light into the internal soul to bring life. Not just mundane life, but an abundance of life, and life-giving in the real world. Black notes the interrelationship of the lovers (193) and delves into world-wide “issues of gender relations” (193). </p>
<p>In conclusion, the most poignant aspect of Black’s understanding of dislocation and the grotesque body is the issue of identity and the erotic knowing of the self. Her inclusion of Teresa of Avila is significant, as the Interior Castle serves as a tool to unlock the mystical and discover the self. It brings to light the ebb and flow of life, while beckoning to the psychology of self-discovery to be revealed, like the layers of an onion with all its flavor, juice and eye-watering stench. </p>
<p>Beyond this, Black’s work focuses on serious issues that are relevant to today’s western society as it engages issues of body imagery, self-understanding, and relationship–power dynamics. Black’s shortfall lies in the political implications of not fully addressing the grotesque body in light of a contemporary epidemic of eating disorders. While this is not Black’s thesis, her research opens up a serious issue within western contemporary society, which could benefit from the use of grotesque imagery in relation to body image and the Song of Songs. Moreover, the wisdom of Teresa of Avila’s view of psycho-spiritual being could light a lamp of understanding for the lover caught up in internal longing. Finally, the political implications of Black’s interpretation of the female body as grotesque could fuel fresh study of the Song of Songs within academia.</p>
