<p>The revival of virtue ethics in the latter half of the twentieth century is often attributed to G. E. M. Anscombe’s seminal essay, ‘Modern Moral Philosophy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946813484405">1</xref></sup> Anscombe was targeting the two prevailing options in ethical theory, deontology and consequentialism, which dominated Western ethical reflection since the eighteenth century. It was not that virtue was wholly ignored in these ethical theories, but that it was deemphasized and instrumentalized as a means either to fulfilling one’s obligation or to maximizing the good. Anscombe and subsequent proponents of virtue ethics, including Alasdair MacIntyre,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946813484405">2</xref></sup> argued that both deontological and consequentialist ethics ultimately implode, being unable to sustain the full weight of the human experience of morality. Modern deontological ethics simply cannot establish universal rules for every possible ethical contingency; and consequentialist approaches, like the multiple varieties of utilitarianism, reach a similar dilemma when striving for an accurate ‘utilitarian calculus’. In addition, as products of the Enlightenment’s confidence in human reason and critique of heteronomous authority, proponents of both deontology and consequentialism have tended to overlook the inescapable hermeneutical character of moral reflection, the awareness of human historicity that reminds us of reason’s embeddedness in tradition. Moreover, by reducing ethics to claims about moral obligations while simultaneously critiquing heteronomous foundations for such obligations, both deontology and consequentialism face ongoing meta-ethical challenges. Can normative claims find a universal grounding without appeals to the Divine, or does ‘ethics after the Enlightenment’ necessarily devolve into the dynamics of mere power? In short, those who revived virtue ethics contend that the predominant moral categories of modern ethics—duty, obligation, and universal law—are simply not sufficient for the task of moral reflection, and should be complemented—if not replaced—by such pre-modern categories as virtue, character, and motivation.</p>
<p>In <italic>After Virtue</italic>, Alasdair MacIntyre sharpens this critique against modern ethics by famously arguing that what divided modern from pre-modern approaches is that pre-modern ethics was based on a three-fold structure ‘of untutored human-nature-as-it-happens-to-be, human-nature-as-it could-be-if-it-realized-its-<italic>telos</italic>, and the precepts of rational ethics as the means for the transition from one to the other’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946813484405">3</xref></sup> Modern ethics, he argues, eliminated the second element of this structure, which is ‘human-nature-as-it-could-be-if-it-realized-its-<italic>telos</italic>’, and, as a result, is both incoherent and destined to fail insofar as it attempts to retain the precepts of pre-modern ethics while eliminating the teleological framework within which those precepts developed.</p>
<p>What emerges after this initial push by Anscombe, MacIntyre, and others is anything but a unified field of virtue ethics. There are virtue ethicists who emphasize a thick description of what it means to be human, or of the human person’s nature and <italic>telos</italic>, while others affirm a form of virtue ethics in which virtue is good for virtue’s sake as defined by a particular cultural context; there are virtue ethicists who reject absolutely all deontological categories, while others who attempt to theorize a relationship between deontological and aretaic categories; there are virtue ethicists who ground their visions upon a form of theism and others who either reject such a grounding or regard it as unnecessary. The detractors of virtue ethics often point to its perceived inability to yield guidance in particular situations, to articulate a convincing argument for human flourishing within a post-modern context, and to provide norms grounding the universality of basic human rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946813484405">4</xref></sup> Thus any broad assessment of virtue theory or virtue ethics today needs to attend to some real differences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946813484405">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The return to virtue in the second half of the twentieth century extended to the sphere of Christian theological ethics, where it clashed to some extent with divine command ethics and natural law ethics. Christian virtue ethics would be dominated primarily by a reconsideration of Thomas Aquinas. Much like Rahner’s and Lonergan’s reading of Aquinas over-and-against the neo-scholastics, the turn to virtue provided an opportunity for a re-reading of Aquinas on virtue that would counter that of the neo-scholastics, but would also unite virtue and the law in a metaphysical concept of human nature. Thomas’s understanding of virtue provided the link between a teleological account of human nature and the norms of the natural law in such a way that would affirm the universality of moral norms and the objectivity of acts, while also acknowledging that moral reasoning occurs within the framework of a particular tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946813484405">6</xref></sup> It is fair to say that since the return to virtue, Christian virtue ethics has been largely a sustained debate over Aquinas’s teachings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946813484405">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>While, in the midst of this return to virtue, there has been some acknowledgement that virtue ethics is neither the invention nor the sole possession of ancient Greeks or Western Christians,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946813484405">8</xref></sup> there has been very little scholarship on virtue in Eastern Christian thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946813484405">9</xref></sup> On one view, this stems from an enduring bias in the academy that continues to refer to ‘both Catholics and Protestants’, as if the Eastern Orthodox tradition does not exist. From another view, this lack of attention is defended by claiming that there is little theoretical analysis on the virtues in the Eastern patristic thinkers, since they understood the virtues primarily in ascetical and pastoral terms as antidotes to vices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946813484405">10</xref></sup> Such a view, however, is inaccurate, as there were robust, theoretical, and deeply influential accounts of the virtues in the Christian East given, for example, by Evagrius of Pontus (345–399) and Maximus the Confessor (580–662). Such a view also presupposes that the liturgical and ascetical context within which this tradition of thinking on virtue grew is irrelevant for scholarly considerations, a theme to which we will return shortly. A third explanation points backward to those of us who study Eastern Christian thinkers, suggesting that the responsibility is ours to draw attention to these sources’ relevance. Regardless of this glaring gap’s etiology, the present volume’s aim is to help fill it and to provoke others to add subsequently to our efforts. Drawing from a range of Eastern Christian thinkers, each of our contributors provides a critical and constructive examination of the theme of virtue, demonstrating the relevance of this tradition to Christian theological ethics and to the broader revival of reflection on virtue.</p>
<p>Is there, then, an underlying claim or characteristic that unifies Eastern Christian teachings on virtue? It is not an overstatement to assert that amidst the diverse traditions of practice and thought that developed within the Christian East, the distinctive trajectory that is rooted in early Christian Greek, Syriac, Armenian and Coptic texts and subsequently shaped within the Byzantine and contemporary Orthodox theological traditions centers around one core and non-negotiable axiom—the deification of the human being, or <italic>theosis</italic>. Even if there were strong and divisive disagreements among Eastern Christians over the <italic>how</italic> of deification and over the language describing it, there was remarkably no disagreement on two points: (1) that humans were created for the sake of a godly mode of being and (2) that this core conviction was revealed, realized and made possible for all humanity in Jesus Christ. The person of Christ, that is, reveals the truth of <italic>theosis</italic> as the meaning of human flourishing.</p>
<p>The centrality of <italic>theosis</italic> is evident in the christological debates that played out in the Seven Ecumenical Councils (325–787 <sc>ce</sc>) convened within the context of Byzantium. What may appear as tedious theological hair-splitting over terminology was for the major theological figures a high-stakes debate over the nature and destiny of the human being. There was a deep-rooted belief that an inaccurate articulation of God and God’s relation to the world in Jesus Christ would set the human being on a misguided path, one that would miss the intended destination, which is God’s own life. Vladimir Lossky expresses this spirit well when he states that the goal of the Christian life is not simply to assent to the dogma, but to ‘live the dogma expressing a revealed truth’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946813484405">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>It would be a mistake, however, to interpret Lossky’s statement as indicating that the dogmatic formulation dictates the formation of the Christian life. In Lossky’s words, ‘Far from being mutually opposed, theology and mysticism support and complete each other. One is impossible without the other. If the mystical experience is a personal working out of the content of the common faith, theology is an expression, for the profit of all, of that which can be experienced by everyone’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946813484405">12</xref></sup> The dogmas are not mere speculation but themselves rooted in the already existing experience of Christians both in the liturgy and in the ascetical struggle toward union with God. It is well known that over the course of the first three centuries in early Christianity, an ascetical movement emerged that was committed to discerning the practices that would lead one to union with God. Less discussed is the centrality of the early Christian experience of liturgy, and especially the Eucharist, as the distinct locus for the experience of God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946813484405">13</xref></sup> Dogma did not simply impose this Christian way of living; rather, it was the liturgical and ascetical practices of early Christians that informed the distinctive theological articulations about God’s relation to Jesus Christ, and, by extension, to the world. There was no division in the early Christian experience between dogma, spirituality, liturgy and ethics; all these aspects mutually informed and were supported by the central belief that humanity’s <italic>telos</italic> is a godly mode of being—that God became human so that humans can become God.</p>
<p>Although evident throughout early Christian texts, accounts of the life in God as a life of virtue are especially evident in the Cappadocian Fathers and John Chrysostom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946813484405">14</xref></sup> Raphael Cadenhead in this issue demonstrates the centrality of the virtues in Gregory of Nyssa’s theological anthropology, and argues for the importance of Nyssa’s notion of ethical maturation as a corrective to MacIntyre’s understanding of narrative. Moreover, as the early Christian ascetical movements organized into monastic communities, texts offering practical and pastoral advice to the monks in their struggle toward union with God were often framed in terms of the virtues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946813484405">15</xref></sup> As Julia Kostantinovsky argues in this issue, Evagrius of Pontus expands on this aretaic theological anthropology by delineating various phases in the acquisition of the virtues, by aligning various virtues to the tripartite division of the soul, and by situating this ethical maturation within a broader theological vision of God’s relation to creation. Assuming the Platonic tripartite division of the soul as rational, irascible and concupiscible, Evagrius describes the progression toward union with God as a simultaneous formation of particular virtues in each of the three parts of the soul, what has since been called the ‘unity of the virtues thesis’. The virtues, he contends, allow for the proper relations between the soul’s parts, which then make true knowledge of the living God possible. Evagrius is also responsible for formulating a list of virtues and vices that would ultimately lead to the lists of the seven deadly sins and seven holy virtues formalized in Western Christian thought through the writings of John Cassian and Gregory the Great.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946813484405">16</xref></sup> While there are structured discussions of the vices and their corresponding virtues in Eastern patristic sources, like St John Climacus’s <italic>The Ladder of Divine Ascent</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946813484405">17</xref></sup> it is worth noting that Evagrius’s account of the eight <italic>logismoi</italic> never reified into a list of ‘seven deadly sins’ in Eastern Christian thought as it did in the medieval West.</p>
<p>The influence of Evagrius on Maximus the Confessor is indisputable, especially the aretaic anthropology in which the virtues are correlated with the three parts of the soul toward a unified and singular desire for the love and knowledge of God. Maximus, however, would depart from Evagrius in significant ways, not least of which was in his teaching on the nature of deification. Evagrius could be read as understanding union with God in such a way that the affective parts of the soul are simply left behind when the rational part of the soul, or the <italic>nous</italic>, achieves perfect contemplation of God. On this reading, the affective parts of the soul need to be ordered so as to allow for contemplation. While Maximus maintains Evagrius’s integrated understanding of the relation between affectivity and contemplation, or desire and knowledge, union with God for him does not entail leaving behind the affective part of the soul. In fact, Maximus understands union with God in terms of love; deification is fulfillment of the greatest commandment—loving God with all of one’s heart, mind and soul and loving one’s neighbor as oneself. Knowledge of God is ultimately the fullest experience of the love of God, which is simultaneously the experience of loving all that God loves as God loves it.</p>
<p>The result of this shift in Maximus was the elevation of love as the virtue of all virtues. For Maximus, all virtues lead to love and are manifestations of love. Yet, as Andrew Louth indicates in this issue, Maximus’s teaching differs from the approach taken later by William of Auxerre (1150–1231) and made famous by Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) in the Christian West. While Maximus makes a few fleeting references to the expression ‘cardinal virtues’, he does not discern a clean division between the cardinal virtues and the virtues of faith, hope, and love.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946813484405">18</xref></sup> Similarly, while Maximus would not deny that love is a gift from God, he does not distinguish between ‘infused’ and ‘acquired’ virtues as Aquinas does.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946813484405">19</xref></sup> Faith and hope are necessary for love, but when Maximus speaks of these virtues, interspersed are variations of what are usually summed up as the cardinal virtue. As Maximus himself states,
<disp-quote>
<p>Love is a good disposition of the soul by which one prefers no being to the knowledge of God. It is impossible to reach the habit of this love if one has any attachment to earthly things. Love is begotten of detachment, detachment of hope in God, hope of patient endurance and long-suffering, these of general self-mastery, self-mastery of fear of God, and fear of faith in the Lord.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946813484405">20</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maximus’s understanding of the link between the virtues has a different ring to it than that of Aquinas; and yet this difference cannot be reduced to the fact that Maximus’s concern is more pastoral than speculative. Paul Blowers in this issue illustrates with clarity that it is impossible to understand Maximus’s teaching on the virtues without understanding his cosmological vision, in which he offers a metaphysical understanding of human nature as oriented toward the love of God. Like Aquinas, Maximus affirms a natural law, and his tripartite division of created existence into being, well-being and eternal being could even be read as analogous to Aquinas’s understanding of the human being’s natural and supernatural end. Maximus, however, does not strictly correlate a particular cluster of virtues with ‘well-being’ and the theological virtues with ‘eternal being’. Well-being is a form of terrestrial happiness that mirrors the fullness of eternal being, and is its precondition. In the end, the human being’s one and only goal is to learn how to love, and the ‘works’ done in order to acquire the virtues do not ‘earn’ one the love of God (how can one earn love?), but do predispose her to the love of God that is woven into the fabric of the cosmos. Virtues then are not acquired, according to Maximus, but manifested as the true intentions of God’s will for created nature, and, as such, are manifestations of God’s love. Maximus, thus, offers speculative flesh to a long-standing ascetical tradition of thinking on the virtues that gets its bearings from theological affirmations of the full divinity and humanity of the person of Christ; his vision is theological throughout.</p>
<p>In one sense, Maximus articulates the radically distinctive Christian claim that the human being was created to learn how to love, even the stranger and the enemy; and, yet, that the human end is to be more loving is a claim that can be understood even on non-Christian grounds. In other words, what Maximus crystallizes is the claim that the human <italic>telos</italic> is love, and he provides an understanding of the relation of the human being’s affective and cognitive capacities to the virtues in order to render intelligible how the human being is structured toward love. Maximus offers a compelling vision of what it means to be human that simply resonates with human experience and cannot be ignored in discussions of human flourishing. Moreover, Maximus’s understanding of the virtues in terms of love can potentially shift traditional debates on moral reasoning, on issues related to applied ethics such as abortion, and even on such themes as war and social justice, especially if one considers the effects of violence on the capacity to love or learn.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946813484405">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>It would be a mistake to think that this tradition of thinking on virtue as a godly mode of being developed in isolation from the formation of Christian practices, especially the liturgical and ascetical traditions of the East. From the apostolic age to the Eastern Orthodox Church of today, liturgy, <italic>theosis</italic>, and the virtues have been organically interconnected. Worship and sacraments aim at <italic><italic>theosis</italic>; <italic>theosis</italic></italic> entails the acquisition of the virtues; and the virtues are cultivated within the lives of the faithful by their repeated activity together as a sacramental community. Within an Orthodox worldview, baptism not only marks the beginning of one’s membership in the church; it entails a new mode of being—a ‘newness of life’ (Rom. 6:4)—that is characterized by the virtues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946813484405">22</xref></sup> This understanding of baptism is reflected both in the Orthodox baptismal rite and in patristic commentary on the sacrament’s meaning, where the one-time events of baptism and chrismation find their fulfillment in the Christian’s repeated preparation for and participation in the Eucharist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946813484405">23</xref></sup> The Eucharist, more than any other practice, manifests the Eastern Church’s belief in the reality of divine-human communion and of growth toward <italic>theosis</italic>.</p>
<p>In addition to the Eastern Christian community’s theology of baptism and regular Eucharistic celebration, the cycle of fasts and feasts underscores the connection between liturgy, narrative, and the cultivation of virtues. Consider the following hymn from the Orthodox liturgical tradition that has been repeated for generations at the start of the Lenten season:
<disp-quote>
<p>The arena of the virtues has been opened. Let all who wish to struggle for the prize now enter, girding themselves for the contest of the Fast; for those that strive lawfully are justly crowned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946813484405">24</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Each year, the arrival of Great Lent invites Christians to recall the meaning of their baptism and to reengage in the struggle against vices in themselves and the world through prayer, fasting, and philanthropy. The Eastern Church’s liturgical tradition is a way of seeing the world and one’s place in it that is eschatological and that fills in the content of a ‘godly mode of being’. <italic>Theosis</italic> thus becomes real in the lives of the faithful through a kind of virtue praxis embedded in the liturgical tradition.</p>
<p>As the revival of virtue ethics was gaining momentum in the late 1970s, Christian ethicists working within Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions showed renewed interest in the relationship between liturgy, narrative, and ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946813484405">25</xref></sup> Some thinkers who study Eastern Christianity have contributed to this scholarly trajectory, yet much room remains for expanding it through an engagement with the historical and contemporary resources of the Christian East. Susan Ashbrook Harvey in this issue shows the fecundity of works by Ephrem the Syrian and Jacob of Sarug for advancing our understanding of liturgy’s connection to the virtues.</p>
<p>Eastern Christianity’s pronounced emphasis upon the saints also manifests the tradition’s concern with virtue praxis. The interiors of Orthodox churches are typically replete with icons of saints, ranging from the Jewish prophets, to the Apostles and early martyrs, to the most recently canonized saints of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Similarly, the liturgical life of Orthodox Christians is saturated with feasts that venerate and celebrate the saints, marking each day on the calendar with at least one and, at times, dozens of holy women and men. The significance of saints for understanding the ethical practices and teachings of Eastern Christianity, in general, and of the virtues, in particular, is multifold and deserves much more scholarly attention than it has received to date.</p>
<p>We can note briefly three points pertaining to hagiology that are especially salient. First, the icons, narrative lives, and living examples of saints depict the virtues with a compelling concreteness. It is one thing to hear definitions of the virtues and quite another to witness them in the lives of real human beings. Robert Wilken has made the point beautifully: ‘it is only by seeing that one can take the measure of a person’s character and remember what one has learned; that is, have the saint’s character imprinted on one’s mind and soul’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946813484405">26</xref></sup> The saints provide an extended sequence of visuals that detail the meaning of Christian virtue and inspire imitation in a way that is much more effective than a list of normative precepts. Second, while each saint expresses a holiness that is uniquely personal and culturally embedded, she or he simultaneously points to the prototype of Christ. ‘Be imitators of me’, the Apostle Paul wrote, ‘as I am of Christ’ (1 Cor. 11:1). Peter Brown describes this connection when he writes, ‘<italic>repraesentatio Christi</italic>, making Christ present by one’s own life in one’s own age and region, appears to be the aim and effect of the early Christian <italic>imitatio Christi</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946813484405">27</xref></sup> The saints thus strengthen the connection between Christology and the pursuit of virtue within the Christian community. And third, the tradition of saints within Eastern Christianity provides assurance to the faithful that <italic>theosis</italic> is not a quixotic pursuit—that the aim of a godly mode of being can be realized in the present.</p>
<p>One of the most promising areas of shared insights on virtue lies in a critical engagement between Eastern Christianity and ‘exemplarist’ virtue theory as articulated by current thinkers such as Linda Zagzebski.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946813484405">28</xref></sup> Zagzebski’s construction of a moral theory that avoids many of the pitfalls identified in deontological, consequentialist, and virtue theories grounded on accounts of human nature resonates with elements of Eastern Christian thought, especially hagiology. The saints are exemplars of moral goodness that are identified and admired as such by the Christian community. Their veneration by theologians and non-theologians alike provides an empirical foundation for an exemplarist moral theory that, according to Zagzebski, can ground a virtue ethic without having to embrace or even articulate a specific theological anthropology. In this issue Maria McDowell advances this line of thinking as it relates to the question of women’s ordination. Another area of particular promise, as Fred Aquino demonstrates in this issue, is the contribution of Greek patristic thinkers to current debates in religious epistemology regarding the relationship between the virtues and the relevant epistemic goods, between <italic>praktike</italic> and <italic>theoria</italic>.</p>
<p>Attention to virtue ethics in Eastern Christianity complicates the dominant narrative within the field, which often presents the thought of Aquinas as summarizing all that already has been said on virtue in the Christian tradition. While there is no indication of a mutually exclusive opposition between Aquinas’s teaching on virtue and that of the Eastern authors, attention to the latter can no longer be ignored. As several of this volume’s contributors demonstrate, the study of the tradition of thinking on virtue in Eastern Christian thought could also reveal new ways of conceptualizing classical problems in virtue theory, new insights into the dynamics of virtues’ development, as well as new contexts for applied virtue ethics. Finally, Eastern Christian thinking on virtue presents for consideration both to philosophical and theological virtue ethics a thick conception of human nature and of human flourishing as the progressive realization of <italic>theosis</italic>. The singular <italic>telos</italic> of our existence is a godly mode of being marked by the embodiment of the full range of virtues and crowned by a radical love that has been discovered as existing all along as a divine gift within us.</p>

<p>A fine example is Lee Yearley’s <italic>Mencius and Aquinas: Theories of Virtue and Conceptions of Courage</italic> (New York: SUNY Press, 1990). We should note here that we employ the language of ‘Western’ and ‘Eastern’ Christianity with caution and with an awareness that these categories often hide as much as they reveal. For a detailed discussion of the limits and problems with an ‘east-west’ dichotomy see George Demacopoulos and Aristotle Papanikolaou (eds.), <italic>Orthodox Constructions of the West</italic> (New York: Fordham University Press, 2013).</p>

<p>One important exception is Joseph Woodill’s <italic>The Fellowship of Life: Virtue Ethics and Orthodox Christianity</italic> (Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 1998). Significant treatments of the theme of virtue within Eastern Orthodox ethics can also be found in the writings of Stanley Harakas and Vigen Guroian. See especially Harakas’s <italic>Toward Transfigured Life</italic> (Minneapolis, MN: Light and Life, 1983) and Guroian’s <italic>Incarnate Love: Essays in Orthodox Ethics</italic> (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1987).
