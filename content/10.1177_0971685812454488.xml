<p>The European Union, India and the United States have long held a fascination for scholars who study regional integration. Though both India and the US are nation-states, they have often grappled with the problems of managing diverse societies within the same constitutional framework. The EU, by contrast, is an attempt by sovereign states in a region to come closer together, both economically and politically, by developing a constitution that makes sovereign states cede part of their sovereignty to a regional organization. The book under review attempts to analyze the various challenges that India, the EU, and the US face by bringing together a group of scholars to discuss diverse issues that have a bearing on their efforts for greater integration. The book is divided into five sections and an Epilogue.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of Section I of the book, Robert Etien discusses the structure and functioning of three democracies, the US, India and France. While he concludes that all three states have remained committed to democratic principles, helped in part by the checks and balances that have been institutionalized in all three systems, he also points out the challenges that lie ahead—the problems of trying to export democracy for the US and the challenge of integrating minorities for both India and France. Pierre-Yves Monjal’s chapter discusses the role of the EU in the twenty-first century. He sees the EU as a unique attempt to create an organization committed to implementing those ethical and political values that European states consider fundamental for their progress. He discusses some of the problems that the EU has faced in making the functioning of its institutions as democratic as possible, but at the same time capable of acting against states that violate principles that are considered fundamental to the Union. Claudine Moutardier in her chapter on the EU’s policy relating to access to documents discusses the various steps that the Union has taken to increase transparency in its functioning and be more responsive to citizens’ request for more information. In the fourth chapter, Charles Reiplinger traces the origins of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and its international impact, particularly the development of similar regulations against corruption in trade and investments abroad by the OECD countries and the countries of the Merida Convention. Hugo-Bernard, in his chapter on Poland’s position in the EU, discusses the problems that arise when a country is part of the EU, but still somehow stays aloof, and prefers a closer relationship with the US instead. European unease at close Polish relations with the US seems to echo long-standing concerns relating to the US–UK special relationship. In the last chapter of the first part, Pierre-Yves Monjal analyzes the economic ‘competences’ of the European Union to ensure greater regional integration, as well as its integration into the EU’s foreign and security policies. He also alludes to the challenges that the EU faces as it tries to both enlarge the union, by including new countries, as well as bringing in additional economic regulations to deepen economic integration.</p>
<p>Though the individual chapters in the first part do succeed in elucidating the topics that they cover, what one misses is a comparative analysis of some of these issues in the context of the US and Indian experience. While this is undoubtedly difficult in an edited volume that brings together scholars from different countries, such an analysis would have provided a much better perspective of the common challenges that the US, the EU and India face and what they could learn from each other. For example, a discussion of the lessons of the Indian and US experience of creating a political union that respects both the rich diversities of their societies, and at the same time ensures effective democracy in its functioning, and its implications for the EU as it tries to move from an economic union to greater political integration would have been useful. Similarly, the discussion of access to EU documents could have been complemented by an analysis of the impact of the Freedom of Information Act in the US and the Right to Information Act in India in bringing about greater transparency in their governance practices as well as some of the problems that these three constitutional provisions for greater transparency have faced.</p>
<p>Section II of the book looks at constitutional issues in the European Union, particularly the travails of the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe (TCE). To many analysts the rejection of the treaty by French and Irish voters sounded the death-knell for ever for closer political union. Julien Streck in his chapter argues that while there were major concerns in France relating to the transfer of sovereignty to EU institutions that contributed to the rejection of the Treaty, the exact position of the TCE in relation to the French constitution, and the extent to which power is actually transferred, is by no means clear. It could, moreover, be subject to differing legal interpretations. Patrick Griffin, in his analysis of the Irish rejection of the TCE, points to an additional element that complicated the vote in Ireland—unease among Catholics at the possibility that a ‘Yes’ vote would lead to the liberalization of abortion laws and legalization of same-sex marriages and euthanasia. He argues that the manner in which the TCE was handled only reinforced the perception of a ‘democratic deficit’ at the heart of EU institutions. In his view, the EU needs to do a far better job of communicating to citizens the good work that it does and effectively counter negative perceptions of the EU in many member states. He also suggests that the EU needs to recognize the fact that all countries may not want to move at the same pace in terms of political integration. The recent convulsions in EU political and economic affairs as a result of the European economic crisis, and criticisms, particularly in Greece, of Germany’s insistence on tough economic reforms, is a reflection of the fact that ever closer union is going to a very slow, difficult and perhaps, a two-speed process.</p>
<p>Section III considers the EU’s external relations and its attempts to formulate a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) for itself. B. Krishnamurthy, in his chapter, lucidly analyzes the evolution of the CFSP and the problems the EU has faced in its implementation. He points out the wide gap between expectation and reality. While there is a feeling, not just in Europe, but also in the developing world that the EU needs to play a more effective role in international affairs, such an outcome remains elusive. Krishnamurthy identifies both structural and capability-related factors as contributing to this failure. Even while EU-member states agree on the need for a CFSP, they hold on to their national foreign and security policies. They also differ sharply on such critical issues as the nature of the EU’s relationship with the US and spending more on building up their military capabilities to intervene abroad. Scott Erb’s chapter looks at the critical relationship between Germany and the US in the context of Germany’s leading role in the EU. He discusses the tensions that arise when the US intervenes in European affairs to protect its allies and its interests, while the EU, keen to maintain peace and stability on the continent, adopts a more cautious approach. The relationship of US with Germany has often been held hostage to political crises involving the US and Russia, particularly in Central Europe. Erb considers the possibility that Europe will abandon the alliance with the US, and feels that such a break could be for economic reasons. He feels that this could happen when global economy undergoes structural transformations and Europe integrates more with the rest of the world. However, at least in the short term, the reverse seems to be happening. The alliance with the US is becoming even more critical as Europe seeks its support in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other International Financial Institutions (IFIs) to overcome a deep economic crisis.</p>
<p>The three chapters in Section IV of the book consider problems of what the authors call the ‘post-colonial’ phase of evolution of India and the EU. Geetha Ganapathy-Dore compares the tensions that exist in the Indian federal framework between the central government and the states with the tensions between the EU and its member states as the Union moves ever closer. The problem of having a multi-religious society, with a major dominant religion, is discussed in the context of debates in India and Europe on the efficacy of a secular state in dealing with such a complex issue. The problem of multi-religious societies is also discussed by Shazia Aziz-Wulber in her chapter that compares the condition of Muslims living in the European Union with those of Indian Muslims. Having discussed the similarities as well as differences in their respective situations, she concludes that rather than adopt a EU-wide consensus on how minorities are to be dealt with, individual member states have evolved their own mechanisms to address the issue. Geetha Ganapathy-Dore in her chapter on the ‘Union of the Mediterranean’ idea sees the whole project as a French-inspired initiative to strengthen its strategic influence in the region.</p>
<p>The final section of the book, Section V, considers the issue of human rights. P. Marudanayagam’s chapter discusses Milton’s views on liberty. Iyer B. Neuman’s chapter considers the complex issue of sovereignty and human rights in the context of joint EU–NATO actions over Kosovo. In an Epilogue to the book, B. Krishnamurthy considers the various challenges that face India, the US and the EU and suggests that greater cooperation among them is needed both to address common challenges and also achieve common goals.</p>
<p>The major benefit of any volume that brings together the work of scholars in diverse areas and from different countries is that the reader gets a multi-disciplinary perspective on a specific issue. The various chapters of this book cover diverse issues ranging from regional organization, constitutional issues, economics and even literature. The authors in their preface to the book say that it aims to ‘honestly, accurately and critically present the changing world order and the legal, political and strategic considerations that are weighing on it’. To the extent that the authors have brought Indian, European and American scholars together to discuss issues of common concern, it could be said that they have achieved their objectives. However, the book would have benefitted from a greater focus on one or two specific themes or issues. The diversity of topics covered means that the various chapters read more like stand-alone papers on specific issues rather than as an analysis by scholars in different countries and in different disciplines of a common theme.</p>
