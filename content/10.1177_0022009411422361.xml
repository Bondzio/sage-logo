<abstract>
<p>East Germany staged two successful industrial exhibitions in Cairo in 1954 and 1957 in an effort to gain Egypt as a trading and eventually diplomatic partner. These displays of East German products and political culture challenged West Germany, which similarly courted Egypt and presented a rival exhibition in Cairo in 1957. They showcased industrial goods from the socialist ‘economic miracle,’ but also revealed German lack of understanding of the Egyptian market and its culture. These exhibitions also showed how Cold War competition between the two Germanys was intertwined with decolonization in Africa and the Arab world, especially when the 1954 show coincided with Gamal Abdel Nasser’s rise to power. East Germany could circumvent West Germany’s Hallstein Doctrine’s goal of diplomatically isolating the socialist state by fostering anti-imperialist solidarity with Arab nations.</p>

<p>A 1959 East German magazine article on tourism in Egypt, rather than describing the pyramids and other wonders, focused almost entirely on documenting evidence of import trade with the German Democratic Republic (GDR):
<disp-quote>
<p>An immense amount of traffic floods through the broad streets of Cairo … And in the middle of the unbroken row of cars we discover a Wartburg, produced in Eisenach by the German Democratic Republic and delivered to Egypt … A large billboard in Ramses Street advertises for Horch trucks from Zwickau and in the shop windows of the bicycle shops we discover mopeds from Suhl, that interested Egyptians stand and look at. We are often made aware of the economic relations between Egypt and the GDR throughout our trip. Thus we encounter our brand-name cameras in Cairo photography stores.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009411422361">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This kind of celebratory reporting points to the important role Egypt played for the GDR by the end of the 1950s as a trading partner. After separate German states were founded in 1949, East and West Germany were locked into a Cold War battle for global allies, particularly among non-aligned states. One of the foremost among these prospective allies was Egypt, first under President Mohammed Naguib and then Gamal Abdel Nasser.</p>
<p>To showcase their budding postwar relationships with this new regime in Egypt, each of the two German states staged industrial exhibitions in Cairo in the 1950s. The GDR succeeded in 1954 in launching an exhibition first, even though the West German Federal Republic (FRG) had hoped to exhibit its wares in 1953. The FRG followed its rival’s lead with its own exhibition in the spring of 1957. The GDR countered again with another exhibition later that same year. These exhibitions were examples of the prominent role played by both foreign and domestic trade fairs, such as the centuries-old Leipzig Trade Fair in East Germany and the new Hanover Fair in the West, in developing foreign trade ties and in staging battles of political imagery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009411422361">2</xref></sup> An examination of these fairs offers insight into the ways that the two Germanys used ‘cultural diplomacy’ to represent themselves abroad in general and to court Egypt in particular.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009411422361">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The historiography of international exhibitions has often focused on how nineteenth and early twentieth century world’s fairs and colonial exhibitions promoted ‘visions of empire’ that embedded racial power and order within ‘dream worlds of mass consumption’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009411422361">4</xref></sup> Historians of Cold War era exhibitions have examined the way that fairs displayed visions of national postwar reconstruction – as in the case of Great Britain’s 1951 Festival of Britain – and gave consumerist form to the ideological competition of the bipolar world – as in the Marshall Plan exhibitions or the American Exhibition in Moscow. However, very little scholarship has attempted to bring together the cold war role of exhibitions with the context of decolonization. Scholars have also paid scant attention to the showcasing of both consumer and heavy industrial goods produced in socialist countries at exhibitions, a lacuna that this journal’s special issue aims to fill.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009411422361">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article’s examination of these three industrial exhibitions in Cairo in the 1950s demonstrates not only how Germany’s competition was staged in the so-called ‘Third World’ but also how the effort to win allies in Africa and Asia affected East and West German policy and cultural display. If, as Timothy Mitchell wrote, the colonial era Egyptian exhibitions represented the certainty of the world’s cultural and particularly colonial order by ‘rendering history, progress, culture and empire in “objective” form’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009411422361">6</xref></sup> then in the unique period of global political flux of the early 1950s, exhibitions took on a particularly important role in representing political and economic relationships ‘objectively’ or materially for a new era of Cold War and decolonization. East and West German trade fair pavilions and industrial exhibitions became a major arena for exercising the battle over economic and political systems and paths toward modern reform and reconstruction that were central to cold war international politics. In this battlefield, the Soviet bloc appeared to surge ahead of its Western counterparts in the early fifties; as part of its goal of ‘peaceful coexistence’, ‘Soviet bloc nations staged 60 foreign exhibitions in 1954, and 170 the following year’, whereas the USA did not begin to focus on trade fair participation until after Eisenhower established the Office of International Trade Fairs in 1954.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009411422361">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>For both reconstructing Germanys after the Second World War, exhibiting fruits of their postwar ‘economic miracles’ at trade fairs was an important part of each state’s attempts to build up an image that would establish domestic as well as global legitimacy as viable states and trading partners, especially after Nazism had made Germany an international pariah.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009411422361">8</xref></sup> Egypt was not alone when it cut off diplomatic relations with Germany in 1939. The division of Germany only deepened this problem of legitimacy as each state claimed to be the sole representative of the German nation.</p>
<p>The GDR asserted that its antifascist foundations and socialist political and economic order made it the true legitimate German state, whereas it alleged that the FRG harbored fascist remnants, in ideology, personnel, and industries that had been active in the Third Reich. Under Party chair Walter Ulbricht, the GDR pursued foreign policy shaped by the principles of socialist internationalism, anti-imperialist solidarity, and peaceful coexistence. Meanwhile, GDR leaders accused the FRG of neo-imperialism, most notoriously evident in its trade ties with apartheid South Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009411422361">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The West German Adenauer government countered these arguments by refusing to acknowledge the GDR, calling it a colony of the Soviet Union, and by pointing to the regime’s ‘totalitarianism’ as a sign of illegitimacy. West German officials referred to the GDR as the ‘Soviet Zone’ or the ‘so-called GDR.’ Starting in 1955 West Germany’s Hallstein Doctrine codified its international campaign to prevent recognition of the GDR by threatening to cut off ties to any country that established diplomatic relations with the GDR. Due to this West German push for the GDR’s global isolation, the East German regime pursued a tactic of ‘small steps’ toward international recognition, hoping that trade ties would lead to GDR embassies abroad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009411422361">10</xref></sup> At the very least, the GDR aimed for trade fairs to facilitate the signing of trade treaties and the establishment of trade missions, as was the case in Tunisia in 1959 and Libya in 1965.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009411422361">11</xref></sup> Trade fairs therefore became battlegrounds for East and West German political and economic imagery that aimed to brand each side as a politically legitimate and economically dynamic partner, especially for ‘developing’ countries.</p>
<p>A key to each German state’s goal of legitimization was its ability to showcase itself as ‘modern.’ The industrial exhibitions aimed to export not only products but also both Germanys’ competing but still similar visions of modernization. Following the lead of their respective allies, the USSR and the USA, the two Germanys differed on whether socialism or free-market capitalism and liberal democracy provided the best path toward modernity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009411422361">12</xref></sup> However, they both idealized modernization through scientific rationality, technology, and industrialization, which they hoped to extend to developing nations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009411422361">13</xref></sup> The GDR prided itself on superior modernization through the planned economy’s focus on efficiency and scientific-technological advancement, whereas the FRG focused on market driven advancements in material prosperity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009411422361">14</xref></sup> In both cases, the industrial exhibitions showcased the possibility of financial aid, technical assistance for engineering projects, scientific cooperation, and trade relations offered by both Germanys to the decolonizing world in the 1950s and 1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009411422361">15</xref></sup> It was this offer of financial and technical development aid and trade connections that dovetailed with the modernizing goals of revolutionary Egypt in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Whereas the historiography of East and West German aid to the decolonizing world has emphasized the role of these modernization projects, a close examination of the German exhibitions in Egypt offers a more complex view of how each German state showcased itself internationally. Along with purveying modern engineering and machinery to Egypt, the two Germanys also worked at the three fairs to export attractive amusements, such as fireworks and music, and ‘traditional’ German commodities and cuisine, such as lace or sausages. In this sense, the exhibitions followed the precedent of world’s fairs that merged commerce with representation of national cultures and with mass amusements. In the battle over legitimacy in divided Germany, however, traditional craft objects also importantly signified the continuities with the past – particularly the German tradition of quality workmanship – that lent validity to each Germany’s claim to embody a reconstructed German nation. While the wares on display may have been the meat of the three exhibitions, the entertainments and cultural events played an important role in the representation of each German state to its potential Egyptian ally. As at world’s fairs, cultural spectacles aimed to represent an ‘external reality’ of each German state, but in effect defined and constructed those realities through the imaginations of the politicians and designers of the fairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009411422361">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, by exploring the politics of these Egyptian trade fairs as a case study, it is possible to see how battles between the two German states played out in the decolonizing world. Not only did the Germanys compete for diplomatic recognition and trade contracts, as diplomatic histories of cold war Germany have emphasized. At these exhibitions, other concerns endemic to German–German tensions surfaced, such as spying, trademark conflicts, mutual sabotage, and the problem of flight from the GDR to the West. Thus, a reading of the evaluations of the exhibitions by their administrators reveals the multiple ways that the ‘German question’ linked up with international relations. This article contributes to a growing historiography of Germany’s entangled history with post-colonial countries that has remained under-researched, in part because Germany’s period of formal colonialism was comparatively short, German historiography has focused on other questions such as the Holocaust and Germany’s ‘special path’ (the <italic>Sonderweg</italic>), and there were comparatively few non-Europeans living in Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009411422361">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In part, the two Germanys focused great attention on Egypt in the 1950s, because German leaders fostered a sense of affinity between dynamic Egyptian reconstruction and the ‘economic miracles’ in each Germany. Both Germanys and Egypt underwent radical political shifts after the Second World War that ushered in new political regimes. In Germany, the defeat of the Third Reich, division, military occupation, and democratization of the country paved the way for establishment of the two states in 1949 both intent on boosting heavy industry and eventually consumer production as a form of national revival and rivalry between East and West. In Egypt, efforts accelerated after World War II to drive out imperial British influence that had predominated after buying the controlling share of the Suez Canal in 1869. British military and economic influence continued even during the reign of King Farouk that started in 1936. Following increasing dissatisfaction with Farouk's inability to expel the British, in July 1952 Mohammed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser staged a revolution against King Farouk and took control of the country. This new nationalist regime was intent on pursuing economic independence from Britain through industrial modernization, particularly after Nasser gained control of the country in 1954. Nations from both the capitalist and socialist worlds aggressively courted the new regime and a number of countries staged exhibitions there in the 1950s.</p>
<p>West Germany preceded East Germany in building up links to Egypt, as companies took a leading role in assisting Egyptian industrialization plans. Already in the early 1950s the West German engineering company Hoch-Tief AG led a consortium of industrialists offering to finance Aswan Dam construction with 200 million marks. FRG companies also funded and guided other industrialization projects; DEMAG began constructing an iron and steel plant at Helwan in 1954 at a reported cost of 45 million dollars, which Nasser described as ‘Egypt’s entry into the field of heavy industry’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009411422361">18</xref></sup> The close relationship between Egypt and the FRG in these early years was evident in the fact that Egypt was the first Near Eastern country to establish full diplomatic relations with the Bonn government in October 1952.</p>
<p>Along with cooperation in industrial development, trade relations were important to the connections between Egypt and the two Germanys. Until the Second World War, Germany had been one of the world’s largest importers of Egyptian cotton. Egypt sought new economic partners as its relationship of economic dependence on Great Britain dissolved after 1945. As a rising economic power during the Korean War boom starting in 1950, West Germany signed a trade treaty with Egypt already in 1951.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009411422361">19</xref></sup> But neither Naguib nor Nasser pledged allegiance to West Germany in return for this aid and import/export links. Rather, Egypt remained committed to non-alignment or ‘positive neutralism’ and played both cold war camps off each other.</p>
<p>In particular, the Egyptian government pursued relations with the GDR to exert pressure on the FRG over the West German relationship with the new state of Israel in the early 1950s. When the FRG made overtures to Israel, Egypt countered by wooing the GDR. This tension disrupted negotiations by the FRG Economics Ministry in 1952 to stage an industrial exhibition in Cairo the following year and led to greater GDR inroads into Egypt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009411422361">20</xref></sup> When in October 1952, the FRG worked towards an agreement with Israel for reparations, Fritz Koch, the GDR Near East Representative and later head of the Chamber of Foreign Trade, visited Egypt that autumn to plan for the establishment of a permanent trade mission in Cairo. In March 1953, West Germany ratified an Israeli reparations accord and pledged to pay 3000 million marks annually to Israel to help rehabilitate Jews there. The GDR pursued no such policy toward Israel, assuming that as an anti-fascist state it was absolved of Nazi guilt and had no need for such reparations. At the height of antisemitic purges across the Soviet bloc, socialist regimes like the GDR also critiqued Zionism as chauvinistic and supported Arab nationalism as revolutionary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009411422361">21</xref></sup> Therefore, upset by West German–Israeli cooperation, Egypt signed a trade agreement with the GDR, also in March 1953.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009411422361">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>This rift between West Germany and Egypt happened at an opportune time for East Germany, when GDR leaders began pursuing foreign ties more concertedly, especially with the 1952 establishment of the Chamber of Foreign Trade, which became responsible for organizing trade exhibitions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009411422361">23</xref></sup> That year, the GDR sent displays to exhibitions in Poznan, Plovdiv, Milan, Paris, Stockholm, Utrecht, and Peking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009411422361">24</xref></sup> The GDR pursued these international ties further in 1953, when it was on the eve of its biggest national crisis of legitimacy, the June 17 uprising, precipitated in part by domestic consumer shortages. Consumer complaints about shortages leading to the uprising pressured the regime during the subsequent New Course to increase material supplies through greater investment in domestic light industry and through imports, such as cotton from Egypt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009411422361">25</xref></sup> In addition, the crisis in domestic legitimacy in the wake of the uprising could have been alleviated by the boost in international prestige through links to countries, such as Egypt. Therefore, in August 1953 the Ministry for Foreign and Inter-German Trade Department of Advertising and Trade Fairs began plans for an Industrial Exhibition in Cairo for the following year to immediately follow a Hungarian exhibition there.</p>
<p>In late 1953, exhibition planners, such as Fritz Koch, returned to Egypt to build relationships with traders, such as the Misr Group. In November a delegation was established to organize the fair headed by tradesman Wilhelm Knapp, with technical organizer Walter Dietrich from the Chamber of Foreign Trade’s Department for Advertising and Trade Fairs, and sales manager Frank Zeidler, who later became the head of the GDR trade mission in Syria from 1956 to 1959. These leaders returned to Egypt to make arrangements for the exhibition with a committee consisting of Egyptian Director for Tourists and Traffic Mohieddine El Chzaly, General Director of the Cairo Chamber of Commerce Mohamed Sakr Aly, Director of the Cotton Museum Moustapha El Bahatimi, and member of the Ministry for Trade and Industry’s Department for Exhibitions Youssef Topouzada.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009411422361">26</xref></sup> The delegation met again in January 1954 to make some final technical decisions.</p>
<p>On March 9, 1954, Wilhelm Knapp held a press conference in Cairo to launch the exhibition and to explain that the purpose of the show was to give the ‘economic circles in Egypt and Arab countries better insight into GDR production and to bring about the trade agreement with Egypt’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009411422361">27</xref></sup> The GDR Industrial Exhibition started the next day on March 10 with a program for 500 VIP guests including President Naguib, who put the exhibit under his auspices, launched the show, and reportedly viewed the displays himself for over two hours.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009411422361">28</xref></sup> It ran until March 30 and attracted over 220,000 mostly Egyptian visitors, including the brother of the Saudi-Arabian king, buyers, industrialists, ministry officials, members of the army, students, and ‘many women’.</p>
<p>The design and decor were by the well-known Bauhaus-trained architect, Selman Selmanagić,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009411422361">29</xref></sup> a Yugoslavian-born professor at the Kunsthochschule in Weissensee, Berlin from 1950 to 1970. Selmanagić had lived from 1933 to 1939 in the Middle East, where he studied local architecture including that of Egypt. He also gained experience with exhibition design as the architect for the first postwar Leipzig Trade Fair in 1946 and for the first GDR pavilions at foreign exhibitions in Prague and Stockholm in 1948. In the early 1950s, GDR designers and architects rejected Bauhaus style in favor of Soviet neo-classicism, although in a retrospective interview Selmanagić claimed that he preferred not to mimic the building styles of past societal orders, but rather to seek new standards for socialist society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009411422361">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>His modern but somewhat eclectic style was evident in the centerpiece of the fair, a hall called ‘Palais d’Orient’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022009411422361">Figure 1</xref>). In this primarily functional, plain and geometric interior, Selmanagić included some ‘oriental’ elements such as ornate archways and capitals on columns, perhaps inspired by his earlier study in Egypt. To soften the otherwise boxy structure, coarse cotton cloth hung on the walls and gauzy fabric in the German flag colors, black, red and gold, was draped from the ceiling to the exterior balustrade borrowing a motif from a Bedouin tent. The GDR flag hung at the entrance along with Egyptian flags and a six meter high sign saying ‘Industrial Exhibition of the GDR’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009411422361">31</xref></sup> Despite some difficulties in construction, the fair planning delegation found this design mingling simplicity, neoclassical columns, and Egyptian motifs ‘achieved the correct effect on the mentality of the population’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009411422361">32</xref></sup>

<p>The large room featured a glass door at one end leading to a central walkway flanked by rows of products, such as motorcycles or small machines, some on red carpets decorated with potted flowers and palms and others in glass cases. Since the majority of investment in the GDR’s Two-Year Plan from 1948–1950 and the first Five-Year Plan thereafter was in heavy industry, the exhibition mainly focused on its display of machinery. Machine tools were one of the major products promoted by GDR industry, in part because new machine tool technologies had been developed under the Nazis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009411422361">33</xref></sup> To the left of a central section showing machine tools was a display of electro-technical products ranging from high voltage transformers to household appliances to X-ray machines. Proceeding further through the hall, one encountered products from the chemical industry, vacuums, woodworking machines, textile spinners and weavers, and machines used for processing food, such as margarine, and mass-produced cigarettes. A major focus of the GDR export industry included printing machines, which were not only displayed but also made copies of the exhibition brochures and circulars on the spot. In the left corner of the exhibition hall were models of a cement factory, a rolling mill, and a train set.</p>
<p>The mezzanine level supported by pillars provided a walkway with additional displays overlooking the central hall. Following the implementation of the New Course in 1953, the GDR government also stepped up its production of consumer goods, both for domestic use and for export, which were on display here. Fine mechanics and optical equipment, especially microscopes, cameras, and lenses from the Zeiss factory in Jena, were on view on this second floor, which also housed household products and textiles. Outside at the entrance, and visible from a distance, was a huge crane.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009411422361">34</xref></sup> On the open-air landing the exhibition also featured agricultural machines and chemical fertilizers as well as a steam-shovel.</p>
<p>Along with industrial products, the GDR proudly showcased traditional products it inherited because of the location of craft centers within its borders. These included Meissen porcelain, manufactured since 1710, and ‘Plauener Spitze’ lace. The lace had been part of Plauen embroidery crafts industries since 1780; it was machine-made after 1880 and given a modern twist in the GDR through its construction out of synthetic Perlon (nylon).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009411422361">35</xref></sup> Juxtaposing these craft items with modern machines presented the GDR as progressive, but also rooted in German tradition in part to rival West Germany.</p>
<p>The exhibition did not sell as many goods as planners back in East Germany had anticipated. However, in some sectors, such as chemicals, the sales plan was completely fulfilled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009411422361">36</xref></sup> Most of the floor models of these products sold, although contracts for later deliveries of goods were only sealed for streetcars and office equipment. The choice of goods on exhibit, however, should have been researched a bit more ahead of time to meet the taste and needs of the Egyptian market. For example, the machine tools offered were often too modern or complicated. Some of the engines for the wood-working machines didn’t work with Egyptian electrical currents and outlets. In the case of products that could have done well in the hot climate of Egypt, such as refrigerators, GDR industry in 1954 still lagged behind appliances exported by capitalist countries, especially the United States. The delegation in Cairo still considered the show satisfactory, however, because it helped open up the Egyptian market to the GDR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009411422361">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the products that the GDR hoped to sell to the Egyptians were the focal point of the event, the exhibition also featured a number of attractions and entertainments. For example, along with exhibits of products, the GDR erected an ‘educational materials’ pavilion that included one major star: the glass woman. The GDR appropriated this life-sized educational aid as a symbol of its own promotion of modern socialist standards of health and hygiene, though it had first been a sensation at Dresden’s Hygiene Museum exhibit in 1930. This transparent body showing internal veins, arteries, bones, and organs through interior illumination became a world-traveler featured at a number of GDR international exhibitions, such as the one in Cairo.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009411422361">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Exhibition planners designed entertainments to bridge an image of traditional Germanness and modern technology. Planners hoped to pump music over loudspeakers into the exhibition hall, including classical concerts, waltzes, old and new German dance music, Heimat Lieder, and folksongs from across Germany. To add to the Teutonic flair, the delegation planned to have a German restaurant on site festooned with German garlands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009411422361">39</xref></sup> Seventy crates containing Halberstadt sausage, apple juice, and alcoholic beverages were shipped to Egypt to contribute to this service.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009411422361">40</xref></sup> These elements of the exhibition served to make the fair a vehicle for virtual tourism to East Germany, ostensibly to foster cultural affinities and to encourage Egyptians to visit the GDR.</p>
<p>The main attraction that made this exhibition a celebratory spectacle was a series of three firework displays over the Nile. Ironically, these fireworks displayed the complicated political climate in which the exhibition took place. The fancy pyrotechnics included rockets that shot the flag of the Arab League and of the GDR into the air. More impressive, but perhaps symbolically ill-advised, was a bundle of firework rockets set off in the image of President Naguib between the Egyptian and GDR flags.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009411422361">41</xref></sup> This coordinated with Naguib’s ceremonial opening to the exhibition. However, this spectacle highlighted the lack of understanding amongst GDR planners for the volatile political situation in Egypt. The fireworks display occurred amid serious political upheaval during which Naguib’s position was in jeopardy and Nasser threatened to take over.</p>
<p>The timing of the GDR’s Cairo Exhibition was, in fact, inopportune, since it occurred during the ‘March 1954 Crisis’ that ended with Nasser’s ousting of President Naguib. As leaders of the monopoly party ruling Egypt, the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), Nasser and Naguib disagreed about how decolonized Egypt should be run. In June 1953, the RCC had made Naguib the Egyptian president who led through military rule. Shortly thereafter, in August, Egypt and the GDR Ministry of Foreign Trade agreed to stage the exhibition the following spring. Prior to the exhibition, conflict was brewing between Naguib and Nasser over the form of the new republican government. Naguib wanted a return to civilian rule with multiple parties, but Nasser believed that to implement the goals of the revolution the RCC and the military should retain control. Nasser eventually incited popular fear that Naguib threatened the revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009411422361">42</xref></sup> By March 27 and 28, 1954, the transportation union workers went on a general strike to support Nasser’s ‘continuation of the revolution’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009411422361">43</xref></sup> This movement of popular backing for Nasser crippled the city for two days toward the end of the GDR exhibition.</p>
<p>Thus, the GDR exhibition delegation unwittingly landed in Egypt during the ‘pivotal moment’ in the consolidation of power by Nasser and the military.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009411422361">44</xref></sup> In the following months, Naguib fell from power and Nasser placed him under house arrest. The fireworks bearing Naguib’s face were honoring a man on his way out of power, but the visage of Naguib engulfed in flames may have ironically presaged his demise in an unhappy metaphor. The political crisis also had a severe effect on the exhibition’s abilities to secure sales contracts. However, exhibition director Wilhelm Knapp found it ‘remarkable, that despite these high political tensions, which dominated public life during almost the whole period of our presence and during the implementation of our exhibition, it still found such great public interest to a large extent’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009411422361">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>This regime shift could not have been anticipated by GDR planners, but the fireworks display of Naguib was still problematic. West German founder and editor of <italic>Der Spiegel,</italic> Rudolf Augstein, happened to be in Cairo during the GDR exhibition to report on the political revolution. Augstein ridiculed the fireworks display: ‘Well, I thought, couldn’t this have fit more with the times? Couldn’t they have stuck in a bit of ‘Nasser’ just to be safe?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009411422361">46</xref></sup> This comment points to some of the challenges the East German delegation faced in working to understand the foreign culture and political climate of Egypt and how missteps opened one German regime to critique by representatives of its rival. The upheaval in March 1954 also demonstrated how the two Germanys faced the challenge of negotiating complex political terrain and potential upheaval as they worked to foster trading relationships in revolutionary and decolonizing countries.</p>
<p>In addition, cultural misunderstanding and the legacy of imperialist stereotypes compounded the difficulty in fulfilling the mission of fostering ties with the shifting political regimes in Egypt. Most members of the East German crews sent to set up and run the exhibitions did not have extensive Arabic language skills and were not familiar with Egypt. Reportedly, these crews were excited above all to see the famous sights of Cairo, but that might have been where their cultural curiosity ended. Despite the shipment of sausage and beer to Cairo, as the organizational leadership recounted, the delegation members ‘refused to understand that it is not possible to obtain pig’s knuckles (Eisbein) and sauerkraut cooked according to our [state trade organization] HO recipe in Africa’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009411422361">47</xref></sup> From the Egyptian perspective it would be odd to sell pork and alcohol in a Muslim country, and apparently German food was not very appealing to the Arab population. Rudolf Augstein recounted witnessing an Arab correspondent in the new Bavarian-style restaurant leaving his leg of veal on the plate with the words ‘that is dreadful’ and a shake of his head.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009411422361">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps more revealing, remarks about Egyptian ‘mentality’ recurred throughout the exhibition delegation’s reports on the exhibition in 1954 and later in 1957 and show that the East Germans, as well as West Germans, harbored certain assumptions about their Arab counterparts. The documents are usually not explicit enough to say what constituted this ‘mentality’, however, there are a few moments when Orientalist stereotypes surface. The construction workers had a very limited amount of time to erect the exhibits (15 days for the 1954 fair) so they hired local workers. Comments in the official reports noted that problems resulted from the ‘mentality of the population’, which slowed construction progress. GDR fair directors commended the German workers for their ‘tremendous work enthusiasm’ especially when they managed ‘despite the proverbial carelessness in Egypt to provide a maximum of safety’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009411422361">49</xref></sup> The exhibition planners also attributed their inability to fulfil sales plans to their neglect of the ‘oriental mentality'. In other words, the German sellers didn’t understand the ‘oriental custom’ of haggling for merchandise over a longer period of time, sometimes until after the exhibition was finished.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009411422361">50</xref></sup> These minor cultural misunderstandings may have undercut the overall message of friendship promoted by the exhibition.</p>
<p>Despite such cultural challenges, the GDR exhibition helped to encourage the Egyptian government to codify trading relations with the GDR later in 1954.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009411422361">51</xref></sup> In 1955 Minister for Foreign Trade Heinrich Rau achieved trade agreements and mutual exchange of official trade missions with consular rights in Egypt. In a trade contract for 1956, the GDR agreed to provide machines, precision optical equipment, and manufactured goods in exchange for cotton.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009411422361">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>GDR ties to Egypt helped it foster trade with other Middle Eastern and North African countries, such as Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Tunisia, and Iraq.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009411422361">53</xref></sup> After the measured success of the 1954 exhibition, the GDR expanded its participation in international trade fairs. It exhibited alongside West Germany at the First, Second, and Third International Trade Fairs in Damascus, Syria in 1954, 1955, and 1956. These East German pavilions were often successful enough to make the West German delegations worried that its rival would literally ‘steal the show’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009411422361">54</xref></sup> In addition, the 1954 exhibition in Cairo also provided the opportunity for the GDR to encourage Arab countries to stage exhibits at the Leipzig Fair in Germany. The Leipzig Fair Office celebrated the fact that Egypt returned to the Leipzig Fair for the first time since the war in 1954, which, according to a press release of the Leipzig Fair Office, ‘would further build up trade relations linked up through the German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition in Cairo’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009411422361">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>These successes were certainly tempered with difficulties. The GDR had some troubles delivering desired goods to its trading partners, which prevented Lebanon, for example, from building stronger trade ties with East Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009411422361">56</xref></sup> In addition, the GDR did not always fulfil the expectations of its Arab trading partners in purchasing enough of their exports, such as Egyptian cotton. Egypt needed hard currency from its foreign exchanges as much as East Germany did, but the GDR often set up trade arrangements based on the barter of mechanical goods for cotton. Despite these setbacks, the trading relationships between the GDR and Egypt strengthened.</p>
<p>The success of the GDR industrial exhibition put the FRG on the defensive. The West German economics ministry still aspired to stage its own exhibition in Cairo. But while they were waiting to counter East Germany officially through such an exhibition, the GDR exhibition delegation reported that West German ‘agents’ attempted to sabotage the GDR’s event in 1954. A major problem had to do with the reestablishment of international confidence in East German products as authentic quality brands. In the early twentieth century, German exports had lent the country international prestige and had fueled domestic economic growth, as the ‘Made in Germany’ label linked together German identity and the concept of quality design and workmanship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009411422361">57</xref></sup> After 1945, both Germanys laid claim to this tradition of technological prowess and fine craftsmanship. One of the express purposes of exhibiting GDR goods at trade fairs abroad was to ‘secure the trust in the quality and effectiveness of our products.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009411422361">58</xref></sup> This was particularly difficult in countries where private companies assumed that the products from ‘capitalist’ West Germany would be better.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009411422361">59</xref></sup> West Germany tried to monopolize the international image of quality products by fighting to prevent GDR industries’ use of the label ‘Made in Germany.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009411422361">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>The conflict over which German state could lay claim to the legacy of German quality products became especially heated over company brands that split between East and West after 1945. A good example of this is the Zeiss optical firm, renowned for quality lenses. Since the mid nineteenth-century the company had been based in Jena. After the Second World War, Jena was briefly occupied by the US army, but eventually fell within the Soviet Zone and the GDR, where Zeiss became a state-owned firm. Therefore, the American occupiers took many of the leading scientists and technicians from Jena and started a new Zeiss firm in the US Zone city of Oberkochen. A brand-name war ensued between Zeiss East and Zeiss West that reached its height in 1961 when 71 trademark cases were pending in 62 countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009411422361">61</xref></sup> One of the early arenas for this ‘trademarks war’ was the 1954 Cairo Exhibition. According to the exhibition delegation, a West German Zeiss representative in Cairo registered the East German trademark ‘Carl-Zeiss-Jena’ as illegal, which led to the confiscation of some of the Zeiss products to be exhibited at the fair.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009411422361">62</xref></sup> The confusion over legitimacy of the East German Zeiss-Jena brand made Egyptian buyers hesitant to purchase precision optical equipment at the exhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0022009411422361">63</xref></sup> The return transport to the GDR of the 94 Zeiss exhibits was also held up by legal deliberations about the trademark status of these goods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0022009411422361">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>West Germans also reportedly attempted to sabotage the exhibit in other ways. Delegation leader Knapp reported to the office of state security back in Berlin that he had heard that three West Germans, Alex Richter from the Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt, Otto Feigl, and ‘a certain Strauss’, denigrated the East German exhibition before a large committee of men from influential Egyptian economic circles. They allegedly claimed that the GDR was not prepared to deliver its products and would break contracts. Not only that, but major East German factories were purportedly falling apart and not being repaired. Perhaps most damning, this trio claimed that soon a new ‘June 17’ would come, meaning that another uprising against the government would occur as in 1953. With this imminent ‘revolution’ on its way, any promises of export deliveries were allegedly mere ‘foam’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0022009411422361">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>On other occasions, West German advisors who accompanied Egyptian officers to the fair were overheard making ‘disparaging remarks’ about the displays. Ostensibly, these accusations were not effective because the Egyptian media reported on the GDR as ‘the birth of a new economic power’. Again Knapp recounted in an internal evaluation that the West Germans retorted by suggesting that the GDR had copied all its technologies and products from West German manufacturers. These critics tried to use the confiscated Zeiss products as a case in point. The delegation leaders even suspected West German saboteurs of going further than mere insults; it was discovered one day that a cable to some sort of pump equipment had been cut through, despite surveillance measures.</p>
<p>East Germans even suspected West Germans of exploiting the GDR’s problem of flight of thousands of its citizens to the West by targeting the exhibition personnel. According to a report by Zeidler, Knapp and Dietrich, a female West German ‘agent’ attempted to lure four delegation members responsible for the fireworks to leave the delegation and to put themselves under ‘protection of the Egyptian government’ as refugees from the GDR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0022009411422361">66</xref></sup> The delegation leaders managed to prevent this flight. Nevertheless, this ‘agent’ stoked official anxieties that GDR citizens abroad might seek asylum in their host countries. Surely this was part of the concern when the delegation members were told they could not take up private conversations or connections while in Cairo. They could not leave the exhibition grounds without reporting to a superior or go into the city except in groups of three to five.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0022009411422361">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>Disruption and even sabotage of East German exhibitions became West German policy in the late 1950s and early 1960s as the FRG sought to block the GDR from showcasing its goods and state symbols at international fairs, which the FRG press called an ‘Eastern Offensive’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0022009411422361">68</xref></sup> As Christiane Fritsche has shown, successful East German exhibitions in the Middle East and Africa, led West Germany to make a more concerted effort to exhibit its own goods in these regions as a counter-offensive. At many exhibitions, both West and East Germany constructed pavilions or displays; trade fairs became the only forum besides sports events in which the two halves of Germany competed directly. The juxtaposition of two German displays at these fairs worried the FRG, because it did not want the global community to accept the existence of two German states, much less to buy GDR products.</p>
<p>Indeed, the East German exhibition in 1954 was one aspect of the deepening ties between Middle Eastern countries and the socialist bloc that led many, such as historian Walter Lacquer, to conclude at mid-decade that a number of Middle Eastern countries could become communist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0022009411422361">69</xref></sup> Due to the perceived threat of communist triumph in the Arab world, the FRG was steeled in its resolve to showcase its own goods and political ideology to the Egyptians. It finally had the chance to do so in its own Industrial Exhibition in Cairo in 1957.</p>
<p>It was a politically strategic move for West Germany to stage its own Industrial Exhibition in Cairo in March 1957, clearly following on the heels of the GDR show in 1954. This was the third national industrial exhibition the FRG had staged since 1945; the others were in Helsinki and Mexico, locations that also had relations with the GDR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0022009411422361">70</xref></sup> During discussions in 1955, the Federal Economics Ministry insisted that it should stage its exhibition as soon as possible, because out of ‘political and trade policy reasons’ the event was ‘urgently necessary’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0022009411422361">71</xref></sup> It was especially troubling that ‘above all the Eastern Bloc makes extraordinary efforts for this sales territory. The Soviet Zone has appraised its exhibition in Cairo, staged some time ago, to be propagandistically very successful’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0022009411422361">72</xref></sup> Given this relative success, FRG exhibition planners even asked their diplomat in Cairo what they could learn from the experience of the East German exhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0022009411422361">73</xref></sup> The FRG didn’t want to be outdone by other countries also planning exhibitions in Egypt, such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Japan, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0022009411422361">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>The outbreak of the Suez Crisis in October 1956 created more political hurdles for the exhibitioners. After the British and French had been forced to retreat from Suez in December, the question arose whether the FRG should continue to stage the exhibition, since it might appear that they were doing business with the enemy of their European allies. The FRG foreign office insisted that ‘the altered conditions in Egypt make the original goal of a fight against the Eastern Bloc offensive seem even more important than before, because there is no doubt that if after pushing out England and France Egypt were also to expel the FRG, Soviet Russia and the other states of the Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Zone, would occupy this area and have it securely in its hand. The German Industries Exhibition takes on special meaning for the entire West’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0022009411422361">75</xref></sup> Walter Hallstein, architect of the eponymous Hallstein Doctrine, himself sent telegrams to the West German diplomats in Washington DC, London and Paris urging them to communicate this reasoning to their local governments. He warned that in Cairo the GDR was already spreading rumors that the FRG would cancel its exhibition. Thus, according to Hallstein, the West German exhibition ‘represented the entire West when it worked against the advance of the Eastern Bloc in Egypt’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0022009411422361">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>The FRG did make one misplaced concession to its European allies following the Suez Crisis, according to the West German media: the Federal Economics Minister Ludwig Erhard, who had originally planned to open the exhibition, stayed home.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0022009411422361">77</xref></sup> This absence put an embarrassing pall over the opening ceremonies, especially when Nasser himself didn’t attend the premiere either. One report berated the Federal German government for revealing that Erhard stayed home to appease Britain and France, an excuse which would certainly not have gone over well with Nasser. The reporter lamented ‘Couldn’t they have come up with a more clever excuse in Bonn? Maybe that Mr. Economics Minister had the sniffles or lumbago?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0022009411422361">78</xref></sup> More seriously, <italic>Der Spiegel</italic> reported in 1957 that Nasser was so insulted that Economics Minister Erhard had not attended the Exhibition that he wrote to the GDR government, ‘We Egyptians know who our real friends are’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0022009411422361">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>The FRG planners finally secured rights to show their exhibition on Gezirah Island in the Nile in March 1957. They started constructing their display buildings in January immediately following a Soviet exhibition in the same location that displayed machine tools and local specialties such as caviar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0022009411422361">80</xref></sup> The German-Egyptian Trade Cabinet formed a subcommittee dedicated to the exhibition headed by Christian Kroeger, leader of the Near East department of the Krupp Firm in Cairo. A coordinating committee in Germany was headed by Alfred E. Schulz, board member of DEMAG.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0022009411422361">81</xref></sup> The Exhibition and Trade Fair Committee (AUMA) founded in 1949 and chaired by Wilhelm Tigges began its concrete plans for designing the exhibition in conjunction with the International Trade Fair and Exhibition Service (IMAG), established in 1946 and headed by its founder Joachim Hietzig. IMAG was responsible for technical engineering of the pavilions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0022009411422361">82</xref></sup> It was clear from their discussions that the specter of the East German show loomed in their minds as they devised their own plans. It was crucial for them to try to outdo the GDR exhibition. This attitude surfaced in their discussion of whether to exhibit their own version of a glass woman showing internal organs. After an engineer named Vogel from the Union of German Machine Construction noted that the ‘Eastern Zone’ had already shown a glass woman in Cairo, Dr. Franz H. Reimbold from AUMA countered that the FRG’s ‘giant’ glass woman was a whole three meters high and had veins and arteries that lit up so that ‘it will be a special attraction that will considerably outdo that offered by the Eastern Zone’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0022009411422361">83</xref></sup> The FRG exhibition also had a fireworks show, but to trump the GDR version they hired the pyrotechnic whiz Hans Moog who did the fireworks for the wedding of Prince Rainier of Monaco and Grace Kelly. More spectacular than the GDR firework finale of two flags and Naguib’s face, Moog’s show featured a ‘flag forest’ of 75 Egyptian and 75 West German flags as well as images of various ethnic groups including Arab sheiks on camelback. Finally, Moog promised to make the Nile into a ‘flaming sea’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0022009411422361">84</xref></sup> Far above the exhibit, a sky-writer flew past writing in Arabic the names ‘Egypt’ and ‘Germany’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0022009411422361">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main attraction was, of course, the displays relating to German industries. The exhibition halls were designed by chief architect Horst Döhnert from the Union of German Architects in Munich with a ‘sober and modern architectural line fitting to the exhibit of industrial goods.’ (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022009411422361">Figure 2</xref>.) The style modeled the ‘attitude of restraint’ identified by Johannes Paulmann in West German exhibitions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0022009411422361">86</xref></sup> Exhibits included products from the steel, chemical, electro-technical, machine construction and transportation industries. Visitors to the exhibition got a chance to take home with them examples of West German consumer production in the form of souvenirs: 25,000 beer glasses, 20,000 pens, 25,000 yo-yos, 50,000 yellow lapel pins, and 50,000 balloons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0022009411422361">87</xref></sup> The planners at AUMA were particularly interested in promoting mutual trade with Egypt by demonstrating how Egyptian cotton and other products could easily be imported to West Germany through ports at Hamburg and Bremen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0022009411422361">88</xref></sup> Therefore in Exhibit Hall I, which offered information about the show, the back wall was covered with a multi-meter high and wide photo montage with images of shipments of goods being unloaded at the Hamburg port. The display also featured a film on a continuous loop called ‘Hamburg – Gateway to the World’ and a model of a ship with cotton being unloaded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0022009411422361">89</xref></sup> The exhibition also showed advanced technologies such as a television on which visitors could see their own image projected.

<p>Besides the main exhibition of West German products, the show also featured smaller information stands to educate the Egyptian public about the political situation in Germany. These displays emphasized the cold war message of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer’s government that the division of Germany was the Soviet Union’s fault and that the GDR was an illegitimate state. Exhibition planners therefore suggested that visitors needed to see an information stand about the division of Germany with the ‘zone border’ marked on a map that looked like it had been ripped down the borderline.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0022009411422361">90</xref></sup> West Berlin would also have its own stand at the fair depicting the issue of refugees from the East.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0022009411422361">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>The West German delegation returned from Egypt triumphant and proud of their exhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0022009411422361">92</xref></sup> According to an AUMA report on the exhibition, almost half a million visitors attended.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0022009411422361">93</xref></sup> On a date after the opening, Nasser had even wandered carefully through the exhibition taking notes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0022009411422361">94</xref></sup> However, the fact remained that Cairo would soon be exposed to a rival image of German modernization and industrial prowess; East Germany was set to showcase its national products at a second exhibition in October of the same year.</p>
<p>The GDR staged its second Industrial Exhibition in Cairo from October 20 to November 10, 1957 in the same location as the FRG exhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0022009411422361">95</xref></sup> Having learned from some mistakes made in 1954, the 1957 delegation leader Mr. Wolf declared this event an even greater success, attracting 315,000 visitors including Nasser (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022009411422361">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0022009411422361">96</xref></sup> Aware that Economics Minister Erhard had erred by his non-attendance at the FRG exhibition, GDR Minister of Foreign Trade Heinrich Rau traveled to Egypt, launched the exhibition, and spent the rest of the week holding discussions with Nasser and Egyptian trade ministers about the advantages of the Egypt–GDR relationship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0022009411422361">97</xref></sup>

<p>Whereas in 1954 the exhibition planners had not always selected the most appropriate merchandise, in 1957 the GDR delegation leader judged displayed products fit the market fully, as proven by the sealing of 1412 trade contracts. The exhibition displayed similar categories of products as in the previous fair, although the offerings demonstrated how GDR production had advanced in development of brands and export products. In 1957, 820 GDR firms featured goods including machine tools, ‘Harz’ brand tractors, three-ton trucks (‘Robur’ and ‘Barkas’ models), Zeiss optical equipment (which no longer suffered from problems from Western provocateurs), printing machines, chemical products such as Milwa soap and Mux pesticide, and beer and liquors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0022009411422361">98</xref></sup> Not all of these products sold well, but the sales were enough to give the exhibition planners hope for better trade connections with Egypt in the future.</p>
<p>The cultural program at the 1957 exhibition was also more elaborate than in 1954. It had a more coherent purpose of informing the Egyptian public about economic and social life in the GDR and to enhance the existing friendly relations between both countries. It included a film festival from the East German studio DEFA, starting with a screening of ‘Thomas Münzer’, an epic color film from 1956 about the German peasant’s war in 1524.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0022009411422361">99</xref></sup> Since the film promoted Münzer as a revolutionary hero, the exhibition planners may have been trying to connect the long revolutionary tradition in Germany to Egypt’s own recent revolution. In addition, the films were shown to build a market for DEFA productions in Egypt, since the GDR hoped to turn a profit on its film sales abroad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0022009411422361">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>The exhibition also featured additional opportunities to learn about the GDR. An exhibition within the exhibition entitled ‘GDR—Land of Peaceful Construction’ offered photographs depicting life in East Germany. Reportedly 75 percent of the overall visitors – mostly school groups – visited this smaller display and asked questions about the relationship between the two Germanys and about chances to study in the GDR. The exhibition delegation leader was relieved that no one asked provocative questions. Ostensibly, from both ‘content and artistic standpoints’ the small exhibition left a ‘good impression’ and the pictures met the educational level of the majority of the visitors, although it would have been more effective, perhaps, to have more mechanically moving displays and eye-catchers.</p>
<p>For further educational opportunities, around 2300 exhibition visitors attended a series of lectures on scientific topics including ‘problems of electrification’, ‘polytechnic education’, ‘social hygiene’, and, oddly, ‘plant psychology’, a discipline that experimented with the ‘feelings’ of plants, forcing their growth through use of magnetism or measuring plant reactions to jazz and other music. Understandably much more popular than the lectures was a boxing match, arranged with some difficulty in conjunction with the Egyptian army sport club. This event attracted 12,000 visitors, especially Egyptian soldiers, and was praised for ‘bringing attention to [GDR] development in sports’. The GDR also brought a dance and music troupe called ‘Kapelle Schneidewind’ to Cairo to perform on the opening night and at other functions (such as a celebration of the Egyptian revolution) as well as daily from 5:00 to 10:00 pm in a restaurant inside the exhibition grounds. Finally, the exhibition planners worked tirelessly to arrange for motor boat rides during the exhibition, but the lack of advertising for this service, the distance of the dock from the exhibition grounds, and the hot climate made this entertainment unpopular and not worth the major financial outlay.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0022009411422361">101</xref></sup> Overall, one can see that these amusements were planned as a sort of didactic carnival. They sought to entertain and attract audiences while also demonstrating to the Egyptian public how advanced the GDR was in social, technological, cultural and even sporting arenas. Promoting an image of the GDR as a modern partner for Egypt and fostering good-will was an important underpinning for trade relations and potential diplomatic recognition.</p>
<p>Although the West German industries exhibition may have boasted that it was welcomed in Cairo as the largest of its kind in the city, its planners knew this event was essentially an ‘interruption in a series of exhibitions by eastern bloc states’. In the end it did not manage to overwhelm the ‘export offensive of the Eastern Bloc that concentrated itself on the Near East’ or in East Germany’s efforts to become closer to Egypt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0022009411422361">102</xref></sup> Much to the chagrin of FRG leadership, the pioneering East German Industrial Exhibition in Cairo in 1954 and its successor in 1957 set the tone for a deepening relationship between the GDR and Egypt and with the short-lived 1958 union of Egypt and Syria into the United Arab Republic. During GDR President Otto Grotewohl’s 1959 world tour, Nasser received him with great fanfare in Cairo. When Grotewohl facilitated the establishment of a consulate in Cairo in 1959, the West German press reaction was gloomy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0022009411422361">103</xref></sup> Bonn considered breaking off diplomatic relations with Cairo over this almost recognition of the GDR, especially since at the same time Egypt had accepted Soviet financing for the Aswan Dam. Still West German companies continued to fund a number of industrialization ventures, such as Egypt’s first auto plant at Helwan, a power station in Alexandria, a fertilizer plant at Aswan, and a paper mill. The GDR also participated in modernizing joint-ventures by supplying machines for a spinning factory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0022009411422361">104</xref></sup> Making friends with states in this region allowed the GDR to broaden its trading partners considerably. By the end of the 1950s the GDR had trade contacts in nearly 30 non-Communist states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0022009411422361">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>Significantly, the GDR hitched its global success as a new nation to the fates of even newer national republics in the decolonizing world. As image-making enterprises, the two exhibitions strove to present not only an image of friendship but of parallel lives of these states. Just as Egypt staged a revolution against imperialism, so too was the GDR vociferously anti-imperialist. Nasser aimed to transform his country economically through broad land reform and industrialization, and the GDR sent a delegation to Egypt in 1956 to guide the government on how to implement central economic planning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0022009411422361">106</xref></sup> Just as the GDR Industrial Exhibition in 1957 had included a display called ‘GDR—Land of Peaceful Construction’, the display of the United Arab Republic at the Leipzig Spring Fair in 1958 took place under the banner ‘The New Egypt – a Land of Peaceful Construction,’ thus constructing Egypt as a mirror image of Germany that had roots in the industrialization of the nineteenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0022009411422361">107</xref></sup> A 1991 retrospective by a former member of the GDR German–Egyptian Society emphasized the many parallels between Egyptian and East German developments, especially the revolutionary creation of new regimes after the Second World War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0022009411422361">108</xref></sup> The GDR hoped through its exhibitions to reveal these commonalities so as to foster mutual solidarity between revolutionary Arab countries and the German socialist experiment.</p>
<p>This strategy was successful enough to buoy East German belief that the spread of GDR goods internationally would not only strengthen ties with the West, but would demonstrate supremacy of the socialist system. As a GDR brochure put it:
<disp-quote>
<p>Keeping in mind the great political meaning that our export goods have in capitalist countries – they are in practical terms, the diplomats of the other, the better Germany – the workers in our export industries carry a special responsibility … They must be aware that every first rate export good that our Republic produces heralds the ascent of our Worker-and-Peasant-State … When we deliver to all areas only those products that can compete with goods from capitalist countries in all respect, or – even better: those that have no competitors – then we will be able to maintain and even broaden our export trade with capitalist countries despite the occurrence of crises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0022009411422361">109</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This statement points to how important it was to the regime to display these trading ties with the ‘third world’ prominently to its own citizens and to the Western world. At the same time, these displays promoted an image of the GDR as a legitimate partner within the concert of nations that would bring it stability and recognition in comparison with West Germany. This sense of triumph may have contributed to the bravado voiced by GDR communist party chair Walter Ulbricht as he declared the ‘Primary Economic Task’ in 1958 to be to raise its population’s standard of living so high that it would overtake that in the West.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0022009411422361">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>Remarkably, the East German exhibitions put rival West Germany on the defensive. Whereas domestically West Germany’s ‘economic miracle’ was a factor arousing discontent among East Germans desiring a more luxurious consumer landscape and enticing some GDR citizens to flee westward, in this foreign setting West Germany had to struggle against the strong presence of the East. Although in much of the world, West Germany managed to prevent the GDR from having any sort of relationship – diplomatic or economic – with non-Communist countries, in the Arab world of the 1950s it was not clear whether East or West would gain greater acceptance. At some exhibitions, such as the 1958 international trade fair in Tunis, the FRG delegation judged the GDR pavilion to be so superior to its own that it was an outright ‘scandal’. In response to this humiliation, the FRG’s Economics Ministry doubled the budget for its next exhibition and made even more aggressive efforts to block East German successes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0022009411422361">111</xref></sup> Therefore, the East German and West German Industrial Exhibitions in Cairo offer unique insight into the way the Cold War competition between these two states played out in the decolonizing world.</p>
