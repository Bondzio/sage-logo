<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MySpace.com">MySpace.com</ext-link> is an online social network site (SNS) where users build a ‘profile page’ to communicate with millions of other users all over the globe. MySpace users customise their profile page with words, photographs, pictures, music, biographical information and other visual/textual icons. There are a number of unique practices that are inherent to these new online social spaces that extend from the need to maintain a personal profile. For example, many users will regularly update their profiles with new visual or textual information in order to encourage future communication (a practice that will be identified as ‘profile changing’). MySpace witnessed a high number of people joining the site in 2005 but more recently there has been similar movement away from the site and towards other online spaces. This article takes an historical look at the use of MySpace in order to explore some wider issues in online communication practices. Through an empirical analysis of 100 open-access MySpace profiles, the author examines the use of SNSs in relation to issues of self, community and wastefulness. This work also addresses the ongoing need to blur the boundaries of how we understand the relationship between human experience and technology, particularly in relation to visual/textual, online/offline, reality/representation and social/psychological.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MySpace.com">MySpace.com</ext-link> is an online social network site (SNS) where people can communicate in a variety of different ways. MySpace users are able to meet with people all over the globe and interact through a number of different means (e.g. blogs, wall posts, photo comments, etc.). MySpace was launched in 2003 and seemed to have a unique interest in music culture and the ability for users to customise their profile page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357212454098">boyd, 2007</xref>). Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation bought MySpace in 2005 for a staggering $580 million when large numbers of users seemed to be joining MySpace <italic>en masse</italic>.</p>
<p>However, more recently, it appears that MySpace has witnessed a high number of users leaving the site. So much so, that MySpace has been recently ranked 87th in the world based on the amount of web traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357212454098">Alexa.com, 2011</xref>). Subsequently, in 2011, News Corporation sold MySpace for $35 million at a heavily reduced price, evidencing the generally accepted idea that the site is officially ‘dead’. MySpace’s decline could also be linked to a range of other SNS-type technologies that offer a similar set of social functions and capabilities. Twitter, for example, is a micro-blogging website where users post short textual messages or ‘tweets’ to a network of other users. Twitter users regularly keep their audience updated with their current activities, views on recent events or general news and information. More poignantly, online users are increasingly becoming distributed across a range of online platforms and they are fundamentally less dependent on one particular site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470357212454098">Marwick and boyd, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the MySpace decline could be indicative of the way that people are now distributed across a number of online spaces.</p>
<p>In <italic>Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470357212454098">2011</xref>), Sherry Turkle discusses this multiplicity of communication technologies and the sense of distance and detachment that is inherent in the use of new technologies. She explains how there is a growing experience of vulnerability and isolation in which ‘we are increasingly connected to each other but oddly more alone: <italic>in intimacy, new solitudes’</italic> (p. 19, original emphasis). This book shows how new forms of communication, such as Facebook and Bebo, all include the need to be constantly connected to a huge number of other online users but, rather than gaining a sense of connection from these multiple relations, we are more and more experiencing a lack of any ‘authentic’ feelings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470357212454098">1</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470357212454098">Harper (2010)</xref> also argues that we both love and loathe our increasingly connected relationship with technology.</p>
<p>However, given this level of multiplicity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470357212454098">Turkle (2011)</xref> still asserts that our ability to be manifold beings does not challenge the ability to feel a sense of wholeness or unification in our use of distributed technologies. She states that it is essential that these sites encourage a level of multiplicity in order for us to feel ‘ourselves’ (p. 194). The self is then treated as a process that is constituted across a number of spaces and relations: a form of experience that is continually unfolding and changing. This idea is continued from one of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1470357212454098">Turkle’s earlier books, <italic>Life on The Screen</italic> (1995)</xref>, where she was one of the first to recognise how cyberspace showed that the self is characterised by ongoing change and fluidity (an idea that is regularly linked to a postmodern stance). This conceptualised the self as part of a multiplicity of selves where people are able to manoeuvre between different forms of online and offline selves. Turkle argues that offline selves and online selves are not separate, but tangled and interwoven in our everyday experience, as one of her participant’s notes: ‘RL [real life] is just one more window’ (p. 13). This shows the power of the online environment to provide a space where people can experiment and ‘recreate’ themselves on the screen.</p>
<p>In the recent book <italic>Alone Together</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470357212454098">2011</xref>), Turkle identifies how the distribution of networked connections and the reliance on technology leads to a lack of any real emotional communication. For Turkle, many new technologies are imbued with new feelings of solitude, isolation and separation, arguing that ‘we are increasingly connected to each other but oddly more alone: in intimacy, new solitudes’ (p. 19).</p>

<title>Profile Changing and the Online Self</title>
<p>The real strength in Sherry Turkle’s work is how her ideas have spanned a number of years and a range of different technologies. Clearly, the use of a historical perspective has given Turkle real clarity and precision to her argument. In a similar vein, this article aims to make use of an historical perspective in studying MySpace, admittedly not on the same scale, but with the intention of being able to investigate the underlying practices through an examination of older MySpace pages. In doing so, the aim is to offer some commentary on the current use of SNSs and try to recognise reoccurring social practices.</p>
<p>This study focuses on the use of MySpace in 2007. At this time, many MySpace users regularly updated their profiles with new information, texts, images, music and photographs. Users had the choice as to whether they made their profile ‘public’ or ‘private’ and this would have impacted on the ability to see certain aspects of the profile (profiles can be restricted by making them ‘friends only’). Many users made friends in MySpace by meeting people through the ‘browse’ function (where people are able to scroll through the members of MySpace in terms of a set of criteria: age, gender, sexual orientation, what they are ‘here for’, etc.) or by connecting with people that they knew offline.</p>
<p>Each profile page carried a main photograph (also referred to as the ‘default photograph’) that was typically a passport-style photograph of the profile owner. This photograph acted as a symbol of the profile page and featured in other forms of MySpace communication; for example, alongside wall comments and photo comments. MySpace users were able to personalise their profiles through the organisation of the visual and textual elements of the page. ‘Profile changing’ defines this process of updating or modifying the different aspects of the profile – ranging from a large-scale change (e.g. a change to the entire profile background) to a small-scale change (e.g. a change to the mood setting or choice of music). Many scholars identified this power of the profile page and commented on how its role was integral to the construction of the self in SNSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357212454098">boyd and Ellison, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470357212454098">Gross et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the power of the profile, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357212454098">boyd and Heer (2006)</xref> argued that an ‘online body’ was created and sustained through the text in the profile activities. Here, the online body is brought into being through the interpretation of the words on the screen as a set of semiotic resources. The use of such resources provided a way of transgressing the problems associated with an online connection; for example, a lack of a shared physical location or the ability to connect with a visible audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357212454098">boyd and Ellison, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470357212454098">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>As MySpace continued to grow, a wealth of literature documented the way an online self could be understood through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357212454098">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> notion of ‘presentation of self’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357212454098">Bargh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357212454098">Cheung, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470357212454098">Robinson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470357212454098">Siibak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1470357212454098">Whitty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1470357212454098">Wynn and Katz, 1997</xref>). Following this perspective, the online self is conceptualised by means of a ‘dramaturgical’ metaphor, whereby Goffman’s ideas could be mobilised to understand the way people strategically present themselves in a way that seems plausible to other members of the online community. Throughout an interaction, the self is invoked in particular ways so as to corroborate with other selves. This shows a pragmatic notion of the self that explains how individuals try to create, consciously or unconsciously, a response to the context of their surrounding environment. The research that uses this theory in understanding the online self is characteristically concerned with the way that different online users are able to interpret language and gestures as signs and symbols.</p>
<p>However, the developments to Goffman’s ideas have been overlooked in the application of these ideas to the study of online communication (and potentially other places). For example, Rom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470357212454098">Harré (1983)</xref> developed Goffman’s dramaturgical understanding of the self in order to reduce the emphasis on the ‘actor’ behind the mask. This research is rarely adopted in relation to the study of online phenomena but has vast implications for how the dramaturgical notions of the self could be understood and deployed in an online setting. Harré explains how individuals are more like the ‘director’ of a theatrical performance and states that individuals have the ability to be jointly concerned with both performance and critique. Thus, the self includes a number of contradictions and inconsistencies that occur at the site of interaction. Such an approach aims to close the gap between the social and the psychological in promoting a non-dualistic version of the self that is not divided into front and back stage.</p>
<p>Harré’s work could be connected with the ‘linguistic turn’ that originated in the 1980s which created a tendency to focus on the function of language and the complex way that human beings use communication to understand their social world. Discursive Psychology (DP) focuses on the way language becomes the main tool for both describing and understanding the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357212454098">Edwards and Potter, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357212454098">Gergen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470357212454098">Potter and Wetherell, 1987</xref>). DP is thus primarily concerned with the function of talk and text, and includes the traditions of discourse analysis (DA) and conversation analysis (CA), both of which utilise a fine-grained investigation of the way that language is used to mobilise a range of social actions. For example, DA is applied to the instances in which people construct themselves as a member of a particular social category: the subtle processes that people regularly engage with in order to establish their position as someone who is accountable to a certain social group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470357212454098">Potter, 1996</xref>). This field of research is of interest to an understanding of the online self and there have been many attempts to study online talk using a discursive methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357212454098">Antaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357212454098">Goodings et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In a recent study of MySpace, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1470357212454098">Van Doorn (2010)</xref> explores the ways that a network of friends uses a range of semiotic resources to bypass gender-normative practices of sexuality. Van Doorn argues that ‘affection can be conceived as flowing through the network as it is continuously (re)assembled and (re)distributed in accordance with the specific social context in which the exchanges are embedded’ (p. 598). This shows how there is a need to move beyond Goffman’s ideas in order to explicate the way our experience is intertwined in a complex set of selves that are mobilised at the site of online communication (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357212454098">Booth, 2008</xref>). This encourages a focus on complexity and fluidity in the analysis of SNSs.</p>

<title>The Visual and the Textual</title>
<p>However, in concentrating on the linguistic power of communication in SNSs, little attention has been paid to the visual aspects of communication. In fact, few studies of SNSs have explored the power of the visual or, perhaps more importantly, the way that the visual and the textual work together at the site of communication. Visual methods are growing in popularity and they show how the use of photographs, videos and other visual-based methodologies can be analysed in a number of ways. Furthermore, visual data are frequently used in ethnographic investigations as a way of evidencing a particular culture or phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357212454098">Knoblach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470357212454098">Pink, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470357212454098">2008</xref>). Much of this work builds on the broader success of using visual methodologies in sociology and social anthropology. These areas also build on the field of semiotics where there is an interest in the production of meaning-making through visual symbols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357212454098">Barthes, 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357212454098">1991</xref>). As a result of the over-indulgence in the textual aspects of the communication, there have been several attempts to combine DA with a range of visual analyses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357212454098">Greiffenhagen and Watson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470357212454098">Norris, 2002</xref>). However, this work has been criticised for the way it views the visual as a supplementary function of spoken communication (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357212454098">Bohnsack, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470357212454098">Norris, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357212454098">Jewitt et al. (2002)</xref> state that communication is essentially ‘multimodal’ and should therefore be studied in such a way. Multimodal analysis acknowledges different layers of communication without over-emphasising one dimension over another (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357212454098">Bezemer and Jewitt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357212454098">Jewitt, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, with regard to the specific use of a computer (or other media devices), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357212454098">Jewitt and Triggs (2006)</xref> argue that information that is presented to us on the screen shows how people are able to mediate information and establish a shared sense of experience through communication. Therefore, in an attempt to utilise an equal relationship between the visual and the textual, this article will use the teachings of Michel Foucault.</p>
<p>In <italic>This Is Not a Pipe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470357212454098">1982</xref>), Foucault explores the multiplicity of the visual and the textual in a discussion of a painting by René Magritte. The painting shows a picture of a pipe with the words ‘Ceci n’est pas une pipe’ (This is not a pipe) written underneath. Foucault discusses how the painting exposes our conceptions of things and signs to show how both the visual and the textual can be treated as instances of power. For Foucault, there is no resolution to the difference between the words in the painting and the image of the pipe. In fact, it is precisely this unsteadiness between the visual and the textual that is present in our everyday encounters with pictures and words. Foucault argues that words should not be understood as supporting the visual or vice versa, but rather that the mixing of different elements, of words and pictures, provides the basis of our experience (for further discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357212454098">Brown, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357212454098">Brown and Stenner, 2009</xref>). This unites with the growing need to understand the visual in psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470357212454098">Reavey, 2011</xref>) and could further aid the retrospective exploration of communication in MySpace.</p>

<sec id="section4-1470357212454098">
<title>Mediated Community</title>
<p>So far, this article has considered a number of key issues that are important to the study of MySpace, including the self and the visual/textual. However, there is one further concept that is crucial to this debate – community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470357212454098">Rheingold (1993)</xref> first used the term ‘virtual community’ to explain how cyberspace could act as a space for shedding the confines of our offline lives and moving to a space of unlimited possibility and opportunity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470357212454098">Leary, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470357212454098">Plant, 1997</xref>). However, given the everyday use of online communication technologies, there are no reasons for understanding a virtual community as warranting some kind of special status or position. Furthermore, this approach avoids the possibility that community is something that could be <italic>felt</italic> or <italic>experienced</italic>.</p>
<p>In order to access this felt notion of community, it is necessary to look outside the notion of a virtual community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357212454098">Lave and Wenger (1991)</xref> define a community in terms of a shared sense of practices where the formation of these shared meanings is culturally, historically and contextually dependent. From this perspective, communities are defined by a collective set of practices as opposed to the essential qualities of the group (their shape or size, for example). In <italic>Imagined Communities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357212454098">1983</xref>), Anderson describes the way that people participate in a range of extreme activities based on a shared sense of belonging. This distinction is particularly useful in the study of MySpace as it also includes an explanation of how people feel attached to their social group without a need for regular contact: the imagined community. Anderson writes:<disp-quote>
<p>It is <italic>imagined</italic> because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of the fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion. (p. 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This quote shows that the imagined community is not considered to be in the minds of individuals but in the social practices of the community. This does not imply that there is no psychological element to the imagined community, rather that the psychological and the social are constituted at the point of interaction. The imagined presence of a community in MySpace mobilises a specific set of social practices. Each user is connected to a network of other users who may provide a potential source of communication. However, it is important that this definition does not state that people <italic>will</italic> act in any predetermined sense. The community is treated as <italic>just there</italic> due to the way that the users have to act <italic>into</italic> the community in order to create meaning. It is then in each interaction that the negotiation of what it means to be in that community is created and maintained. Thus, the community is continually changing in relation to an imagined set of relations and a current set of social practices. This idea is fitting for the study of MySpace as many users will have many more friends than one person could reasonably expect to maintain in any real sense of friendship (e.g. some users have hundreds of thousands of friends) and therefore there is a strong potential for an imagined connection between the users.</p>
<p>This article defines MySpace as a ‘mediated community’ in order to capture the unique way that MySpace facilitates the production of a shared set of practices, which shows that it is not dissimilar from any other sort of community (e.g. in an offline setting). Mediated community emphasises the specific practices that are unique to MySpace and defines the particular modality in which the mediation occurs in MySpace. The modality is provided by the distinctive way that MySpace users design and re-design who they are and who they are friends with. This includes something of an imagined element of community due to the high number of relatively weak social ties.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470357212454098">Marwick and boyd (2010</xref>: 124) follow a similar line of inquiry in looking at the micro-blogging site Twitter where they argue that the community presence has a direct impact on the way people use Twitter to the extent that ‘the imagined audience affects how people tweet’. Marwick and boyd also address the issue of distribution across a number of different platforms where they argue that people are able to ‘collapse’ different audiences into a singular set of actions. However, one essential difference between the way Marwick and boyd conceptualise the imagined audience and the current use of mediated community is that the former is ‘cognitively constructed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357212454098">boyd, 2006b</xref>). In contrast, the latter focuses on a sense of community that is located at a social level. Clearly, in order to understand the notion of imagined or mediated community, there is a need to blur the social and the psychological in order to examine the complexity of profile changing in MySpace.</p>

<title>Data Collection, Ethics and Analysis</title>
<p>The data for this analysis are taken from two open-access profiles from MySpace in 2007. A total of 100 MySpace profiles were initially gathered using the MySpace ‘browse’ function. The search initially returned over 3000 hits by using the following search terms: <italic>age</italic> – ‘between 18 and 35’ (the default setting); <italic>location</italic> – ‘UK’; and <italic>what are you here for</italic> – ‘networking’. The term ‘networking’ was chosen in order to search for active members in MySpace. The profile changes of 100 MySpace users were observed and recorded over a period of one month (<italic>N</italic> = 100). The sample included 61 males and 39 females, aged between 18 and 39.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470357212454098">3</xref></sup> The URLs from the original search were stored on a computer and the data were recorded by visiting the profile pages every day and taking a screenshot of the entire profile page. This data collection had to be conducted over a short period of time because in MySpace (as with other SNSs) the links to other profiles can very quickly become ‘old’ or ‘broken’. This method also allowed for the capture of a higher amount of contextual information by following one strand of profile changes over a short period of time.</p>
<p>All forms of identifying information have been deleted from the profile screenshots. The names that feature in this report are all pseudonyms and are designed to conceal the identity of the profile owner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470357212454098">4</xref></sup> The unique URL to their profile has also been removed in order to block the possibility of searching for the page. In order to allow withdrawal, the MySpace users were sent private messages through their MySpace email accounts which included information on this study. Included in this message was the opportunity to withdraw from the study. None of the 100 participants decided to withdraw from the study as a result of this process (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357212454098">Davis, 2010</xref>, for a similar ethical set of concerns). Hopefully, the time that has passed since gathering these data will also act as a way of protecting the participants further.</p>
<p>Participants were removed from the study if they changed their profile status to ‘private’ (or if they deleted the profile entirely) during the data gathering process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470357212454098">5</xref></sup> This research was able to keep to standard ethical procedures by restricting the involvement of certain vulnerable groups (such as the over 65s and under 18s). Also, during the course of the study, MySpace privacy statements, terms of use and other more general help features were all monitored to maintain a high knowledge of the ethical issues surrounding the use of MySpace and the internet more generally. The findings of this investigation have been treated with a high level of social sensitivity and any information that was felt to be potentially damaging was immediately destroyed. The cookies/web page addresses were all deleted from the system once the data had been gathered. There is the possibility that other academic researchers could populate the site but, given the way this article is taken from a time when user figures were at their highest, it is unlikely that any academics would feature in a random sample.</p>
<p>The study of MySpace and of any other form of new technology requires the need to re-address conventional notions of ethics. In this case, the attempt to conduct new forms of research should consider any ethical dilemmas in order to create a space for the research to continue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357212454098">Griffiths and Whitty, 2010</xref>). In studying MySpace it must be remembered that the data were gathered from a space (and time) where there was an emphasis on doing things publicly. MySpace users would post messages, upload videos, create blogs and modify their profiles in a way that was intentionally profile; so much so, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357212454098">boyd and Heer (2006)</xref> labelled the use of MySpace as a ‘public identity performance’. In 2007, when the data were collected, two thirds of MySpace profile pages were found to be world visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470357212454098">Hinduja and Patchin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470357212454098">Thelwall, 2008</xref>) and it is therefore reasonable to expect that MySpace users were aware of the public nature of the site.</p>
<p>It is necessary to maintain a high level of ethical sensitivity by respecting participants’ expectations of privacy and consider the extent to which observations may have potentially damaging effects for participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357212454098">Ess and the AoIR Ethics Working Committee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357212454098">Flicker et al., 2004</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470357212454098">Thrift (2003</xref>: 108) notices how ‘new forms of ethics close down some of the main means by which we learn about others and other cultures’. This implies that certain areas of research may become restricted in the future due to the power of ethical procedures. This is particularly an issue for SNSs where there is strong potential for ethical decisions to be influenced by the wider mass media (what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470357212454098">Marwick, 2008</xref>, refers to as a ‘technopanic’). Thrift argues that, as researchers, we need to expand our subjectivity to take on the experience of those being studied. This involves exercising good judgement about what is presented in online environments and always considering issues of privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Each of the 100 profiles was read repeatedly to identify reoccurring aspects of profile changing. A multimodal analysis was applied to the data by considering both the visual and the textual aspects of the communication. However, even though there is a definite decision to further the use of a purely textual analysis, this study still aims to maintain a ‘discursive mentality’, whereby there is an interest in any form of inconsistency or ambiguity in the interaction – that is, moments when the MySpace users appear to be doing something with the visual or the textual aspects of the page in order to achieve a particular social action.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>This analysis will now illustrate the version of the self in question and explore the practice of profile changing in MySpace. The first personal profile is taken from a MySpace user called ‘It’s a Casual Thing’ (or just ‘Casual’ for the purpose of this report).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470357212454098">6</xref></sup> Casual is a male MySpace user who changes his profile three times during the course of this study; he is an active user who regularly visits his page and communicates to a number of other users via the site.</p>

<title>Extract 1: Positioning the self in MySpace</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357212454098">Figure 1</xref> shows the use of a dimly lit profile photograph that acts to distort the body image and direct the gaze to the other, more vibrant, areas of the profile background. Casual’s background consists of a number of brand labels in a colourful arrangement across the entirety of the profile. Casual’s profile page includes a tag line that is adjacent to the profile photograph which reads ‘Creamfields Aug 25th … loving it!!’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470357212454098">7</xref></sup> Each of these activities shows how Casual is able to demonstrate an active status through his profile page and how the potential to encourage future communication can be present in even the smallest aspect of the profile page. For example, another MySpace user might ‘reply’ to Casual’s tag line by commenting on their intention to go to Creamfields.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357212454098">Figure 1</xref> shows how the profile name, ‘It’s a Casual Thing’, appears to have a connection with the phrase ‘Vic Casuals’ in the interactive box. The interactive box is a section of the profile page that is located directly below the profile photograph and includes a number of different ways of contacting the profile owner. Like any other part of a MySpace page, the interactive box can also be customised. Casual’s interactive box features a number of references that demonstrate a strong gendered performance, for example, ‘your going home in a Yorkshire ambulance’. This statement is localised in place through the significance of it being a ‘<italic>Yorkshire</italic> ambulance’ and also performs a wider connection with a male stereotype through the reference to violence and aggression. Therefore, Casual is able to make use of different semiotic resources from different parts of the page to signal a particular formation of the self in MySpace.</p>
<p>In the ‘who I’d like to meet’ section of Casual’s profile, there is a list of iconic male figures who embody this version of the self, which includes: ‘Muhammed Ali’, ‘Liam Gallagher’ and ‘Ray Winstone’. This information is connected to the blurb section of the profile where Casual describes himself as a ‘fairly confident’ person who likes ‘a good night out or a holiday with the lads’ – again showing a strong performance of masculinity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357212454098">Figure 1</xref> also shows that Casual has a high number of friends (273 exactly) which would suggest that he has an increased level of social status (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357212454098">Lampe et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The profile activities show a way of ‘positioning’ Casual’s self in MySpace. Social positioning explains the way people are able to discursively identify themselves with a particular social category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357212454098">Davies and Harré, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357212454098">Harré and Van Langenhove, 1991</xref>). From this perspective, the self is then dependent on the way a person is positioned in any given interaction and explains the way people are different from one identity category to the next (e.g. a school child may act very differently when in the presence of a teacher as opposed to his or her friends). The self is accomplished and negotiated through the shaping of the interaction to achieve a particular position within a group (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470357212454098">Harré, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357212454098">Figure 1</xref> shows how Casual is signalling a membership to a particular social group that shares a similar set of values in relation to the performance of masculinity. Therefore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357212454098">Figure 1</xref> shows how Casual is concerned with articulating his position within an imagined network of MySpace users. The following screenshot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470357212454098">Figure 2</xref>) shows the first set of changes that Casual makes to his profile:</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470357212454098">Figure 2</xref> shows the changes to Casual’s profile of which the first noticeable change is that the display name has been changed to ‘Vic Casual’ (a phrase that was previously found in the interactive box). This shows that users are able to make connections across different profiles in time as a way of constructing the self. The profile picture has also changed to a new photograph of Casual with another male wherein the jacket that the new male is wearing also appears to match one of the images from the interactive box. This shows a level of interactional binding that ties the different elements of the profile page together.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470357212454098">Figure 2</xref> shows that the tag line has been changed from ‘Creamfields Aug 25th … loving it’ to ‘It’s Grim Up North’ which shows a clear rhetorical contrast between the positive construction of ‘loving it’ in the first profile to the negativity of being ‘Up North’ in the current profile. This subtle change could provide the impetus for the MySpace audience to recognise the wider changes in Casual’s profile. The blurb section of Casual’s profile has been subject to a number of changes, including a list of ‘things in life [that Casual] couldn’t live without’. The list contains: ‘1) family and friends. 2) Football – Leeds United and England. 3) Alcoholism – Strongbow Love it!!!’ The act of clarifying the things he ‘couldn’t live without’ shows that the organisation of the profile is hinged on the way that the profile is received by a particular group of people.</p>
<p>However, this is not to suggest that the change commands the community to act in a particular way. Clearly, within the attempt to forge a new set of relations (such as the identity on offer in this profile), it is crucial to remember that these profiles are inherently visible to a wide number of users. It could be for this reason that the reference to ‘family and friends’ still appears as the first item in Casual’s list. Even if the other members do not look at these subtle changes that Casual makes, there is an imagined sense of mediated community that is invoked in the process of profile changing. It may be of importance that Casual does not change any of the people in the ‘top 8’ section of his profile. The ‘top 8’ section of the profile has been identified as an important aspect to the function of friendships in MySpace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357212454098">boyd, 2006a</xref>). The final set of changes to Casual’s profile show a more dramatic set of changes to the profile. Here is the screenshot of the changes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470357212454098">Figure 3</xref>):</p>
<fig id="fig3-1470357212454098" position="float">

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470357212454098">Figure 3</xref> shows how Casual has completely removed the background from the profile page. The page has been left with a plain white background (the default setting) that signifies a withdrawal from the earlier profile pages. This symbolises a shift in the construction of the self and a deletion of the masculine identity category. To look at the profile in stages would not communicate the same message as the earlier profiles and would fail to identify with a distinct audience. This shows the self in process – moving from one position to another – where, with each change, the self in MySpace is able to accommodate an alternative subject position. This offers the MySpace user an opportunity to visit different selves, while at the same time feeling part of a coherent whole and connected under a different set of conditions.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470357212454098">Figure 3</xref>, Casual is wiping away that last set of identity markers in order to create a space for new connections to be made. Casual’s profile is in a state of flux where a new direction to the self is waiting to be applied to the profile. It is interesting to note that Casual’s number of friends has increased from 270 to 345 as a result of the previous changes to the profile. This would imply that a high amount of profile activity results in a high number of friends where each new friend brings an increased <italic>potential</italic> for communication and the renegotiation of the self.</p>
<sec id="section8-1470357212454098">
<title>Wastefulness in MySpace</title>
<p>However, it could also be argued that a great amount of these changes to the profiles have a high potential to go unnoticed. What if the other members of the mediated community do not notice any of them? In <italic>The Ecstasy of Communication</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357212454098">1988</xref>), Jean Baudrillard conceives a technological space where people are so heavily interested in their own appearance that others almost cease to exist (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357212454098">Lanier, 2010</xref>). For Baudrillard, the rise of different forms of communication technology offers the opportunity for individuals to constantly reproduce themselves and constitutes the ‘death of expression’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357212454098">Baudrillard (1988</xref>: 29) writes, ‘what matters above everything else is proving our existence, even if that is its only meaning.’ Even though this work is not specifically targeted at SNS, there is some similarity in the way that the data have shown the basic, emotionally disconnected relationship where someone is obliged to keep updating his or her profile: It simply states that <italic>I am here</italic>.</p>
<p>Baudrillard identifies the way modern technology seems to be littered with a vast amount of unnecessary communication that is dedicated to our own sense of uniqueness. In a similar vein, some view the communication in new technologies as a form of ‘phatic communion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470357212454098">Malinowski, 1923</xref>). The argument here is that the communication in many new media technologies generates a vast amount of vacuous, unnecessary forms of communication. This could be evidenced from the number of changes to Casual’s profile, whereby the high numbers of changes to the profile do very little to signal a change in the self.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470357212454098">Turkle (2011)</xref>, the constant need to change or update a profile page (or other medium) is indicative of the new levels of isolation or ‘solitude’ that are inherent in new technologies. This binding of intimacy and solitude could be related to this intrinsic form of wastefulness and the way that a large amount of profile activity is an essential component of everyday communication. This could also be understood as the dilemma between distance and closeness that is inherent in these online social practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357212454098">Goodings, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470357212454098">Figure 3</xref> also suggests that there is a need for a high amount of profile activity in order to increase the possibility of future communication. This supports the idea that people have to act into these online communities in order to create meaning and offers an alternative view on describing these activities as wasteful. It might actually be the case that the visual performance of profile changes is essential to communicating a continued presence to the other members of the mediated community and also signifies an ongoing desire to communicate. These claims will be further explored in Extract 2.</p>

<title>Extract 2: The potential self in MySpace</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470357212454098">Figure 4</xref> shows a different MySpace user. This time the data relate to the actions of a female user who has a high amount of activity on her profile. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470357212454098">Figure 4</xref> shows that Julia (her real name has been anonymised) states that ‘I am opinionated – but that doesn’t make me a bad person, and I’m not fake, but I just can’t be … but then again how many times on this site do you hear people quote that?’ The use of the marker ‘on this site’ appears to be of interactional significance as she is positioning herself as somehow different to other forms of interaction. Her blurb begins with the question ‘where does anyone start when having to talk about themselves?’ This question is juxtaposed to many MySpace practices (e.g. the blog) that requires a form of self-reflection. There is also a playful use of the phrase ‘I’m not fake, how can I be … but then how many times on this site do you hear people quote that?’ This refusal to construct the profile in a traditional sense creates another way of constituting the self.</p>
<fig id="fig4-1470357212454098" position="float">
<label>Figure 4.</label>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470357212454098">Figure 4</xref> shows the playful rejection of the profiling norms in Julia’s personal profile. The construction is intentionally positioned as being different to the rest of the users in MySpace. For example, Julia’s display name is ‘How I’d hate to be like you’ and such a name would suggest distaste for the kind of activity that occurs in MySpace but it is clear from the other sections of the profile that this distance from the other members of MySpace is a way of constituting closeness. This distance provides another way of demonstrating identity as with the display of masculinity in Extract 1.</p>
<p>However, the profile includes a number of inconsistencies; for example, a different location of the page describes her commitment to being a ‘loving’ and ‘caring’ person. This shows how self is performed through the power of this contradiction and evidences the idea that the presentation of self does not fit a linear pattern. It is also noteworthy that the text description of her capabilities as a caring person is actually an image: it is a picture that has been uploaded to the page in that particular location on the page. This shows the conception of the visual and the textual is not one that can be easily separated in MySpace as there are many textual occurrences on the page that are actually uploaded as a picture. The following changes were made to Julia’s profile (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470357212454098">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470357212454098">Figure 5</xref> shows the continuation of the playful construction of the self in the first profile as Julia has changed her display name to ‘I don’t love you I’m just passing the time’. Again, this performs a distance from one potential audience – those who support alternative forms of MySpace practices. However, the most notable change to the profile is the addition of a number of photographs to the profile page. The blurb (which previously included the line ‘where does anyone start when having to talk about themselves’) has been replaced with a collage of photographs which cycle through a number of different images in a slideshow format. These photographs include a number of photographs of Julia (matched to the profile photograph) in a range of venues with a variety of different people. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470357212454098">Figure 5</xref> also shows changes to the song choice and profile background, which bolster the membership of a particular social group in MySpace.</p>
<p>There is a similar contradiction in this profile as with the previous profile page: Julia ‘hates’ to be like other members of MySpace, while at the same time the visual aspects of the profile suggest a high number of positive connections in MySpace. This contradiction provides a way of <italic>doing</italic> identity. This uses the difference across the profile changes as a way of cementing interest in the profile and embedding a narrative in the self. Perhaps one of the reasons for intervening with these moments of contradiction is due to the way that the self is never finished in MySpace and it requires to be seen as continuously moving and changing. The self is always ‘in potential’ and never finished both online and offline. This shows that movement and change are essential properties of the self in MySpace. It can be argued that the moment a MySpace user constitutes the self in MySpace he or she is responsible for keeping it moving and changing, just as with real life situations and relations. In MySpace, this process requires the unique mediation of an imagined community of members.</p>
<p>Extract 2 seems to further support the possibility of a mediated community that relies on the constant performance of a set of imagined connections as opposed to a community of people who are ‘just there’ (in the way that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470357212454098">Marwick and boyd, 2010</xref>, describe the possibility of an ‘imagined audience’). Furthermore, Marwick and boyd explain how there is a possibility that each action has the ability to ‘collapse’ audiences into a single action but, following this analysis, it is also possible that a single action has the ability to ‘extend’ the connections to a potential audience. This distinction is helpful in exploring the claim that new technologies also bring with them a new sense of distance. For MySpace users, it would appear that there is a dilemma of closeness and distance that is embedded in the way that the self is negotiated and re-negotiated in the everyday use of the site.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Through the analysis of empirical data from MySpace profiles, this study has attempted to use a historical approach to identify current social practices. It is necessary to look at SNSs in this way as technology is constantly changing and moving in new directions. For example, at the time of writing this article, Google have recently launched a new SNS (Google+;) that has the potential to rival Facebook. It is possible that Facebook will soon witness widespread movement to Google+; that is similar to the movement from MySpace to Facebook. What this demonstrates is that it is necessary to look at the ‘past’ uses of SNSs in order to capture the use of these sites in the present.</p>
<p>The current findings from MySpace can be applied to similar forms of current social networking technologies in four main ways: (i) that constant change is essential to the construction of the self in these spaces; (ii) that, despite the way the self is constantly shifting, there is still the ability to feel part of a coherent whole in SNSs; (iii) that the self is essentially <italic>hoped-for</italic> in the profile changes; and (iv) that construction of the self requires a joint relationship between the visual and the textual. These findings will now be discussed in more detail.</p>
<p>Firstly, this research shows that the constant changes to the profile page are fundamental to the construction of the self in MySpace. While appearing to be somewhat wasteful, the changes are essential to the presentation of the online self by foregrounding a number of communicative possibilities. This shows that SNSs are not automatically a space for communication and that each MySpace member is confronted with the task of constructing the self through the different aspects of the profile page. Users need communication to understand who they are (and who they can be) in this space. The micro-blogging site Twitter also has the same wasteful qualities but, like MySpace, Twitter relies on a set of anticipatory actions that are necessary for carving out a space for communication. Therefore, the constant need to ‘talk’ is an essential component of this technology.</p>
<p>Secondly, the analysis of MySpace shows how we are not able to directly experiment with a number of social positions through activities such as profile changing, but that the self exists in the spaces <italic>between</italic> these different selves (or profiles). This is due to the way in which, even though there is a high amount of dispersion across different sites and profiles, the self still feels part of a coherent whole. This is because the self is a process that does not allow a sense of division and continually resists spatial comparisons. Consider one of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470357212454098">Foucault’s later (2000</xref>: 290–291) definitions of self for further clarity of this idea:<disp-quote>
<p>It is not a substance. It is a form, and this form is not primarily or always identical to itself. You do not have the same sort of relationship to yourself when you constitute yourself as a political subject who goes to vote or speaks at a meeting and when you are seeking to fulfil your desires in a sexual relationship. Undoubtedly there are relationships and interferences between these different forms of subject; but we are not dealing with the same type of subject. In each case, one plays, one establishes a different relationship to oneself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This shows how different selves do not collide because our experience involves an inherent multiplicity. In MySpace, the different selves that are created in each profile page present an opportunity to experiment with the self in a variety of ways, tangled up in a variety of different meanings that cross over but that, most importantly, do not crash into each other. This concept complicates the ‘dramaturgical’ notion of the self and the idea that we present a version of ourselves that will match the other actors in a social setting. This shows how different MySpace profiles offer an opportunity to produce a particular form of the self, which will not collide with the other selves as it is not the ‘same type of subject’.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the historical analysis of MySpace allows for a development of the ideas on the ‘imagined audience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470357212454098">Marwick and boyd, 2010</xref>). This article argues that MySpace extracts demonstrated a community that cannot be said to act in any particular way (if we recall it is ‘just there’) and constituted what could be described as a mediated community. In a mediated community, one could describe these selves as fundamentally <italic>hoped-for</italic> as they relate to a desired form of self that is specifically crafted to appeal to an imagined sense of community. Therefore, the multiple forms of the self are hoped-for due to the construction of the self in terms of a felt sense of community in MySpace. In practice, the hoped-for self requires constructing a multitude of different forms of the self in order to align with the multiplicity of imagined community ties.</p>
<p>Finally, the study of MySpace shows how the online self requires the use of both the visual and textual aspects of the site. Thus, conceptions of the online body and the self should include the power of the visual as it does not just fill in the gaps in the discourse, but rather that they dissolve as separate entities in the MySpace page and form a communicative whole – one which again could be interpreted as wastefulness, but is actually part of the ongoing attempt to forge a link with a particular version of the self in a complex set of relations with other users. The everyday use of MySpace involves a multifaceted relationship between self and community, real and imagined, online and offline, and – most crucially – visual and textual.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470357212454098">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Historical research of this kind can promote vital discussion on the changing shape of the online social landscape. Following this article, an investigation of Facebook (or other SNSs) could seek to understand how a variety of modes of expression allows for the construction of self and identity. It could also consider how different privacy settings allow for the formation of community. Considering that many sites have tighter privacy settings than MySpace, how does the imagined community function in Facebook and other SNSs? On a broader scale, there is a need to look at the complex way that communication technologies continue to mediate our everyday lives in diverse and intricate ways.</p>

<p>Some people still maintain profiles in this way but the use of the past tense is aiming to capture the way that many people have left MySpace in recent years.</p></fn>

<p>However, the majority of the users that featured in this sample were between 18 and 24 years. MySpace users are typically found to be aged between 14 and 24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357212454098">boyd, 2006a</xref>). Users who stated that they were below 18 were excluded from this study.</p></fn>

<p>Apart from those names that do not allow for recognition in any way, such as ‘It’s a Casual Thing’.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-1470357212454098">
<label>5.</label>
<p>However, this does mean that the findings cannot be generalised to the entirety of MySpace as there are a high number of users who communicate through private networks in MySpace. The reason for using public profiles, other than the ethical advantage, was to capture the communication from those people who used MySpace openly and had the potential to communicate with a variety of different people in MySpace.</p></fn>

<p>Even though the screenshots are labelled as first, second and third, this is purely for analytic purposes and it is important to remember that these screenshots could have been part of an ongoing number of changes.</p></fn>
