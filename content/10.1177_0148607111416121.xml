<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Nutrition care as we know it has been practiced for 40 years. It was begun, and has evolved, under the influence of nutrition research. And it has been shaped by the healthcare system in which it is embedded. Although the future is admittedly hard to predict, the author has made a determined effort to identify the trends in nutrition science and the political and demographic currents affecting healthcare reform, all of which will strongly influence the practice of nutrition care over the next 2 or 3 decades.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This address will consider the future of nutrition care over the next 2 or 3 decades, from 2 different viewpoints. First, I will outline the scientific areas in which the most significant advances will be made. Second, I will discuss the healthcare system in which we must care for patients.</p>
<p>It has to be admitted that talking about the future has its hazards.</p>

</p>
<p>Indeed, the past is littered with the quotations of famous people who got it all wrong. This is certainly true for big things:</p>

The richest man in the world can be excused a few trivial errors early in his career.</p>

<title>A Short History of Nutrition Support</title>
<p>In the first third of the 20th century, the foundations for modern nutrition science were built. From 1920 to the 1940s, there was keen interest in nutrition among biomedical scientists. Much of what we know now was established during that period. But then, from the mid-1940s up to the mid-1960s, there was a great falling off. Medical students were taught that malnutrition was an incidental part of disease and nothing could or should be done about it. This neglect of nutrition began to be reversed in the 1960s, in large part due to the work by Dudrick and Wilmore, which established parenteral nutrition (PN) as a form of therapy. And, as an additional side benefit, established the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.).</p>
<p>Nutrition care grew with intensive care. Over these years, intensive care units (ICUs) evolved from modest beginnings—a few beds in the back of the recovery room—into dedicated units for specialized care of the critically ill. Burn care, trauma care, and the care of all manner of acute illnesses developed dramatically. The first modern ventilators appeared in the mid-1960s. Neonatal ICUs became universal. All of these advances were accompanied by the development of more and more sophisticated methods of nutrition support.</p>
<p>Over the next 20 years, nutrition support grew and became more important in the care of critically ill and hospitalized patients. PN became standard. Enteral nutrition (EN) expanded greatly, both in terms of available formulas and methods for administering them.</p>
<p>But then, around 1990, skepticism began to set in. This always happens with new medical advances. First comes disbelief. Next is great enthusiasm. Then there is a return of skepticism. Finally, we achieve a balanced acceptance of the benefits and the costs of the new therapy. Right now, we’re not quite there. There is a great deal of denial of the need for nutrition, as well as fear of the complications of PN and (to a lesser extent) EN.</p>
<p>We have not achieved our goals. It is true that we have made great progress in nutrition care of both adult and pediatric patients. But today, just as in the 1970s, some 30% to 40% of hospitalized patients are nutritionally challenged or outright malnourished. We have developed the tools, and they are ready to be used. But they are not being used. We still have the “nutrition gap” that has persisted down the years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0148607111416121">
<title>Where Is Nutrition Science Going to Lead Us?</title>
<p>There are 3 areas in which nutrition science will greatly influence how we treat patients in the next 20 years. These are, to put it simply, the expanding collection of data, the definition of roles for specific nutrients, and the increasing understanding of patient-disease-nutrient interactions.</p>
<p>The first of these areas is fundamental to clinical practice. It is the basic hypothesis of nutrition support that, since people die if they don’t eat, then feeding them will help them get well. But we have done less than we should to prove this hypothesis. For one thing, we were too eager to feed everyone. For another, there are relatively few studies incorporating nonfed controls. There were ethical reasons for this. Many institutional review boards refused to permit studies in which one group or another was left unfed. Partly as a result, we did too many studies of EN vs PN, and too few studies of feeding vs no feeding. We proved, by many prospective randomized double-blind studies, that if patients can tolerate either EN or PN, then EN is best. Now, I started doing this in 1970. We knew that back then. Over those years, we have failed to prove conclusively that nutrition support of sick patients helped them to get better. We have to look seriously at the question, Does nutrition make a difference? And we must look at methods: how will we tell?</p>
<p>Medicine is presently in a climate of skepticism. If nutrition therapy is to be used more widely, we must convince our colleagues that it will improve outcomes of patient care. And so, we are spending time and effort in an effort to look more closely at the evidence for nutrition support. Doing the necessary studies and assembling a more convincing justification for the place of nutrition in patient care will require a great deal of work and will not be completed soon. This will occupy much of our research effort over the next 20 years. And that is as it should be. Providing the data to support nutrition care will have a more direct effect on our practices than anything else we do.</p>
<p>There are many unanswered questions out there. Should we supplement EN with PN to meet nutrition targets? How effective is critical care nutrition? What about home nutrition support? Do the specialized formulas work? A.S.P.E.N.’s SUSTAIN program will build a database that, we hope, will help us to get some of the answers. Furthermore, we will form consortia of several institutions and carry out multicenter prospective randomized studies to evaluate many of the questions. There are too many aspects of nutrition care that we think are true but that we cannot prove.</p>
<p>Let me caution, however, that not all of the questions will be amenable to the gold standard of the prospective randomized study. Consider this title of a recent article<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111416121">1</xref></sup>: “Parachute Use to Prevent Death and Major Trauma Related to Gravitational Challenge: Systematic Review of Randomised Controlled Trials.”</p>
<p>Perhaps needless to say, it was a very short article. Its conclusion was, “Parachutes reduce the risk of injury after gravitational challenge, but their effectiveness has not been proved with randomised controlled trials.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111416121">1</xref></sup> The authors went on to suggest possible subjects for such randomized trials. However, because it became clear that they had a bias against institutional review board members, I will not repeat their suggestions.</p>
<p>Second, we will not neglect, nor should we, the more traditional forms of research. In particular, it is becoming more and more evident that nutrients are involved in the body in a variety of roles, not just as a source of calories and nitrogen. Nutrients currently being investigated include glutamine, arginine, branched-chain amino acids, medium-chain triglycerides, and both ω-3 and ω-9 fatty acids. And there are many others.</p>
<p>Much of my own investigative work involves such agents. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111416121">Figure 1</xref>, as an example, shows the variation in the expression of LMP-7 protein as a function of arginine concentration in RAW 264.7 cells in tissue culture, both at normoxia (21%) and hypoxia (1.5%). LMP-7 is a proteolytic subunit of the proteasome, an intracellular organelle that is intimately involved in the regulation of the inflammatory reaction. And <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111416121">Figure 2</xref> shows the variation in the signal for tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), as measured by mRNA, both with and without hypoxia, with varying levels of arginine. It is clear that mRNA increases as arginine decreases under normal oxygen conditions, but it increases as arginine increases under hypoxia. Why? Well . . . my lab is still working that out.</p>

</fig>
<p>The third area of investigation over the next few years, which will have profound effects on the practice of nutrition support, is the progressive understanding of the relationships among the patient, nutrition, and disease. This has already led to a change in how malnutrition is regarded, measured, and defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111416121">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0148607111416121">Figure 3</xref> shows an outline of the new concept of etiology-related malnutrition. Traditionally, we have regarded malnutrition as a condition that exists independent of disease. Indeed, the view that malnutrition was an inevitable consequence of diseases such as tuberculosis or cancer caused great harm in the past. It led to the concept that if you treated the disease, the malnutrition would get better pretty much without any treatment. We know that to be untrue, but we have moved too far in the other direction. We can now appreciate that malnutrition and disease are intimately related. Treatment of either without treating the other is a path to disaster.</p>

</fig>
<p>The interaction between patients and their internal microflora, long of interest to nutrition scientists, now attracts interest in the general biological science community. A recent paper in <italic>Science</italic> by Lee and Mazmanian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111416121">3</xref></sup> proposed that the gut bacteria have influenced the actual evolution of the adaptive immune system. They provided strong evidence that the gut microflora interacts with the genome to regulate the ratio between T<sub>reg</sub> and T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, a major part of adaptive immunity. This is yet another area that has only been touched but will be of great importance in the future.</p>
<p>The gut bacteria have even been awarded a new and more respectable name, the “human microbiome,” reflecting its increasing importance in mainline science. As even a casual search of the Internet will show, the use of probiotics has even—in the current jargon—gone viral.</p>
<p>In short, we are not going to run out of subjects for research any time soon. On the contrary, we have enough to do to keep all of us busy for the rest of our careers.</p>

<sec id="section5-0148607111416121">
<title>The Demographic Trap</title>
<p>As might be expected, the 21st century was greeted with great optimism. Ten years on, the bloom is most definitely off the rose. And in the healthcare system—one-sixth of our economy, we should remember—we are waking up to the realization that we have built ourselves an unsustainable system. Just what do I mean by that? Well, we are being threatened by something that people have avoided talking about for a number of years. I call it the Demographic Trap. Now, any demographers reading this will immediately recognize the term. It usually refers to a developing country that is stuck in stage 2 of the demographic transition, in which the rapidly expanding population has outstripped the capacity of the land to support it. Think the Gaza Strip, Yemen, or Egypt. We know what happens then. It is not a recipe for stability.</p>
<p>So what is the Demographic Trap in healthcare? Very simply, over the next 20 years, we will have a great increase in patients needing care, a significant decrease in the number of people who will give that care, and fewer resources with which to do it. Our healthcare economy has outgrown its support system. Let us consider this statement in detail.</p>
<p>The mean age of the population is increasing. We are all healthy and living longer. The number of U.S. residents older than 65 is projected to grow from 36 million in 2007 to 72 million in 2030. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0148607111416121">Figure 4</xref> shows the population charts for 1980 to 2030. Notice the increasing numbers in the higher age groups. Notice also that we are maintaining a sizable number of young people. In the 1980 and 2010 graphs, the baby boom can be seen as a distinct bulge. Current projections for 2040 suggest that there will be a much more even distribution. But still, there will be a lot older people.</p>
<fig id="fig4-0148607111416121" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0148607111416121-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Why is that a problem? Simply put, older patients require more healthcare. That means the government has to pay more for Medicare. Medicare is already out of money. And there will have to be more doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and dieticians. With the possible exception of dieticians, we don’t have enough of them. And as we will discuss a bit later, the efforts to reform the healthcare system will put even more stress on the inadequate numbers of medical professionals.</p>
<p>How can I say that? In the 1960s and 1970s, we expanded the number of doctors trained every year. In fact, we doubled it, from around 8000 in 1960 to around 16,000 by 1985. Nursing education went through a great change, with closure of most hospital-based diploma schools and the opening of university-based programs. We should have a very adequate supply of both. But we do not.</p>
<p>Start with physicians. The accompanying graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0148607111416121">Figure 5</xref>) was published by Dr Richard Cooper, who has done the best work in this area over the past 30 years. He has pointed out that the relationship between physicians per 100,000 and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is a straight line. In other words, the richer we get, the more physicians we require. That relationship holds for other countries, as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0148607111416121">Figure 6</xref>). And within the United States, it is also true. The individual states vary in GDP per capita by about 2:1, and most states almost doubled between 1970 and 1996 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0148607111416121">Figure 7</xref>). It may not be a natural law, but it’s a consistent relationship.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0148607111416121">Figure 8</xref> indicates how a present and projected shortage will look. The expansion 30 to 40 years ago was followed by a period of zero growth. Few new places in medical schools appeared, yet demand for physicians continued to increase. Osteopathic schools increased their output, but that was not enough to meet the demand for new physicians. That demand was filled by international graduates. But a number of government-sponsored studies in the 1980s had shown that there was an oversupply of doctors being produced. So convinced were policy makers that this was true that in 1996, Congress capped the number of resident positions. The primary purpose was to limit the number of international medical graduates coming into the United States to the level of 4000 to 5000 per year. That worked. The number has not increased. Today, however, we have no oversupply in any specialty. There are shortages in family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, general surgery, and a number of others. Dr Cooper’s graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0148607111416121">Figure 9</xref>) shows several of the more likely results. This is based on the number of physicians who are actually practicing medicine, although it no doubt includes part-timers, research scientists, administrators, and so on. The bottom line is that there will be too few physicians to meet the demand and that we will face a physician shortage for the next 20 years or more.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111416121">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111416121">8</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Well, we always have nurses—or do we? The present nursing workforce is around 2.8 million. Nursing schools graduate about 70,000 per year. Of these, 43,000 are associate degree (2 year), 25,000 are baccalaureate degree (4 year), and 2000 are diploma nurses (the old 3-year programs). Yes, that’s correct. Basically, we traded in the 3-year diploma programs for 2-year associate degree programs. That’s another issue and beyond our scope today. Although 70,000 graduates is a lot, it is not enough. The actual numbers of nurses is declining somewhat, and the numbers per 100,000 population are declining considerably more rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0148607111416121">Figure 9</xref>). Many nurses work at other things, and many of those who do work are part-time. For that reason, the table and graph break out separately the total number of registered nurses (RNs), the number employed, and the number of full-time equivalents (FTEs). The average age of nurses is also rising, which contributes to the decline expected in the next 10 to 20 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111416121">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111416121">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pharmacy is a simpler issue. There are presently around 250,000 pharmacists, considerably fewer than doctors or nurses. We are almost training enough. The current shortfall is estimated at around 5%. There will be a projected shortage of 10% by 2020, when there will be about 305,000 pharmacists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111416121">11</xref></sup> This is probably manageable, with increased use of pharmacy techs and other measures, but it’s still a shortfall.</p>
<p>Only in the dietitian workforce will there be an adequate supply. The number of practicing registered dietitians is a difficult number to obtain. However, the Committee on Dietetic Registration has registered some 77,000 dietitians, according to the American Dietetic Association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111416121">12</xref></sup> This figure may be misleading, and the true number of practicing individuals is probably closer to 60,000. According to Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA), demand for dietitians is currently matching supply, and sufficient numbers are being trained.</p>
<p>So to summarize, we have about 900,000 physicians. We will be short 100,000 to 200,000 by 2020, a 20% shortfall. We have 2.8 million nurses, and we will be short 500,000 by 2020—also 20%. We have 250,000 pharmacists, and we will be short 25,000 by 2020. Finally, we have 60,000 registered dietitians. No shortages are projected.</p>
<p>The implications are clear. The healthcare sector is facing 2 decades of shortages of professionals. Right now, we have serious shortages of both doctors and nurses. Medical schools will have to expand. There will be more use of nurse practitioners and physician assistants. In nursing care, there will be more use of nursing aides and more production of associate degree nurses. We will employ more pharmacy technicians. But even with these efforts, most hospitals will continue to have staffing problems, which will become worse. Rural hospitals may be unable to recruit physicians and nurses, and some may close their doors.</p>
<p>There will be a lot of sound and fury about healthcare reform from politicians, bureaucrats, and academics. We won’t hear nearly as much about shortages of doctors and nurses. Yet these shortages will influence every decision we make on healthcare reform. How we deal with them will have much to do with the future in which we will care for our patients.</p>

<title>Health Care Costs: Will They Ever Stop Rising?</title>
<p>For the past 20 years (and long before), the cost of healthcare has been rising inexorably. In 2009, the growth rate was only 4%, the lowest in 50 years. Nonetheless, healthcare costs are 17.6% of GDP, a record high. How can we lower the cost? Frankly, we do not have a clue.</p>
<p>The drivers of cost are, basically, utilization, technology, and drugs. There are more episodes of care for each patient. We use more services per episode of care and more people for each service. Technology, which is said to comprise 60% of increased costs, can be divided into hardware, software, and wetware. People have to make the hardware and program the software. Wetware is, of course, the people it takes to run the technology and apply it. In short, most of the costs of technology are due to people, although some of the people may be in a medical device company far from any hospital. Finally, drug costs. For all of the demonization of Big Pharma and its profits, the sobering truth is that it costs $800 million to bring a new agent to market. A company has maybe 10 years until the drug goes off patent and cheap generics appear. The company has to make $80 million per year on that drug, plus whatever it takes to make the drug and to run the rest of the company. So, they spend more on marketing than they do on research, and they try to avoid risk. And they charge a lot for the drugs they make.</p>
<sec id="section7-0148607111416121">
<title>Basically, most of the increase in costs goes to people. To people like us, in fact.</title>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We have met the enemy, and he is us.</p>
<attrib>—Pogo Possum (Walt Kelley)</attrib></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The options for lowering costs are many, but successes are few. For a number of years, the consensus among healthcare economists ran like this<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111416121">13</xref></sup>:</p>

</list>
<p>All of these have been tried in the last few years. Results?</p>
<list id="list2-0148607111416121" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Information technology</italic>: Anyone who has used the electronic medical records (EMRs) currently available has to be skeptical. They take more time to use, require a lot of care and feeding, and introduce new types of errors. They are unlikely to reduce costs by more than a very little. Even the Congressional Budget Office admitted this last year.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Improving quality and efficiency</italic>: Maybe. I still cannot operate on 2 patients at a time, nor has my internist started using exam rooms with 2 tables. There are great limits to efficiency, because much of healthcare is one-on-one. On the other hand, improving quality may help a great deal to reduce costs. Still, improving quality isn’t free, and it imposes costs of its own.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lowering compensation for providers</italic>: If we are not going to have enough doctors and nurses, it isn’t going to be easy to reduce compensation. That’s called the law of supply and demand. Congress would like to repeal it, but that will be very difficult.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Government regulation</italic>: Good luck with this one. Perhaps new regulations will only add costs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Prevention</italic>: Depends. Some prevention activities simply allow diseases to be picked up and treated at an earlier stage. That is certainly good but does nothing to reduce overall costs. Many of the really cost-effective ones, such as vaccination, vitamins, and so on, are already in place. But there is great potential here. Proper care of diabetes, for example, can prevent the many late complications, which fill our hospitals.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To summarize, although all of these things are currently being tried, there is very little evidence that any of them—besides prevention and quality—have much potential to reduce costs. Most of them will actually increase costs.</p>
<p>Are there other ideas out there? A few, although some are out of political favor. These include health savings accounts, national insurance markets, and other measures, which would redirect control of healthcare expenses from insurer or government to the individual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111416121">14</xref></sup> Many of them sound appealing, but they have not been tried on any large scale, or at least enough to determine their effect on costs. In short, we are still trying to work out what to do.</p>

<sec id="section8-0148607111416121">
<title>Healthcare Reform</title>
<p>Finally, we come to the healthcare reform act of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act—PPACA, for short. It is a great illustration of the words of H. L. Mencken, the Sage of Baltimore: “Democracy is the theory of government which says that the people know what they want and deserve to get it, good and hard.”</p>
<p>PPACA was adopted in a very hostile political environment and has managed to make that environment considerably worse. Its major flaw is that it was adopted backwards. There were (and are) some 50 million uninsured people living in America. We should find a way to allow them better access to healthcare than simply showing up in emergency rooms. In the richest society on Earth, that is regarded by many as a moral imperative. But we badly need to have a national debate about how to pay for healthcare for all of our population. Only after that should we have written legislation. Instead, without much debate about costs, Congress enacted a law that covers some of the uninsured, has a shaky payment mechanism, and understates the total costs. Not surprisingly, it remains highly unpopular, even a year after it was passed.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, PPACA has defined the framework for all subsequent discussions of healthcare reform. It contains a very large number of provisions, almost more than you can imagine. Some of them will take effect as late as 2016. For 2010-2012, there are immediate benefits, largely from insurance regulation. All private coverage will cover dependents until age 26 and will not allow preexisting conditions or lifetime caps to limit coverage. There will be stiffer regulation of insurance plans. New federal agencies are being set up. New taxes are included, including a general income tax increase. These were supposed to come on line in 2010, but nobody wanted to raise taxes in a recession. They were delayed for 2 years and will probably be further delayed after that. There are other new taxes, such as those on drug companies, that will probably be implemented. Last, the Internal Revenue Service is being expanded.</p>
<p>It is the delayed actions of PPACA that will increase coverage to the presently uninsured. These will take effect in 2014-2016. They include state insurance exchanges, expansion of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Improvement Program (CHIP), employer mandates to provide insurance, and the individual mandate to buy insurance. Now the preceding discussion only scratches the surface of the reform act. For the diligent among us, a very good outline of PPACA is available online.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111416121">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Will all of this cover the uninsured, combining the insurance exchanges, Medicaid, and employer mandates? When the legislation was before Congress, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that between 17 and 25 million of the 54 million uninsured would be covered. Presently, 83% of people are insured. The PPACA is projected to raise that into the low 90s.</p>
<p>It probably is no surprise that there is virtually nothing that affects nutrition. True, restaurant chains and vending machines must post calorie counts. This is intended to combat obesity. There is nothing about intensive nutrition care. In this, as in much else, the role of regulation will be vital. The regulators, including Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, have considerably more power than before. They will probably be joined by an alphabet soup of new regulatory agencies established by the PPACA. That depends on what Congress does.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0148607111416121">
<title>What Will Congress Do?</title>
<p>Congress is changing, as we all know. The 111th Congress had a strong Democratic majority in both houses. The 112th Congress has a Republican House (239–188) and Democratic Senate (53–41). Because the two parties disagree on the PPACA, among other things, this virtually guarantees stalemate. There will be much jockeying for position in 2012.</p>
<p>Most of have observed that Congress doesn’t work very well. It never has. First, it was not supposed to. We have a republic, not a pure democracy. The Constitution was written to avoid the excesses of a popularly elected government. Senate seats are by state, to put a check on majority rule. In both Houses, the legislative process was specifically designed to avoid haste and promote thoughtful decision making. It certainly achieves the first of these, if not always the second.</p>
<p>Second, Congress has acquired some “features.” In software, we would call them bugs. House districts are drawn up by state legislatures. These are often designed to create “safe” districts, to protect or isolate particular groups—usually to the advantage of whichever party controls the legislature, often to provide representation for an ethnic or racial group. As a result, only 100–150 House seats of 435 are true competitions between the parties. This produces a polarized legislature. A congressperson from a “safe” seat doesn’t need to worry about being turfed out by the opposite party in the next election. For how this is done, note the illustration of the Gerrymander in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0148607111416121">Figure 10a</xref>, and a modern “gerrymandered” congressional district in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0148607111416121">Figure 10b</xref>.</p>

<p>Third, both houses run on the seniority system. Whatever its virtues, this means that committee chairs are often out of touch and sometimes even losing their grip. Senior members often work from outmoded assumptions. And fourth, staff work dominates both houses. Because there is too little time for members to carefully consider legislation, the only people who do are young congressional staff workers. These are bright, committed, and occasionally very foolish. And they are almost always ideological.</p>
<p>These and many other features have made Congress the subject of many adverse remarks. Here are some disrespectful quotes from others over the past 2 centuries:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Suppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of Congress—but I repeat myself.</p>
<attrib>—Mark Twain, 19th century</attrib></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly American criminal class except Congress.</p>
<attrib>—Mark Twain, 19th century</attrib></disp-quote>

<p>
<disp-quote><p>The only difference between death and taxes is that death doesn’t get worse every time Congress meets.</p>

</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The Internet interprets the U.S. Congress as system damage and routes around it.</p>
<attrib>—Jeanne Devoto, 21st century</attrib></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>To summarize, contrary to popular belief, Congress is working exactly as it was designed to do. Based on the above, it has changed very little over the 200 years of the Republic.</p>

<title>What Changes in Healthcare Reform Are Likely?</title>
<p>It was clear from the start—and certainly after the 2010 election— that several elements of the PPACA would not last. Some of the initial cuts in Medicare—notably, the physician reimbursement—were reversed. New taxes were cut back. Going forward, new agencies may remain unfunded. The mandatory insurance rule will be eased. Indeed, since it is currently being challenged in federal court by a majority of states, it may be thrown out entirely. And last, the Medicaid coverage will be changed greatly. The states cannot afford more Medicaid. Existing Medicaid is driving them to the wall. The Feds cannot afford the promised increases in coverage. Block grants to the states are being discussed. That would kick most of the decisions down to the states, which may or may not do a good job with it.</p>
<p>Medicaid was originally set up as a healthcare insurance program for the “working poor.” In fact, 20% of its spending is on the aged and 44% on disabled people. Some 33% of the program expenditures are on long-term care. Putting it another way, 43% of all long-term care is paid for by Medicaid. A large problem with Medicaid is that it is trying to insure several different groups and for different things.</p>
<p>It is most <italic>un</italic>likely that the PPACA will be repealed. It is true that repeal has passed the House. But it will have no chance until 2013 and probably not even then. On the other hand, selected parts of it will be reversed, or remain unfunded, or be overthrown by the courts.</p>
<p>Insurance reform will largely remain. The more rigorous regulation of plans is being selectively enforced. The Department of Health and Human Services has issued over 1000 “waivers” to business and union health plans, exempting them. Needless to say, this is a highly political process. As a result of all this insurance reform, insurance rates are already rising and will continue to rise this year and next. Will anyone care? Probably not.</p>
<p>Costs will exceed estimates. The cost estimates in this legislation were very optimistic. The taxes that were to pay for it have already been cut back. The result will be severe overruns, and that in turn will fuel further debate about how to pay for it. Most people seem to want universal coverage but only as long as they don’t have to pay for it. It will be an interesting few years.</p>
<p>In short, healthcare is going to become more difficult over the next few years. There will be more patients, fewer professionals, and less money. Funding sources will be found, but it is going to be difficult, and there will be great turmoil and uncertainty.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the sick will still need care. People will need to be fed. Science will continue to advance. We have been complaining about the healthcare system for 50 years, yet it still rocks along fairly well. Things are much brighter than they may seem.</p>
