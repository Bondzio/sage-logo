<abstract>
<p>Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from gestational tissues represent promising cell populations with stem cell-like properties for use in regenerative medicine. Previously, we reported that MSCs in the chorionic villi of the human placenta reside in a vascular niche. However, the niche(s) in which MSCs reside in the fetal membranes, another rich source of MSCs, remains to be determined. The cell surface markers STRO-1 and 3G5 were previously employed to identify niches in a variety of tissues and here we use these markers to report the location of the MSC niche in the human decidua parietalis. The cultured decidua parietalis MSCs (DPMSCs) isolated from the choriodecidua component of the fetal membranes possessed stem cell-like properties such as adherence to plastic, colony forming ability, and multipotent differentiation potential. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed cultured DPMSCs were of maternal origin. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cultured DPMSCs stained positively with stem cell surface markers 3G5, CD105, CD106, STRO-1, CD146, CD49a, and α-SMA but were negative for hematopoietic markers (CD117, CD34) and vascular markers (CD34, von Willebrand factor [vWF]). Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to stem cell surface markers and the endothelial markers on term fetal membranes revealed a vascular niche for DPMSCs, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis. Both STRO-1 and vWF fluorescence signals showed substantial overlap, while CD146 and vWF signals showed partial overlap. These observations were consistent with a vascular niche.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gestational tissue and amniotic fluid are rich sources of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).<sup>

</sup> Currently, there is intense research on the potential utility of cultured MSCs for regenerative and reparative medicine and clinical trials are underway. Despite this, we know relatively little about the biology of MSCs.</p>
<p>The human fetal membranes envelop the fetus and its surrounding amniotic fluid, forming a highly specialized interface between mother and fetus that carries out important functions during pregnancy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450334">9</xref>
</sup> The fetal membranes have 2 components; the amnion and the chorion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112450334">10</xref>
</sup> The amnion, which is avascular and fetal in origin, comprises a single layer of epithelial cells with an underlying mesenchymal stromal layer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112450334">11</xref>
</sup> These 2 cell layers are the sources of human amniotic multipotent epithelial cells (hAECs) and amniotic MSCs (AMSCs), respectively, both of which have stem cell-like properties.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112450334">4</xref>

</p>
<p>The chorion of term fetal membranes consists of the chorionic mesenchymal stromal layer covering the chorionic trophoblast cell layer, which are both of fetal origin. As the fetus grows, the fetal membranes enlarge such that the chorion pushes into, and subsequently adheres to, the overlying decidua parietalis, which is of maternal origin. The chorion with attached decidua parietalis is called the choriodecidua. Following delivery, the amnion and choriodecidua can be easily separated mechanically. The choriodecidua is, like the amnion, a rich source of stem cells. The chorionic mesenchymal stromal layer is the source of chorionic MSCs (CMSCs).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112450334">16</xref>
</sup>
<sup>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112450334">18</xref>
</sup> The chorionic trophoblast (CT) layer of first trimester fetal membranes is a source of multipotent trophoblast stem cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112450334">19</xref>
</sup> The adherent decidua parietalis of the choriodecidua is also a source of MSCs.<sup>

</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112450334">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Unlike decidua basalis MSCs, which have been intensively studied because of their intimate relationship with the attached placenta,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112450334">21</xref>
</sup> little is known about decidua parietalis MSCs (DPMSCs). Collectively, these data suggest that the fetal membranes from term placentae are rich sources of MSCs (AMSCs, CMSCs, and DPMSCs) and the presence of multiple MSC populations of different origins necessitates that the purity and origin of MSCs be determined. Others have noted that MSC populations from the choriodecidua can contain mixtures of MSCs of both fetal and maternal origin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112450334">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Immunophenotyping studies of AMSCs, CMSCs, and DPMSCs employing flow cytometry reveal an expression profile characteristic of mesenchymal stem cells including expression of the stem cell markers CD73, CD90, and CD105, while being negative for CD14, CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR.<sup>

</sup> Although as stated above, there are similarities in the immunophenotype of AMSCs, CMSCs, and DPMSCs, there are also differences between them with respect to expression of specific stem cell markers, differences in gene expression profiles, growth rates, and differentiation potential.<sup>

<p>The stem cell niche is a highly balanced environment, which comprises the milieu of factors to which naive stem cells are exposed to, and non-stem cell populations that they contact.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112450334">23</xref>
</sup> Each stem cell niche is, therefore, expected to have unique properties that reflect the tissue or organ of origin, or in this case, that reflect the different microenvironments of the various cell layers of the fetal membranes.</p>
<p>With respect to human fetal membranes, immunofluorescence studies have been carried out to identify stem cell marker-positive cells and thereby identify the likely niche(s). For hAECs, Oct-4, Sox-2, and Nanog-positive cells were scattered in the epithelial layer of the amnion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112450334">24</xref>
</sup> (U Manuelpillai, personal communication). The niche for hAMSCs has not been reported but scattered stem cell marker-positive cells have been identified in the amniotic mesenchyme (U. Manuelpillai, personal communication). The niche for CMSCs, and DPMSCs in the choriodecidua has not yet been reported. Here, we focus on identifying the DPMSC niche in the decidua parietalis component of the choriodecidua. Our strategy was to exploit multiple cell surface markers that have been used to identify mesenchymal stem cell niches in a variety of human tissues.</p>
<p>STRO-1, 3G5, and CD146 cell surface markers have been used to characterize cells with MSC properties derived from bone marrow, periodontal ligament, dental pulp, and human adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112450334">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112450334"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112450334"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112450334">28</xref>
</sup> Importantly, these cell surface markers can enrich the subpopulations of MSCs that have a high capacity to form fibroblastoid colonies in vitro (called the colony-forming unit-fibroblast [CFU-F] population), which is an important property of stem cells.<sup>

</sup> In a recent study, we used STRO-1 and 3G5, CD146, and CD49a to characterize cultured placental MSCs (PMSCs) and used STRO-1 and 3G5 to identity the PMSC niche in the chorionic villi of the human term placenta.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112450334">36</xref>
</sup> In the present study, we prepared DPMSCs from the decidua parietalis, confirmed their colony forming unit potential, their capacity for multilineage differentiation, and determined their fetal/maternal origin. Using immunocytochemistry, we determined that cultured DPMSCs were positive for a range of cell surface markers used to identify the MSC niche and compared DPMSC staining to that of PMSCs from the human term placenta. Finally, we used stem cell surface markers with immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence detection to identify a vascular niche for DPMSCs in the decidua parietalis in the choriodecidua. </p>

<title>Patient Samples and Tissue Collection</title>
<p>Fetal membranes (defined as amnion and choriodecidua) from uncomplicated term pregnancies were obtained with informed patient consent and with approval from the Research and Ethics Committees of the Royal Women’s Hospital, Melbourne. Patient characteristics for the samples used in this study were as follows: gestation age of 38.7 ± 1.2 (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) weeks, maternal age 32.8 ± 5.9 years, newborn birth weight 3425.9 ± 397.0 g, and placental weight 646.8 ± 80.1 g. The samples were from caesarean sections without labor. Exclusion criteria were maternal tobacco or other substance abuse, obvious signs of fetal infection, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, or preterm rupture of the membranes. All samples were collected from uncomplicated singleton pregnancies.</p>
<p>Rolled fetal membranes were either snap frozen Cryomatrix (TissueTek, Crown Scientific) or 10% formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin wax before use for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence techniques. </p>

<title>Preparation of Fetal Membrane Samples for Stem Cell Isolation</title>
<p>Fetal membranes were collected within 20 minutes of delivery. The amnion was manually separated from the choriodecidua. Samples (∼10 g) were rinsed in saline, extensively minced using dissecting scissors and a scalpel blade, and placed in prewarmed Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS, Life Technologies, Mulgrave, Australia) at 37°C for immediate stem cell isolation.</p>
<p>The MSCs were isolated as described previously <sup>

</sup> with the following modifications. Tissue suspensions were centrifuged at 1000<italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes at room temperature and the supernatant was discarded. Red blood cells were hemolysed and the remaining cells were centrifuged as mentioned above. The pellet was incubated in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 10 minutes at 37°C, then washed twice in 50% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/α-minimum essential medium (MEM) for 10 minutes, and centrifuged at 1000<italic>g</italic> at room temperature after each wash. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20% fetal calf serum (FCS)/α-MEM medium (complete medium), seeded into 75 cm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks and maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (passage P0). At the next passage (P1), the growth medium was 10% FCS/α-MEM and it was changed every 48 hours.</p>
<p>Trypan Blue exclusion assays were used to determine viable cell counts (Invitrogen, Australia) as previously described.<sup>

<p>The DPMSCs were successfully cultured from term fetal membranes following collagenase IV and dispase enzymatic disaggregation of the tissue.<sup>

</sup> We have previously used a similar approach to isolate PMSCs from human placental tissue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112450334">36</xref>
</sup> The DPMSCs were isolated with a &gt;90% success rate, with DPMSCs able to form colonies when seeded at low densities. As demonstrated for other MSC populations derived from fetal membranes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112450334">18</xref>
</sup> and from placental chorionic villi,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112450334">36</xref>
</sup> we found that culture of DPMSC in 20% FBS/α-MEM resulted in the highest clonogenic efficiency, and the clonogenic efficiency was higher than that of PMSCs.</p>

<title>Cell Surface Marker Expression of DPMSCs</title>
<p>Isolated DPMSCs were characterized using a variety of different cell surface markers. Consistent with other studies, DPMSCs stained positively with stem cell markers CD105, STRO-1, and α-SMA<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112450334">4</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112450334">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112450334">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112450334">29</xref>
</sup> and negatively for endothelial/hematopoietic stem cell marker CD34.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112450334">17</xref>
</sup> The marker expression profile for DPMSCs was similar to that of PMSCs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112450334">36</xref>
</sup> Cells were negative for the trophoblastic marker FD066Q, endothelial marker vWF, and hematopoietic stem cell marker CD117. The DPMSCs expressed the pericyte-associated antigens 3G5, STRO-1, α-SMA, and CD146 and expression of pericyte-associated antigens by cultured DPMSCs was consistent with the notion that DPMSCs may be derived from pericyte cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1933719112450334">47</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1933719112450334">48</xref>
</sup> Most important was that DPMSCs were immunoreactive for the CFU-F enriching markers 3G5, STRO-1, CD146, and CD49a. Thus cultured DPMSCs express cell surface markers characteristically associated with mesenchymal stem cells, pericytes, and cell surface markers used to enrich the CFU-F population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1933719112450334">
<title>Flow Cytometry, Differentiation, and Fetal/Maternal Origin of DPMSCs</title>
<p>Flow cytometry analysis showed that DPMSCs were enriched for cells positive for CD105 and CD73 negative for CD45. These cell surface markers are used to identify MSCs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1933719112450334">49</xref>
</sup> Like other MSC populations, DPMSCs exhibited multilineage differentiation potential and were successfully differentiated into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes with specific stimulatory media supplements.</p>
<p>The MSCs of mixed fetal/maternal origin have been reported from second trimester decidua and third trimester decidua basalis<italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112450334">4</xref>
</sup>
</italic> As described above, fetal membranes are reported to contain MSCs of both fetal (AMSCs and CMSCs)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112450334">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112450334">16</xref>
</sup> and maternal origin (DPMSCs).<sup>

</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112450334">20</xref>
</sup> As such, establishing the fetal/maternal origin of the DPMSCs was highly important. Our studies suggest that DPMSCs from fetal membranes of male newborns contained 2 X chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719112450334">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that they were of maternal origin and derived from the decidua parietalis component of the fetal membranes.</p>

<title>The DPMSC Niche</title>
<p>Immunocytochemical analysis revealed DPMSCs express cell surface markers characteristically associated with MSCs and pericytes, as well as cell surface markers used to enrich CFU-F populations. Cell surface markers 3G5, STRO-1, and CD146 have been used successfully to identify the MSC niche in a variety of human tissues including dental pulp and adipose tissue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112450334">25</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112450334">28</xref>
</sup> Immunohistochemistry on term fetal membranes showed staining for STRO-1, 3G5, and CD146 around the vessels of the decidua parietalis, which ranged from 50 to 150 μm in diameter. </p>
<p>In the chorionic trophoblast, CD146 showed immunoreactivity but other antibodies were negative. Scattered cells in the chorionic mesoderm were immunoreactive for CD49a. The cell surface markers used in this study were not sufficient to identify the MSC niche in the avascular amniotic or chorionic mesoderm. </p>
<p>More detailed analysis of the staining pattern around the vessels necessitated the use of immunofluorescence on frozen sections. The 3G5 gave the most discrete staining in scattered perivascular cells as well as cells within the tunica media. The CD146 showed perivascular expression as well as expression in the tunica media, but there was some overlap in expression with vWF-positive endothelial cells. The STRO-1 expression overlapped substantially with vWF expression and only a few individual perivascular cells were detected.</p>
<p>The overlapping staining of STRO-1 with vWF-positive cells in the endothelium was unexpected and differed from the immunofluorescence results obtained for STRO-1 and vWF in placental villi, where vWF staining did not overlap with STRO-1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112450334">36</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Consistent with our observation, immunofluorescence studies with STRO-1 and endothelial-specific antibodies in other tissues, including human adipose tissue, revealed that STRO-1 expression was highly specific for endothelial cells in adipose tissue arterioles and capillaries, but not in arteries<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1933719112450334">50</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1933719112450334">51</xref>
</sup> and only in some veins.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1933719112450334">51</xref>
</sup> In our study, vessels of 50 to 150 μm in diameter were predominant in the decidua parietalis and exhibited STRO-1 and vWF colocalization. Additional evidence of significant overlapping STRO-1 and vWF factor-staining cells in the endothelium of central and pulmonary veins of the liver and lung, respectively, has been recently provided.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1933719112450334">52</xref>
</sup> In this same study, Western blot analysis on a variety of cell types provided evidence that STRO-1 was a 75-kD endothelial antigen.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1933719112450334">52</xref>
</sup> The CD146 is predominantly a marker for endothelium, but like STRO-1, CD146 is also an MSC and pericyte cell surface marker that can be used to enrich the CFU-F.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1933719112450334">53</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1933719112450334">54</xref>
</sup> Moreover, our results suggest that there is an overlap between CD146 and vWF staining in decidua parietalis vessels. Thus, in the decidua parietalis, we can identify a vascular niche for cells that express the stem cell markers STRO-1 and CD146.</p>
<p>The origin of MSCs remains controversial and while the prevailing notion is for a perivascular origin, principally pericytes, for MSCs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1933719112450334">55</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1933719112450334"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1933719112450334">57</xref>
</sup> others have proposed an endothelial origin for MSCs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1933719112450334">58</xref>
</sup> Our data supports a “vascular stem cell niche” in the decidua parietalis similar to that described for the adipose tissue-derived stem cell niche.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1933719112450334">50</xref>
</sup> Lin et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1933719112450334">50</xref>
</sup> proposed that vascular stem cells in tissues are at various stages of differentiation toward becoming smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Those cells at early stages of differentiation have the potential to differentiate into tissue-specific cell types in their native tissues. When these cells are cultured in vitro as MSCs, they can be induced to form additional cell types (eg, chondrocytes and osteocytes). Thus, DPMSCs could be derived from vascular stem cells at early stages of differentiation. Clearly, the origin of DPMSCs is of importance and warrants further studies. </p>
