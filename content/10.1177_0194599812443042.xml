<p>The advent of the endoscopic endonasal expanded approach (EEA) has allowed surgeons to access skull base, parasellar, and intracranial pathology, from the crista galli to the odontoid process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812443042">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812443042">2</xref></sup> The widespread adoption of EEA was initially hindered by the inability to reestablish a robust barrier between the subarachnoid space and the sinonasal tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812443042">3</xref></sup> The development of the pedicled nasoseptal flap (also known as the Hadad-Bassagasteguy flap), a neurovascular pedicled flap of the nasal septum mucoperiosteum and mucoperichondrium based on the nasoseptal artery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812443042">4</xref></sup> has reduced postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks to levels similar to open approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812443042">5</xref></sup> In many cases, the surgeon does not know a priori if a nasoseptal flap will be needed for reconstruction, and to preserve the vascular pedicle, the flap must be raised prior to the sphenoidotomy.</p>
<p>To decrease patient morbidity from unnecessary nasoseptal flap harvest, the nasoseptal “rescue” flap technique was devised to allow for partial harvest of the most superior and posterior aspect of the flap at the onset of the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812443042"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812443042">6</xref></sup> If a CSF leak is encountered or the resultant defect is larger than expected, the rescue flap can be fully harvested and used for reconstruction.

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Approval for this study was obtained from the University of North Carolina (UNC) Biomedical Institutional Review Board. Ninety-one patients undergoing EEA for sellar lesions that were operated on by the senior author between July 2008 and July 2011 were retrospectively identified (extra-sellar lesions were excluded because the rescue flap is not applicable to these patients).</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599812443042">
<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>The nasoseptal rescue flap technique was primarily developed for a pituitary adenoma in which we do not anticipate an intraoperative CSF leak or a protruding diaphragma that may desiccate and have a delayed CSF leak. In our practice, this included Rathke cleft cysts and pituitary adenomas less than 2 cm in size. The nasoseptal rescue flap has since become our standard practice for these types of tumors. Occasionally, we will use the rescue flap technique for pituitary adenomas that are larger than 2 cm; however, in these cases, we are careful to observe that the pituitary gland has been displaced superiorly to protect the thin diaphragm. For these larger tumors, we will also have a lower threshold of using a rescue flap if the ascended diaphragma protrudes into the sphenoid sinus. We do not routinely use the rescue flap technique for perisellar tumors that are not pituitary or Rathke cleft in origin, such as craniopharyngiomas or meningiomas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812443042">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The following is a description of the surgical technique used for the nasoseptal rescue flap. We have also included supplemental multimedia detailing the steps necessary for its successful use (video, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://otojournal.org">otojournal.org</ext-link>).</p>
<p>After the patient is anesthetized and positioned, image guidance is registered to the patient, and the nasal cavity is prepared with a nasal decongestant topically. The inferior turbinates are outfractured under direct visualization with the 0-degree Hopkins Rod. The right middle turbinate is removed using sinus scissors and Tru-Cuting instrumentation. The posterior middle turbinate pedicle is cauterized, being careful not to cauterize the nasoseptal flap pedicle. Next, the sphenoid ostium on the right is palpated in the standard location between the superior turbinate and the nasal septum. This is usually palpated with a caudal or stapes curette. Once it is identified, we then begin to plan our rescue flap pedicle incisions.</p>
<p>Using an extended guarded needle-tip Bovie set on 15-20, an incision is made from the level of the sphenoid ostium superiorly approximately 1.5 cm from the skull base to preserve olfactory filaments. This incision is extended from the sphenoid os along the superior bony septum for approximately 2 cm. Next, the Cottle elevator is used to retract the flat pedicle inferiorly. It is freed from the sphenoid mucosa at the level of the sphenoid sinus ostium; this exposes the entire sphenoid rostrum and the bony boundary of the inferior choana. This preserves the entire mucosal pedicle of the nasoseptal flap in case it is needed later in the procedure, if an intraoperative CSF leak is encountered.</p>
<p>A Cottle elevator is used to fracture through the posterior bony septum. A posterior bony septectomy is performed superiorly to the level of the sphenoid floor. The sphenoid ostia on the left and right sides are identified and enlarged and made into 1 sphenoid opening. The anterior sinuses’ septum is taken down. At this time, the sellar face, clival recesses, and opticocarotid recesses are usually able to be identified. A high-speed drill is used to drill all this bone into plane. The sphenoid planum is identified as the superior limit of our visualization, the right and left optic nerves are identified as the lateral limits of our visualization, and the sphenoid floor is identified as the inferior limit of our visualization.</p>
<p>Next, the sellar pituitary tumor surgery is performed in the standard fashion. At the end of the procedure, if an intraoperative CSF leak is noted, its quality is noted, whether it is a high-flow or low-flow CSF leak. If there is no leak encountered and no significant herniation of the diaphragm, then a small amount of Flowseal (Baxter International Inc, Deerfield, Illinois) is placed over the sphenoid face and the nasoseptal flap pedicle is relayed over the septal posterior septectomy defect, making sure that the sphenoid os can drain in its natural position. Dual splints are then placed over this and left in place for approximately 1 week.</p>
<p>If there is an intraoperative CSF leak, then the nasoseptal flat is harvested, and the superior incision is continued anteriorly to the level of the nasal septal organ at the area of the internal nasal valve. This is then carried inferiorly down to the level of the nasal floor. The inferior incision is then started at the level of the choana and made across the choana, down the posterior aspect of the bony septum onto the nasal floor and connected with our inferior anterior incision. The nasoseptal flap is then raised in a submucoperichondrial plane; the pedicle is released from the overlying choana and left attached at the level of the sphenopalatine foramen. At this time, it is usually then placed in the nasopharynx; a high-speed drill is used to remove some of the pterygoid wedge bone, as well as the bone overlying the inferior sphenoid floor. This allows for a better arc of rotation of the nasoseptal flap along the defect.</p>
<p>At this time, if a nasoseptal flap is to be used, all mucosa of the sphenoid sinus is stripped since it will be relined with the nasoseptal flap mucosa. This is saved to the end of the procedure to minimize sphenoid scarring, as well as atrophic sphenoid mucosa in the setting of not needing the flap. Next, the flap is rotated over the defect; the bony ledges are noted to be appropriately covered in 360 degrees around the skull base defect.</p>
<p>The flap is then bolstered into place using Surgiseal (Adhezion Biomedical, LLC, Wyomissing, Pennsylvania), DuraSeal (Confluent Surgical, Inc, Waltham, Massachusetts), Nasopore (Polyganics, Groningen, the Netherlands), and usually a Foley balloon catheter or Merocel (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) finger cot. The pack is left in place for approximately 3 days for a low-flow leak and 5 to 7 days for a high-flow leak. A high-flow leak with a large arachnoid opening would also likely need a lumbar drain for optimal seal. Lumbar drainage would be performed for 3 days in these patients. Dual splints would then be placed over the nasoseptal flap donor site and sutured into place. These are left in place for 2 to 3 weeks; once these are removed, the exposed cartilage is gently debrided over the next 4 to 6 weeks until complete mucosalization is accomplished. The patient will irrigate diligently 2 to 4 times per day with saline nasal irrigations. Patients are also instructed to have strict no nose blowing for approximately 6 weeks, as well as no strenuous activity during this immediate postoperative healing phase.</p>

<title>Leak Definition</title>
<p>A low-flow leak was defined as one that was suspected after dural opening but did not involve opening into the ventricle or arachnoid cistern. Examples of such low-flow leak cases would include CSF leaks found after adenoma removal from a thinned diaphragma sellae or after transcribriform encephalocele repair from the olfactory groove defect. A high-flow leak was defined as one that did involve expansion into the ventricle or arachnoid cistern. For example, an encephalocele defect through the planum sphenoidale and into the suprasellar cistern would be considered a high-flow leak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812443042">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In our retrospective review, of the 26 consecutive patients who had a nasoseptal rescue flap raised, only 7 patients (27%) required the use of the rescue flap for repair of intraoperative CSF leak. In this cohort, there were 5 males and 21 females, and the average age at resection was 43 years (range, 15-71 years). Mean follow-up time was 6 months (range, 1-16 months). Of these 26 patients, 19 were undergoing surgery for pituitary adenoma (73%) and 7 for Rathke cleft cyst (27%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812443042"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>Of the 7 patients with CSF leak, 6 patients had low-flow CSF leak, whereas 1 patient had high-flow CSF leak. Six of the 7 had pituitary adenoma, whereas 1 of the 7 had Rathke cleft cysts. No patients required postoperative lumbar drain.</p>
<p>One patient with an initially unused rescue flap developed pneumocephalus after sneezing 1 year after her initial surgery. Her unharvested rescue flap was used at that time. To date, no patients have presented with recurrent CSF leak or septal perforation. The success rate in those 7 patients with rescue flap utilization was thus 100%.</p>

<sec id="section12-0194599812443042" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The nasoseptal rescue flap allows for decreased utilization of unnecessary nasoseptal flap harvest for patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary surgery. Of 26 consecutive patients undergoing pituitary surgery, only 7 patients required full rescue flap harvest, saving unnecessary tissue harvest for 19 patients (73%). The success rate of surgery was 100%, with no postoperative CSF leak or septal perforation with up to a 16-month follow-up time.</p>
<p>Previous indications for nasoseptal flap included patients with high risk for a planned or unplanned CSF leak, those with a previously irradiated surgical field, those requiring postoperative radiation, or those who required palliative surgical debulking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812443042">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812443042">8</xref></sup> The nasoseptal rescue flap reduces this list into just 2 indications for sellar tumors: observed CSF leak or dural defect large enough to require additional tissue harvest.</p>
<p>Limitations of the rescue flap include smaller visual field for the surgeon, smaller septectomy, and more potential for scope obscuration due to posterior tissue. These limits did not interfere with any of the sellar tumors approached in this cohort; however, for more advanced lesions (craniopharyngioma, meningioma, etc) or more advanced approaches (transcribriform or transclivial), this technique is not used or advised. In these cases, we harvest a full flap in the standard fashion even with the possibility of a tumor resection without an intraoperative CSF leak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812443042">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the nasoseptal rescue flap being a valuable tool to repair intraoperative CSF leaks, our experience demonstrates that nasoseptal rescue flaps may be used for delayed postoperative complications, as evidenced by our patient who developed pneumocephalus after sneezing 1 year after surgery. During the patient’s revision surgery, we were able to use the previously unharvested nasoseptal rescue flap. This would not have been possible if the patient’s original surgery had used traditional sphenoidotomy/pituitary approach techniques that usually sacrifice the mucosa where the pedicle is located. The nasoseptal rescue flap thus allows the opportunity to use a vascular pedicle for future revision surgery if disease recurs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0194599812443042" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The nasoseptal rescue flap is an effective surgical technique for patients undergoing pituitary surgery without a planned nasoseptal flap. It allows for vascularized skull base reconstruction if an intraoperative CSF leak is encountered and minimizes donor site morbidity if a leak is not encountered.</p>
