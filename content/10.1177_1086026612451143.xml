<p>Something really got under James Lawrence Powell’s skin—and the result is this unique book to try to answer the question “why, when the scientific evidence for global warming is unequivocal, does only half the public accept that evidence?” (preface).</p>
<p>This feels right—but not simply for the U.S. public. It is true for highly intelligent, curious European and global audiences in business and in business schools (for example). Challenging climate science is a trait of hungry, critical, thinking people too—not just professional climate scientist deniers (which Powell distinguishes from contrarians and devil’s advocates). Sensitive appreciation of this “mode” of engagement with science is key to advancing public understanding and this book is an excellent contribution.</p>
<p>Powell is convincing in his demonstration that the answer to his opening question is down to an “army” of people who, in recent years, have collectively waged a successful war on climate science. The scientific credentials of the author are impeccable and impressive: Powell served under both Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush on the National Science Board for a period of 12 years. Here, he is speaking out where presumably some of his peers in recent years may have wanted to, but had second thoughts about the consequences (see denier tactics below). Most important, Powell writes from a position of <italic>not</italic> “being a climate researcher.” This is what gives this book its fresh and engaging edge. We learn alongside him as he uses his scientific instincts and training to structure his thoughts around his central question.</p>
<p>The use of “Inquisition” in the title is provocative. Powell explains,
<disp-quote><p>Science is far better than Scientists. It is the best system we have for getting beyond human frailty and folly to the truth. Those who trample science are always in time the ones to suffer. Who stands guilty in the courtroom of history: Galileo, or his inquisitors? (p. 14)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The book is a biography of climate change science and climate skepticism in its U.S. form as it evolved from the 1960s. Though there are one or two non-U.S. characters in the story, the book is mostly U.S. oriented. There are several other notable international climate change deniers absent from the book, and if this claimed to be a global treatment of climate denial (which it does not), it would be extremely unfair not to mention them.</p>
<p>So who is this “army of deniers with a cast of generals and its GIs” (p. 71)? Well it is a diverse cast of characters comprising many age groups and backgrounds including among others (in order of appearance): Richard Lindzen, Terry Dunleavy, Ross McKitrick, Benny Peiser, Viscount Monckton of Brenchely, Klaus-Martin Schulte, S. Fred Singer, Frederick Seitz, John Tierny, Michael Crichton, Patrick Michaels, Harrison Schmitt, Freeman Dyson, George Will, and Bjorn Lomborg.</p>
<p>In several cases the book details how these individuals acted in collaboration with or under the auspices of a range of denier organizations including among others: the International Climate Science Coalition (ICSC), the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition, the Heartland Institute, the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, the Cato Institute, the Jasons, the George C. Marshall Institute, the Friends of Science, the Global Climate Coalition, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p>Powell’s succinct list of “how the deniers operate” is thoughtful and well worth repeating:</p>
<p>They [Climate deniers]:</p>
<list id="list1-1086026612451143" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Engage in publicity stunts designed to gain media attention and that promulgate disinformation [for example issuing “declarations” after conferences]</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Repeat claims long after scientists have shown them to be false</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Make serious assertions without presenting any evidence to back them up</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Have no scientific findings that falsify global warming</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Have opposed global warming for twenty years . . . [unlike scientists]. . . . Deniers do not change their minds, a sure sign that they base their denial not on science but on ideology. (pp. 12, 13)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As is his summary of the traits of deniers:</p>
<p>Deniers:</p>
<list id="list2-1086026612451143" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Dispute a scientific consensus that is at least twenty years old</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cite an online petition as proof of the absence of consensus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Manufacture doubt by cherry-picking and other methods</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the exception of one accomplished scientist, almost never do research or publish in peer-reviewed journals</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Derogate peer-review as designed to quash new ideas</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Portray themselves as beleaguered, gutsy truth-tellers denied the research grants they need to show that mainstream scientists are wrong</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conduct dissident conferences with all the trappings of legitimate scientific meetings</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Accuse scientists and the government of a global conspiracy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Receive support from the media and heads of state</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Call scientists Nazis and murderers. (pp. 178-179)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Powell concludes that the trait that most deniers have in common is that they are “economic and political libertarians opposed to government regulation of every kind” (p. 178). The author is to be congratulated on having the patience to sit down and pin down these tactics and traits on behalf of climate science.</p>
<p>One does very much get the sense he had to sit down and do this for himself—get it out of his system. As a result, where the book could have been strengthened would have been in deciding at the outset on a specific task, target audience, and voice. It tries to interweave too many tasks, and the result is a range of voices: science communicator, historian and philosopher of science and politics, science-policy wonk (among others).</p>
<p>Some of the science communication is extremely good. Here is a good example:
<disp-quote><p>The Mauna Loa station found that carbon dioxide concentrations rose from about 315 parts per million by volume when the measurements began in 1958 to 393 ppm by June 2010. (The latter figure, for example, means that of a million gallons of air, 393 gallons are carbon dioxide.) (p. 50)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Chapter 12, “Science Under Attack,” is an excellent summary of the hockey stick saga and the scenario for global warming to be a hoax (p. 155) that he paints is compelling reading.</p>
<p>The emergence of global warming as a scientific theory is fascinating—and not at all devoid of politics, particularly in recent years. There is a lot more potential in the topic of connecting his version of “Adventures in Denierland” with a topical treatment of theory and philosophy of science—as dozens of PhD students are no doubt now mining.</p>
<p>Skepticism is a scientific skill, but denial is ultimately not. However, there is a spectrum between these two and there is no doubt that we all learn a great deal from skeptical—even denier type—positions. Right from the start Powell writes, “Anyone following the controversy over global warming is bound to come away with the impression of two parallel but separate universes: the scientists and the deniers” (p. 7). A more helpful perspective that transcends this distinction is that we are all indeed in the same universe—and these are not distinct groups. We might find ourselves in different places on the spectrum—depending on the <italic>precise</italic> scientific question one is being asked. In my classes, I regularly start by asking the group a few basic questions such as “do you think the climate change we are observing is normal?” and “what do you believe is the main cause of observed climate change?” Instantly, the class divides in their responses, then some of the better students attack the vagueness of my questions and, hey presto, we discover we do not all agree on basic questions about climate change. This is because most often we are talking across each other when we <italic>think</italic> we have pinned each other down. Skepticism and denial is sometimes just confusion.</p>
<p>There is a habit of the skeptics that could be deemed a tactic (though I am not sure it is as purposeful and conscious as that) missing from the list above, but nicely described later in the book:
<disp-quote><p>Repeatedly, deniers latch on to some new finding that, they say, finally falsifies global warming and exposes the conspiracy. Then the new fatal flaw turns out to be nothing of the sort; things quiet down until deniers discover the next fatal flaw, then the process repeats, and the media and we fall for it again. (p. 128)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a tactic, but it is also sometimes a genuine sign of learning. It is a sort of “community of practice” going about its business. Deniers do learn. They may not publicly change their overall stance of denial for whatever reason (and continue to cause lots of damage in terms of public understanding), but they do adapt and learn and with more care we could track it and make more of it. One minute the herd is off reading up on sunspots, the next it is sea-bed volcanoes, and the next cloud physics, and on it goes. Sometimes that learning is helpful to us all. It can also be extremely harmful. Powell ends by cautioning us that by the time there is sufficient scientific certainty to satisfy some deniers it could be too late and that ultimately it is our own trust in science translated into headroom for our political leaders that is the key to avoiding the dangers of global warming.</p>
