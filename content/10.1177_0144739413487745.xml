<p>This article describes and discusses the benefits of a unique approach of one National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA)–accredited U.S. Master of Public Administration (MPA) program that employs integrative seminar style courses at both the start and end of the program of study. Seminar style courses are based on the notion of coproduction of knowledge. In this approach, ‘the student, lecturers and others who support the learning process are viewed as being engaged in a cooperative enterprise focused on the production, dissemination and application of knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0144739413487745">McCulloch, 2009</xref>: 171).</p>
<p>Integrative seminars are most often used as an application-oriented capstone in place of a thesis or comprehensive exam requirement. Distinctively, the MPA program at West Virginia University (WVU) has designed its curriculum to begin with an integrative theory seminar; continue through a set of competency-building core courses, electives, and internship experiences; and conclude with an integrative practice seminar. By design, the first integrative seminar provides the theoretical foundation to the second application-oriented integrative seminar – a pair of bookends helping students move from theory to practice.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0144739413487745">Figure 1</xref>, the purpose of the integrative theory seminar is to expose students to the full landscape of thought about the ‘big questions of the field that address ‘problems with immediate and great significance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0144739413487745">Lieberson, 1992</xref>: 12) and have implications for both managing organizations and the role of administration in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0144739413487745">Behn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0144739413487745">Brooks, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0144739413487745">Neumann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0144739413487745">Kirlin, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0144739413487745">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0144739413487745">Agranoff and McGuire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0144739413487745">Callahan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0144739413487745">Cooper, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0144739413487745">Rohr, 2004</xref>). The aim of the integrative theory seminar is to give students an opportunity to explicitly reflect on the field of public service as a whole through various theoretical lenses, combining a host of theoretical sources from which administrative theory is derived. These multiple strands of theory are later disaggregated and explored as separate threads that weave themselves through the MPA competency-building courses and internship experience. In these courses, distinct theories are employed to analyze practice while building core competencies. Finally, after both hypothetical and actual application of theory to practice, the knowledge and skills gained in distinct course and internship experiences are rewoven in the integrative practice seminar, which culminates in a service learning project and professional portfolio. The aim of the integrative practice seminar is to provide students an opportunity to reflect back on theory through direct practice of public administration.</p>

<title>Why theory in a professional degree program?</title>
<p>Public administration as an area of study has grappled with its role in theory building and the production of knowledge as a discipline of academic study, juxtaposed with its role as a field of professional practice. This has been described in the past as an “intellectual crisis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0144739413487745">Ostrom, 1989</xref>) that has led to numerous critiques of the field’s scholarly preference for the descriptive case study as opposed to more theoretically driven analysis, meta-analysis, or advanced quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0144739413487745">Cleary, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0144739413487745">Wright et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0144739413487745">McCurdy and Cleary, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0144739413487745">Cleary, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0144739413487745">Stallings and Ferris, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0144739413487745">Stallings, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0144739413487745">White, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0144739413487745">Perry and Kraemer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0144739413487745">Houston and Delevan, 1990</xref>). In short, public administration often wonders if it is an academic discipline in the received sense of the term. Perhaps due to this almost existential angst, there has been an increasing trend toward celebrating the practitioner backgrounds of many “pracademics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0144739413487745">Posner, 2009</xref>) and calls from both academic and professional sides of the discipline to build better bridges between theory and practice.</p>
<p>Evidence of the desire to more productively bridge the work of academics and practitioners is reflected in the adoption of a series of special sections of <italic>Public Administration Review</italic> over the past decade, including: (1) The Reflective Practitioner; (2) Academic–Practitioner Exchange; (3) Theory to Practice; (4) Administrative Profile; and (5) Administrative Case Study. As an example, the intent of the Theory to Practice series was to increase interaction between practitioners and academics in research, theory development, and curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0144739413487745">Raadschelders and Lee, 2011</xref>). The legacy of the Theory to Practice series is an uncommon exchange of evidence, perspectives, and application on the key issues in public management between academics and practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0144739413487745">Durant and Durant, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In August, 2008, the academic journal <italic>Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis</italic> initiated a series on “Reflections on Theory in Action”, calling for papers that ‘reflect on theory and when efforts are made to put this theory into action in order to learn, change, or innovate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0144739413487745">Alexander, 2008</xref>: n.p.). In the initiating article of the series, then editor and public administration theorist Thomas Catlaw notes, ‘there is probably not a word that does as much as work – or causes as much trouble – in public administration as the word practical. It pins together the various domains that comprise “public administration”. At this node, academic scholarship should inform administrative practice; university-based education should be practical and help practicing administrators to solve “real world” problems or applied in a hypothetical, imagined, or actual administrative context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0144739413487745">Catlaw, 2008</xref>: 518).</p>
<p>Therefore, practical is generally taken to mean ‘capable of being put into use, of being put into practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0144739413487745">Catlaw, 2008</xref>: 517). It follows that theory can be understood as ‘potential action under consideration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0144739413487745">Miller and King, 1998</xref>: 54). However, as Catlaw points out, we are talking not only about instrumental usefulness, but offering value because it is ‘<italic>interesting</italic>. It is an idea, instrument, or bit of knowledge that resonates with us. There is a spark or trace of something that seems applicable to our life or the situated context in which we seek to act’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0144739413487745">Catlaw, 2008</xref>: 527). Indeed, it has been suggested that ‘educating MPA students to competency in theory adds at least three potential aspects to their capacity for effective administrative action: richness of perspective, flexibility of attention, and modesty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0144739413487745">McSwite, 2001</xref>: 112). As a result, theory can help build universal competencies in terms of skills, knowledge, <italic>and</italic> attitudes. This offers particular value in light of the recent addition to the standards for public administration competence of the ability to ‘articulate and apply a public service perspective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0144739413487745">NASPAA, 2009</xref>: 7). However, it is equally of value to building competence in the other four domains of leadership and management skills, working within diversity, contributing to the policy process, and analysis, synthesis and critical thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0144739413487745">NASPAA, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Front bookend: integrative theory seminar</title>
<p>In the MPA program under study, the first integrative seminar is called Scope &amp; Practice and, according to its catalog description, is meant to provide an ‘orientation to the field of public administration, ethics and professional standards, and professional skills. Review of foundations, theories, scope and methods. Study of public management heritage and exploration of current trends and issues’. Based on a review of program and course information available on the websites of 136 peer NASPAA accredited programs, about 35 per cent of the foundation courses similarly introduce the field’s history and intellectual heritage, covering aspects of both organizational theory and the political, legal, and economic context. However, they are not presented as “integrative seminars”. Comparatively, the remaining sample foundations courses emphasize one of three purposes: (1) a survey of the substantive areas of public administration (22%); (2) an introduction to management and organizational theory (25%); and (3) an introduction to the institutions of governance and public policy (18%).</p>
<sec id="section3-0144739413487745">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Scope &amp; Practice is meant to be an integrative graduate seminar that provides the theoretical and historical underpinning needed to orient graduate students to the scope of the field and its elements of professional practice. It is also designed to develop core professional skills such as analysis, synthesis, writing, and presenting in order to prepare students for success in the remainder of the MPA curriculum. This purpose is mentioned in the course descriptions of six other foundations courses in the sample. With these purposes in mind, Scope &amp; Practice aims to produce the following student learning outcomes:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Explore and better understand the historical foundations of public administration in the United States</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Become familiar with principal topics of theoretical focus in public administration</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Identify and understand several recognized grounds for legitimacy in public administration</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Analyze how specific administrative theories and theorists use differing logics of legitimacy and combinations thereof</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Make personal choices among traditions of public administration or combinations thereof (as defined in the Traditions model used in the course)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Demonstrate an ability to apply multiple perspectives to current, real-life administrative challenges, relying on the knowledge gained through the other five learning outcomes</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0144739413487745">
<title>Design</title>
<p>Scope &amp; Practice has been developed over the last 4 years based on guidance drawn from: (1) discussions among the faculty in departmental strategic planning and the MPA Program Committee; (2) individual discussions with the emeritus professors who developed and taught the course; (3) external peer review of the syllabi and assignments by mentor faculty at peer or aspirational institutions; (4) peer review, editorial review, and publication of the textbook written for the course; and (5) ongoing student feedback from in-class change analysis exercises and anonymous evaluations.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Practice covers the historical, intellectual, and philosophical foundations of the field in diverse pedagogical approaches designed to build the universal competencies required for NASPAA accreditation. To address the need for some type of survey of the field and its history for students lacking any familiarity, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0144739413487745">Denhardt and Denhardt (2009</xref>) textbook, <italic>Public Administration: An Action Orientation</italic>, is used during the first 5 weeks of class to provide an introduction to the field and its history. The chapters introducing the field, its historical and current political and intersectoral context, its ethics, and its anticipated future are explored in several class sessions, along with supporting readings. Through a collective review of the remainder of the chapters, students are advised to use them as “primer” reading prior to each of the other core MPA courses, discussing how each chapter matches up with each course.</p>
<p>From this historical foundation, a theoretical framework is used for making sense of the various foundational theories in a generic fashion to orient graduate students to the field, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0144739413487745">Table 1</xref>. This is the principal method for integrating many strands of theory into a single framework.</p>

<p>Taken together, several patterns in how these questions are answered (called <italic>logics of legitimacy</italic>) comprise three traditions of public administration (Constitutional, Discretionary, and Collaborative) that channel administrative behavior into three distinct role types: Bureaucrat, Entrepreneur, and Steward. These differences are critical to both professional socialization and practice. This framework is presented and explained in the other assigned textbook, <italic>Logics of Legitimacy: Three Traditions of Public Administration Praxis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0144739413487745">Stout, 2013</xref>), which is utilized for the remainder of the course. As one external reviewer of the Scope &amp; Practice syllabus notes, ‘the model provides a succinct and useful way of organizing an array of views about knowledge and methods, political–administrative relations, and managerial practices. Best of all, these matters are all oriented towards the fundamental issue of the professional identity of the practicing public administrator and how these views play out in the real world of governance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0144739413487745">Catlaw, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>By repeating analysis of the same six theoretical elements through three very different lenses on governance, students develop an understanding of how the various source theories are interrelated. For example, political theory has deep implications for more than the institutions of governance and the policy-making process; its assumptions frame the scope of administrative authority, from which everything from organizational structure to supervisory assessment are developed. In this way, when students learn more deeply in a Management and Leadership class about organizational culture or in a Human Resources Management course about performance assessment, they are readily able to situate those approaches within patterns of philosophical tendencies. In short, specific approaches to these practices are informed by theoretical preferences that students are able to recognize from this integrative foundation. As one student puts it, the course ‘provided a theoretical and structural basis for the rest of my courses in the program, as well as towards my future career as a public administrator’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0144739413487745">Vodden, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Pedagogy and universal competencies</title>
<p>As would be appropriate for an integrative seminar, Scope &amp; Practice contributes to all five domains of universal competencies identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0144739413487745">NASPAA (2009</xref>): leadership and management skills; working within diversity; contributing to the policy process; analysis, synthesis and critical thinking; and articulating and applying a public service perspective. An overview of how the theoretical elements explored in the course provide a foundation for universal competencies is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0144739413487745">Table 2</xref>. However, competencies are also built through course assignments.</p>

<p>The Traditions framework provides the theoretical foundations for understanding diverse approaches to and expectations of leadership and management. The textbook and associated lectures and discussions provide a broad literature review in both the historical and philosophical sense. As one student explains, ‘it was challenging but helped me develop more points of view in government &amp; public administration as a whole’. This diversity is crucial to prepare students for the politically diverse perspectives they are certain to encounter in practice. Indeed, it is often these types of difference that are most difficult to manage in public administration.</p>
<p>Each student is assigned to one of three Traditions for focused team work in addition to individual reading about the other two. Through these readings and subsequent lecture discussions, students discover that each Tradition has its own organizing styles and approaches to allocating authority and measuring proper behavior. The differing scopes of action and decision making approaches are directly related to the various ways in which administrators contribute to the policy process. Each Tradition also has a different way to measure the performance of administrators in execution of expected functions.</p>
<p>Using the in-depth understanding developed through reading assignments and lecture discussions, the course builds competencies in analysis, synthesis, and critical thinking through in-class experiences and written assignments. To illustrate the unique pattern of leadership and management, each Tradition has a peer teaching component in which the team designs, with faculty guidance, a roleplaying exercise that demonstrates the governance roles of elected representatives, expert administrators, and affected citizens in a process appropriate to the Tradition. Each Tradition team also selects a film and develops, with faculty guidance, a discussion guide that illustrates the Tradition and walks students through the analytical process as a group. Films are a helpful way to approach case study, particularly for pre-service students with less direct experience to contextualize traditional case analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0144739413487745">Stout, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0144739413487745">Goodsell and Murray, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0144739413487745">Eagan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Armed with this team-based and in-class analytical practice, students are then given individual written assignments through which they demonstrate their individual ability to utilize a specific theoretical framework to analyze: (1) an administrative situation; and (2) scholarly prescriptions for practice. In the first type of written assignment, each student completes two analytical summaries of assigned readings from founding scholars (in original or excerpted form). The analytical summaries include an assessment of each reading’s fit (or lack thereof) to the assigned Tradition. The analytical summaries are reviewed for accuracy and shared with the entire class as a reference resource. Using the analytical summaries, students provide “value-added” details to a collaborative lecture and discussion about the associated Tradition.</p>
<p>In the second type of written assignment, students write a reflective essay on each of the three Traditions. First, the students synthesize in their own words their understanding of the distinct Tradition. Second, they provide a case illustration of the Tradition, analyzing how the situation reflects the Tradition (or not).Third, considering the case illustration and analysis, students apply critical thinking skills to reflect on the usefulness of the respective Tradition in contemporary governance. In so doing, they formulate their personal preferences for differing approaches to public administration in reflection on real or hypothetical administrative situations. The results of this assignment are often brilliant, revealing quite nuanced conceptual analysis and synthesis in addition to new personal insights into the challenges of governance. These cumulative insights help to inform their final written assignment – a personal statement for achieving legitimacy in public service.</p>
<p>In the third type of written assignment, each student selects an important scholar from the past or present for an analytical literature review paper at the end of the course. The paper presents a literature review of the scholar’s work, using synthesis to present the work in thematic fashion; provides analysis of the ideas utilizing the Traditions framework; and then offers a critical assessment of the work considering future application to practice. This repeats the same analytical process used in the essays, but rather than being trained on an administrative situation, the analytical lens is focused on scholarly prescriptions for practice. In this way, students become savvy consumers of theoretical claims throughout the remainder of their programs of study and careers. The reflections in this paper also contribute to their personal statement.</p>
<p>Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the Traditions framework enables students to discover three distinct approaches to the public service perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0144739413487745">Stout, 2009</xref>). Rather than being socialized into one particular approach to the profession, they are exposed to the landscape from which they may make their own informed choices. In the essays written on each Tradition, students are required to articulate and apply each perspective, and through their reflective critiques they are encouraged to begin devising their own personal method for achieving legitimacy in public service. Each student describes this approach in the final written assignment – a personal statement designed for inclusion in their professional portfolio. This intimate understanding of the choice-making involved in adopting a particular perspective sensitizes students to the problems of diversity in the governance process, particularly when the perspectives of elected representatives, expert administrators, and affected citizens differ. The professional portfolio is one of the key products developed throughout the program of study, and is pulled together in final format in the Capstone Seminar.</p>

<title>Back bookend: integrative practice seminar</title>
<p>In the program under study, the second integrative seminar is called Capstone; according to its catalog description, it ‘links MPA academic preparation to professional career through analysis of practice settings, professional literature, and internship/professional experience of student; integrates course-work, practice themes, competencies, and ethics’. Based on a review of program and course information available on the websites of 136 peer NASPAA-accredited programs, about two-thirds (92) of the programs offer a capstone seminar that integrates the intended curriculum competencies. The remaining programs either require a comprehensive exam, a thesis, or no concluding activity. The pedagogical approach for an integrative capstone experience varies, emphasizing one of three integrative purposes: (1) a series of reflective activities to mirror real-world experiences with case studies, simulations, and personal analysis of public service profession (53%); (2) individual analysis of a program management or public policy issue (30%); or (3) a team-based service learning project that directly supports a policy or program management activity for a non-profit or public organization (17%). What is unique about the integrative practice seminar implemented in the MPA program under study is that it combines two traditional pedagogical capstone approaches – explicit reflection on one's personal philosophy of public service, and a team-based service learning project. Based on the analysis of course descriptions in the sample, only two other MPA programs offer this blended approach.</p>
<sec id="section7-0144739413487745">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The practice of public service is in many ways a “contact sport”. Public service requires an understanding of the fundamentals, the ability to thrive in a dynamic and unpredictable environment, and the capacity to make decisions to facilitate action. Recognizing the need to prepare MPA students to integrate the streams of competencies to successfully transition to the practice of public service, many MPA programs have adopted capstone courses to meet this purpose. MPA capstone courses provide not only an opportunity to bridge theory to practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0144739413487745">McGaw and Wechsler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0144739413487745">Reid and Miller, 1997</xref>), but also to thread the acquired public service competencies together to address a real-world issue in public administration.</p>
<p>The purpose of the MPA capstone seminar under study is an opportunity to apply and reflect on the skills and knowledge garnered through the coursework in preparation for contributing to public service. Capstone aims to meet the following student learning outcomes:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Integration of concepts covered in the MPA curriculum to complete a public service project in support of the mission of a non-profit or public organization</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Application of professional and management skills to a team-based public service project</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Reflection on professional issues in public administration in preparation for contribution to public service</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Completion of a professional portfolio to reflect student achievements toward professional goals during the MPA program</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0144739413487745">
<title>Design</title>
<p>Capstone reflects a blend of the service learning and reflective activities models. The course draws upon foundational theories introduced in Scope &amp; Practice and the distinct public service competencies developed in a range of core and elective courses throughout the program of study in application to a team-based applied public policy or management project. Capstone also incorporates explicit reflection and integration of student’s public service knowledge, skills, and attitudes in producing an MPA professional portfolio. The professional portfolio is both a formative and summative reflection of the student’s achievements, competencies, and attributes to meet their distinct professional goals.</p>
<p>Capstone has been developed over the past four years based on: (1) the emphasis on public service values in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0144739413487745">NASPAA (2009</xref>) accreditation<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0144739413487745">1</xref>
</sup>; (2) a recognition of the value of service learning in MPA pedagogy; and (3) expressed student interest in integrating MPA experiences to articulate each student’s distinct knowledge, skills, and competencies. Capstone is both an instructor-guided and student-driven process. The instructor provides a framework for navigating the team-based policy and management projects, and the students directly negotiate with each project sponsor the scope of work, communication, and final deliverable. The MPA professional portfolio represents the student-driven reflection of each student’s unique knowledge, competencies, and attitudes, and the instructor provides guidance about how to contextualize explicit portfolio artifacts.</p>
<p>To generate applied projects, the instructor solicits requests for public service projects from local and regional non-profit and public organizations. The proposed public service projects range in specific deliverables but the focus is constant: the public service projects must advance the organizational mission and provide MPA students an opportunity to apply both management and analytical skills. Students articulate their project preferences and are assigned to teams to define with the organizational sponsor the scope of the project, specific project deliverables, and expectations about communicating with the sponsors. The role of the instructor during the public service projects is to provide an implementation framework for the teams. There are several process deadlines for the public service projects. Specifically, the MPA student teams must generate a Memorandum of Agreement with the organizational sponsor, provide a clear project management plan that includes tasks and deadlines, share their proposed methodology with their peers to receive feedback, and conduct a formal presentation. The instructor provides guidance and direct feedback to the teams at each of these milestones. The role of the organizational sponsor is to provide feedback on student work and to provide information about the organizational context and the policy environment. The students complete their analysis with a formal report and present their findings to organizational decision-makers and relevant policy stakeholders. Capstone deliverables have included: (1) a comparative analysis of state site certification policies to guide proposed state legislation; (2) the design and analysis of findings of a staff survey to advance a non-profit’s strategic planning process; and (3) the creation of a budget and implementation plan for a new school-based food assistance program.</p>
<p>The MPA professional portfolio provides another mechanism for MPA students to integrate foundational theories, curricular competencies, and professional experience. The professional portfolio is a curated collection of artifacts that represents the student’s academic work, knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Portfolio artifacts document a student’s academic performance, leadership skills, knowledge of ethical and professional standards, demonstration of public service, and activities for professional growth and continuing education. They include a résumé, a personal statement of their public service perspective, a narrative explanation of a student’s distinct skills and knowledge areas, evidence of each universal competency in documented artifacts, a summary of the internship experience, and a journal of both professional development and community service experiences. Examples of portfolio artifacts include: (1) a decision-making memo addressing a management challenge and recommendations; (2) a public engagement plan for a community strategic planning process; and (3) certificates of specialized professional development (e.g. homeland security or healthcare administration). Using the artifacts in the professional portfolio, students participate in several formal reflection assignments to articulate their knowledge, skills, and public service perspectives.</p>

<sec id="section9-0144739413487745">
<title>Pedagogy and universal competencies</title>
<p>Capstone is designed to build universal competencies as outlined in the NASPAA accreditation guidelines. Specifically, through the completion of the public service project and professional portfolio, Capstone contributes to developing the five universal competency domains: leadership and management; working with diversity; contributing to the policy process; analysis, synthesis, and critical thinking; and articulating and applying a public service perspective.</p>
<p>Capstone provides an opportunity for students to apply their own leadership and management skills to the implementation of a public service project. The projects require students to manage and reflect on their communication style and application of ethical standards, and contribute to a quality deliverable appropriate for the organizational context. Through the public service project, students build competencies in leading through adversity, managing diverse stakeholders, and maintaining a positive professional team environment. The public service projects, like public service itself, are fraught with ambiguity, conflicting ideas, and unanticipated changes. For example, students negotiate the specific scope, deliverables, and expected communication process with clients who may not know exactly what they need, how to accomplish the project, or change their expectations for the deliverables. Through these projects students learn to deal with unexpected challenges successfully. For example, student teams have identified new projects when initial projects have fallen apart. Student teams have identified new contact people in the organization when the original sponsor left. Student teams have leveraged their personal network of contacts in the community and the university to access relevant information and resources for the projects. The bottom line is that students take responsibility for the project outcomes, regardless of the obstacles.</p>
<p>The course builds competencies in working with diversity through the public service projects. One of the greatest challenges public administrators face is the ability to clearly and coherently communicate public need, recommendations for action, and decision-making strategies. The aim of the public service project is to empower students to apply a myriad of communication tools in a manner appropriate to the context. For example, students engage with unionized employees, board members of non-profits, representatives of state agencies, and community residents. To encourage students to effectively address organizational and policy issues, the public service projects require working closely with organizational sponsors to understand the contextual environment. The result of the public service project process is that students possess the courage to listen to diverse audiences, generate persuasive management and policy recommendations, and develop interpersonal skills to facilitate the implementation of recommendations.</p>
<p>The focus of the public service projects provides students an opportunity to develop competencies in contributing to the policy process through a variety of analytical skills. The varying project scopes reflect the range of activities that contribute to the policy process. Some public service projects provide analysis that supports proposed legislation to address a specific policy issue. Some projects build organizational capacity to implement policy changes. Some projects yield programmatic evaluation data as mandated by authorizing policies. Through directed discussions in the MPA Capstone Seminar, students reflect on how each project contributes to various stages of the policy process.</p>
<p>The professional portfolio is an explicit mechanism to articulate competencies in analysis, synthesis, and critical thinking. Students reflect on the cumulative MPA experience framed by the foundational theories, expanded through core curriculum and public service internship, and augmented by community service and professional development activities; providing exemplary evidence of what has been completed. Furthermore, the artifacts in the professional portfolio document a student’s ability to analyze, synthesize, and think critically to advance their distinct public service professional goals. In curating their own professional portfolio, MPA students reflect on and summarize their unique skills in problem analysis, knowledge synthesis to provide recommendations, and critical thinking to implement a project, program, or policy.</p>
<p>The NASPAA accreditation guidelines suggest that articulating a public service perspective may include ‘pursuing the public interest with accountability and transparency; serving professionally with competence, efficiency, and objectivity; acting ethically so as to uphold the public trust; and demonstrating respect, equity, and fairness in dealings with citizens and fellow public servants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0144739413487745">NASPAA, 2009</xref>: 2). As noted earlier, the aim of the integrative theory seminar is to engage students in an exploration of three ideal-type public service perspectives in order to discover their own personal approach. The aim of the integrative practice seminar is to engage students in the application of their personal public service perspective to a real-world project. The public service project provides an opportunity to practice and redefine their personal methods for achieving legitimacy in public service. For example, a critical piece of the public service project is formal evaluation from the organizational sponsor. Sponsors evaluate the student teams based on their ability to achieve professional competence, demonstrate respectful and appropriate communication, and meet the intent of the public service project, often in a context where diverse public service perspectives compete for legitimacy.</p>

<title>Discussion and recommendations</title>
<p>Public administration curriculum is evolving to meet the dynamic and diverse environment of contemporary governance. MPA faculty increasingly use pedagogical techniques designed to bridge theory to practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0144739413487745">Bushouse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0144739413487745">Cunningham, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0144739413487745">Killian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0144739413487745">Kramer, 2007</xref>). For example, case-based learning is evolving to reflect the phased and iterative practice of collaborative governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0144739413487745">Morse and Stephens, 2012</xref>) and take advantage of multimedia technologies for case analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0144739413487745">Hubert Project, 2013</xref>). Service learning projects that place students in organizational and community settings have been effectively used in a variety of public administration programs to link course material and theory to practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0144739413487745">Stout, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0144739413487745">Imperial et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0144739413487745">Bushouse and Morrison, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0144739413487745">Dicke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0144739413487745">Lambright, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0144739413487745">Lambright and Lu, 2009</xref>) while also producing real value in organizations and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0144739413487745">Necomer and Allen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0144739413487745">Waldner and Hunter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0144739413487745">Plein and Morris, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section11-0144739413487745">
<title>Reflection in linking theory to practice</title>
<p>However, in the rush to provide hands-on and real-world experiences that apply course concepts and theories, there is often an absence of active reflection. Yet such reflection on experience is what enables students to make sense of what is happening, consciously link it to theory, and integrate it most fully into their acquired knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0144739413487745">Cunningham, 1997</xref>). Analytical reflection on those experiences fosters critical thinking and the linkage of theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0144739413487745">Collier and Williams, 2005</xref>). Active reflection also supports the “double loop learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0144739413487745">Argyris and Schon, 1978</xref>) so sought after in organizational contexts, enabling the learner to adopt, adjust or reject theory based on experience. Therefore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0144739413487745">Bushouse et al. (2011</xref>) argue that ‘faculty should provide public administration students with ample opportunities to link theory with practice through reflection. Instructors should be prepared to take an active role in facilitating the reflection process and should not assume that students will be able to make the linkages between theory and practice on their own’ (p. 106).</p>
<p>Both the integrative theory seminar and the integrative practice seminar provide opportunities for guided reflection as students discover theory, articulate their own public service perspective, and apply both knowledge and attitudes in practical skill-building. Taken together active reflection is encouraged in the two integrative seminars in a variety of pedagogical approaches and assignments, including lecture discussion, role-playing exercises, case analysis, and both informal and formal writing assignments. In all, these activities develop “the reflective practitioner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0144739413487745">Schön, 1983</xref>). Explicit reflection through class discussions and assignments, faculty and client feedback on tasks and assignments, and preparation of the professional portfolio provide the “double-loop” learning that translates their experiences into applied practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0144739413487745">
<title>Making learning personal</title>
<p>As one external reviewer of the Scope &amp; Practice syllabus notes, ‘everything begins from and with the student’s own world and context, thereby making the materials and course overall <italic>relevant </italic>to the student’s work and development of her professional identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0144739413487745">Catlaw, 2011</xref>). As another suggests, ‘it is a course that forces students to reflect upon the nature of the study, the role and position of government in society, and the role they see for themselves in their future careers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0144739413487745">Raadschelders, 2011</xref>). This is borne out in student experience, as one graduate notes: ‘I have been able to easily identify trends in public administration not only in the literature I continue to read, but also in colleagues and policies with which I interact on a regular basis as a practitioner. At the same time, this framework has helped me to identify what my own “flavor” of public administration is, which allows me to more easily interact with my peers and the citizens with whom I regularly work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0144739413487745">Staton, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The reflective activities are designed to serve synthesis functions in each of the bookend seminars – helping the learner synthesize streams of theory in reflection on hypothetical practice in the first, and helping the learner synthesize experience of elements of actual practice in the second. However, it also important to note the manner in which reflection can also support analysis of specific elements in the remainder of the program of study. In taking on one theoretical thread or one particular set of skills in each core course, active reflection can be, and frequently is, used to integrate theory and practice. These analytical activities help the learner delve more deeply into each element of practice, but without losing sight of how they are connected to an integrated whole. This fosters a more seamless re-integration at the back end of the program when both theory and practice must be reintegrated in a service learning project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0144739413487745">
<title>Assumptions and expectations</title>
<p>Admittedly, however, this model does have its drawbacks. Adding the front-end integrative seminar makes the program of study longer. Furthermore, students commonly prefer application over history and theory, so bringing these topics to life in relevant ways can be challenging. In the program under study, this is accomplished through application of theory to interesting current events during lecture discussions, engaging role-playing exercises, and use of popular films and television series as case illustrations of governance scenarios. Based on the majority of student comments, this appears to be successful. As anonymous student evaluation comments put it:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>‘Film illustrations were wonderful use of displaying concepts’.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>‘I think they were very helpful to understand each of the traditions in action’.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>They ‘brought a very unique style to a potentially boring subject’.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Capstone also faces challenges. Service learning projects as a means of integrating theory to practice face implementation challenges. Projects vary in the degree of scope, clarity and organizational support. As a result, students must contend with goal and process ambiguity, competing stakeholder interests, and managing teams in the absence of explicit authority. But as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0144739413487745">Abel (2009</xref>) argues, ‘students of public administration must learn how to thrive on chaos, to resolve novel situations as apprehensive parties clamor to secure their interests, and to collaborate with a team of fellow bureaucrats as they identify, share and master a situation that is filtered through a fog of quasi-accurate information’ (p. 157). The service learning projects provide students an opportunity to “muddle through” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0144739413487745">Lindblom, 1959</xref>) the policy process, make decisions based on bounded rationality, and articulate recommendations that provide the highest value based on the scope of the project.</p>
<p>Therefore, in both integrative seminars, coproduced learning and service learning require a greater commitment on the part of both students and faculty. These types of approach prepare students for real-world expectations of self-direction, team work, and inter-organizational collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0144739413487745">Killian, 2004</xref>) and build both research and management skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0144739413487745">Whitaker and Berner, 2004</xref>). However, such approaches are also highly ambiguous and lead to higher levels of stress and unpredictability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0144739413487745">Jacoby, 2003</xref>). Therefore, they represent somewhat of a risk on the part of faculty, particularly those still on the road to tenure and promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0144739413487745">Boyer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0144739413487745">Boyer, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, we believe that the rewards for both students and faculty far outweigh the cost of the addition of one course and the pedagogical ingenuity and effort required for the coproduced learning and service learning experiences. Therefore, we heartily recommend the approach to our peer MPA programs and faculty.</p>

<p>A precondition for accreditation review includes an emphasis on Public Service Values defined as follows: ‘the mission, governance, and curriculum of eligible programs shall demonstrably emphasize public service values. Public service values are important and enduring beliefs, ideals and principles shared by members of a community about what is good and desirable and what is not. They include pursuing the public interest with accountability and transparency; serving professionally with competence, efficiency, and objectivity; acting ethically so as to uphold the public trust; and demonstrating respect, equity, and fairness in dealings with citizens and fellow public servants. NASPAA expects an accreditable program to define the boundaries of the public service values it emphasizes, be they procedural or substantive, as the basis for distinguishing itself from other professional degree programs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0144739413487745">NASPAA, 2009</xref>: 2).</p>
