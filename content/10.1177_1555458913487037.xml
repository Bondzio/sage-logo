<p>This case involves a high school principal dealing with increasing numbers of students with “invisible disabilities” in his school while faced with ever-present budgetary cuts, perennially substandard academic performance, and low teacher morale. This case seeks to investigate how a principal, faced with an unsupportive Board interested only in raising test scores as well as teachers complaining about students with disabilities disrupting their classes, can foster a climate of inclusivity while creating conditions aimed at the academic success of all students in this financially strapped, low-performing school serving children in poverty.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555458913487037">National Center on Accessible Instructional Materials (n.d.)</xref>, the overall percentage of students with disabilities receiving accommodations in K-12 schools nationally in 2008 was approximately 13.4%, yet few educators are well versed in how to effectively work with students who have disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555458913487037">Wolf, Brown, &amp; Bork, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555458913487037">Capper, Rodriguez, and McKinney (2010)</xref> pointed to the “dismal achievement, school completion and employment outcomes for students with disabilities” (p. 177) as justification for providing inclusive, comprehensive, and strength-centered educational opportunities. These issues are compounded in schools situated in areas where poverty is the norm, resources are limited, and parents or guardians can barely afford medication, much less regular visits to health care professionals for their children. Educational leaders need to think creatively in terms of how to best deal with these challenges.</p>

<sec id="section2-1555458913487037">
<title>Background and Context</title>
<p>Bryant High School is situated in a small Northeastern city of approximately 80,000 residents. The school district in which Bryant High School sits comprises 20 schools: 10 elementary schools, 4 sixth-grade academies, 4 middle schools, and Bryant High School contains a 9th- and 10th-grade campus and the high school proper. Like many urban school districts, the Bryant School District suffers from academic and other deficiencies. School-wide performance based on the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law has been inconsistent since 2003; only 7 out of the 20 schools “met AYP” in the last academic year, with 3 more schools designated as “making progress,” a euphemism for unsuccessful but just a little improved. The district is designated by the state as being in “Corrective Action-Year 4,” another indicator of failure. Other findings from a recent state Department of Education audit regarding the Bryant School District and Bryant High School include the following items:</p>
<list id="list1-1555458913487037" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>About 12 out of every 20 students (62%) were proficient/advanced in Mathematics compared with about half (49%) in Bryant. White students performed better than Latino/Hispanic and Black students in both subjects. Achievement levels were lowest for students with Individualized Education Program (IEP) and English language learners.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The high school was not effective in supporting student learning.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Students lost ground at the high school relative to their starting point after middle school.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The high school graduation rate is 66%, significantly lower than the state goal of 85% and the state average of 90%.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When compared with the state standardized test growth gains for high schools with similar student demographics, Bryant High School ranked consistently at or near the bottom.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Student enrollment in the 10 elementary schools ranged from 207 to 961 pupils.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the secondary level, each of the four middle schools housed approximately 550 students. The 9th- and 10th-grade campus enrolled about 2,000 students, while the senior high school had nearly 3,000.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Bryant School District employed about 2,300 employees during the last year. About 55% were teachers, 39% support staff, and 6% building and district-level administrators. Out of the 58 building administrators, 41 (70%) have been in that position for 3 years or fewer, and 91% for fewer than 7 years.</p></list-item></list>

<sec id="section3-1555458913487037">
<title>Case Narrative</title>
<p>Mr. Lopez has worked at Bryant High School for 20 years, moving up the ranks from science teacher to assistant principal and now principal. Although he has his master’s degree in Education as well as his School Building Leadership Certificate, most of his training has been on the job. Working in an inner-city, culturally diverse high school with over 90% of the students living at or below poverty level has certainly been challenging over the years for Mr. Lopez, but he is very committed to inspiring and empowering these students and his teachers. The past 5 years have been particularly difficult, however, as grades have fallen slightly, federal and state funding have decreased dramatically, and students with a wide variety of disabilities seem to have increased exponentially. In fact, 14% of his study body comprises students with disabilities, and that only includes those who have been reported; Mr. Lopez is quite certain, based on anecdotal evidence, that the number is much higher. In addition, he is fairly sure that even of those who are diagnosed, many cannot even afford the doctors’ visits and/or medication prescribed.</p>
<p>Mr. Lopez’s mantra, consistent with his commitment to diversity, has been the quote from M. Scott Peck, “Share our similarities; celebrate our differences,” which is engraved on a plaque on his door. However, he has seen that increasingly, with all the pressing problems the school is facing, such mind-sets have taken a back seat with the teachers and administrators. In fact, they have been replaced by repeated complaints about the number and “inappropriate” behavior of students with what he refers to as “invisible disabilities,” such as Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), psychiatric illnesses, learning disabilities, and so on. In the past 2 weeks alone, teachers brought the following grievances to Mr. Lopez:</p>
<list id="list2-1555458913487037" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Mr. Bonilla, a Spanish teacher known widely for his “chalk and talk” style of teaching, complained that Jordan is always antsy and “unfocused” in his class. Jordan “refuses” to pay close attention to the lecture, interrupts him with questions and irrelevant comments at inappropriate times, constantly disrupts the class with his immature antics, is always losing his homework (which Jordan “claims” to have done but somehow loses on the bus ride to school), and lost three Spanish textbooks in the past 2 months.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Miss Lee, a history teacher committed to making “history come alive” through her class reenactments, student skits, and individual presentations, has been having trouble with Lourdes, whose “parachute” mother is in her office at least once every 2 weeks. The mother’s main complaint is that Lourdes suffers from extreme social anxiety and therefore cannot be “forced” to engage in these class activities, nor can she sit in the front of the room because her psychiatric illness makes her believe that other students are “snickering at Lourdes behind her back.” Lourdes’ mother said she knows her daughter should be on medication but they cannot afford it. However, 40% of the grade involves some sort of class participation, so Miss Lee is at a loss as to what to do.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mrs. Rodriguez, an English teacher, is trying to teach the class literary techniques such as metaphors, foreshadowing, imagery, allusion, irony, and so on. However, Jeremy claims that his Asperger syndrome makes him unable to understand and apply these terms. (His IEP indicates difficulty with such concepts, but encourages teachers to push Jeremy to try his best.) Moreover, Jeremy is highly literal in his interpretation of everything that is said in the class and needs to have directions repeated to him over and over again after class (and often written down for him) which has become very time-consuming for Mrs. Rodriguez who can barely keep up with her overcrowded classes to begin with. What’s more, Jeremy often bursts into either the teachers’ lounge with questions that seem completely irrelevant or that Mrs. Rodriquez has already answered. At the same time, Jeremy seems to crave structure to the point where if the class routine is changed even slightly, he becomes visibly anxious, resulting in him rocking back and forth furiously in his seat.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mr. Pouncy, a biology teacher lamented his ongoing difficulties with Miguel, who was diagnosed with a learning disability. Although he seems to have above-average intelligence, he exhibits a very poor self-concept, does not seem to be able to conceptualize or process the lessons efficiently, and at times appears to even lack motivation. In addition, Miguel very often does not even use the accommodations that he is entitled to, such as note-takers, private testing rooms, extended time, and so on because he insists it makes him “feel like a loser” and his classmates make fun of him for being “a retard.” Often, the lab assignments are not completed on time because of Miguel’s deficits in basic work-related skills, causing his lab partners who are “stuck” with Miguel to complain about, and marginalize, him. In addition, his peers often bully him in the lunchroom and Mr. Pouncy himself has had to break up several fights.</p></list-item></list>
<p>While several of the teachers were somewhat sympathetic to the plight of these students, others view them as a disruption to the classroom and felt they should not have been mainstreamed to begin with. Moreover, most of the teachers feel ill-equipped to handle these students in their already overcrowded classes and insist that valuable class time is often “wasted” tending to the needs of these students. Compounding those complaints is the fact that the state recently introduced a performance review mandate that links annual teacher appraisals to their students’ test scores.</p>
<p>Mr. Lopez has never formally been educated on how to deal with students with such disabilities. Some of the newer teachers had taken a class in their master’s degree program, but the majority of teachers at Bryant are tenured and were never learned about such issues when they were in school. Instead, they rely on the district’s director of Pupil Personnel Services (PPS) and the high school’s sole special education teacher (both of whom are already overworked) to answer any questions they happen to have.</p>
<p>Mr. Lopez knows he needs to address not only the mind-set of his teachers but also their skills in working effectively with all students with invisible disabilities. In this way, he hopes these students will not only be set up for success, but the classrooms will foster a much more inclusive environment. Although well managed, Mr. Lopez’s budget is tight and there is little funding for professional development. Therefore, in a recent Board of Education meeting, he floated a variety of potential, low-cost ideas to forestall the seemingly escalating problem, including the following: training the faculty in, and promoting robust use of, Universal Design for Learning (UDL); purchasing an inexpensive, but professionally packaged, web-based disabilities awareness program; preparing an online, in-house module on disabilities; incorporating information at new teacher orientations; addressing disability issues at faculty meetings; preparing written materials with an overview of pertinent information; using open source assistive technology applications for teacher and student use; sending out e-newsletters (and other forms of communication) to teachers once every few weeks with relevant information, tips, teaching strategies, and success stories; applying for grants; bringing in consultants from nonprofit disability advocacy organizations who will present to the teachers at minimal cost; organizing a disability awareness day; and offering periodic “lunch ’n learn” sessions with various disability themes.</p>
<p>However, as hopeful as he was about several of his ideas being embraced, Mr. Lopez was told—in no uncertain terms—that his <italic>sole</italic> priority at this point was to raise grades and improve SAT scores or they would risk losing more state and federal funding. Any professional development activities, therefore, should be devoted to determining how to improve academic performance, not addressing disability-related issues. Furthermore, there were numerous complaints over the past year from parents about “the inordinate amount of taxpayer money” dedicated to resources for these few students with disabilities during a time of major cutbacks in other areas, including teachers.</p>

<title>Teaching Notes</title>
<p>This case study highlights how administrators and teachers must be aware of, and effectively address, a multitude of issues regarding students with invisible disabilities. Successful resolution of this case will entail providing appropriate social justice–oriented leadership aimed at addressing the knowledge and attitudes of teachers as well as providing tools for creating more inclusive classrooms. This needs to be accomplished with a seemingly unsupportive Board of Education that insists on focusing only on improving academic performance as well as a vocal parent–teacher association (PTA) demanding that resources be allocated “where they are most needed.”</p>
<sec id="section5-1555458913487037">
<title>Leadership Mind-Sets and Vision</title>
<p>On a macro level, educational leaders, such as the principal in this case (in conjunction with other key stakeholders), must develop an overarching vision that includes an understanding and awareness of disability and requires a significant shift in thinking for many educators. People are socialized to view disability as something that is intrinsic to the individual (i.e., their “impairment”)—a “defect” of sorts. In schools, students with disabilities are often viewed as people who must be assessed, identified, and accommodated as opposed to just unique individuals who contribute to the rich diversity of the classroom. Students with disabilities are often merely tolerated, seen as a burden, or expected to assimilate rather than be supported, nurtured, and empowered to be active members of the classroom community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555458913487037">Capper et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This mind-set is referred to as the “medical model” of disability whereby the person with a disability must be “normalized,” and/or “rehabilitated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555458913487037">Michigan Disability Rights Coalition [MDRC], n.d.</xref>). Such a model, along with behaviors and attitudes it foments, restricts people’s opportunities to make choices, control their lives, and develop potential. The “social model” of disability, however, is described in the rapidly growing, multidisciplinary field of Disability Studies as a framework that “seeks to understand disability as socially and culturally constructed, as opposed to something wrong with people’s bodies that must be remediated, fixed or cured” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555458913487037">Capper et al., 2010</xref>, p. 176). In other words, the social model of disability posits that disability is caused by society and is not the fault of the person with a disability. In this sense, it is the product of physical, organizational, and attitudinal barriers present in society which lead to discrimination. The removal of such discrimination requires a change of approach and thinking in the way in which society is organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555458913487037">MDRC, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking all of this into account, educational leaders for social justice must consider students labeled with disabilities in their equity efforts, moving beyond mere conversation to building truly integrated, socially just schools and districts, not just for students with disabilities but for <italic>all</italic> students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555458913487037">Frattura &amp; Capper, 2007</xref>). Accomplishing such a challenging but achievable goal will require educational leaders to rethink the structure of the entire school to ensure high academic achievement of all students. At the same time, it should promote classrooms that are safe havens, where differences are celebrated and students’ strengths are maximized.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555458913487037">Capper et al. (2010)</xref>, the following guidelines will help educational leaders create integrated, socially just schools and districts:</p>
<list id="list3-1555458913487037" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Integrated, socially just practices benefit ALL students.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Student classroom placement and participation in extracurricular groups must reflect natural proportions of students in the overall school population.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Leaders must work actively to recruit and hire a high quality, diverse teaching force and to support all teachers’ instructional capacity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ALL students must have access to rigorous, differentiated, culturally responsive instruction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Leaders must maintain a strong vision of socially just education and work to invest stakeholders in that vision.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Moving toward integrated, socially just education requires a purposeful plan for implementation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In seeking inclusive, integrated socially just schools and districts, leaders’ commitment cannot stop at disability but must include all students who may be marginalized based on some perception of difference. (p. 189)</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1555458913487037">
<title>UDL</title>
<p>One of many ways in which educational leaders and teachers can create these integrated, inclusive environments is through the use of UDL. According to the Center for Applied Special Technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555458913487037">CAST; n.d.</xref>)—a nonprofit research and development organization that works to expand learning opportunities for all individuals, especially those with disabilities—UDL is a research-based framework for designing curricula (i.e., educational goals, methods, materials, and assessments) that enables <italic>all</italic> students to gain knowledge, skills, and enthusiasm for learning. This is accomplished by simultaneously providing rich supports for learning and reducing barriers to the curriculum, while maintaining high achievement standards for all students. The premise behind UDL is that classrooms usually include learners with diverse abilities and backgrounds, including students with physical, sensory, and learning disabilities, differing cultural and linguistic backgrounds, varied preferences and motivations for learning, students who are gifted, and many others. UDL supports educators’ efforts to meet the challenge of diversity by providing flexible instructional materials, techniques, and strategies that help educators differentiate instruction to meet these varied needs. It does this by providing options for</p>
<list id="list4-1555458913487037" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>presenting information and content in different ways (the “what” of learning),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>differentiating the ways that students can express what they know (the “how” of learning), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>stimulating interest and motivation for learning (the “why” of learning).</p></list-item></list>
<p>Essentially, UDL introduces educators to three components for overcoming barriers in the traditional classroom by providing <italic>multiple means for representation, expression, and engagement</italic>. To encourage success of <italic>all</italic> students, the curriculum needs to provide flexible alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555458913487037">CAST, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>UDL has been endorsed as a “scientifically valid framework” by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 [HEOA, P.L. 110-315, §103(a)(24)] and is fashioned around the premise behind the NCLB—that education must be flexible if a wide audience is to be reached.</p>
<p>Consistent with the social model for disability, UDL is based on the assumption that it is the curricula (not the student) that fail to provide all individuals with fair and equal opportunities to learn. As noted above, the traditional approach has been to focus on “fixing the student” and retrofitting the curricula to meet the student—often resulting in lowered expectations and less-than-optimal learning opportunities for these students. From a UDL perspective, the focus for change is on the “disabled curricula” and not the student. UDL assesses curricula (goals, methods, material, and assessments) rather than students for their strengths and challenges, and the curricula are designed or redesigned more broadly to meet the needs of a diverse group of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555458913487037">CAST, n.d.</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1555458913487037">
<title>Teacher Mind-Set</title>
<p>Dealing with curricular strategies still leaves the question of teacher attitudes, perceptions, and stereotypes unanswered. According to Gitlow (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555458913487037">Milligan, 2005</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555458913487037">Wilczenski (1995)</xref>, faculty attitudes have been shown to be a powerful determinant in the inclusion of students with disabilities. Studies have also shown that the more contact educators have with students with disabilities, the more favorable they were to having these students in their classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555458913487037">Milligan, 2005</xref>). Likewise, educators who had more information about students with disabilities were more positive toward them and more willing to integrate them (Leyser, Vogel, Wyland, &amp; Brulle in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555458913487037">Salzberg et al., 2002</xref>). The success of students with disabilities depends to a large extent on willingness and ability of their instructors to accept them and provide accessible instruction, engagement, and assessment so that they can participate more equitably. To promote inclusivity with regard to disabilities, there needs to be an atmosphere of understanding and respect for individual differences, ultimately celebrating the uniqueness of each individual.</p>
<p>Addressing the practices, curricular changes, perceptions, and attitudes of teachers through ongoing professional development opportunities and support will ideally have a positive effect on the academic performance, personal satisfaction, and sense of belonging of the students with disabilities. In addition, the school climate will be much more welcoming for all students.</p>
