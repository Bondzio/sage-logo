<abstract>
<p>In this study, a novel bilayer scaffold composed of electrospun polycaprolactone and poly(lacto-co-glycolic acid) (PCL/PLGA) membrane and glutaraldehyde (3.5% v/v) cross-linked chitosan/gelatin hydrogel was fabricated using two methods: electrospinning of the membrane onto the lyophilized hydrogel (BS-1) and membrane underlaying and casting method (BS-2). The morphology of the fabricated scaffolds was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Mechanical strength, porosity, swelling capacity, and biodegradation rates of the scaffolds were also characterized. The in vitro biocompatibility of the materials was investigated by assessing cytotoxicity and cell proliferation on the material was measured using MTT assay. In addition, cell adhesion on the material was investigated by SEM. The BS-2 was grafted in Sprague-Dawley rats to determine its in vivo behavior and biocompatibility. The experimental results showed that the addition of the membrane layer to the hydrogel decreased swelling and degradation rates and provided ease of handling during implantation. Grafted BS-2 showed normal wound healing and no major inflammatory reaction was observed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211416527" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The structure of the native skin is usually presented with two distinctive layers: the epidermis and the dermis. The keratinocyte-laden epidermis is the upper, thin layer that functions as the protective barrier of the skin. The dermis is comparatively thicker and constitutes the lower layer of the skin. This layer, which contains fibroblast cells, provides strength and flexibility and networks with different systems of the body for a variety of functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211416527">1</xref></sup> Several different biomaterials have been developed to mimic the bilayer structure of skin for tissue engineering. Different groups have used a bilayer structure using a collagen sponge and silicone film,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211416527">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211416527">3</xref></sup> chitosan film and sponge,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211416527">4</xref></sup> chitosan and gelatin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211416527">5</xref></sup> and gelatin/chondroitin-6-sulfate/hyaluronic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211416527">6</xref></sup> for skin tissue engineering applications.</p>
<p>The bilayer structure of scaffolds intended for use in artificial skin applications is usually composed of an upper, dense layer and a porous or sponge-like sublayer. The difference in structure of the two layers can provide several advantages and add functionality to the scaffold. The dense upper layer is used to cover the wound and prevent further infection and stresses over the wound area. This covering is also designed to prevent fluid loss and dehydration since a moist environment is desired for the transfer of cell nutrients and metabolic products during culture. The lower, porous layer is thicker in height and has the capacity to absorb fluid since this layer is in contact with the wound exudates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211416527">7</xref></sup> In the case of culturing cells for tissue engineering of a skin substitute, the keratinocytes and fibroblast cells can be cultured separately in two layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211416527">6</xref></sup> Due to the difference in the pore sizes, infiltration of the keratinocytes to the lower layer can be prevented. Sustained release of incorporated drugs can also be achieved due to differences in the morphological characteristics and degradation of the two layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211416527">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chitosan and gelatin are two of the most widely used natural polymers for the fabrication of biomaterials for different target organ applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211416527">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211416527">13</xref></sup> due to their favorable biological qualities and degradability. Numerous studies have used this polymer combination to form hydrogels intended for skin tissue engineering applications. Although the chitosan/gelatin hydrogels for skin tissue showed promising in vitro characteristics, none of these displayed implantability in vivo. In this study, the addition of an upper membrane layer was done to complement the material properties of the hydrogel scaffold to overcome stresses in vivo. For these applications, the hydrogel was separately prepared using casting method and followed by lyophilization. It was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (GA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211416527">14</xref></sup> which is an effective cross-linker for the amine groups of chitosan and gelatin, to improve mechanical strength. The chitosan/gelatin sublayer has the ability to accommodate water molecules in its highly porous structure, thereby, retaining moisture. Dermal fibroblast cells were used to determine the cytocompatibility of the chitosan/gelatin sublayer since these cells are dominantly found on the lower layer of the skin.</p>
<p>Addition of a synthetic membrane layer to the porous hydrogel was done by electrospinning combined synthetic polymers to the precasted hydrogel (BS-1) and by underlaying the membrane followed by hydrogel casting (BS-2). The membrane was made of two biodegradable synthetic polymers, polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly (lacto-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA). The PCL/ PLGA membrane will be used as the substitute epidermis whose main function is to cover the wound area and prevent further infection to the wound. Its dense structure is designed to prevent moisture from evaporating but with sufficient porosity to allow gas exchange. Since this membrane is made of mechanically stable synthetic polymers, it should supplement the strength the chitosan/gelatin hydrogel lacks. Compatibility of the PCL/PLGA membrane with the native skin cells was also investigated to determine whether it can be an effective cell carrier. Keratinocytes were seeded on the membrane and growth and adhesion behavior was assessed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and MTT proliferation analysis.</p>
<p>The material and biological properties of the bilayer scaffold (BS) were investigated to determine whether the addition of the membrane layer improved the properties of the hydrogel scaffold. The scaffold was also grafted in a laboratory rat to determine its implantability and biocompatibility in vivo.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328211416527"><title>Preparation of samples</title>
<sec id="sec5-0885328211416527"><title>Bilayer scaffold</title>
<p>Two methods were used to fabricate the BS. The first method (BS-1) is by electrospinning the PCL/PLGA solution (4 mL) to the prefabricated hydrogel using the electrospinning parameters described in the section PCL/PLGA membrane. The second method (BS-2) was by initially underlaying the prefabricated PCL/PLGA membrane in a tissue culture plate. The chitosan/gelatin hydrogel solution, 5 mL, was poured over the culture plate and allowed to solidify at room temperature. The fabricated BS was prefreezed at −20°C for 12 h and then freeze-dried at −81°C for 24 h at 5 mTorr.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328211416527"><title>PCL/PLGA membrane</title>
<p>PCL/PLGA membrane (PM) was fabricated using polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly (lacto-<italic>co</italic>-glycolide) (PLGA) dissolved in THF: DMF: MC solvent (40:40:20) to a final concentration of 12% and 10% solution, respectively. These mixtures were combined to a final ratio of 80:20 (PCL: PLGA) and mechanically stirred for 12 h until completely homogenous. The 4 mL solution was electrospun under the following conditions: 25 kV high-voltage power supply, 25-gauge needle, 0.5 mL/h solution flow rate, 15 cm distance from syringe nozzle to the collector, 10 cm spraying distance from tip to collector at ambient room temperature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328211416527"><title>Chitosan/gelatin hydrogel</title>
<p>Chitosan/gelatin hydrogel (CGH) was fabricated using a filtered chitosan acetate solution, 2%, combined with 15% gelatin in deionized water to achieve a 50: 50 ratio and was mechanically stirred for 12 h. Glutaraldehyde (GA; 25%) was diluted to 5% and was used for cross-linking (3.5% v/v). The cross-linked CG solution was casted on a culture plate, prefreezed at −20°C for 12 h, then lyophilized in a freeze-drying machine (Ilshin Lab, Co. Ltd., Korea) at −81°C, 5 mTorr for 24 h until completely dried. Samples were washed once with 1% NaOH to remove excess acetic acid, then repeatedly rinsed with distilled water and treated with 50 mM of glycine to neutralize GA. Samples were then freeze-dried with conditions described above.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0885328211416527"><title>Characterization</title>
<sec id="sec9-0885328211416527"><title>Morphological analysis</title>
<p>The fabricated BSs were imaged using a portable optical microscope (Dinolite) for gross morphological visualization after fabrication. Cross-sections of BS-1 and BS-2 were cut and sputtered with platinum sputter coater (Cressington Sputter Coater). Samples were then visualized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM701F, JEOL, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV.</p>
<p>The density of the samples was calculated by dividing the obtained mass by the calculated volume (length × width × height). Average values were obtained from four replicates with standard deviation.</p>
<p>The porosity and pore size distribution of the samples was determined using a mercury intrusion porosity meter (Quantachrome Porosity Meter, FL, USA). CGH, 5 mm × 5 mm × 3 mm, was placed inside quartz penetrometers after sufficient drying. Porosity was determined using the accompanying Poremaster software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0885328211416527"><title>Mechanical strength</title>
<p>Samples (BS-1, BS-2, and CGH) were cut into rectangular strips (7 mm × 4 mm × 3.5 mm) to test the material’s mechanical strength using a universal testing machine (Unitech™, R&amp;B, Korea). Each strip was securely attached to a paper frame using double-sided adhesive. This was then anchored to the tensile tester. The sides of the paper frame were cut upon uniaxial application of strain at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min with a 1-kg load cell. Tensile strength was determined using dry samples and wet samples that were immersed in PBS for 15 min. The reported values were an average of four replicates with standard deviation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0885328211416527"><title>Swelling properties</title>
<p>Each sample was preweighed prior to immersion in PBS, pH 7.4, 37°C. At different time intervals, samples were taken out of the PBS and blotted with filter paper to remove free water. The degree of swelling, which was expressed as a percentage, was calculated as follows:

</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0885328211416527"><title>In vitro biodegradation</title>
<p>Lyophilized BS-1, BS-2, CGH samples were preweighed and then immersed in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> units/mL of lysozyme at 37°C, for a total of 25-day observation. PBS was replaced every sampling time. The samples were freeze-dried for 6 h and the remaining weight was measured after 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 17, 20, 23, and 25 days. The degree of degradation was calculated as follows:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0885328211416527"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="math2-0885328211416527"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Degree of degradation</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>%</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula2-0885328211416527" xlink:href="10.1177_0885328211416527-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>W<sub>0</sub></italic> was the original weight and <italic>W<sub>t</sub></italic> was the weight per time interval. All samples were tested four times at every observation time.

<sec id="sec13-0885328211416527"><title>In vitro biocompatibility</title>
<sec id="sec14-0885328211416527"><title>Cytotoxicity</title>
<p>In vitro biocompatibility was assessed for CGH, BS-2, and BS-2 treated with glycine (BS-2 G). Cytotoxicity of the samples was determined by measuring the cell viability of cultured cells after exposure to different concentrations of the extract solutions from the sample. Extract solutions were initially prepared by immersing the sample in culture medium (RPMI with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at a ratio of 0.1 g/mL for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2.</sub> The extract solutions were filtered with 0.20 µm disposable sterile filters (DISMIC, Japan) and several dilutions were made with fresh media (0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, and 100%). These were then added to 24-h cultured cells (L-929 fibroblast cells) in 96-well tissue culture plates seeded at 10<sup>4</sup> cells/100 µL and incubated for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2.</sub> Absorbance at 595 nm was quantified after subsequent addition of MTT solution and DMSO and read using an ELISA reader (Infinite F50, Tecan). Cell viability was determined as the ratio of absorbance of the treated wells against the non-treated wells (0%) and reported as percentage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0885328211416527"><title>Cell proliferation</title>
<p>Human dermal fibroblast cells (CCD-986SK) were maintained in DMEM culture media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Fibroblast cells were seeded at a density of 10<sup>4</sup> cells/mL onto the hydrogel component of the bilayer (cell seeding surface area: 1 cm<sup>2</sup>), which had been ethanol-sterilized and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cell proliferation was quantified using the MTT assay for 1, 3, and 5 days. The optical density at 595 nm was used to quantify the cell growth.</p>
<p>Human neonatal keratinocytes (K-155) were maintained in Keratinocyte Growth Media Bulletkit (Lonza). Keratinocyte cells were seeded at a density of 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ mL on the membrane layer (cell seeding surface area: 3 cm<sup>2</sup>) of the BS and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> with media changes every 2 days. Cell proliferation was quantified using the conditions described above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0885328211416527"><title>Cell adhesion behavior</title>
<p>CCD-986SK and K155 cells were seeded on the hydrogel and membrane component of the BS, respectively. Cell-seeded scaffolds were fixed and dehydrated with a series-graded ethanol after 3 days and critically dried with hexamethyldisilazane. Dried samples were examined using FE-SEM.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0885328211416527"><title>In vivo biocompatibility</title>
<p>The biocompatibility of the fabricated BS was also investigated in vivo. A sample (BS-2) with dimensions of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm × 1 cm was sterilized with ethylene oxide gas and soaked in PBS prior to implantation. An incision was made at the dorsal part of an anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rat (male, approximately 250 g) and BS-2 was grafted by replacing the incised skin with the dermal muscle still intact. The laboratory animals were fed and kept at optimum laboratory conditions. After 2 and 21 days, skin was excised for histological examinations of inflammation and scar tissue formation, respectively.</p>
<p>Excised skin fragments were fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin and cut into 5 µm sections with a microtome. Tissue sections were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and were viewed with a light microscope (Olympus BX51, Japan). Stitching of images was done using the accompanying Cellsens software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-0885328211416527"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Characterization tests were conducted in four replicates, unless otherwise stated. Values were expressed as mean of four replicates and standard deviation. Experimental results done in a continuous time interval were also analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), single factor with a confidence level of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 using Microsoft Excel 2007. Tukey’s studentized range test and Bonferroni <italic>t</italic> tests were done to determine which changes in values were statistically significant.</p>

<p>The precursor materials used for the BS were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211416527">Figure 1</xref>. The electrospun PCL/PLGA membrane consisted of the upper, thin layer, which had a thickness of 44.65 ± 4.99 µm, density of 10.210 ± 0.960 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, average fiber diameter of 0.98 ± 0.40 µm, and porosity of 20.70%. In addition, in the frequency of fiber distribution, more than 60% of the fibers had diameters below 1000 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211416527">Figure 1(a)</xref>, inset).

<p>The GA-cross-linked CGH SEM morphology is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211416527">Figure 1(b)</xref>. The thickness of the hydrogel was 2.13 ± 0.22 mm with a density of 0.125 ± 0.002 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Its porosity was 97.49% and the average pore diameter was 290 ± 109 µm.

The PCL/ PLGA membrane consisted of the upper, thin layer and a thicker, porous sublayer was made of GA-cross-linked CGH. There were no marked differences in the gross morphology since the starting materials used in the fabrication was the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211416527">Figure 1(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211416527">b</xref>)). Difference in the membrane layer was noted. The membrane deposition in BS-1 has a rough, variable microsurface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211416527">Figure 1(c)</xref>, inset) while the membrane adhesion in BS-2 resulted in flat and smooth appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211416527">Figure 1(d)</xref>, inset).</p>

<sec id="sec21-0885328211416527"><title>Mechanical strength</title>
<p>The mechanical strength of both the lyophilized (dry) and PBS-immersed (wet) scaffolds was investigated to determine the material’s ability to withstand the stresses that occur during handling and implantation. BS-1, BS-2, and CGH had similar tensile strengths ranging from 216.7 ± 21.1 to 225.7 ± 33.5 kPa. After PBS immersion, the tensile strength of BS-1 and BS-2 scaffolds has drastically reduced by almost 90%; however, the values displayed by the BSs were still higher than CGH alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211416527">Figure 2(a)</xref>).

<p>The swelling property of the BSs, BS-1 and BS-2, was compared with the CGH layer alone to assess the effect of the membrane layer addition with the swelling kinetics of the scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211416527">Figure 3(a)</xref>). In these experiments, the mass of all samples increased to about 800% of their initial weight after 24 h of immersion with an observed increase in mass every sampling time. The swelling patterns of BS-1 and BS-2 were observed to be similar, with BS-2 having a slightly higher weight after 3 h. The CGH swelled more than the two BS when the immersion time was greater than 1 h and reached the equilibrium after 12 h. Changes in the surface area were monitored at different time points during 24 h of immersion. The surface diameter of CGH and BS-1 were shown to have similar patterns of enlargement. However, a relatively small change in surface diameter was observed for BS-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211416527">Figure 3(b)</xref>). Consequently, membrane separation was seen in BS-1 after 24 h of immersion in PBS, while the membrane in BS-2 remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211416527">Figure 3(c)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211416527">d</xref>), respectively). The membrane surface of the scaffolds was white and opaque in the dry state. In the wet state, the color of the hydrogel layer dominated since the thin membrane became semi-permeable to the water molecules.

<p>During characterization of the two BSs, it was found out that BS-2 displayed more favorable properties in terms of shape stability, degradation, and membrane separation. For these reasons, the BS-2 was used for the following biocompatibility testing and was compared to the CGH layer. The cytotoxicity of the samples was evaluated by measuring cell viability after extract solutions of the samples were added to cultured fibroblast cells. CGH and BS-2 were able to support more than 80% cell viability with a slight reduction upon the addition of membrane layer in BS-2. However, when BS-2 was treated with glycine (BS-2 G), a greater cell viability was observed relative to non-washed BS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211416527">Figure 5</xref>). The addition of a hydrophobic membrane layer in combination with the effect of GA cross-linking may have caused this decrease in cell viability. Thus, to lessen the deleterious effect to cells, washing with glycine was done to neutralize the cross-linker.

<p>After establishing the in vitro cytocompatibility with native skin cells, the BS was grafted in a laboratory rat to determine its implantability and its effect on wound healing in vivo. In this part of the experiment, BS-2 was used as sample for implantation since its material integrity was maintained during in vitro experiments. This was done without antibiotics or any chemicals to suppress immune response. Implantation of CGH was also attempted, but it was not able to withstand the mechanical stresses of surgery and broke during suturing. In the case of BS-2, the attached polymer membrane provided support to the scaffold during implantation allowing ease of handling and withstand of needle puncture. The animals were observed to be in a healthy state before extraction. No wound swelling or purulent deposits were observed in the wound area. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211416527">Figure 7</xref> shows the skin sections containing the BS-2 grafted in the rat skin after 2 days.

<sec id="sec27-0885328211416527" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Skin is a complex organ and the study of skin tissue engineering is very diverse in terms of scaffold fabrication. Several materials have been used to fabricate a suitable dermal replacement from biologically-derived to synthetically manufactured matrices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211416527">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211416527">18</xref></sup> However, studies are still in progress to develop other scaffold alternatives. In this manuscript, a novel BS, which was made of two different biomaterials, was fabricated for skin tissue engineering applications. This structure was selected to mimic the two-layered structure of the native skin. The different properties of the separate layers may provide advantages not found in single-layered scaffold. The outer layer serves as wound protection and the layer in contact with the wound environment primarily aids in healing and rehabilitation of the damaged tissue. The same principle may have been evident in other commercially available scaffold, like Integra for example, which used a silicone upper layer and a collagen-glycosaminoglycan sublayer. In contrast, the BS in this study used materials that can be used in a wider range of applications. Chitosan have antimicrobial properties that are important during wound healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211416527">9</xref></sup> Gelatin is derived from collagen, which accounts for similarity in chemical structure and cost significantly less.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211416527">19</xref></sup> PCL and PLGA are mechanically reliable polymers that can be used as drug-delivery systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211416527">20</xref></sup> One of the challenges in fabricating a bilayered structure is to ensure that the scaffold is homogenous in structure with two different precursor materials. Moreover, adhesion of the two separate layers must be maintained in order to serve its function. In fabricating BS-1, the hydrogel thickness was controlled but collection of the fibers resulted in an uneven microstructure of the membrane surface. The deposition of the nanofibers in the macroporous hydrogel network only accomplished physical layering but not sufficient adhesion; thus, signs of membrane separation were observed within after 24 h of immersion in a fluid environment. BS-2 was fabricated using a different approach. A prefabricated membrane that was initially underlayed in a mold ensured uniform thickness of the upper layer. In addition, the weight of the viscous CGH solution flattened the membrane allowing it to be uniformly distributed resulting in a smooth and even surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211416527">Figure 2(b2)</xref>). Casting with warm hydrogel solution and subsequent prefreezing and freeze-drying facilitated adherence of the membrane to the hydrogel layer.</p>
<p>The upper layer was intended to be used as a cover to protect the wound from further stress and infection. Such material required suitable strength and dense structure. It is known that electrospun membranes mimicked the extracellular matrix,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211416527">21</xref></sup> while still providing a porous structure. Degradation can be controlled depending on the material used. These characteristics can provide more benefits when the upper layer will be used for other purposes besides wound cover, such as cell-delivery or drug delivery systems. The membrane layer in this study was made from electrospun blends of PCL and PLGA. This material was shown to have sufficient mechanical strength and favorable cytocompatibility with mouse fibroblast cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211416527">22</xref></sup> Porosity data revealed that it was about 20% porous despite its dense structure, which may still allow gas exchange. Testing its cytocompatibility with human keratinocyte cells showed that it can allow native skin cell adhesion, but cell proliferation was not statistically significant. A previous study also reported that PCL can only minimally support keratinocyte cell growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211416527">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chitosan and gelatin are naturally derived polymers that have a similar structure as extracellular matrix components,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211416527">24</xref></sup> rendering it more biocompatible than its synthetic polymer counterparts. These polymers were used to fabricate the hydrogel sublayer of the BS. Since this layer will be in contact with the wound environment, the material must be compatible with native skin cells and should not elicit cytotoxic effects.</p>
<p>The high porosity of the hydrogel layer allowed it to swell up to 800% of its initial weight. This was beneficial in keeping the wound environment moist to protect the wound from desiccation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211416527">25</xref></sup> However, the porous nature also made the scaffolds mechanically weak. In a study using gelatin scaffolds, increased porosity correspond to a reduction in the compressive strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211416527">26</xref></sup> The stress and strain values of CGH obtained in this study were similar to those reported by Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211416527">27</xref></sup> for chitosan-gelatin hydrogels. The incorporation of a membrane layer improved the tensile strength and strain in the BS compared to the CGH alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211416527">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, swelling was slightly reduced especially in the case of BS-2 when the membrane displayed good adhesion even after 24 h of immersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211416527">Figure 3(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211416527">d</xref>)).</p>
<p>Membrane adhesion was also seen to influence the scaffold enlargement during swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211416527">Figure 3(b)</xref>), which influences lower biodegradation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211416527">Figure 4</xref>). The membrane was composed of 80% PCL, which is a highly hydrophobic polymer. Attachment of a hydrophobic membrane in the upper layer repelled water molecules that entered from the upper surface. Thus, less water molecules could penetrate the hydrogel network, reducing its degradation rate.</p>
<p>Cytotoxicity tests were conducted to investigate the effects of the biomaterials on animal cells, which is one of the prerequisites for implantation. In the case of CGH, reduced cell viability was observed, which may be attributed to GA cross-linking. Thus, the BS was treated with glycine to neutralize GA, which elicited toxic effects, resulting in the improvement of cell viability as was observed in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211416527">28</xref></sup> Human dermal fibroblast cells were shown to tightly adhere to the hydrogel layer of the BS, further validating the favorable compatibility of the chitosan and gelatin and the effectiveness of GA neutralization. During in vitro culture, cell behavior was seen to spread vastly in the pore surface, with attachments in between pore walls indicating that the scaffold can be used as native skin cell carrier.</p>
<p>In vivo grafting was used to assess the potential of using this scaffold in a clinical setting. Implantation with CGH alone was also attempted; however, the scaffold was broken immediately after needle puncture during suture. Mechanical weakness is the main limitation to use this scaffold in a clinical setting. Thus, the membrane layer was added to support the structure during implantation and to withstand suture. It was noted, however, that the hydrogel layer of the BS degraded much faster in vivo compared to the in vitro experiments. In this case, the BS maybe used as a temporary skin substitute or for tissue dressing but not for long-term skin replacement. However, it is worth noting that the scaffold did not elicit an immune reaction or rejection and the wound bed underwent a normal healing process. Further studies are needed, however, to investigate its efficiency over commercially available products.</p>

<sec id="sec28-0885328211416527" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, a novel BS composed of an electrospun PCL/PLGA membrane and chitosan/gelatin hydrogel was fabricated. The addition of electrospun membrane made of synthetic polymers displayed improved physical properties and mechanical strength as indicated by the slower biodegradation rates and minimal swelling of the BSs compared to the hydrogel layer alone. In addition, the hydrogel layer was observed to be very compatible in vitro as evidenced by the high proliferation rates of human dermal fibroblast cells and favorable cell adhesion and in vivo as evidenced by scaffold integration without eliciting immune response. However, biodegradation of the scaffold needs to be improved for more effective use in the clinical setting.</p>
