<p>An electromagnetic device, consisting of a pair of permanent magnets and a non-magnetic coil, has shown its linear advantages for inducing parametric stiffness excitation in the laboratory. The electromagnetic device powered by a DC coil current acts like a mechanical spring with constant stiffness. The effects of design parameters upon the electromagnetic stiffness and its linear operating range (referred as the stiffness characteristics) are important and crucial for the design and usage of the device. Thus, a numerical method, based upon the commercial finite element method (FEM) package ANSYS/Emag, was presented for analyzing the stiffness characteristics of the device with DC coil current. The theory foundation for computing the electromagnetic force using FEM was derived and the program realization in ANSYS was introduced briefly. Two typical examples were chosen to verify the accuracy of the numerical analysis method. Based upon these, the restoring force characteristics of the electromagnetic device with various DC coil currents were obtained utilizing the numerical method. Two important indicators (proportional coefficient between linear stiffness and coil current and linear range of the stiffness) were defined for measuring the stiffness characteristics of the electromagnetic device. Then, the effects of the design parameters (both the electromagnetic and structural parameters) on the two indicators were investigated, respectively. The research results provide useful references for the stiffness design of the electromagnetic device in actual practice.</p>

<p>Dynamical systems mathematically modeled by linear ordinary differential equations with periodic coefficients (or Mathieu–Hill equations) are referred to as parametrically excited systems. This type of system is of great theoretical and practical importance because of its many applications in various fields of science and engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077546311404728">Ibrahim 1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077546311404728">b</xref>).</p>
<p>Using experimental means is one of the important aspects of the research on the dynamic behavior of parametrically excited system. Presently, some methods have been used to achieve the parametric stiffness excitation in the laboratory, such as beams and plates subjected to a periodic axial or in-plane loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077546311404728">Bolotin 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077546311404728">lvan-Ewanowski 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077546311404728">Deolasi and Datta 1997</xref>), axial moving systems (belt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077546311404728">Pellicano et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077546311404728">Michon et al. 2008</xref>) and plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077546311404728">Kartik and Wickert 2008</xref>)), a pendulum under two-frequency parametric motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077546311404728">Yatawara et al. 2006</xref>), base excited cantilever beam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077546311404728">Rhoads et al. 2008</xref>) or wire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077546311404728">Mullin et al. 2003</xref>). In addition, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077546311404728">Belovodsky et al. 2002</xref>) described several designs of elastic elements with periodically time-varying elasticity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077546311404728">Echer 2008</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077546311404728">Dohnal et al. 2006</xref>) respectively gave two ideas for creating a mechanical element with time-dependent stiffness. However, these experimental programs seem to be more difficult to achieve in the laboratory, and the dynamic features of the systems induced by parametric excitation could easily be concealed due to the disturbances of some unavoidable nonlinear effects.</p>
<p>In 2001 and 2004, an electromagnetic device, acting like a spring with alternating stiffness, was developed in experiments by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077546311404728">Chen and Yeh 2001</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077546311404728">Yeh and Kuo 2004</xref>) to induce parametric excitation on cantilever beams. The amplitude and frequency of the parametric stiffness excitation were accurately controlled by the current flowing through the coil of the electromagnetic device. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077546311404728">Chen and Yeh 2001</xref>) showed that the device could be easily equipped in the laboratory. Since the excitation force is a non-contact electromagnetic force which acts on the beam in the transverse direction, some nonlinear disturbances induced by the geometric imperfection of the beam and the coupling effects between the excitation mechanism and the beam were effectively avoided. Therefore, the electromagnetic device is a potential good choice in the experimental investigation of parametric instability behavior of various structures with various materials. Recently, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077546311404728">Schmidt et al. 2007</xref>) used a similar device to demonstrate the effect of a so-called parametric anti-resonance on a test stand.</p>
<p>As the literature shows, current research mainly focuses upon the realization of parametric stiffness excitation utilizing the AC powered electromagnetic device, while the stiffness characteristics of the device powered by DC source (becomes a spring with constant stiffness) have not attracted sufficient attention. The stiffness characteristics referred in here include two major aspects: (1) the relationship between the DC current through the coil and the linear stiffness of the device; and (2) the effects of design parameters upon the electromagnetic stiffness and its linear operating range. Actually, quantitative study on the first aspect is essential for determining the amplitude of the parametric stiffness excitation; to understand the second aspect is also important and crucial for the design and usage of the device. The electromagnetic stiffness is defined as the increase of restoring force per unit of coil displacement. Thus, the key point for analyzing stiffness characteristics is how to compute the electromagnetic force acting on the coil, which essentially belongs to the static electromagnetic field problem. As the structure of the device is relatively complex, so a finite element method (FEM) is employed to solve the problem. The commercial FEM code ANSYS/Emag (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ansys.com">http://www.ansys.com</ext-link>) has powerful modeling capabilities for the electromagnetic field, and provides multiple types of formulations for the static analysis, such as the magnetic scalar potential (MSP) formulation, the magnetic vector potential (MVP) formulation and the edge formulation.</p>
<p>Thus, the stiffness characteristics of the electromagnetic device will be analyzed numerically based upon the FEM code ANSYS/Emag in this paper. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-1077546311404728">Section 2</xref>, the structure and working principle of the electromagnetic device are introduced briefly. Then, in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-1077546311404728">Section 3</xref>, the theory foundation for computing the electromagnetic force using FEM is derived and the program realization process in ANSYS is illustrated. Two examples are chosen to verify the accuracy of the numerical method. Based upon these, in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec16-1077546311404728">Section 4</xref>, the restoring force characteristics of the electromagnetic device with various DC coil currents are obtained utilizing the numerical method. Two important indicators (proportional coefficient between linear stiffness and coil current and linear range of the stiffness) are defined for measuring the stiffness characteristics of the electromagnetic device. In the following section (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec19-1077546311404728">Section 5</xref>), the effects of the design parameters (involving the electromagnetic and structural parameters) on the two indicators are discussed respectively. Finally, the conclusions are given in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec25-1077546311404728">Section 6</xref>.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1077546311404728"><title>2. The electromagnetic device</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311404728">Figure 1</xref>, the electromagnetic device consists of a pair of permanent magnets and a non-magnetic coil. The pair of magnets are fixed on support connected to the ground. An enamelled wire is wound around a plastic frame to form the coil. As the current flow through the coil, the coil becomes an electromagnet. The mutual acting forces between the electromagnet and the pair of magnets make the electromagnetic device function like a spring. When the DC coil current has the same direction as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311404728">Figure 1</xref>, the mutual acting forces between the electromagnet and the pair of magnets are repulsive forces. The resultant force acting on the electromagnet by the pair of magnets tends to push it back to the equilibrium position. In this case, the electromagnetic device has positive stiffness. When the DC coil current has the opposite direction to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311404728">Figure 1</xref>, the mutual acting forces between the electromagnet by the pair of magnets are attractive forces. The resultant force tends to pull the electromagnet away from the equilibrium position. The electromagnetic device acts like a spring with negative stiffness. Since the non-contacting device possesses either the positive or negative stiffness, it can be employed to add or to remove stiffness from a structure without changing the structure.
<fig id="fig1-1077546311404728" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic of the electromagnetic device.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311404728-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In addition, when the coil current is an AC current, the electromagnetic device becomes a spring with alternating stiffness. As the coil frame is plastic and non-ferromagnetic, there is no hysteresis for the stiffness changing with coil current. Moreover, the electromagnetic stiffness is linearly correlated to the coil current. Thus, the electromagnetic device could be used to produce parametric stiffness excitation, and the amplitude and frequency of the excitation are precisely and rapidly controlled by the coil current.</p>
<p>The structure and working principles of the electromagnetic device have been illustrated briefly. In the following section, a numerical method based upon ANSYS/Emag will be presented for analyzing the stiffness characteristics of the electromagnetic device powered by a DC source.</p>

<p>The current source element (SOURC36) in ANSYS/Emag, used for modeling the current-carrying coil (electromagnet), does not support the two-dimensional analysis. Thus, the three-dimensional static electromagnetic analysis is chosen in ANSYS/Emag to model and compute the acting force of the coil by the permanent magnets. The corresponding program realization includes four parts.</p>

<p>The solid elements used in the three-dimensional static magnetic analysis are SOLID5, SOLID96 and SOLID98. SOLID5 and SOLID96 are bricks and have 8 nodes, while the SOLID98 is tetrahedral and has 10 nodes. Here, the SOLID98 is selected for its better precision.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current source element SOURC36 is utilized to model the electromagnet. There are three geometry types of the element: coil, bar and arc. Obviously, the coil type of SOURC36, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311404728">Figure 2</xref>, is chosen in the analysis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311404728">Figure 2</xref>, nodes I, J and K define the characteristic length, current flow direction and orientation of the element; CUR, DY and DZ are real constants, which represent the total current through source, characteristic <italic>y</italic> direction and characteristic <italic>z</italic> direction, respectively.

<p>Because the plastic (the material of the coil frame) has a magnetic permeability close to air, it is approximated as air material in the analysis. Thus, the concerned material involves two types: air and permanent magnet. For the air material, the relative permeability is just specified as 1. In the case of the permanent magnet, requirements are the normal demagnetization curve (or relative permeability μ<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, if linear) and components of the magnetic coercive force <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> along the three orthogonal axes. In addition to the coercive force, there is another parameter of the permanent magnet, which is called the remanence <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>.

<p>The establishment of the finite element model of the electromagnetic device is similar with that of the general structural analysis. Something that should be mentioned is that the surrounding air regions of the coil and permanent magnets should be expanded to an appropriate scope in order to reduce the error due to the leakage of magnetic flux. In order to compute the electromagnetic force, the air region of the coil is defined as a component.</p>

<p>The number of turns of the solenoid is <italic>N</italic> = <italic>s</italic>/<italic>d</italic> = 231, and the current is <italic>I</italic> = 0.5 A. Therefore, the total current source is <italic>N</italic> × <italic>I</italic> = 115.5 A. Since no ferromagnetic materials are present, the field due to induced magnetization equals zero, and thus no scalar potential is required. The total magnetic field can be determined from the numerical integration of the coil source field upon specification of the coil with the current source element (SOURC36). Since the field is symmetric, an arbitrary arc of 20° is chosen with an additional symmetry plane taken along the coil midspan. The finite element model of the solenoid is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311404728">Figure 4</xref>. The calculated magnetic flux density is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1077546311404728">Figure 5</xref>. It is shown that the magnetic flux mostly distribute in the internal region of the coil, and the direction is from the downside to the upside. According to the right-hand rules, the north pole of the solenoid is at the tip of the solenoid. Thus, from the qualitative point of view, the magnetic field result is correct.

<p>As the coil is powered by DC current with different values (<italic>I</italic> = −2, −1.5, −1, −0.5, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 A), restoring force (the resultant force acting on the coil due to the two magnets) values of the electromagnetic device varying with coil displacement are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1077546311404728">Figure 11</xref>, respectively. In the figure, positive values of coil current correspond to restoring force curves with positive slopes. For a certain value of coil current, such as <italic>I</italic> = 2 A, the restoring force value becomes larger with the increase in displacement. Different coil current value makes the force changing rate different. Generally, the higher the coil current, the faster the changing rate. In the following, the relationship between the coil current and the changing rate of the restoring force with displacement will be investigated using the polynomial fitting technique.

<p>The restoring forces changing with displacement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1077546311404728">Figure 11</xref> are discrete data points. The continuous variation could be seen in virtue of the polynomial fitting technique.

It is shown that the cubic polynomial fitting provides a good approximation to the restoring force data. The linear polynomial fitting results meet the precision requirement for the coil in small displacement, while larger errors are produced for the coil in larger displacement.

<p>The electromagnetic stiffness is defined as the increase of restoring force per unit of coil displacement. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1077546311404728">Figure 12</xref>, it is found that the stiffness of the electromagnetic device is linear in small coil displacement. However, nonlinear phenomena will occur for the electromagnetic stiffness in relative larger coil displacement. In actual practice, the electromagnetic stiffness should be working in linear range as soon as possible to avoid the nonlinear effect. In the paper, the coefficient of the first degree of the polynomial fitting function is taken as the linear stiffness, and its range is defined as the displacement in which the relative difference between the linear and cubic polynomial fitting results is no more than 5%. The linear range is shown as the range of the two verticals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1077546311404728">Figure 12</xref>, corresponding to the displacements <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>1</sub> and <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>2</sub>.

<disp-formula id="disp-formula20-1077546311404728"><label>(20)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311404728-eq20.tif"/></disp-formula>
in which <italic>a</italic> is the current/stiffness proportional coefficient (units: (N m<sup>−1</sup>) A<sup>−1</sup>). Here <italic>a</italic> characterizes the relationship between the linear stiffness and coil current. Under the same coil current, greater coefficient <italic>a</italic> could bring larger electromagnetic stiffness. It is indicated that the ability of the electromagnetic device to obtain additional stiffness is increasing. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1077546311404728">Figure 13(b)</xref> shows that there is no significant change for the linear stiffness range under different coil currents, which maintains about 0.0024 m. Therefore, it is concluded that the coil current has no effect upon the linear stiffness range.

<p>Based upon the above discussions, the current/stiffness proportional coefficient and linear stiffness range are utilized as two indicators for measuring the stiffness characteristics of the device. In the following section, the effects of the design parameters (including structural and electromagnetic parameters) of the device upon the two indicators will be investigated, respectively.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1077546311404728"><title>5. Effects of design parameters upon stiffness characteristics of the electromagnetic device</title>
<p>The structural parameters of the electromagnetic device are the diameter and length of the permanent magnet, the equivalent coil diameter, and the spacing between two magnets. The dimensions of the magnet should adhere to the market specifications. Here, the diameter and length of the magnet is fixed and the values are the same with these in the previous section. The electromagnetic parameters are the magnetic coercive force and the remanence of permanent magnet, number of turns of the coil and winding types of the coil.</p>
<p>Thus, the equivalent coil diameter and spacing between two magnets will be respectively considered in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec20-1077546311404728">Sections 5.1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec21-1077546311404728">5.2</xref>. The coercive force and the remanence belong to the magnetic parameters of the permanent magnet, which are discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec22-1077546311404728">Section 5.3</xref>. The effects of number of turns and winding types of the coil are investigated in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec23-1077546311404728">Sections 5.4</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec24-1077546311404728">5.5</xref>.</p>
<sec id="sec20-1077546311404728"><title>5.1. Equivalent coil diameter</title>
<p>Practically, the equivalent coil diameter could be changed by adjusting the inner diameter of coil frame. The magnets spacing is fixed to be <italic>H</italic> = 0.012 m and the other parameters are the same with these in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec18-1077546311404728">Section 4.2</xref>. As the equivalent coil diameter <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>ce</italic></sub> is in the range of [0.025, 0.055] m, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1077546311404728">Figure 14</xref> shows the changes of the current/stiffness proportional coefficient <italic>a</italic> and linear stiffness range <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>2</sub>, respectively. It is found from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1077546311404728">Figure 14(a)</xref> that the value of <italic>a</italic> first increases then decreases for the <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>ce</italic></sub> adding from 0.025 to 0.055 m. The maximal value is obtained as <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>ce</italic></sub> = 0.040 m, which just equals the magnet diameter.
<fig id="fig14-1077546311404728" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><p>The current/stiffness proportional coefficient and linear stiffness range changing with the coil equivalent diameter in the range of [0.025, 0.055] m: (a) proportional coefficient; (b) linear stiffness range.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311404728-fig14.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Thus, the effect of the equivalent coil diameter upon the proportional coefficient is summarized as when the equivalent coil diameter is equal or near to the magnet diameter, the proportional coefficient achieves greater value, indicating that the electromagnetic device could have higher spring stiffness under the same coil current. If the difference (both greater than and less than) between the equivalent coil diameter and the magnet diameter is larger, the proportional coefficient would have lower value. In this case, same coil current could only bring lower stiffness to the electromagnetic device.</p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1077546311404728">Figure 14(b)</xref>, we can see that changing the equivalent coil diameter also produces a significant impact on the linear stiffness range. In the case of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>ce</italic></sub> = 0.040 m, the corresponding <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>2</sub> ≈ 0.0018 m, which is almost the minimum value, indicating that the largest proportional coefficient and widest linear stiffness range could not be obtained together. Increasing (or decreasing) <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>ce</italic></sub> from 0.040 m to 0.055 m (or 0.025 m) all makes <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>2</sub> first raise evidently and then fall gently. There are two ‘best’ diameters, corresponding to point B or point B′ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1077546311404728">Figure 14(b)</xref>, at which the <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>2</sub> reaches the maximal value, roughly equals to the air gap ((<italic>H</italic> − <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>)/2 = 0.0042 m) between the coil and one of two magnets. This means that the electromagnetic device would have linear stiffness in all of movable range of the coil.</p>
<p>In order to explain the existence of two ‘best’ equivalent coil diameters for linear stiffness range, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1077546311404728">Figure 15</xref> shows the restoring force curves for the electromagnetic device at points A, B, C, A′, B′, and C′ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1077546311404728">Figure 14(b)</xref> with coil current <italic>I</italic> = 2 A. The solid and dashed lines in the figure represent the restoring force and the corresponding linear polynomial fitting curves, respectively.
<fig id="fig15-1077546311404728" position="float"><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><p>Restoring force and the corresponding linear fitting curves for the device at six points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311404728">Figure 1(b)</xref>: (a) point A; (b) point B; (c) point C; (d) point C′; (e) point B′; and (f) point A′.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311404728-fig15.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>For the equivalent coil diameter smaller than the diameter of point B or larger than the diameter of point B′, such as the diameter of point A or point A′ (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1077546311404728">Figure 15(a)</xref> or (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1077546311404728">f</xref>)), the varying rate of the restoring force is reducing in case of large coil displacement, showing that the stiffness of the electromagnetic device has the ‘soft’ feature. When the coil equivalent diameter is greater than the diameter of point B and less than the diameter of point B′, such as the diameter of point C or point C′ (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1077546311404728">Figure 15(c)</xref> or (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1077546311404728">d</xref>)), the varying rate of the restoring force is increasing for large coil displacement, indicating that the electromagnetic device has the ‘hard’ feature. As the coil equivalent diameter is increasing or decreasing from the magnet diameter (equal to 0.040 m), the electromagnetic stiffness will be gradually transformed from the ‘hard’ to ‘soft’ features. Therefore, there must be two values of equivalent coil diameter, one is larger than and the other is smaller than the magnet diameter, which cause the electromagnetic stiffness to be in the transition state. In this case, the device has the maximal value of linear stiffness range. For the equivalent coil diameter equals to the diameter of point B or point B′, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1077546311404728">Figure 15(b)</xref> or (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1077546311404728">e</xref>), either the soft or hard feature is not found in the restoring force curves, indicating that the device stiffness is around the transition state. Thus, the maximal value of linear stiffness range is obtained.</p>
<p>The equivalent coil diameter should be equal to or close to the magnet diameter by adjusting the inner diameter of the coil frame in order to obtain higher value of electromagnetic stiffness. However, the linear stiffness range is relatively small for this case. If the electromagnetic stiffness is expected to be linear in a larger range, then one part of the stiffness value will be sacrificed and the equivalent coil diameter should be designed to be any one of two certain values (one is larger than and the other is smaller than the magnet diameter). In addition, the stiffness and its linear range of the electromagnetic device all would be small as the equivalent coil diameter is too large or too small compared with the magnet diameter. This type of design should be avoid in actual practice if there is no special requirement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1077546311404728"><title>5.2. Spacing between two magnets</title>
<p>The effect of spacing between two magnets <italic>H</italic> upon the stiffness characteristics of the device is discussed in this section. Three values of <italic>H</italic> (0.008, 0.01 and 0.012 m) are considered in the analysis, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1077546311404728">Figure 16</xref> shows the proportional coefficient <italic>a</italic> and linear stiffness range <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>2</sub> changing with the equivalent coil diameter <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>ce</italic></sub>, respectively.
<fig id="fig16-1077546311404728" position="float"><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><p>The effect of the magnet distance upon the stiffness characteristics: (a) proportional coefficient; (b) linear stiffness range.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311404728-fig16.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>For different values of <italic>H</italic>, the qualitative properties of the electromagnetic stiffness changing with <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>ce</italic></sub> are similar with the above descriptions. In quantitative aspect, when the equivalent coil diameter is equal to or close to the magnet diameter, reducing the magnet distance increases the current/stiffness proportional coefficient evidently and the increasing rate is accelerated, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1077546311404728">Figure 16(a)</xref>. For <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>ce</italic></sub> = 0.040 m and <italic>H</italic> = 0.012 m, the corresponding proportional coefficient is <italic>a</italic> = 180 (N m<sup>−1</sup>) A<sup>−1</sup>. As <italic>H</italic> is reduced to 0.010 m, the value of <italic>a</italic> is increased to 220 (N m<sup>−1</sup>) A<sup>−1</sup> and the increment is 40 (N m<sup>−1</sup>) A<sup>−1</sup>. Continuing to reduce <italic>H</italic> to 0.008 m, the value of <italic>a</italic> reaches 300 (N m<sup>−1</sup>) A<sup>−1</sup> and the increment is 80 (N m<sup>−1</sup>) A<sup>−1</sup>, which is obviously greater than the increment of <italic>a</italic> from <italic>H</italic> = 0.012 to 0.010 m. In addition, if there is large difference between the equivalent coil diameter and the magnet diameter (both greater than and less than), changing the magnet distance seems to have little effect on the proportional coefficient of the electromagnetic device.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1077546311404728">Figure 16(b)</xref> shows that reducing the magnet distance decreases the linear stiffness range with varying degrees. For <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>ce</italic></sub> equal to or close to the magnet diameter, the electromagnetic stiffness has ‘hard’ features and the value of <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>2</sub> is slightly decreased due to the reduction of <italic>H</italic>. When <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>ce</italic></sub> is far from the magnet diameter, the electromagnetic stiffness would have the ‘soft’ feature or be in a transition state, the value of <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>2</sub> is notably decreased for reducing the <italic>H</italic>.</p>
<p>The above discussion shows that: adjusting the spacing between two magnets is an effective way for the stiffness design of the electromagnetic device. In the premise of the equivalent coil diameter close to the magnet diameter, reducing the magnet spacing increases the stiffness of the electromagnetic device with the same coil current, while the linear stiffness range would be decreased in this case. Moreover, the air gap between the coil and one of the two magnets is reducing along with the magnet spacing, which would also narrow the actual moveable range of the coil. These factors should be considered comprehensively in the practical design.</p>

<sec id="sec22-1077546311404728"><title>5.3. Magnetic coercive force and remanence of the permanent magnet</title>
<p>The magnetic parameters of the permanent magnet are the coercive force <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> and remanence <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>. In this section, they are analyzed respectively for their impacts on the stiffness characteristics of the electromagnetic device.</p>
<p>The magnet spacing is <italic>H</italic> = 0.012 m, and the remanence is fixed to be <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = 1.17 T. Three values of the magnetic coercive force (<italic>H</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> = 7.56 × 10<sup>5</sup>, 8.68 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 9.47 × 10<sup>5</sup> A m<sup>−1</sup>) are considered in analysis, and the computational results for both the current/stiffness proportional coefficient <italic>a</italic> and linear stiffness range <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>2</sub> changing with the equivalent coil diameter <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>ce</italic></sub> are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1077546311404728">Figure 17</xref>, respectively. For certain equivalent coil diameter, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1077546311404728">Figure 17(a)</xref> shows that adding the coercive force increases the proportional coefficient, especially for the coil equivalent diameter close to the magnet diameter. Thus, the stiffness of the electromagnetic device could be enhanced by increasing the magnetic coercive force. In addition, it is found from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1077546311404728">Figure 17(b)</xref> that changing the coercive force almost has no effect upon the linear stiffness range.

<p>The above discussion is summarized as follows: increasing the magnetic parameters (both coercive force and remanence) of the permanent magnet will all enhance the ability of the electromagnetic device to gain greater stiffness values. Moreover, the linear stiffness range is not affected by the magnetic parameters.</p>

<sec id="sec23-1077546311404728"><title>5.4. Number of turns of the coil</title>
<p>Here, the number of turns of the coil is taken into account in the discussion. The diameter of the wire and the turns per layer are the same as in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec18-1077546311404728">Section 4.2</xref>. Thus, the change in coil turns is achieved by adjusting the number of layers of the winding wire. The magnet spacing is fixed to be <italic>H</italic> = 0.012 m. Three values of the number of turns of the coil (24, 36 and 48) are concerned in the analysis. Then, the current/stiffness proportional coefficient and linear stiffness range varying with the equivalent coil diameter are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1077546311404728">Figure 19</xref>, respectively.

<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1077546311404728">Figure 19(a)</xref>, we can see that the proportional coefficient is increased evidently by adding the number of coil turn, especially for an equivalent coil diameter close to the magnetic diameter. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1077546311404728">Figure 19(b)</xref> shows that the linear stiffness range is slightly widened with the increase in the number of turns of the coil.

However, the coil weight is increasing along with the number of turns of the coil, which should be considered in the stiffness design of the electromagnetic device by changing the turn number of the coil.</p>

<p>When the equivalent coil diameter is close to the magnet diameter, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1077546311404728">Figure 20(a)</xref> shows that the coil of ‘12–3’ has the maximal proportional coefficient, the others are smaller and the smallest proportional coefficient corresponds to the coil of ‘3–12’. If the equivalent coil diameter is largely different to the magnet diameter, the proportional coefficients of five winding types are almost the same. For certain magnet distances and numbers of turns, the coil with larger length and smaller width of winding wire would have greater stiffness in the same coil current. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1077546311404728">Figure 20(b)</xref>, the maximal value of linear stiffness range corresponds to the coil of ‘3–12’, while the others are lower and the coil of ‘12–3’ has the lowest value. It is indicated that the coil with smaller length and larger width of winding wire has roughly greater values of linear stiffness range.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that the linear stiffness range could be reduced due to the increasing the length and decreasing the width of the winding wire. However, for certain magnet spacing and number of turns, the moveable range of the coil (the air gap between the coil and one of the two magnets) is reducing with the increase in the length of winding wire. This should be taken into account in the actual design.</p>

<sec id="sec25-1077546311404728" sec-type="conclusion"><title>6. Conclusions</title>
<p>A numerical method, based upon the commercial FEM package ANSYS/Emag, has been presented for analyzing the stiffness characteristics of the electromagnetic device powered by the DC coil current. The theory foundation for the method is derived, and the program realization in ANSYS is introduced briefly. Then, two typical examples are chosen to verify the accuracy of the numerical method. After these, the restoring force characteristics of the device with various coil current are obtained by utilizing the numerical method, and two indicators, the current/stiffness proportional coefficient and linear stiffness range, are defined to measure the linear stiffness characteristics. The design parameters (both structural and electromagnetic parameters) have been investigated for their effects upon the two indicators. The conclusions are summarized as follows:
<list id="list2-1077546311404728" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The stiffness of the device is linearly proportional to the coil current. The linear stiffness range is not affected by the current.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When the equivalent coil diameter is equal to or close to the magnet diameter, the electromagnetic device could have greater value of stiffness with the same coil current. If the electromagnetic stiffness is required to operate linearly in a wide range, the equivalent coil diameter is recommended to be any one of the two ‘best’ diameters, which means that the electromagnetic stiffness is in transition state.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In addition to the equivalent coil diameter, the spacing between two magnets is also an important structural parameter for the stiffness design of the electromagnetic device. For the equivalent coil diameter close to the magnet diameter, decreasing the magnet spacing could effectively enhance the ability to obtain greater stiffness for the device. However, the linear stiffness range is reduced along with the magnet spacing decreasing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The magnetic parameters (both the coercive force and remanence) of the permanent magnet would slightly affect the electromagnetic stiffness, while they almost have no effect upon the linear stiffness range.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For certain wire diameter and turns per layer, adding the number of turns of the coil will increase the electromagnetic stiffness evidently. However, the weight of the coil is also increased, which should be considered in the design practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For certain magnet spacing and number of turns, changing the winding type of the coil will affect the stiffness of the device. The coil with larger length and smaller width of winding wire would have greater stiffness and relatively narrower linear stiffness range.</p></list-item>
