<title>Deadline: February 28<sup>th</sup> 2012</title>
<p>The construction of creativity in organizations continues to puzzle scholars. Creativity is often associated with organizational spaces where rules and boundaries are weak if non-existent, and by the same token is considered to decline where they are strong and pervasive. This dichotomy, between organizational freedom and necessity, results in opposing images of creativity and its absence: On the one hand we have romantic images of entrepreneurs asserting creativity by breaking rules and transcending boundaries, and on the other institutionalized managers constrained by rules and prevented by boundaries from exercising creativity.</p>
<p>The interplay of freedom and necessity in organizations, however, is more nuanced. Most organizational actors have to operate both within and through existing rules and boundaries to effect creative solutions to existing problems. To meet the challenge of the situation these actors develop a set of skills, social tactics, and mental orientation that express “organizational ingenuity”: the ability to create innovative solutions within structural constraints using limited resources and imaginative problem solving.</p>
<sec id="section2-0170840611433379">
<title>Organizational Ingenuity as Creative Managerial Entrepreneurship</title>
<p>Building on extant work, we claim that organizational ingenuity within institutional constraints is not only a confrontation between change and inertia, it can also be a creative adaptation or reformulation of institutional constraints that are either intrinsic or extrinsic to the structure and strategy of the organization in question. Seen in this perspective, organizational actors working within the constraints embedded in the legitimate logic of the organization are motivated to find creative solutions to existing problems, or to develop new systems that provide innovative opportunities. Thus, actors employ creative actions to drive organizational ingenuity which enables re-conceiving the basic purpose, practices and ethos of the organizations in which he or she works.</p>
<p>Organizational ingenuity applies to single organizations navigating their environment, but also to organizational populations seeking to change the institutional frameworks that define and constrain their environment. In this respect, organizational ingenuity is a societal level capability that is behind many of the governance and organizational innovations that have shaped our current economic, social, and political realities, and a crucial part of the innovations needed to address the current challenges facing a world in transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611433379">Courpasson, Arellano-Gault, Brown and Lounsbury, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Organizational ingenuity is therefore practiced at different organizational, sectoral, national, and international. It is practiced within the organization at the interface between individual, team, project, and business unit levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611433379">Bundy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840611433379">Okhuysen and Bechky, 2009</xref>), but is also employed externally by the organization as it engages with its regulatory and societal interactions. In these contexts organizational ingenuity combines both dissention and cooperation to game and tilt organizational and societal power in the pursuit of limited or global goals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611433379">Couprasson and Clegg, 2006</xref>). Its practices therefore reflect the governance system in which it is embedded, but this embeddedness is used to advantage by co-opting, coordinating, and whenever possible drawing on organizational slack to effect change (March and Simon, 1963; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611433379">Donaldson, 2001</xref>). Accordingly, the special issue addresses institutional rationality that combines the micro-processes of actors’ practices, and the macro structures and cultural frames that organize meanings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611433379">Lounsbury, 2008</xref>). It explores the interaction between creativity and institutional processes that give rise to individual and collective expressions of organizational ingenuity.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, the key questions that this Special Issue therefore addresses are: <bold>Under what conditions does organizational ingenuity emerge? How do social actors innovate within the constraints of their institutional processes, and how do they use institutional processes to alter the institutions in which they operate?</bold></p>

<title>Possible Topics</title>
<p>This special issue is intended to encourage scholarly interest in the more contextual and practice oriented aspects of organizational ingenuity and creativity. We welcome submissions from a variety of disciplines and point of views. In particular, we are interested in submissions that relate to the way organizational actors employ creative tools in their plight for change. We also encourage submissions that can bridge the major gap between ‘structure and agency’ in the creative process, as well as the tension between the accommodation of structure versus its reformulation and bypassing, using various levels of analysis and addressing multiple fields, to explain the central role of actors in constituting and employing organizational creativity for the purpose of promoting change. With this in mind we encourage submissions that focus on the following issues:</p>
