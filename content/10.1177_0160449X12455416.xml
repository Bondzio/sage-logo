<p>I am always suspicious of authors who start out their books trying to create a wholly new class analysis and structure, including newly created words, like this title. It seems to me to be a way to avoid the classic (though rightly vulnerable to revision) Marxist-based categories out of fear of being labeled a red and thereby dismissed or because one is ideologically anticommunist and refuses to give Marxist categories and analysis any public credence. Despite this inauspicious beginning, there is much in <italic>The Precariat</italic> to recommend it to labor educators, labor studies scholars, and activists of all sorts.</p>
<p>Guy Standing is a former longtime International Labor Organization (ILO) official, now a professor of economics at the University of Bath, in the United Kingdom. With a PhD from Cambridge, an MA in industrial relations from the University of Illinois, and a long list of consultancies, he has written a book that provides a clear and detailed understanding of how the situation of precarious employment affects the lives of the “precariat” individually, collectively, day to day, and over the longer term. This is the book’s greatest value. Standing does this with many international examples, even though his main intellectual base is in Britain.</p>
<p>His analysis of the impact of precarity, along with the diversity of examples from around the world, makes this the primary book on the topic to date. His use of history ranges back to the ancient Greeks, and his construction of a revised terminology to deal with work (tasks to be accomplished), labor (work for wages/money income), leisure (nonwork activities), and play (leisure activities that do not involve learning, participation in civic life, or idleness) is useful and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>His description of the new “class” is the clearest I have ever seen, incorporating all the factors that both define the “precariat” and the outside forces that have brought it into being. Not surprising for an ILO veteran, the book is a model of organization, but in this case he is explicitly critical of the ILO’s central ideology, which he calls “labourism” or social democracy. He contends this approach is insufficient for the demands of the world of corporate globalization and never did adequately encompass the majority of the world’s people.</p>
<p>The main problems with the book are two: One is the attempt to create an entirely new class structure based on a mishmash of subjective and objectives factors, with more than a dash of pop sociology thrown in. This is unnecessary. The vast majority of the volume could just as well be categorized as to how the working class has once again been altered by a combination of factors worldwide. In fact, Standing himself can’t keep to his own analysis and is forced to fall back on traditional Marxist terminology (e.g., working class, exploitation) in order to carry his discussion.</p>
<p>Second, the book is sorely deficient in its attention to how these problems—for the “precariat” and the rest of society—are to be addressed. His few brief examples of alternative organizations are much too scanty to carry the load he rightly sees as needed in the future. Ironically, for a book that persistently decries neoliberal state action as “libertarian paternalism,” his own solutions, especially the universal basic wage, would mainly require government implementation on a large scale.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this book is well worth the time for labor educators and a stimulating read that makes it worth its price. It would be useful in any class where the goal to is introduce students (especially union members) to the realities of the precarious existence of over half the world’s labor force, including many in the United States. Standing’s provocative analyses will stimulate discussion, and his questions are more fundamental than those often raised in labor education or labor studies classes.</p>
