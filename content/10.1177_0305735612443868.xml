<abstract>
<p>There has been considerable research considering how instrumental practice changes as expertise develops. Much of that research has been relatively small scale and restricted in the range of instrumentalists included. This paper aimed to explore the development of practising strategies and motivation to practise as expertise develops with a large sample of participants at different levels of expertise playing a wide range of different instruments. A total of 3,325 young people ranging in level of expertise from beginner to the level required for entry to higher education conservatoires completed a questionnaire which consisted of a number of statements relating to practising strategies, organization of practice, and motivation to practise with a seven-point rating scale. Data were analyzed in relation to nine levels of expertise. Factor analysis revealed seven factors: adoption of systematic practice strategies; organization of practice; use of recordings for listening and feedback and use of the metronome; use of analytic strategies; adoption of ineffective strategies; concentration; and immediate correction of errors. There were statistically significant linear relationships between grade level and four of the factors but not for organization of practice; use of analytic strategies; and concentration. The findings are discussed in relation to the educational implications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Practice is central to the development of all aspects of musical expertise. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735612443868">Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Romer (1993)</xref> have suggested a monotonic relationship between ‘deliberate practice’ and an individual’s acquired level of performance. Supporting this, accumulated practice has been demonstrated to be a key variable in determining the level of musical expertise attained. Expert performers invest several thousand hours of practice over a lengthy period of time to attain high levels of accomplishment, although there are substantial individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735612443868">Ericsson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735612443868">Hallam, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735612443868">Jørgensen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735612443868">Sloboda, Davidson, Howe, &amp; Moore, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0305735612443868">Sosniak, 1990</xref>). These differences suggest that the quality of the practice undertaken is also important. The extent to which musicians enjoy practice may be an important determinant of how much is undertaken or, indeed, the extent to which musicians attempt to make their practice effective so that they can keep practice time to a minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735612443868">Chaffin, Imreh, &amp; Crawford, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735612443868">Hallam, 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735612443868">2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735612443868">2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735612443868">McPherson &amp; Davidson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Effective practice has been described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735612443868">Hallam (1997b)</xref> as ‘that which achieves the desired end-product, in as short a time as possible, without interfering negatively with longer-term goals’ (p. 181). In other words, effective practice is ‘what works’ in the short term without interfering with progression in the long term, for instance by creating undue muscular tension. The underlying assumption of this definition is that effective practice can take many forms and that each musician requires considerable meta-cognitive skills to know what is effective for them. ‘Deliberate practice’, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735612443868">Ericsson et al. (1993)</xref>, is conceptualized as goal-oriented, structured, and effortful, although motivation, resources, and attention are perceived as possibly acting to constrain its effectiveness. Also acknowledging the importance of practice being focused, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0305735612443868">Jørgensen (1995)</xref> proposes that musicians need to behave like teachers, taking account of their practice aims, the musical content, available learning media, allocation of time, and specific practice strategies.</p>
<p>Whatever the nature of the practice undertaken, time spent practising increases as expertise develops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735612443868">Hallam, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0305735612443868">Harnischmacher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735612443868">Sloboda et al., 1996</xref>). Focusing on the number of days when practice was undertaken each week, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735612443868">Sloboda et al. (1996)</xref> reported that novices and young people practised each day, although not all of the evidence supports this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735612443868">Hallam, 2011</xref>). It may be that the number of days when practice occurs does not increase as expertise develops, but the length of time of practice sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735612443868">Hallam, 2001a</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on the quality of practice has tended to focus on the strategies adopted. One strand of work has considered whether strategy use changes as levels of expertise increase. Studies with professional musicians have shown that typically they establish an overview and aural mental schemata of music to be learned by studying the score, playing the music, or learning from a live or recorded model. Difficult sections are identified based on the formal structure of the music, the most difficult parts being divided into smaller subdivisions. As practice progresses the sections are linked together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735612443868">Chaffin, Imreh, Lemieux, &amp; Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735612443868">Hallam, 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735612443868">1995b</xref>). Research on the practice of those studying music in higher education in conservatoires or universities has shown that they tend adopt similar strategies to professionals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735612443868">Dos Santos &amp; Gerling, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0305735612443868">Miksza, 2011</xref>), although they do not always implement them effectively (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0305735612443868">Nielsen, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0305735612443868">2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Key questions are whether similar strategies are adopted by those at lower levels of expertise and if strategy use changes as expertise develops. Some research has addressed this issue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735612443868">Gruson (1988)</xref> studied 43 pianists from novice to professional level and found that, as expertise developed, there was an increase in the repetition of sections, verbalizing and playing hands separately, while errors, repeating single notes and pauses decreased. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735612443868">Hallam (1997a)</xref>, studying 55 string players aged 6–18 ranging from beginner to post-grade 8 standard, identified six levels of practice. Initially there was much time wasting and work was incomplete; at the second level the music was played through with no corrections; at the third, single notes were corrected; at the fourth, the material was played through with short sections repeated en route; at the fifth the material was played through with large sections practised en route; while at the sixth level the material was played through initially, with difficult sections identified and worked on in isolation. The correlation between these levels and graded examination level was 0.69, suggesting enhanced strategy use as expertise developed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0305735612443868">McPherson and Renwick (2001)</xref> also found relatively ineffective practice in a longitudinal study of relative beginners undertaken over three years. Most practice time was spent playing through a piece with the children sometimes repeating a small section after an error. Some worked things out before playing. These studies suggest that strategy use does develop simultaneously with expertise. However, they have limitations in terms of sample size and instrument breadth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735612443868">Gruson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735612443868">Hallam, 1997a</xref>) and because of the length of the period of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0305735612443868">McPherson &amp; Renwick, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the difficulties that beginners and novices may experience is not having appropriate schemata against which to evaluate progress. If learners have not acquired an internalized representation of the sound of the music that they are trying to play, they have nothing against which to assess whether they are making errors. There is certainly evidence that this is the case. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735612443868">Hallam (1997a)</xref> found that 60% of beginners, novices and advanced students when learning a new piece left errors uncorrected. Once errors were made they tended to become permanent and were left uncorrected. Similar observations were made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0305735612443868">McPherson and Renwick (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0305735612443868">Pitts, Davidson, and McPherson (2000)</xref>. Only when students had considerable expertise and had well-developed schemata were errors consistently corrected. One possible strategy to support the development of relevant aural schemata is the use of recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0305735612443868">Puopolo, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0305735612443868">Zurcher, 1975</xref>) as this provides learners with the opportunity to acquire knowledge of the sounds that they are trying to recreate before practising. However, there is some evidence that recordings, even when available, are infrequently used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0305735612443868">Miksza, 2007</xref>) and even when they are used this is not always effective in enhancing performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735612443868">Anderson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0305735612443868">Linklater, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Musicians often have to learn to play passages at considerable speed. Initially, while ensuring that they are playing the correct notation, they may have to begin their practice playing the passage slowly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735612443868">Drake and Palmer (2000)</xref> observed three approaches adopted by students at different levels of expertise in learning to play fast passages. Beginners tended to stick to one tempo throughout practice sessions, novices increased tempo gradually until they reached a limit, while the most accomplished students gradually increased tempo over each practice session. These findings are supported by those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735612443868">Barry (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0305735612443868">Oura and Hatano (2001)</xref>. The adoption of these strategies is clearly important to support the development of high levels of expertise. The question is to what extent do they develop in young people playing a wide range of instruments across a broad range of expertise?</p>
<p>Another strand of research has explored whether the organization of practice contributes to its effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735612443868">Barry, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735612443868">DeNicola, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0305735612443868">Price, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0305735612443868">Santana, 1978</xref>). At the start of practice sessions many musicians carry out warm-up exercises, although there is considerable individual variation in the extent to which these are perceived to be necessary; this in part may relate to the instrument that they play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735612443868">Hallam, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0305735612443868">Jørgensen, 1998</xref>). Technical exercises often follow with repertory work left until last (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735612443868">Duke, Flowers, &amp; Wolfe, 1997</xref>). Highly expert young musicians focus on scales in morning practice sessions rather than those later in the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735612443868">Sloboda et al., 1996</xref>) suggesting that this may be an important strategy in developing high levels of expertise. They may do this because they treat scales as warm-up exercises, or they may believe that they will be better able to concentrate on technique in the morning. A distinction has also been made between formal (deliberate) and informal practice (playing favourite pieces by ear, messing about with music, improvising); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0305735612443868">McPherson &amp; McCormick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0305735612443868">Sloboda &amp; Davidson, 1996</xref>). High achievers tend to report more formal and informal practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0305735612443868">Sloboda &amp; Davidson, 1996</xref>) which may indicate higher levels of enjoyment of making music.</p>
<p>In order for practice to be focused, learners must concentrate. There is considerable evidence that some learners do not succeed in concentrating and engage in displacement activities, for instance setting up a music stand, maintaining the instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0305735612443868">McPherson &amp; Renwick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0305735612443868">Pitts et al, 2000a</xref>). Concentration may improve as expertise develops. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0305735612443868">McPherson and Renwick (2001)</xref> found that, over a period of three years, a higher percentage of practice time was focused on improving performance with less time spent in off-task activities. This may reflect an increase in meta-cognition, ‘knowledge concerning one’s own cognitive processes and products’ and ‘the active monitoring and consequent regulation and orchestration of these processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735612443868">Flavell, 1976</xref>, p. 232). These are activities with which professional musicians consistently engage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735612443868">Hallam (2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735612443868">2001b</xref>), requiring students to undertake a performance task within a limited space of time, explored the extent of implicit planning and found that those who exhibited high levels of planning completed the task, identified difficulties early on, concentrated their efforts on those difficulties and then integrated learned sections together. These strategies were adopted most frequently by students at higher levels of expertise.</p>
<p>Such activities have also been conceptualized as self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0305735612443868">McPherson &amp; Zimmerman, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0305735612443868">McPherson (1997)</xref>, working with 101 high school wind players, demonstrated that self-regulated musicians employed more sophisticated and musically appropriate strategies. Adopting a different perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735612443868">Cantwell and Millard (1994)</xref> studied six 14-year-old students and identified deep and surface approaches to learning music, the former involving learning in musical rather than technical terms. This led to a greater focus on understanding and subsequently enhanced learning outcomes. Perhaps the focus on musical outcomes sustained students’ interest. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735612443868">Duke, Cash, and Allen (2011)</xref> found that concentration on the sound produced led to more accurate performance than focus on the movements required for making the sounds.</p>
<p>Having well-defined aims for practice may support concentration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735612443868">Ericsson et al. (1993)</xref> concluded that having a clear goal for each practice session was important for learning to occur. However, the evidence suggests that novices and more accomplished students often fail to formulate goals for practice activities and mastering specific tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0305735612443868">Jørgensen, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Some research has focused on the direct relationship between strategy use and learning outcomes. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0305735612443868">Miksza (2011)</xref> investigated the relationships between observed practice behaviours consistent with conceptions of deliberate practice and the performance achievement of a specific piece of 55 college wind players. Participants completed a 23-minute practice session and were assessed on their performance pre- and post-practice. While there was some improvement in assessed performance this was very small, although there was more variability post-practice. Significant positive correlations were found between pre- and post-performance measures and repeating two to four bar chunks, whole-part-whole strategies, linking sections together and the use of the metronome. The relatively small changes in performance outcomes preclude firm conclusions about the extent to which strategy use assisted learners in the short practice period they were allocated to prepare the set piece, although the positive correlations with pre-practice performance suggest that strategy use was linked to overall levels of expertise.</p>
<p>In a study conducted over a 16-week period where graduate and undergraduate students prepared a short Brazilian piano piece without guidance from teachers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735612443868">Dos Santos and Gerling (2011)</xref> found that students exhibited different performance outcomes although they were similar in their levels of self-regulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735612443868">Hallam (2011)</xref>, researching school-aged students, similarly found no relationship between the practising strategies adopted and the quality of performance at particular levels of expertise.</p>
<p>It is clearly important to our understanding of the development of expertise to be able to establish the relationship between time spent practising, the adoption of particular practising strategies, the organization of practice, motivation to practise and the level of expertise and the quality of performance at that level of expertise. The study reported here aims to explore these relationships with a large sample of young people at different levels of expertise playing a wide range of instruments. The specific research questions are:</p>
<list id="list1-0305735612443868" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Does the amount of practice increase as expertise develops?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do practising strategies, organization of practice and levels of concentration of young people change as they become more expert?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do young people’s attitudes towards practising change as they become more expert and are these related to the amount of practice undertaken?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the adoption of effective practising strategies contribute to attaining high levels of expertise?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the adoption of effective practising strategies contribute to the quality of that expertise?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>On the basis of previous research we would expect that: the amount of practice will increase as expertise develops; that practising strategies, organization of practice and levels of concentration will change as learners become more expert; and that the adoption of effective practising strategies will contribute to attaining high levels of expertise and to the quality of that expertise.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>Previous research in this area has tended to adopt observation methods with practice being recorded using audio or video equipment. While this facilitates detailed analysis of real life events, it is time consuming. As a result sample sizes tend to be relatively limited in size. To address this issue the present study adopted a self-report questionnaire as a means of collecting data from a large sample of learners. Analysis of variance was used to analyze the data, with level of expertise as the independent variable and practice time and the outcomes of two factor analyses as the dependent variables. Multiple regression techniques were also adopted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0305735612443868">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>The questionnaire was devised based on the research evidence outlined earlier and a smaller scale prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735612443868">Hallam, 2011</xref>). The questionnaire sought information about the level of expertise attained (assessed by the highest examination grade achieved) and the quality of performance at that level of expertise (as measured by the mark obtained in the highest grade). In the United Kingdom (UK) there are several independent examination boards which offer graded instrumental examinations, usually from preliminary to grade 8. Typically, graded examinations assess candidates’ performance on pieces, scales, sight-reading, and aural tests, with some examination boards assessing technical exercises and improvisation tasks. These provide a convenient, widely recognized and impartial means of assessing level of expertise and, through the mark given, the quality of that expertise. Respondents were also asked to indicate the length of time they had spent learning to play an instrument and the number and length of practice sessions in a typical week. The questionnaire also included a range of statements relating to: the practising strategies adopted; the organization and management of practice; and motivation to practise. Respondents were requested to respond to these on a seven-point Likert scale with 7 indicating the strongest agreement and 1 the strongest disagreement. The questionnaire was piloted on a small group of young musicians to ensure that the statements were easy to understand. Their feedback indicated that no changes were required. The full questionnaire is included in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0305735612443868">Appendix 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Respondents</title>
<p>Data were collected by a team of researchers from young people playing all of the classical and popular musical instruments in a variety of settings, including two junior conservatoires, two local authority youth orchestras, two local authority Saturday music schools, a conservatoire for popular music, and three state comprehensive schools. The children who participated were receiving tuition on their instruments individually or in small groups of no more than four children. The organizations which the children were attending were approached and permission requested for questionnaires to be administered. Convenient times for the researchers to visit the organizations were negotiated.</p>
<p>A total of 3,325 children ranging in level of expertise from beginner through to grade 8 level (minimum required for conservatoire entrance in the UK) participated in the research. Of these, 2,027 (61%) were girls and 1,225 (37%) were boys, with some not indicating their sex. The instruments that they played were representative of the classical and popular instruments played in the UK. The greatest number played the violin (28%) followed by flute (10%), piano (10%), clarinet (10%), cello (8%), trumpet (6%), guitar (4%), viola (3%), voice (3%), saxophone (3%), French horn (3%), trombone (3%), oboe (2%), drums (2%), double bass (2%), percussion (1%), cornet (1%), tuba (1%), recorder (1%), bassoon (1%), harp (1%) with other instruments played by fewer than 1% of respondents. The grade levels of the respondents and their ages are set out in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735612443868">Table 1</xref>. The age range was from 6 to 19 years and the number of months learning from 1 to 172. The Pearson’s correlation between age and grade level was <italic>r</italic> = .618, (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), between the number of months learning and age .602 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) and grade .592 (<italic>p</italic> = .0001).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The research was designed taking account of the ethical guidelines of the British Psychological Society and the British Educational Research Association and was approved by the ethics committee of the Institute of Education, University of London. The organizations that the young people were attending were contacted and asked if they would be willing for the researchers to collect data from students. The young people themselves were told that they did not have to participate if they did not wish to do so and were assured that the data would remain confidential and that their parents and teachers would not have access to it.</p>
<p>The researchers administered the questionnaires to students in the various learning environments. The exact procedures for this varied depending on the environment. For instance, in schools the children completed the questionnaires during music lessons, while in the extra-curricular environments questionnaires were distributed and collected during break periods between musical activities.</p>

<title>Does the amount of practice increase as expertise develops?</title>
<p>Respondents were asked to indicate on the questionnaire the number of days that they practised each week and the length of time that they practised on each day. There was a significant effect of level of expertise on the number of days of practice, <italic>F</italic>(8,2865) = 12.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, and a statistically significant linear trend, <italic>F</italic>(1,2865) = 85.35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, indicating that, as expertise increased, the number of days in which practice was undertaken increased (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735612443868">Table 2</xref> for means and <italic>SD</italic>s of number of days when practice occurred). There was a significant effect of expertise on the amount of daily practice, <italic>F</italic>(8,2864) = 60.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, and a highly significant linear trend, <italic>F</italic>(1,2864) = 388.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, indicating that, as expertise increased, so did the amount of daily practice (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735612443868">Table 2</xref> for means, <italic>SD</italic>s, and minimum and maximum daily practice in minutes). The number of days when practice occurred and the reported amount of practice undertaken in each session was combined to create an overall measure of time spent practising each week. There was a significant effect of level of expertise on overall weekly practice, <italic>F</italic>(8,2856) = 54.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.0001, with a significant linear trend, <italic>F</italic>(8,2854) = 362.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, indicating that weekly practice increased as students became more expert (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0305735612443868">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Do practising strategies, levels of concentration and the organization of practice change as young people become more expert?</title>
<p>Multivariate analysis revealed that there was a highly significant effect of level of expertise on statements relating to practising and concentration, <italic>F</italic>(216,19784) = 6.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. This was followed up by analysis of variance for each item to explore whether there were linear trends. For almost all of the statements there was a statistically significant linear trend. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0305735612443868">Table 3</xref> sets out the mean responses to each statement by grade level. There were decreasing trends for statements relating to: practising pieces from beginning to end without stopping; working things out just by looking at the music and not playing; trying to find out what a piece sounds like before beginning to try to play it; analyzing the structure of a piece before learning to play it; when making a mistake going back to the beginning and starting again; making a list of what to practise; and setting targets for each practice session.</p>

<title>Factor analysis</title>
<p>To explore the relationships between the variables, factor analysis was undertaken. A principal components analysis was selected as it affords an empirical analysis of the data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0305735612443868">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). Eigenvalues were retained if they were greater than 1 and the scree plot was used to identify those factors before the breaking point of the elbow of the plot. A varimax rotation was used to enable interpretation and description of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0305735612443868">Green, Salkind, &amp; Akey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0305735612443868">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). Two checks were made to assess sampling adequacy, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test (checks whether the sample is large enough to carry out factor analysis) and an anti-matrix of covariances and correlations which showed that all elements on the diagonal of these matrices were greater than −.5, the necessary requirement. The KMO was 0.86, greater than the 0.5 required to assess the adequacy of the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735612443868">Field, 2000</xref>). Following examination of the scree plot, a seven-factor solution was deemed to be the most appropriate. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0305735612443868">Table 4</xref> sets out the weightings.

<p>This factor had an eigen value of 1.87 accounting for 6.9% of the variance. There were high loadings on only playing pieces from beginning to end without stopping when practising (.7); and going back to the beginning and starting again when making a mistake (.644). There was a smaller loading on working things out just by looking at the music and not playing (.451). This latter might be conceptualized as a useful strategy, for instance, in terms of mental rehearsal. However, in previous research it was consistently adopted by beginners who also tended to repeat the whole piece with no identification of difficult passages and returned to the beginning of a piece when a mistake was made. For this reason the factor was conceptualized as referring to ineffective practising strategies. This is supported by the negative loadings on identifying difficult sections (−.222); thinking about interpretation (−.266); marking things on the part (−302); and practising small sections (−.403).

<p>In addition to data on practising strategies and organization of practice, participants were asked to indicate their agreement to statements related to liking practice. The means for the statements relating to liking practice were 4.7 for ‘I like practising’ (range 4.9 to 4.4); 5.2 for ‘on some days I don’t want to practise’ (range 4.7 to 5.4); and 3.5 for ‘I find practice boring’ (range 3.3 to 3.9).

<p>A principal components factor analysis was undertaken with varimax rotation on the variables related to attitude towards practising.

<title>Does the adoption of effective practising strategies contribute to the quality of expertise?</title>
<p>Participants were asked to indicate their level of performance in their last graded examination. Because participants had taken different examination syllabuses it was not possible to use exact marks as outcome measures so performance was divided into the categories set by examination boards, fail, pass, commended and highly commended. Twenty four percent (624) of participants responding to this question had failed their last examination, 17% (437) had passed their most recent examination, 33% (834) had received a commendation, and 26% (671) had received a special commendation. A multiple regression analyses using examination outcome as the criterion variable revealed a Multiple <italic>R</italic> of .407 with an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of .156, <italic>F</italic>(10,856) = 16.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0305735612443868">Table 7</xref> sets out the beta weightings.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings from the research suggest that, as expertise develops, learners practise on more days and increase the amount of practice undertaken on those days. Those at the highest levels of expertise, on average, reported just over twice the amount of daily practice of beginners. However, even the most advanced players did not practise every day. There was also huge variation in the amount of practice reported at every level of expertise. This finding is consistent with previous research findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735612443868">Ericsson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735612443868">Sloboda et al. 1996</xref>). The increase in practice is not surprising as the higher grade examination requirements include more scales and technical exercises and longer pieces from the repertoire. The increased volume of material to be learned takes longer to practise, hence more practice time is needed.</p>
<p>Learners at higher levels of expertise reported adopting more effective practising strategies and perceived that they were more able to recognize errors. They also ceased to adopt the ineffective strategies of playing through entire pieces, returning to the beginning of a piece if they made a mistake, or correcting errors as they played through a piece. While these strategies may seem to be ineffective in the long term, it may be that in the initial stages of learning to play an instrument, where pieces are very short and tend to be of a similar level of difficulty throughout, they are appropriate. What may be problematic is that some learners are unable or unwilling to change their approach as the content of what they are learning becomes more complex and difficult. This is supported by what appears to be a dip in the adoption of effective strategy use at around grade 3. It may be that, as the repertoire becomes more challenging, some students cannot or are not sufficiently interested to adapt their practice strategies. These students may then give up playing. The increase in negative attitudes towards practice in these middle grades supports this. Further research taking account of drop outs would be needed for verification, although there is already evidence that those who drop out tend to practise less than those who continue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735612443868">Hallam, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735612443868">Sloboda et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>As expertise developed more use was made of the metronome and recordings to assist practice and listen to the performance of others, although beginners also reported listening to recordings more than those in the middle grades. This may reflect the fact that, increasingly, beginner tutor books have recorded materials which can be used to support practice. After this stage, recordings of music to be learned may not be available until learners are tackling the standard repertoire for the instrument. The increase in the use of mobile phones for recording may also have facilitated the ease of recording practice and performance and therefore made this strategy more accessible. This type of feedback may be particularly useful to learners as it is visual as well as aural.</p>
<p>There was no effect of level of expertise on the organization of practice. While it might have been expected that practice would become more organized with increasing levels of expertise, the data do not support this. Perhaps organization of practice relates more to personal preferences or other factors such as the instrument played, available repertoire, or constraints relating to where and when practice has to be undertaken.</p>
<p>The lack of increase in the adoption of analytic strategies is surprising. There may be individual differences in preferences for analytic or intuitive approaches to learning music which are unrelated to the level of expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735612443868">Hallam, 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0305735612443868">Lisboa, Williamon, Zicari, &amp; Eiholzer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0305735612443868">Nielsen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0305735612443868">Winold, Thelen, &amp; Ulrich, 1994</xref>). However, there is evidence that analytic approaches can support secure memorization processes which would indicate their necessity at higher levels of expertise as more complex works are learned which need to be performed from memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735612443868">Hallam, 1997c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735612443868">Chaffin et al., 2003</xref>). It may be that the young people in the research sample were not required to play from memory with sufficient regularity for the adoption of such strategies to be necessary.</p>
<p>There was no effect of level of expertise on ease of concentration. This may be an artefact of the self-report methodology. Self-reports regarding the extent to which one is able to concentrate while practising or be distracted may be particularly unreliable. Despite this the data raise some interesting questions. While there was no relationship between mean responses and level of expertise, the two statements to which participants responded had different standard deviations. There was a reduction in the standard deviation through the grade levels for responses to being distracted but not for ease of concentration. Further research might explore these differences as it likely that intensity of concentration is a key element in the amount of time needed to attain learning goals.</p>
<p>Attitudes to practice and level of expertise were not related, although as expertise increased there was an increase in not wanting to practise on some days. The data suggested that practice was enjoyed in the early stages of learning with less enthusiasm in the middle examination grades with enjoyment and commitment returning beyond this level. This requires more investigation. There was a small positive relationship between the amount of weekly practice and liking to practise. It is surprising that this relationship was not stronger. The extent of practice undertaken does not appear to be strongly related to enjoying practice. This raises the question of what motivates young people to practise. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of those participating in the study had failed their most recent examination. Despite this they had sustained sufficient motivation to continue playing. This requires further investigation.</p>
<p>The findings from the multiple regression using level of expertise as the criterion variable confirm earlier research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735612443868">Ericsson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735612443868">Hallam, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735612443868">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735612443868">Sloboda et al. 1996</xref>) demonstrating that the number of months of learning was the best predictor of the level of expertise attained. The adoption of a range of effective practising strategies was not a statistically significant predictor of level of expertise, with the exception of the use of recordings and a metronome. However, lack of ineffective practising strategies was a relatively strong predictor. It may be that, once ineffective strategies have been eliminated and a certain level of effectiveness has been achieved, there is a ceiling effect, and further improvement in practising strategies, of itself, does not contribute further to the development of expertise.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that number of months of learning was a significant predictor of the quality of performance at the level of expertise attained, although not all earlier research supports this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735612443868">Hallam, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0305735612443868">Williamon &amp; Valentine, 2000</xref>). The strongest predictor related to the lack of use of ineffective strategies. The use of effective strategies with the exception of making use of recordings and a metronome was not an important predictor. This may be because other factors play a more important role in the quality of performance at any level of expertise than those related to practice, although, interestingly, organization of practice did contribute to the prediction of the quality of expertise. It is possible that this relates to the role of scales and other technical exercises in many graded examinations. Organizing practice so that these technical elements are tackled at the start of practice may indicate a particular focus on them which contributes to gaining high marks.</p>
<p>There are limitations to this research as the data are based on self-report, although the statements relating to practice itself are based on research which has been previously verified with recordings or observational work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735612443868">Gruson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735612443868">Hallam, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735612443868">2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0305735612443868">McPherson, 2005</xref>; Pitts et al; 2000). There is evidence that learners tend to report adopting particular learning strategies before they actually implement them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735612443868">Flavell, 1976</xref>). This needs to be taken into account when interpreting the findings. Getting accurate data about the amount of time which is spent practising is also problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0305735612443868">Madsen, 2005</xref>). This remains the case for this study.</p>
<p>While the research has elucidated a number of issues it has also raised further questions. First, we need to know more about how the organization of practice contributes to the quality of expertise at any particular level and the nature of the use of the metronome and recordings in practice which contribute to the level and quality of expertise. Second, the data indicated that the young people did not unreservedly enjoy practising. There were higher levels of enjoyment during the beginner stages and at the higher grade levels. This needs further investigation, as does why some learners continue to play an instrument to relatively high levels of expertise when practice is perceived as not particularly enjoyable. Although there is some research which follows up on those who drop out, this has largely been post-hoc. A large-scale study which collected data relating to practising and motivational factors and was then able to follow up those who dropped out would be useful in this respect. Related to this is the issue of those who had failed their previous graded examination and yet had continued to learn to play an instrument. Theories of motivation would generally predict that failure of this kind, relating to a voluntary activity, would lead to drop out. Clearly for many of these learners that was not the case.</p>
<sec id="section22-0305735612443868">
<title>Implications for education</title>
<p>The findings show that beginners learning to play an instrument tend to play through the music that they are required to learn. Initially, this may be an effective strategy as pieces tend to be short and of similar difficulty throughout. However, the evidence from this research suggests that, at middling levels of expertise, some learners may not be able to make the transition to the strategies required to learn the more difficult repertoire needed for further progression. Clearly they need support from teachers to enable them to work more effectively. Earlier research has shown that teachers often believe that they are teaching their pupils how to practise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735612443868">Barry &amp; McArthur, 1994</xref>) while students report that this is not the case to any great extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0305735612443868">Jørgensen, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0305735612443868">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0305735612443868">Schatt, 2011</xref>). Indeed, there is considerable evidence that even those studying at higher education music conservatoires do not always adopt very effective practising strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735612443868">Austin &amp; Berg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0305735612443868">Miksza, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0305735612443868">Nielsen, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0305735612443868">2001</xref>). This is despite the evidence that students can be taught to adopt meta-cognitive strategies effectively during practice and that this leads to enhanced performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735612443868">Bathgate, Sims-Knight, &amp; Schunn, 2011</xref>). Clearly teachers need to focus more on this issue, particularly as practising for very long periods of time can lead to physical injuries and ruin promising musical careers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0305735612443868">Williamon, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>How might teachers support learners in becoming more effective in their practice? They can model effective practising in lessons, providing guidance as to how to identify difficult passages, subsequently modelling strategies as to how the difficulties might be tackled. This has the added advantage of encouraging analysis of pieces to be learned which can be extended as repertoire becomes more complex to include issues relating to structure and interpretation. These activities will need to be carried out by the teacher over a sustained period of time to be effective. This will require a change in pedagogy as there is considerable evidence that modelling does not constitute a major element in many instrumental lessons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735612443868">Kennell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0305735612443868">Kostka, 1984</xref>) despite the fact that it has been demonstrated to be very effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0305735612443868">Dickey, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735612443868">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735612443868">Goolsby, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Teachers can assess whether learners are engaging with these processes during lessons. For instance, when new repertoire is being introduced learners can be asked to identify difficult passages and demonstrate how they would go about practising them. As repertoire is being mastered, ongoing technical challenges can be dissected, discussed and appropriate practising strategies developed. This will mean the learner taking an active rather than passive role. The evidence to date suggests that this is not usually the case, with teacher talk and student performance typically taking up most lesson time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735612443868">Kennell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0305735612443868">Kostka, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Technological developments in recent years, particularly recording facilities on mobile phones, have made recording performance and practice much simpler. Most young people can easily record practice and performances. These recordings can be used in lessons to discuss how practice and performance can be improved. This has been shown to be an effective way of improving practising strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0305735612443868">Nielsen, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0305735612443868">2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The feedback that teachers give, whether in response to recordings or playing in lessons, is crucial for improving the quality of learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735612443868">Colprit, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735612443868">Duke &amp; Henninger, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735612443868">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735612443868">Hallam, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0305735612443868">Kennell, 2002</xref>). Even when learners can meet technical requirements unaided, they frequently do not have the vision or knowledge to fulfil their potential musically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735612443868">Dos Santos &amp; Gerling, 2011</xref>). Learners need expert guidance in developing a secure technique, ensuring that the quality of the sound produced is pleasing and playing musically. Teachers need to be able to provide feedback in a constructive supportive way which does not negatively impact on motivation, particularly in the early stages of learning when the learner may have not acquired a strong identity as a musician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0305735612443868">Sloboda &amp; Howe, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0305735612443868">Sosniak, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>If learners are to achieve high marks in those graded examinations which include considerable technical requirements (e.g., scales, exercises), teachers need to find ways to encourage greater organization of practice so that these are addressed early in practice sessions. Modelling this in lessons may help in this respect. However, teachers need to take account of the aims and aspirations of their students in developing appropriate curricula. It may be that some students would prefer to focus on learning repertoire rather than taking examinations with high levels of technical requirements. There is certainly evidence that motivation is greater when learners have choice about what they learn and how they learn it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0305735612443868">Renwick &amp; McPherson, 2002</xref>). Given that most young people taking instrumental lessons will continue with music for recreational purposes rather than to pursue a career as a professional musician, this is important. Sustaining motivation in learners is one of the most important tasks facing the teacher and, crucially, ensuring that they develop a love of music which will sustain their interest in the long term.</p>
