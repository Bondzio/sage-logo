<abstract>
<p>Retinal atrophy is well known in adult-onset multiple sclerosis but remains unexplored in children. We aimed to determine retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume in pediatric patients, with and without optic neuritis and their relations with visual evoked potentials. We also examined macular volume changes at month 12. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness of all quadrants and macular volume were measured in 28 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis eyes and 30 control eyes using optical coherence tomography and were found reduced in patients compared with controls. This reduction was more prominent in eyes with longer time interval from optic neuritis. Retinal nerve fiber thickness was lower in eyes with delayed visual evoked potentials. Visual evoked potential amplitudes were reduced in affected eyes compared to patients without optic neuritis. Macular volume reduced nonsignificantly in patients at month 12. Retinal atrophy occurs in pediatric multiple sclerosis, and previous optic neuritis accelerates this atrophy.</p>

<body>
<p>Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated inflammatory, demyelinating, and degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Although the hallmark of the process is demyelination, destruction of axons has also been observed, at least in part independent of demyelinating activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812447683">1</xref></sup> Pathologically, axonal loss has been demonstrated within both inflammatory lesions and normal-appearing white matter in brain and spinal cord.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812447683">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812447683"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812447683">4</xref></sup> The persistent disability experienced by patients with multiple sclerosis is thought to be attributed to axonal degeneration secondary to inflammation and demyelination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812447683">2</xref></sup> Axonal loss can be monitored in vivo by measuring brain, spinal cord, or optic nerve atrophy with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); however, this may be subject to confounding by myelin loss and other tissue changes such as inflammation or gliosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812447683">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812447683"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812447683">7</xref></sup> So there remains a need for more specific measures of axonal damage and neuronal loss in multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>The visual pathways are frequently affected in multiple sclerosis even in patients without visual disturbances. Retinal nerve fiber layer is composed solely of unmyelinated axons of the ganglion cells. Investigation of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in vivo thus provides a means for detecting axonal damage in the anterior visual pathway. Optical coherence tomography, which has long been used in ophthalmology for other diseases such as glaucoma, is a reliable noninvasive, simple-to-use technique for measuring macular volume and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812447683">8</xref></sup> Recent studies have shown that optical coherence tomography could detect retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, possibly because of axonal damage, within the retinas of patients with multiple sclerosis regardless of clinical history of optic neuritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447683">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812447683"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812447683">11</xref></sup> In fact, the determination of total macular volume has been suggested as a marker for neuronal loss in multiple sclerosis patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812447683">12</xref></sup> A correlation between reduction of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and both MRI documented brain atrophy and level of disability measured by the Kurtzke’s Expanded Disability Status Scale score has been reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812447683">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812447683"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812447683">15</xref></sup> However the earliest time to detectable retinal nerve fiber layer loss in multiple sclerosis has not yet been established.</p>
<p>Different from optical coherence tomography which evaluates structural integrity of the retinal tissue through high-resolution images, visual evoked potentials record the functional integrity of the anterior visual pathway. The magnitude of the visual evoked potentials depends on the functional afferent fibers reaching the striate cortex. After an acute episode of optic neuritis, latencies of visual evoked potential are usually prolonged and the abnormality may persist for many years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812447683">16</xref></sup> Previous studies reported the association between retinal nerve fiber layer atrophy measured with optical coherence tomography and abnormal visual evoked potentials in patients with optic neuritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812447683">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Pediatric multiple sclerosis is essentially the same disease as adult-onset counterpart, although some differences including clinic, radiologic, or possible pathologic aspects may occur. In this study, we evaluated whether axonal loss was present early in pediatric multiple sclerosis patients by measuring the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume in patients and healthy controls. We also examined the influence of previous optic neuritis attacks on these measures. Then we sought to examine whether retinal atrophy was more significant in the eyes with abnormal visual evoked potential recordings. We finally examined if there were any changes in macular volume after 1-year follow-up in pediatric multiple sclerosis patients.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Fourteen pediatric patients (13 girls and 1 boy) with the diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis were recruited from the pediatric neurology clinic of Gazi University Medical Faculty. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of The National Health Ministry. All study subjects provided informed consent. All patients were diagnosed before 18 years of age by using revised McDonald criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812447683">18</xref></sup> The diagnosis of optic neuritis was based on clinical findings including the presence of decreased visual acuity, visual field defect, color vision loss, relative afferent pupil defect, and a compatible fundus examination. The eyes of patients were grouped as eyes of patients without previous optic neuritis, and affected and unaffected eyes of patients with previous optic neuritis. The mean time interval from clinical optic neuritis attacks to optical coherence tomography testing was 11 ± 9 months (range, 3-32 months). Patients with the diagnosis of clinical isolated syndrome, primary progressive multiple sclerosis, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, any coexisting ocular disease and high disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale scores &gt; 4) were excluded. The control group consisted of 15 healthy volunteers with similar age and sex distribution and without known ophthalmologic or neurologic disorders.</p>
<p>Subjects included in the study were evaluated at baseline and every 3 months thereafter and when there were clinical relapses. Complete neurologic and ophthalmologic examination including acuity testing using Snellen chart, direct ophthalmoscopic examination and Expanded Disability Status Scale scoring, complete blood count, and liver function tests in the patients treated with interferon-β were performed in each visit. During the 1-year follow-up period, 8 patients had 1 and 1 patient had 2 clinical attacks requiring intravenous methylprednisolone. No patient had optic neuritis attack during this time. All optical coherence tomography and visual evoked potential studies were performed at least 1 month after a demyelinating event and 1 month after discontinuation of corticosteroids. At the time of study, 8 patients were being treated with interferon-β with 3 different interferon-β preparations (4 patients with interferon-β1a 22 μg 3 times a week, 2 patients with interferon-β1a 30 μg once a week and 2 patients with interferon-β1b 0.3 mg 3 times a week). Only 1 patient was receiving treatment for 2 years; in others, interferon-β therapy was started within the past 6 months (range, 1-6 months) from the time of first optical coherence tomography testing. Because the duration of treatment was very short, we did not consider it as a confounding factor for the study. Remaining 6 patients refused interferon-β treatment.</p>
<p>Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume measurement with optical coherence tomography and the recording of visual evoked potential latencies and amplitudes have been performed cross-sectionally in all patients and controls. We have made comparisons of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume between eyes of all patients and controls as well as between eyes of patients without a history of optic neuritis, affected and unaffected fellow eyes of patients with previous optic neuritis and controls, and lastly between patients with and without abnormal visual evoked potentials. We additionally measured macular volume at month 12 in 13 patients and compared the change with baseline values. One of the 14 patients has not completed second macular volume testing.</p>
<p>All optical coherence tomography examinations were carried out on a time domain optical coherence tomography (Stratus OCT Model 3000 and OCT 4.0 software; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California) by an experienced ophthalmologist blind to the results of other studies of patients. Macular volume was measured in each eye by means of 6 radial scans centered on the fovea to compose a macular thickness/volume map. Average and quadrant (temporal, superior, inferior, and nasal) retinal nerve fiber layer thickness were measured for each eye using Fast Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness Protocol without pupil dilation.</p>
<p>Visual evoked potentials were recorded monocularly in a dark room after occlusion of the other eye and were elicited by 1.3 Hz pattern reversal of a 50% contrast black-and-white checkerboard at a viewing distance of 70 cm. Latency and peak-to-peak amplitude were recorded for the P100 wave. At least 2 records of the P100 wave were obtained and the average value was calculated. P100 latencies and amplitudes were determined in milliseconds (ms) and microvolts (µV), respectively, and also on a normal–abnormal scale according to whether main components were absent or latencies exceeded the mean of our laboratory control values by 2.5 standard deviation (&gt;119 ms).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 16.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) was used for all statistical analysis. The results of all descriptive analyses were reported as a mean ± standard error for the group. Conformity for normal distribution of quantitative data was performed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. For statistical analysis, nonparametric tests were applied. For evaluations of categorical data, independent groups, and dependent groups, χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812447683">2</xref></sup> test, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, and Wilcoxon test were used respectively. All tests were classified as significant if the <italic>P</italic> value was &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 14 children, 13 (92%) girls and 1 (7%) boy, were included in the study between January 2009 and December 2010. The mean disease duration was 3.5 years. The baseline characteristics of patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812447683">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Of the patients studied, 9 (64%) had experienced a previous episode of optic neuritis, 4 in the left eye, 3 in the right eye, and 2 bilaterally, enabling us to analyze 11 optic neuritis eyes. Thus, we analyzed 28 multiple sclerosis eyes: 10 eyes of patients without previous optic neuritis, 11 affected eyes of patients with previous optic neuritis, and 7 unaffected eyes of patients with previous optic neuritis. Of the 11 optic neuritis eyes, 2 eyes had visual impairment (defined as a visual acuity less than 20/40). The mean time interval from clinical optic neuritis to optical coherence tomography testing was 13.1 ± 8.7 months (range, 3-32 months). This interval was between 3 and 6 months for 3 and between 6 and 12 months for 2 clinical optic neuritis attacks.</p>
<p>When all multiple sclerosis patients were analyzed as a single group and compared with control values, there were significant reductions in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (mean 82.5 ± 18.5 µm in patients; 98.0 ± 19.2 µm in healthy controls, <italic>P</italic> = .002) and macular volume (mean 6.49 ± 0.49 mm<sup>3</sup> in patients; 6.91 ± 0.73 mm<sup>3</sup> in healthy controls, <italic>P</italic> = .013). Retinal nerve fiber layer thinning was significant in the nasal (65.6 ± 26.1 µm, <italic>P</italic> = .012), temporal (58.3 ± 17.8 µm, <italic>P</italic> = .002), and superior (99.8 ± 22.7 µm, <italic>P</italic> = .013) quadrants and not significant in the inferior (104.3 ± 28.4 µm, <italic>P</italic> = .094) quadrant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0883073812447683">Table 3</xref>).</p>

Mean retinal nerve fiber length thickness was reduced significantly in eyes of patients without optic neuritis (<italic>P</italic> = .016) and affected eyes of patients with optic neuritis (<italic>P</italic> = .034), and nonsignificantly in unaffected eyes of patients with optic neuritis (<italic>P</italic> = .063) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0883073812447683">Table 4</xref>). Macular volume showed a decreasing trend and was nonsignificantly lower in eyes without optic neuritis, and in unaffected and affected eyes of patients with optic neuritis compared with controls. When we stratified the eyes with optic neuritis into eyes with time interval from optic neuritis longer than 6 and 12 months, mean and all 4 quadrants’ retinal nerve fiber length thickness and macular volume were found to be decreased significantly in eyes with time interval from clinical optic neuritis longer than 6 months (mean retinal nerve fiber length <italic>P</italic> = .022, macular volume <italic>P</italic> = .008) and showed a more marked decrease in eyes with time interval from clinical optic neuritis longer than 12 months as compared with controls (for mean retinal nerve fiber length thickness, <italic>P</italic> = .004, and for macular volume, <italic>P</italic> = .001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0883073812447683">Table 4</xref>). Expanded Disability Scoring Scale scores were also higher in patients with longer time interval from clinical optic neuritis, although not significant (mean, 2.00 ± 1.38 in patients with time interval from optic neuritis &gt;6 months and 2.41 ± 1.35 in patients with time interval from optic neuritis &gt;12 months) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073812447683">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Axonal loss is considered to be a key prognostic factor contributing to disability in multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812447683">19</xref></sup> However, there are still no direct measures of axonal loss in clinical practice. As a possible indicator of axonal loss, retinal atrophy is relatively well known in adult-onset multiple sclerosis. The anterior visual system is frequently affected and a measurable axonal loss is well documented even in clinically unaffected multiple sclerosis eyes despite the absence of visual symptoms on conventional visual acuity testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812447683">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812447683">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Studies of adult-onset multiple sclerosis cohorts detected reduced retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measures in the eyes with and without optic neuritis when compared with controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812447683">17</xref></sup> Other studies that compared clinically unaffected eyes with healthy controls have revealed significant reductions in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, although these reductions were not as much as those of the affected eyes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812447683">10</xref></sup> Similarly, a difference in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness between optic neuritis–affected eyes and controls as well as between optic neuritis–affected and unaffected eyes has been reported; however, no difference was detected between optic neuritis–unaffected eyes and controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073812447683">20</xref></sup> Retinal nerve fiber layer thinning has been reported even in patients with optic neuritis as a clinically isolated syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812447683">11</xref></sup> But little is known about the retinal involvement in the eyes of pediatric multiple sclerosis patients. Recently, a significant retinal atrophy was reported in the pediatric population with demyelinating diseases of central nervous system such as optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis, and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, by measuring retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume with optical coherence tomography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073812447683">21</xref></sup> In these patients, retinal atrophy was found to be more prominent in patients with previous optic neuritis.</p>
<p>In the present study, we observed in accordance with previous reports on adult-onset multiple sclerosis patients that retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume were significantly reduced in the eyes of patients with childhood-onset relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis compared with healthy controls. This has suggested that axonal damage could occur in early stages of multiple sclerosis eyes. Unlike that in most studies of adult cohorts, retinal atrophy was not more significant in the subgroups of multiple sclerosis eyes with and without previous optic neuritis than healthy controls, although we observed a decreasing trend of mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume in the affected eyes of patients with previous optic neuritis. The small sample size of our relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis eyes with and without optic neuritis cohorts likely obscured our ability to show mean retinal nerve fiber layer and macular volume reductions in these groups. However, when we excluded the eyes with time interval from clinical optic neuritis less than 6 months in analysis, retinal thinning was observed to be greater in eyes with previous optic neuritis than in eyes of controls. When we included only patients with time interval from clinical optic neuritis longer than 12 months, both all-quadrant retinal nerve fiber layer and macular volume was found to be more markedly reduced in optic neuritis–affected eyes. Previously, in 38 adult patients with newly diagnosed single episodes of optic neuritis, it has been shown that retinal nerve fiber layer thinning occurs mostly between months 3 and 6 in 85% of patients when sequentially evaluated with optical coherence tomography within the first month and at 3-month intervals for a period of 1 year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812447683">11</xref></sup> The same group showed that retinal nerve fiber layer thinning stabilized from 7 to 12 months after acute optic neuritis and did not show any additional thinning between the first and the second year after onset in 35 patients with isolated optic neuritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073812447683">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073812447683">23</xref></sup> In accordance with these reports, we also observed the most significant retinal thinning in patients with time interval from clinical optic neuritis more than 12 months compared with eyes of healthy controls.</p>
<p>Because the macula consists of mostly ganglion cell bodies, assessment of macular volume determines whether axonal loss measured by the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness is associated with neuronal degeneration. Although retinal nerve fiber layer thickness reduced significantly in the eyes of patients without previous optic neuritis history and affected eyes of patients with optic neuritis in the present study, macular volume showed significant reductions only in patients with time interval from clinical optic neuritis more than 6 and 12 months. These results suggest that reduction in macular volume (and possibly retinal ganglion cell loss) tends to occur in optic neuritis–affected eyes and increases over time with disease progression and thus may follow retinal nerve fiber layer thinning. In this context, our study supports the hypothesis that retinal ganglion cell death may not be the primary event but more likely develops secondary to myelin and axonal damage in the optic nerve.</p>
<p>Retinal nerve fiber layer thinning determined with conventional optical coherence tomography findings correlate with clinical and electrophysiological measures of visual function and with disease activity and disability in certain subgroups of patients with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073812447683">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073812447683"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073812447683">26</xref></sup> Significant relations among retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and visual evoked potential amplitude have been reported in the adult population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073812447683">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073812447683">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073812447683">27</xref></sup> On the contrary, there are other studies reporting no relationship between retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and visual evoked potential recordings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812447683">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073812447683">28</xref></sup> In the present study, we observed that visual evoked potential amplitudes were significantly decreased in the affected eyes of patients with previous optic neuritis as compared to the eyes of patients without optic neuritis, but there were no differences between affected and unaffected eyes of patients with previous optic neuritis. We also observed that mean retinal nerve fiber layer thicknesses were found to be reduced in eyes with delayed visual evoked potential latency. However, macular volume was not different between eyes of patients without previous optic neuritis and unaffected or affected eyes of patients with previous optic neuritis. This finding also supports the notion that the primary event in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis is mainly demyelination and secondary axonal damage, eventually causing retrograde neuronal loss.</p>
<p>It is well known that Expanded Disability Scoring Scale score as a clinical measure of disease severity correlates with retinal atrophy measured with optical coherence tomography testing of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume in adult population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812447683">14</xref></sup> We also observed that Expanded Disability Scoring Scale score was highest (though not significant) in patients with time interval from optic neuritis longer than 12 months, whose eyes showed the most significant retinal atrophy. This finding suggests that more disabled patients may have a reduced retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume on optical coherence tomography in pediatric multiple sclerosis as in adult counterparts.</p>
<p>Results of the longitudinal part of the study demonstrated that macular volume was reduced nonsignificantly in eyes of all multiple sclerosis patients after a 1-year follow-up period. The small sample size of our relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis eyes with and without optic neuritis cohorts and the short duration of follow-up likely obscured our results to show statistically significant macular volume reductions in these groups after 1 year. These findings suggest that there is continuous axonal damage leading to secondary retinal ganglion cell loss in the anterior visual pathways in pediatric multiple sclerosis. Previously, mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness loss of 4.8 µm over 2 years has been reported in a predominantly relapsing cohort of 61 adult patients with multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812447683">14</xref></sup> Similarly, in the adult population, retinal thickness decreases continuously in all multiple sclerosis patients with or without previous optic neuritis and in optic neuritis affected or unaffected eyes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073812447683">29</xref></sup> However, a more recent study reported no significant change in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness over 2 years in 39 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and 7 patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073812447683">23</xref></sup> In the early stage of the disease and relatively short period of time, we observed a decrease in macular volume values; it was not statistically significant, however. So there remains a need for prospective studies with larger cohorts and longer periods to establish the ongoing changes of the retinal tissue in pediatric multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Limitations of our study include the relatively small sample size and short duration of follow-up, though to our knowledge this is one of the largest cohorts of a single center in our country. We did not compare macular volume changes of patients and controls over 1 year because of the lack of second measurement of macular volume in the control group. So we cannot suggest that the macular volume loss is more significant in children with multiple sclerosis than in controls. Although we have observed some relations between retinal atrophy and disease burden as measured using the Expanded Disability Scoring Scale, we did not correlate the results with MRI volume evaluations.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume significantly decrease in pediatric multiple sclerosis, and this reduction increases markedly in eyes with longer time interval from clinical optic neuritis. Macular volume continuously decreases in the eyes of pediatric multiple sclerosis patients during the early stages of the disease. These findings suggest that neurodegeneration becomes apparent at the very early stage of multiple sclerosis, and this neuronal loss possibly develops secondary to demyelination. Optical coherence tomography is a promising tool to detect subclinical changes in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular volume in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis and should be examined in patients as a potential biomarker of retinal pathology and neurodegeneration.</p>
