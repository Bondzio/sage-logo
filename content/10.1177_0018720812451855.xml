<title>Objective:</title>
<p>With the assumption that circadian rhythms influence human performance, the work of live line electricians was reorganized and evaluated. The hypothesis was that in highly physical and attention-demanding work, the organization of tasks, according to the ideal period of day and day of week, should diminish stress and consequent work risks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0018720812451855">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>There are only a few studies reporting the work of electricians and even fewer approaching work organization. Moreover, these investigations often do not consider human physiological limitations and capabilities as well as task demands.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0018720812451855">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>A new work system was proposed with consideration of (a) the circadian cycles and homeostatic processes; (b) the effect of heat, which is a <italic>zeitgeber</italic> (synchronizer) for the biological clocks; and (c) the degree of physical and mental demands of the different performed tasks, which was assessed on the basis of opinions of the electricians and physiological markers of stress that are controlled by circadian rhythms. The traditional and new systems were compared on the basis of two cognitive indices (the arrangement of matchsticks and the perception of a minute) and three physiological markers of mental-to-physical loads (heart frequency and the level of adrenaline and noradrenaline).</p>

<sec id="section4-0018720812451855">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Both physical and mental loads were reduced in the new system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The few ergonomics studies on the work of grid electricians point to the adverse conditions of excessive cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812451855">Paivnen, 2006</xref>), heat, and high level of both physical and mental load, generating stress, fatigue, pain, musculoskeletal disorders risk, and in the final instance, death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812451855">Guimarães, Fisher, Faé, Salis, &amp; Santos, 2002</xref>), mainly in emergency situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812451855">Figueiredo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812451855">Lima, Gomes, &amp; Melo, 2002</xref>), when the work conditions are more critical. Statistics on accident rates are not fully available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812451855">Paivnen, 2006</xref>), but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812451855">Buriol, Rozendo, Geus, Scheer, and Felsky (2009)</xref> estimated the direct cost of accidents in a Brazilian company to be approximately US$1,750,000 in 8 months. The handbook developed by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812451855">Electric Power Research Institute (2001)</xref> has ergonomic recommendations for tasks with moderate to high risk for musculoskeletal disorders.</p>
<p>Most often, the operation center programs the supply of electric energy services without consideration of the incompatibility between work demands and workers’ capabilities, and the team renders this service without question, despite the fact that the different tasks performed in a journey are not necessarily sequential. However, besides the load imposed by the work conditions, human performance and consequent workload and stress levels are also influenced by circadian rhythms (oscillations in biochemical, physiological, and behavioral cycles of approximately 24 hr). Humans have different endogenous circadian pacemakers that interact with homeostatic processes (e.g., amount of hours since awake until the maximum alertness; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812451855">Monk et al., 1997</xref>), which end up defining whether a task would be best performed in the morning, afternoon, or evening (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812451855">Carrier &amp; Monk, 2000</xref>). Most people are prone to a postlunch dip (between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m.) even if no food is ingested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812451855">Monk, Buysse, Reynolds, &amp; Kupfer, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Daily productivity curves show an increase from the beginning of the journey until around 11:00 a.m. and declines in the afternoon. After lunch, the maximum point of the productivity curve is inferior compared to the point before lunch, decreasing with time until the end of the journey. The weekly curve shows a low productivity on Monday, getting highest on Tuesday and declining toward the end of the week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812451855">Parker &amp; Oglesby, 1972</xref>), which is expected since workers tend to accumulate fatigue.</p>
<p>Considering that human performance ability fluctuates during the day, and assuming that there is no reason for not designing work according to human predisposition, we hypothesize that the organization of tasks that includes consideration of the preparedness for action should diminish stress and the consequent work risks. A proposal for scheduling service calls by a team of live line electricians was developed, prototyped, and validated in a Brazilian company (CEEE), where most tasks are independent of each other and approximately 95% of the services are not emergencies.</p>

<sec id="section8-0018720812451855">
<title>The Work of the Live Line Electricians in the Company Studied</title>
<p>CEEE employs 10 men for live line operations for energy distribution in the city of Porto Alegre. The work consists of preventive and corrective maintenance of the network and its substations with grids energized at 13.8 kV or 22.4 kV.</p>
<p>Work generally begins with the arrival of the electricians at 7:45 a.m. at the CEEE’s headquarters, at which the allocation is made of the services to be performed that day and the route to be followed. The electricians usually work 8 hr a day (plus 1 hr for lunch break) in the open air except on rainy or very humid (&gt;70%) days, when operations are not permitted on the energized grid, in which case they work at headquarters. There is a roster for services on the weekend. Depending on the type of task and the local conditions, the electricians perform two to four tasks in a day, which are mostly independent; when they finish one task, they start a new one (sometimes in another site).</p>
<p>The 10 electricians work in teams of 4 to 6, depending on the work demand and/or workers’ availability. In a five-worker team, two workers stay on the ground to operate the truck for maneuvering the insulated baskets that access the grids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812451855">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812451855">2</xref>) at a height between 9 m and 11 m and to prepare equipment, assemble components, and handle loads. The work on the ground is often more dynamic than that of the two workers in the confined baskets, which involves mainly the arms, and increases heart rate and blood pressure. The insulated clothing necessary to deal with the energized grids makes movements more difficult, increases the body heat, and impairs sweating, adding to discomfort. The fifth worker, the most experienced one, is responsible for the work management and safety procedures.</p>

<title>Developing a Proposal for Reorganizing the Team’s Live Line Work</title>
<p>The proposal for work re-organization was performed on the following procedures:</p>
<p>(a) In a meeting, 20 electricians (from three cities, with expertise on live line operation varying from 0.5 to 15 years) estimated the physical and mental effort of normal tasks (as exemplified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812451855">Table 1</xref>) with a view to fitting each one into categories termed as light, medium, or heavy. In addition, three researchers acted as facilitators at this meeting, which was also attended by a safety specialist and a safety engineer from CEEE. Physical stress increases from light to heavy in accordance to the weight and level of difficulty in handling tools and components to perform the task. Mental stress increases from light to heavy depending on the level of contact with the energized conductors, the levels of difficulty and accuracy of the movements involved, and how many people (i.e., dead line electricians working in the same area, citizens) will be affected by the service if it is not done in the prescribed time.</p>

<p>(b) Thereafter, the electricians proposed a distribution of the different types of tasks (as classified in the first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812451855">Table 1</xref>) throughout the day (as set in the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812451855">Table 1</xref>) and on each day of the week, on the basis of the following guidelines: Tasks with a predominantly mental demand should be allocated to the late morning and afternoon shift; tasks with a predominantly physical demand should be allocated to the morning when heart rate responses to exercise are at a minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812451855">Atkinson &amp; Reilly, 1996</xref>) and the effect of heat is lower; both mental and physical loads should be higher on Mondays, Tuesdays (primarily), and Wednesdays, decreasing until Fridays; at the end of each day, time should be set aside for planning the work for the next day, besides sorting and organizing the materials and equipment needed. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812451855">Table 2</xref> shows a general distribution of tasks as grouped (from A to E) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812451855">Table 1</xref>. Site activities are expected to start after 8:30 a.m. because in the early morning, the workers are in transit from the headquarters to the first assigned site. Given the midafternoon dip, the lighter tasks (Groups B and C) were also scheduled for the period between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m. in all days of the week.</p>

<title>Implementing and Evaluating the Proposal for the Team’s Live Line Work Reorganization</title>
<sec id="section11-0018720812451855">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The 5 electricians, all male and with at least 2 years of experience in dead line, were Worker 1 (the team’s driver, 45 years old, 2.5 years of experience in the company, smoker), Worker 2 (30 years old, 1.5 years of experience, smoker), Worker 3 (30 years old, 2.5 years of experience, smoker), Worker 4 (25 years old, 2.5 years of experience), and Worker 5 (the team’s leader, 47 years old, 9 years of experience, smoker). None of the workers was on medication during the 2 weeks (i.e., they were using neither prescribed nor over-the-counter nor recreational drugs), and all of them ate the same type of food (and roughly the same amount of food and type of soft drink) and at the same place during the lunch break. It was not possible to follow up the type of meal ingested at home. The workers do not ingest alcohol because they have to work sober, and they do not smoke on the site.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0018720812451855">
<title>Materials and procedure</title>
<p>The company agreed to a pre- and postintervention study with a team composed by 5 electricians. Therefore, all resources (i.e., researches, equipment, tests) were used in only one team across 2 consecutive weeks when no special event was noticed besides the intervention itself. Temperature was about the same, no rain was observed, and volume and nature of tasks was also about the same. In the 1st week (Week 1), the team worked normally, as scheduled by the operation center, and in the 2nd week (Week 2), the team worked in the “ergonomic” way, with tasks having been scheduled in accordance with the level of mental and physical demand, time of day, and day of week. All the participants signed an informed consent form. The research team (one to three researchers in industrial engineering and one undergraduate student) and the safety specialist from CEEE were present full-time together with the electricians during the 2 weeks of the experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0018720812451855">
<title>Indices used to assess the impacts of the work reorganization</title>
<p>Subjective evaluation of workload, such as the NASA Task Load Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812451855">Hart &amp; Staveland, 1988</xref>) technique, is often used to evaluate how workers perceive the workload of a given task. However, as suggested by Hart and Staveland, people are unlikely to remember experiences sufficiently well, making absolute judgments of workload or even relative measures for different tasks difficult. Therefore, because of the need to obtain a more accurate result when comparing the two conditions in a short period of time (2 weeks), we prioritized the evaluation of the physiological level of stress (by the heart frequency [HF] and the levels of two urinary catecholamine) and not the subjective evaluation of workload. Besides, the level of tiredness, and consequently, the level of attention, was evaluated by two attention tests. Attention and HF data were collected from all 5 electricians. Catecholamine data were collected from only 2 electricians because of the costs involved and grant limitation. Given the influence of heat on stress, daily temperature (kept by CEEE’s meteorological department) was under control in the 2 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0018720812451855">
<title>Record of HF</title>
<p>HF was used to obtain the work pulse (WP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812451855">Kroemer &amp; Grandjean, 1997</xref>) as an overall stress index in terms of the number of beats per minute. WP reduces most HF individual variability (as a function of age, fitness, type of nutrition, and overall medical conditions) since it is the difference between the mean HF during work (working pulse) and HF at rest (resting pulse).</p>
<p>Resting pulse of each worker was measured after he remained seated for approximately 15 min at CEEE headquarters, and HF was monitored throughout work. Since the model of the HF monitor used (POLAR Model S610) did not have an interface with the computer, readings were taken at 30-min intervals. The workers reported the readings to a member of the research team, who also took note of the time and task being performed at the moment. In addition to WP, the percentage of the maximum aerobic capacity (PMAC) was calculated by the formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812451855">Rodgers, 1986</xref>):</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section15-0018720812451855">
<title>Measurement of urinary levels of catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline)</title>
<p>Whereas HF gives an indication of the overall workload, the measurement of catecholamine levels assessed by either blood or urinary samples allows for identification of the physical (through the noradrenaline levels) and the mental loads (through the adrenaline levels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812451855">Fibiger, Singer, &amp; Miller, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812451855">Basset, Marshall, &amp; Spillane, 1987</xref>) imposed on a person. Although some criticism could be argued against the use of urinary catecholamines as markers for physical and mental loads, particularly because both substances are vasoconstrictors that may cause reduction in urinary flow, both are excreted by the kidneys at the same rate, despite the status of renal blood flow imposed by their own action on the kidneys. So, any alteration in either adrenaline or noradrenaline blood level is matched by the same pattern of alteration in its excretion in urine.</p>
<p>Samples of urine were collected from Worker 1 and Worker 2 before leaving headquarters and after returning from the site every day during the 2 weeks of study. To minimize individual catecholamine fluctuations as well as day-to-day variations in the excretion of both catecholamines, we compared the ratio of noradrenaline (physical stress) to adrenaline (mental stress) after work (NA/A<sub>after</sub>) with the ratio of noradrenaline to adrenaline before work (NA/A<sub>before</sub>), so that the overall ratio Q-index [Q = (NA/A<sub>after</sub>) / (NA/A<sub>before</sub>)] indicates whether the maneuvers had been of more mental demand (Q-index falls) or of less mental demand (Q-index rises).</p>

<title>Attention tests</title>
<p>The minute test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812451855">Ahlgren &amp; Halberg, 1990</xref>) consists of asking the participant to count, mentally, the elapse of 1 min. As soon as an electrician indicated to the member of the research team that he had finished counting, the researcher stopped the chronometer and recorded the real time that had elapsed since the start of the count. The difference between the time recorded on the stopwatch and the elapse of 1 min indicated the size of the participant’s error. The method assumes that the more tired the person is, the greater the error will be in relation to the real time elapse of 1 min. Time does not seem to pass when one is tired, and therefore, the perception of how long a minute is tends to be higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812451855">Ahlgren &amp; Halberg, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The test of fitting matchsticks into a matchbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812451855">Ahlgren &amp; Halberg, 1990</xref>) consists of scattering the matchsticks around an empty matchbox and timing how long the participant takes to put them all inside the box and close it. The assumption is that the more tired the participant is, the more time he or she will take to fit the matches into the box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812451855">Ahlgren &amp; Halberg, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>All team members took the attention tests twice a day, before leaving headquarters and after returning from the site, as a means for evaluating stress and fatigue accumulated during the journey.

Viable alternatives to experimental approaches include longitudinal case-series designs and before–after trials (either without or with control groups) that can be paired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812451855">Neumann et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering the size of the population (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and the conditions imposed by the company, we adopted the before–after trials paired design with the same 5 participants from the same live line team working for 2 consecutive weeks in similar weather conditions. Because authorization was given to accompany only one team, it was not possible to use the other team as a control group. Although one should interpret the results considering these limitations, it is worth noting that the sampling design involved 50% of the population (<italic>n</italic> = 5), which reduces the standard error and increases the power for detection of significant difference on the statistical test, given the size of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812451855">Chow, Shao, &amp; Wang, 2003</xref>). Besides, the sample can be considered representative since it contains people with different characteristics (such as age, experience, weight, height, different responsibilities in the team).</p>
<p>Data were evaluated by analysis of variance (repeated-measures ANOVA), which is often used by chronobiologists to evaluate the effect of time of day in human performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812451855">Atkinson &amp; Reilly, 1996</xref>), especially when the number of data is small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812451855">Monk, 1982</xref>). In each ANOVA table, we decompose the variability observed in each evaluated index into contributions of various factors and evaluate their interactions: worker, period (beginning or end of the journey), and week (1 = traditional and 2 = ergonomic).

<title>Work Performed in Weeks 1 and 2</title>
<p>As depicted in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720812451855">appendix</xref>, the electricians performed similar tasks in the 2 weeks. They performed 12 tasks in Week 1, 7 of them plus half of two tasks in a time of day different from one more suited to human performance. In Week 2, they spent less time pruning and performed 16 tasks, of which only 3 (e.g., change C key on Day 11, cut down pruning on Days 11 and 12) were out of schedule. In terms of time, they worked 39 hr in Week 1, of which 19 hr (48.7%) were out of schedule; on Week 2, they worked 40 hr, of which only 3 hr (7.3%) were out of schedule. Although the idea was to have 100% of the tasks performed at the most appropriate time of day, it was not possible to adjust them all. Pruning, for example, is sometimes a task that is a prerequisite for accomplishing another one.</p>

<p>We used daily median instead of the daily average to cope with heart beating peaks that might occur during the workday. The daily median WP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812451855">Figure 3</xref>) has a significant effect attributable only to worker (<italic>p</italic> = .0192), which is expected since the participants have different work paces and different tasks in the team. Since week is not significant (<italic>p</italic> = .2640), the conclusion is that the intervention did not affect the daily median WP.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the small sample size, physiological indices were good markers for workload and physical-to-mental stress when examined as a whole and particularly for distinguishing mean effort of each day’s tasks. WP varied with the individual and with the different tasks each worker performs in the team. Temperature was monitored in both weeks, showing approximately the same expected oscillations during the day; workers’ WP accompanied these variations. The impact of temperature, which is a strong physiological <italic>zeitgeber</italic> (synchronizer) for the biological clock, on stress reinforces the need to schedule heavier tasks for the morning period, when it is cooler, leaving the lighter tasks for the afternoon.</p>
<p>Although the individual levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline at the beginning and at the end of the workday were about the same for each worker in Week 1, the level of noradrenaline measured in Worker 1 was lower than in Worker 2, who is older, is less physically fit, and is also the driver, which imposes an extra load. After the intervention, the levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline measured in both workers were lower, showing, respectively, a decrease in physical and mental effort, which is an important benefit, since the reduction in stress reduces the likelihood of accidents and fosters an increase in attention. Since the nature of the tasks did not undergo any significant changes in Week 2, work organization can be assumed to be the beneficial factor. There is a clear tendency for the two workers to display the same NA/A curves, characterizing work more mentally than physically demanding, even though they perform different tasks. This finding means that they are both subject to similar physical and psychological pressures. Q-index values, a much more robust parameter to assess the real weight of mental and physical demands, clearly evidenced the decrease in mental stress load after the circadian-based ergonomic intervention.</p>
<p>In regard to the attention indices, in Week 1, there is a statistically significant difference in the time taken for the two attention tests before and after the daily journey, whereas there is no difference in Week 2. This finding shows that the perception of the individuals was not affected by the load imposed by the journey, possibly because they came to and left work feeling less tired in the “ergonomic” week. In the test measuring workers’ notion of 1 min, the error shows a slight tendency to be lower (i.e., the workers are more relaxed) in Week 2, but it would be necessary to increase the sample size to achieve statistical significance. The time taken to fit the matchsticks into the box is statistically shorter in Week 2, indicating less fatigue. It is further observed that in the index of fitting the matchsticks into the box, there is a statistically significant difference between measurements before and after the working day in the 2 weeks, such that the times in Week 2 are always shorter than in Week 1. Since the measurements were paired (before and after) for each individual, it can be assumed that the reduction is attributable to the reduction in fatigue and not merely because participants have become familiar with the matchstick test.</p>
<p>When the researchers returned to the company to discuss the results with management and electricians, the live line team leader commented, in public, that the sensation of feeling less stress and fatigue was evident in the “ergonomic” week. Although the study was successful and the electricians demonstrated enthusiasm toward the new system, it was not implemented at CEEE yet. Participatory ergonomics was instrumental in the proposal of changes that might positively affect work, but at the same time, the study proved that even being aware of the benefits, management is still resistant to changes and does not see any reason for improvement since it adduces that workers are not at risk and are not exposed to both physical and mental stress. In studies aimed at changing work organization in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812451855">Guimarães, 2009</xref>) as well as in other developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812451855">Scott, 2009</xref>), researchers found it very easy to engage the workers but very difficult to implement changes when the decision was in the hands of the managerial staff. Actually, changing work practices can be difficult even in developed countries, either because management is not interested or because workers do not see the necessity for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812451855">Vink, Imada, &amp; Zink, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study presented an evaluation of the performance of electricians of a live line team working in two conditions: In Week 1, there was no interference in the team’s work, and in Week 2, the work was organized according to ergonomic criteria based on circadian rhythms and homeostatic processes. Both physical and mental stress were reduced in Week 2, as evidenced by the decrease of noradrenaline and adrenaline, respectively, and confirmed by Q-index values. When the distributions of the time taken in the two attention tests were assessed during the course of the 2 weeks, we observed that there was an improvement in performance in Week 2 for all individuals. Together, physiological and attention data provided evidence of a reduction in the stress experienced in Week 2, indicating that taking ergonomic principles into account when organizing work positively affects workers’ performance.</p>
<p>Even with its design limitations, this field study makes it clear that in nonemergency situations, and for jobs in which tasks to be performed are not interdependent, it is possible to have a schedule of production or supply of services that meets the needs of the workers and the company simultaneously. Workers know the most demanding and riskier tasks; therefore, improvements can be achieved by participative ergonomics. However, the implementation of organizational changes depend on the managerial staff, who are yet not prepared to accept other forms of work organization that differ from the one they are used to. The cost of this kind of intervention is more cultural than monetary, since it changes the company’s traditional way to structure work but does not necessarily depend on acquisition of new tools, equipment, or even training.</p>
