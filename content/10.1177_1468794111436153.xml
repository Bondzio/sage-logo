<p>Tessa Muncey’s <italic>Creating Autoethnographies</italic>, is a thought-provoking exploration of the use of art and creativity in autoethnography. However, for such a complex and controversial subject, it lacks discussion about the differences between art and ethnography, the use of memory versus imagination, and the experiences and ideas best suited to autoethnography. The book begins by defining autoethnography as ‘an artistically constructed piece of prose, poetry, music or piece of artwork that attempts to portray an individual experience in a way that evokes the imagination of the reader, viewer or listener’ (p. 2). Muncey does not, however, discuss what art is or investigate whether the kind of questions important in autoethnography can be asked and answered through art.</p>
<p>Although, in the preface, Muncey writes that ‘published work has a tendency to focus on the successful: the rags to riches, victim to survivor, stories of successful research outcomes, and shies away from those with mistakes or of which we are ashamed’ (p. xi), she then presents her own story, of her nursing career and rise in the academic world after a difficult abusive childhood and teenage pregnancy, as a victim to survivor story, focusing mainly on her successful career. Hidden stories like hers are difficult to research except through autoethnography, but such stories are not easy to tell and Muncey seems to avoid the actual telling. She leaves gaps where she might have asked questions, such as why people don’t believe her story and what in her past helped her have a successful career when most teenage mothers do not.</p>
<p>At the heart of the book is a series of creative writing techniques which emphasise accessing unconscious thoughts, imagination and metaphor. Muncey uses the example of a poem about anticipated fear that she constructed using a photograph of herself at age two. The poem, in itself a complex mixture of imagination and interpretation, hints at her hidden story, and it would have been interesting to see this poem embedded in an autoethnography exploring her childhood story and questions arising from it. The book ends with an autoethnography by David Carless on the creative process of writing a song, which would have been a good starting point for an examination of the differences between art and ethnography, the song and the ethnography on song-writing.</p>
