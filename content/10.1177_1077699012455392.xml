<abstract>
<p>Scholars have examined media substitutability from many angles, but few, if any, studies have examined substitutability of advertising on the basis of language. Using a price sensitivity test, this exploratory study examines advertisers’ attitudes toward the substitutability of English-language advertising among U.S. foreign language television advertisers to reach their target audiences. Advertisers overwhelmingly (90%) indicated that they did not consider English-language television as an acceptable substitute for reaching their target audiences. This finding has implications for media ownership and mergers, providing evidence that foreign-language television and English-language television exist in separate product markets, and should aid future policy discussions.</p>

<p>Foreign-language media have served diverse audiences within the United States from its earliest days.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012455392">1</xref></sup> Electronic and new media platforms have become the most recent venues to offer non-English-language options to the U.S. population,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012455392">2</xref></sup> with television programming being one of the most robust examples. The number of Spanish-language networks grew from just three in 1986 to more than seventy in 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012455392">3</xref></sup> More than fifty Asian-language networks now exist, including Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Japanese. Programming can be found in Russian, Hindi, and dozens of other languages, along with foreign-language advertising. As the foreign-language media industry has expanded in the United States, however, media managers and policy makers are faced with a critical question: Do foreign-language and English-language media compete? The answer to this question is important not only for assessing media competition, but also in considering the approval of mergers, and has implications for the economic sustainability of foreign-language media and the linguistic diversity of content for U.S. audiences.</p>
<p>At the center of media competition debates is the concept of substitution. It is a measure that determines whether two media products exist within the same product market, and are thus competitors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012455392">4</xref></sup> Substitutability serves as a basis for determining a firm’s market share and any potential competitive harm, concepts that are central to the antitrust proceedings of media merger cases.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077699012455392">
<title>Purpose of Study</title>
<p>While the substitutability of media has been examined by scholars,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012455392">5</xref></sup> few, if any, academic studies have examined the substitutability of advertising on the basis of language. There is a need to empirically address this question, which has been a matter of public policy debates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012455392">6</xref></sup> The purpose of this exploratory study is to do just that, by examining whether “foreign-language advertisers”—defined in this study as those who use non-English-language advertising within the United States—consider foreign-language and English-language advertising availabilities to be substitutes. The findings have important implications for market definition as it pertains to media ownership and antitrust issues.</p>
<p>Because media products are consumed by two “buyers” simultaneously—audiences and advertisers—the media industry operates in what is known as a dual product market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012455392">7</xref></sup> So, it is worth noting that audiences also play a role in media competition and substitution, in that they make consumption decisions about what content best serves their needs. Certainly, a proportion of foreign-language speakers also consumes English-language content, and this will be further discussed; however, the current study limits its examination to the advertising side of this equation.</p>
<p>It may seem intuitive that advertisers who use foreign languages to reach their target audiences would not consider English-language media an acceptable substitute for reaching foreign-language audiences within the United States. However, law and policy have not consistently followed this assumption,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012455392">8</xref></sup> and because no similar study has been conducted on advertising and language substitutability, there has been no empirical evidence to guide policy makers in this area. Given the increasingly multilingual nature of the U.S. media industry and audience, it is likely this topic will resurface and be addressed by policy makers again. Therefore, a demand-side analysis that adds to our theoretical and applied understanding of substitutability and language would be helpful in addressing the question directly. A more thorough discussion of substitutability precedes a review of the literature.</p>

<sec id="section2-1077699012455392">
<title>Substitutability</title>
<p>Substitutability refers to “whether media goods and services are interchangeable with each other.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012455392">9</xref></sup> It indicates the degree to which two or more products or services compete in a common market and can be assessed by examining price sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012455392">10</xref></sup> Substitution is also part of product market discussions, as it is related to the cross-elasticity of demand between two products. Products or services are considered “reasonable substitutes” if “an increase in the price of one will result in an increase in the quantity demanded of the other.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012455392">11</xref></sup> The current language substitutability question was prompted by a merger between Univision Communications Inc. and Hispanic Broadcasting, which was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2003. During the merger review, the government sought to learn whether Spanish-language and English-language radio advertising competed in a common market based on their degree of substitutability. While a previous study examined the substitutability issue from case law and policy perspectives,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012455392">12</xref></sup> this article examines substitutability from economic and marketplace perspectives, which often inform legal analysis. This study’s data from advertisers regarding their perceived substitutability of English- and Spanish-language television advertising in response to a hypothetical price change can provide an informative, exploratory step toward a more comprehensive analysis, such as one that examines cross-elasticity of demand based on quantity of advertising sold and pricing data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012455392">13</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-1077699012455392">
<title>Importance of Substitutability of Media on the Basis of Language</title>
<p>The merger of Univision Communications Inc. and Hispanic Broadcasting Corp. united the largest Spanish-language television broadcaster and the largest Spanish-language radio broadcaster in the United States. The case had far-reaching implications for the public interest because a merger approval would grant unprecedented corporate power in Spanish-language broadcasting, with radio advertising revenue overlap ranging from 70%-95% in some markets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012455392">14</xref></sup> Opponents of the merger decried that Univision, translated as “one voice,” would become just that for many listeners who rely solely or mostly on Spanish to communicate and comprehend, and who would have no other radio “voices” in the marketplace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012455392">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the merger review, the Department of Justice (DOJ) examined the substitutability of English and Spanish radio advertising.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012455392">16</xref></sup> After thorough analysis and application of the SSNIP test (discussed below), it concluded that the affected advertisers did rely specifically on Spanish-language radio advertising availabilities and would not substitute English-language radio advertising spots, given a small but significant increase in price.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012455392">17</xref></sup> One would assume that this would have resolved the issue because the DOJ concluded that competitive harm would be the result in this antitrust proceeding involving radio stations. However, the FCC ignored this finding by the DOJ and approved the Univision-HBC merger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012455392">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Conflicting views of the merger’s effect on competition reveal the need for additional study that might help resolve the dispute arising from cases like <italic>United States v. Univision Communications Inc. and Hispanic Broadcasting.</italic> This study extends the DOJ’s radio inquiry in <italic>United States v. Univision Communications Inc. and Hispanic Broadcasting</italic> to test whether television advertisers who use foreign languages view English-language advertising as a reasonable substitute. As with the DOJ’s analysis, the relevant product market is advertising availabilities and the relevant buyers are advertisers. A demand-side interpretation is foundational to such questions.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section4-1077699012455392">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Media product substitutability has been measured in two primary ways: cross-elasticity of demand and the SSNIP (“small but significant non-transitory increase in price”) test (often used as a rule of thumb for applying the cross-elasticity principle). The SSNIP test has been frequently applied by the DOJ in antitrust proceedings and when conducting horizontal merger reviews to determine price sensitivity and define the relevant product market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012455392">19</xref></sup> Regardless of test used, scholars can collect data on perceived media substitutability by asking advertisers directly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012455392">20</xref></sup> Price sensitivity testing is imperative for economic and policy analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012455392">21</xref></sup> and, based on previous approaches, the current study will test substitutability using direct inquiry of advertisers. Advertisers who practice foreign-language advertising will be asked how they would respond to a small but significant increase in the price of this advertising.</p>
<sec id="section5-1077699012455392">
<title>Price Sensitivity and the SSNIP Test</title>
<p>The DOJ and Federal Trade Commission’s Horizontal Merger Guidelines provide the basis for the SSNIP test, a rule of thumb common to competitive harm analyses in the United States and also now used by the European Union. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012455392">22</xref></sup> Analysts, including those in the DOJ, frequently use 5% as the SSNIP price increase level during such inquiries; however, it is a somewhat arbitrary level that can vary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012455392">23</xref></sup> The U.S. Guidelines require that it be determined “whether a transaction will likely increase concentration in a relevant market and create market power, allowing the combined firm, unilaterally or through coordinated action, to raise price above competition levels.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012455392">24</xref></sup> Since a market is defined as “something worth monopolizing” and the application of the SSNIP test by government “involves talking to people who make buying decisions” in that market,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012455392">25</xref></sup> the Guidelines ask whether “a hypothetical monopolist of the smallest candidate market could profitably sustain a small but significant [non-transitory] increase in price (SSNIP), generally 5%.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012455392">26</xref></sup> If the conclusion is yes, the relevant product market has been identified. If the conclusion is no, this is due to consumers’ ability to switch to alternative products or suppliers (substitutes).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012455392">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The SSNIP test was used by the DOJ in 2003, when it analyzed the now-finalized merger between Univision Communications and Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation. The DOJ agreed that the affected advertisers did rely on Spanish-language radio and would not substitute English-language radio spots, given a small but significant (non-transitory) increase in price.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012455392">28</xref></sup> Following the DOJ model, which used the SSNIP test to examine advertisers’ willingness to substitute English-language radio advertising spots for Spanish ones, the current study takes a first step into the television realm by asking advertisers about their willingness to substitute TV advertising on the basis of language using a small but significant price increase (set at 5% for this study). The findings can then be incorporated into future antitrust discussions and direct further testing when questions of language and media arise.</p>

<sec id="section6-1077699012455392">
<title>Industry and Policy Evidence of Non-substitutability of Language-Specific Media Products</title>
<p>Evidence of non-substitutability already exists on an industry level. Spanish-dominant audiences—those who speak only or mostly Spanish—are unable to substitute a media product that they comprehend for one that they cannot because it is delivered in a foreign language. Univision’s own claims of product non-interchangeability for consumers boasts that one of its stations “delivers a significant exclusive audience . . . 51.9% of WLTV-TV’s audience does not watch any English television at all during the week.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012455392">29</xref></sup> The FCC acknowledged HBC’s claim that “more than 70% of U.S. Hispanics prefer to speak Spanish at home” and that “a large segment of the audience is driven by dependence and not just preference.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012455392">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Broadcast rights to major sporting events provide additional evidence of the separate product markets (and lack of substitutability) between English- and foreign-language media. English- and Spanish-language rights are sold separately to broadcast events such as the World Cup—within the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012455392">31</xref></sup> Olympic broadcast rights are sold to many more nations, which air the games in multiple languages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012455392">32</xref></sup> Because exclusive broadcast rights cannot be sold to two different buyers (by definition, the rights would no longer be exclusive), this means that the industry deems English and Spanish broadcast rights as two distinct products. Because the two products have weak or insufficient substitutability, they can be sold separately.</p>
<p>Finally, the growth of the foreign-language advertising industry, as exhibited by the growth of ethnic advertising agencies in the United States, serves as supplementary evidence of distinct product markets. The $4 billion Hispanic advertising industry is booming, helping companies launch multimillion-dollar Hispanic marketing campaigns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012455392">33</xref></sup> The majority of these advertising billings go to television,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012455392">34</xref></sup> a reason for the separate examination of TV in this study. The Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies (AHAA) and Asian American Advertising Federation (3AF) exist specifically to serve the in-language and in-culture advertising market. Despite the fact that a well-defined industry subsegment has seemingly emerged under the assumption that there is no substitutability for advertisers who need to target audiences in a foreign language, and despite evidence of foreign language audiences as a valued market segment, the substitutability of language has nevertheless been a matter of debate among some in the advertising industry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012455392">35</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077699012455392">
<title>Scholarly Evidence of Non-substitutability of Language-Specific Media for Advertisers</title>
<p>The academic literature has provided some evidence of advertiser preference for foreign-language advertising over English-language advertising to reach foreign-language audiences. Advertising language preference has been used as a strategic basis for entering consumer product and service markets outside of the United States, such as those in China and India,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012455392">36</xref></sup> but studies also show non–English speakers in the United States prefer advertising delivered in their dominant language, whatever it may be. Roslow and Nicholls found that Spanish-dominant and bilingual Hispanics both prefer advertising messages in Spanish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012455392">37</xref></sup> Other studies show that consumers prefer viewing and listening to television advertisements in their native language, although this preference tends to fluctuate based on level of acculturation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012455392">38</xref></sup> Research on advertising language selection generally argues that advertisers should use their target audience’s dominant language.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012455392">39</xref></sup> In one study, young Hispanics viewing advertisements showed a preference for English or “Spanglish,” a mixture of Spanish and English.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012455392">40</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077699012455392">
<title>The Role of Audience</title>
<p>It is worth noting that some foreign-language speakers also consume content in English, and this can impact the demand for foreign-language media content. While this study is focused on neither Hispanics nor Spanish speakers per se, recent research indicates a majority of U.S. Hispanics consume media in both English and Spanish, with 11% consuming only Spanish media content and 14% consuming only English content.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012455392">41</xref></sup> While these data were not further segmented by English ability, Hispanics as a whole indicate a willingness to consume some English-language content, a finding confirmed by data regularly reported in Nielsen’s National People Meter Hispanic subsample. The third most viewed television network by Hispanics, after Univision and Telemundo, is Fox.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012455392">42</xref></sup> Shows such as <italic>American Idol</italic> and <italic>Grey’s Anatomy</italic> top the list of Hispanics’ English-language favorites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012455392">43</xref></sup> These “favorites,” however, are often ranked lower than most Hispanic-watched shows, usually thirtieth place or below.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012455392">44</xref></sup> While many Hispanics are bilingual, Da Costa notes that—whether out of preference or need—some may simply consume English content due to the unavailability of preferred content in Spanish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012455392">45</xref></sup> That being said, Nielsen Hispanic household ratings consistently reveal that the top ten rated shows, week after week, are Spanish-language programs, typically on Univision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012455392">46</xref></sup> In addition, U.S. Census data reveal that one-fifth of the U.S. population speaks a language other than English at home, and of those, 62% speak Spanish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012455392">47</xref></sup> About half of U.S. residents who speak a language other than English state that they do not speak English very well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077699012455392">48</xref></sup> Thus, there is a segment of the population that is also dependent on non-English-language media.</p>
<p>The question of language and audience choice, then, is a complex one. Language ability, age, level of acculturation, and even program type may all play a role in audience media selection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077699012455392">49</xref></sup> While foreign-language advertisers in this study defined “target audience” for themselves, Da Costa summarily advises investors to “know your audience well and keep in mind that they don’t all behave the same way.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077699012455392">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, the ethnic advertising industry bears witness to the investment and valuation of language as an advertising strategy. Moreover, research has shown that audiences prefer consuming media messages in their dominant language, and it seems that advertisers are taking this knowledge and utilizing it to develop in-language advertising campaigns. Toward this end, and returning to the need to establish whether foreign-language and English-language advertising constitute separate product markets, the following research questions were posed:</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012455392" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>RQ1:</bold> To what degree do advertisers who advertise in foreign-language television within the United States perceive English-language television as an acceptable substitute to reach their target audiences when presented with a small but significant increase in price?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>RQ1a:</bold> For advertisers who do not find English-language television to be an acceptable substitute for foreign-language television (when presented with a small but significant increase in price for television advertising availabilities), is there a price increase higher than that used for SSNIP at which they would switch to English-language television?</p></list-item></list>
<p>Finally, in an effort to gather some baseline information about how in-language advertisers feel about their foreign-language investments, it was asked,</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section10-1077699012455392">
<title>Survey</title>
<p>Survey and interview methods have been effectively used by scholars to gather information from advertisers, particularly on media substitutability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1077699012455392">51</xref></sup> Television advertisers were surveyed because they represent the largest advertising sector by revenue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1077699012455392">52</xref></sup> It should be noted that self-identification as a television advertiser did not preclude the advertiser from also advertising on other media platforms. However, the study intentionally sampled advertisers who used television, as television advertising was the focus of the survey. Advertisers who did not use television were excluded.</p>
<p>Once the sample was selected, each potential respondent was emailed an invitation to participate, the text of which contained a link to the survey web site and a unique password. The text also informed potential respondents of an executive summary of the study’s findings that they would receive as an incentive for participation. Data were collected for a period of four months. Nonrespondents were sent at least one follow-up email and encouraged to participate.</p>
<p>Within the survey, price sensitivity was tested via direct inquiry of buyers (advertisers) to determine the perceived degree of substitutability between foreign-language- and English-language television advertising. To accomplish this, a survey question asked advertisers directly, “If the price of ad inventory on the foreign-language networks increased by 5%, would you buy time on an English-language network in order to reach your target audience instead?” Then, for any respondents who replied “no,” a follow-up question asked whether the two networks were substitutable at another price increase: “If you answered ‘no,’ is there another level at which you would consider substituting English- language for foreign-language advertising?” Possible responses included “no,” “yes, 6–10% price increase,” “yes, 11–15% price increase,” “yes, 16–20% increase,” and “yes, more than a 20% price increase.” Finally, in order to address <bold>RQ2</bold>, which gathered some baseline data on respondents’ perceptions of their in-language advertising investments, the survey also asked how “effective” foreign language advertising was for them, on a scale of one to five, with five being “very effective” and one being “not effective at all.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077699012455392">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>A cluster sampling approach was used to generate a purposive sample of advertisers and advertising agency personnel who practice foreign-language advertising. A census of these personnel was attempted in order to obtain the greatest number of respondents in a limited universe of foreign-language advertisers. However, due to response rate, it is more appropriate to describe the respondents as a purposive nonprobability sample. The sample was compiled via official rosters of the principal existing foreign-language advertising organizations and source books in the United States, including AHAA, 3AF, and “ethnic member” sections of the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4As) directory. The sample was collected as part of a larger study and was a combination of agency personnel and advertisers to provide a sufficient number of respondents for analysis.</p>
<p>Procedurally speaking, the advertising agencies were contacted as an initial and efficient way of identifying advertisers who actively targeted ethnic audiences. However, because this information was often refused, efforts were made to identify advertisers using the client lists posted on the agency’s web site or from its listing in one of the agency source books, rosters, or the <italic>Agency Red Book</italic>. Nearly 100% of agency clients could be identified using one of these sources. These individual clients, or advertisers, were then contacted independently in order to acquire the necessary names, job titles, and email addresses of potential survey respondents. In a few cases, this contact information was clearly stated on the company’s web site, and it was not necessary to call to acquire the information. When contacting the agencies, names and email addresses of appropriate agency-based personnel were also gathered for survey participation.</p>
<p>Employees of advertisers (companies) targeted for participation were the director of marketing, director of advertising, brand manager, or product manager. Only one contact per company (or company product line) was selected. This person is referred to as the “advertiser” and represents that firm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077699012455392">53</xref></sup> Agency personnel were selected by job title and whether they were involved in assessing audience value and or media buying or planning initiatives. Because companies retaining advertising agencies seek strategic guidance from these agencies and are paying the agency for these services, appropriate agency personnel were considered knowledgeable and reliable to include as additional respondents; advertising industry personnel consulted regarding the sampling method agreed. Typical job titles at the agency level included account executive, vice president of strategy, president, and media buyer. The term <italic>advertiser</italic> hereinafter refers to any survey respondent, whether the respondent originates from the client company or an advertising agency.</p>
<p>A total of 1,150 requests for survey participation were successfully emailed to potential respondents. After excluding unusable surveys, there were 484 participants, for a response rate of 42.1%. Of the respondents, 216 self-identified as advertisers who advertise on foreign-language television. While the sample respondents are few in number, they represent an important group of key professionals with a specialized understanding of the industry and the issues under investigation. Such respondent samples are valued by industry practitioners and scholars, and have proven effective in academic research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1077699012455392">54</xref></sup></p>

<title>Profile of U.S. Foreign-Language Television Advertisers</title>
<p>This respondent pool of 216 foreign-language television advertising personnel was 46.6% male and 53.4% female and had a median age of forty-two years. In terms of ethnic composition, 53.3% were white (non-Hispanic), 30.3% Hispanic, 10.3% Asian, and 1.8% black (non-Hispanic), and 4.2% did not self-identify into any of the above categories. Respondents had worked for a median four and a half years in the industry and a median of two years in their current position. The predominant product categories represented by respondents were financial services (11.6%), retail/fast food (11.2%), and automotive (8.4%).</p>
<p>The foreign languages most often used by these television advertisers were Spanish (61.3%), followed by Chinese (10.0%), Korean (7.5%), Vietnamese (6.7%), and Tagalog (4.6%) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077699012455392">Table 1</xref>). Most advertisers utilized only one foreign language in their initiatives, although some used multiple. Of advertisers, 63% also reported that they had used bilingual television advertising at some point, in which two languages were used within the same ad.</p>

<title>Non-substitutability of Advertising by Language</title>
<p>Findings on the question of substitutability (<bold>RQ1</bold>) were clear. Respondents overwhelmingly indicated that they did not consider English-language advertising to be an acceptable substitute for foreign-language advertising. When asked in the survey whether, given a 5% increase in the price of advertising availabilities on the foreign-language networks, they would place advertising on an English-language network to reach their target audience instead, 90% of foreign-language television advertisers responded “no” (<italic>n</italic> = 162).</p>
<p>The follow-up question was then asked of the respondents who answered “no” (those who would not switch to English-language advertising options if the price of foreign-language ads was raised by 5%), to learn to what degree advertisers would substitute English-language advertising for foreign-language advertising on TV, if at all. This question asked about “another level at which you would consider substituting English-language advertising in order to reach your target market.” The response choices were “no,” “yes, a 6–10% price increase,” “yes, a 11–15% price increase,” “yes, a 16–20% price increase,” and “yes, more than a 20% price increase,” so that level referred to the price increase. In response to these options, 45.1% said “no,” there was no other price increase for which they’d consider substituting, while 3.5% said they would consider substituting English if the price increased between 6% and 10%; 7.7% said they’d consider substituting with a 11–15% price increase; 6.3% would consider it with a 16–20% price increase; and 16.2% would consider it with still higher price increases (<italic>n</italic> = 142).</p>
<p>Descriptive results were examined by language for these questions as well. Spanish (10.3%) and Chinese (6.3%) television advertisers were the only ones willing to consider advertising on English TV, given a small but significant increase in price on the foreign-language network. As one possible explanation, these languages have more advertising vehicles to choose from, or it could be that these target audiences tend to be more bilingual, and they view English as more substitutable. Nevertheless, the majority of advertisers in these groups still responded “no,” they would not advertise on English-language television, given a small but significant price increase.</p>
<p>In response to <bold>RQ1</bold>, it seems that in a very small percentage of cases, television advertisers who advertise in foreign languages may consider English-language advertising an option, but for most this consideration would come only after a substantial price increase, as illustrated by the follow-up question responses. For TV advertisers who practice foreign-language advertising, their willingness to substitute English ad availabilities for those intended to reach their target audiences appears to be quite low, if it is considered at all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1077699012455392">
<title>Effectiveness of Foreign Language Advertising</title>
<p>Finally, to address <bold>RQ2</bold> and generate baseline information about in-language television advertisers’ perceptions regarding their foreign-language investments, respondents were asked whether they found foreign-language advertising to be an effective strategy. In all, 80% responded that they considered it “effective” or “very effective.” While advertisers were not directly asked in the survey why they consider or do not consider English-advertising substitutable with other languages, and while this result is not an indicator of substitutability, it does seem that the majority of in-language television advertisers are satisfied with the strategy’s effectiveness.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1077699012455392" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found that language is not substitutable for the majority of television advertisers when trying to reach their target audiences. Specifically, 90% of this study’s advertisers who use foreign languages stated that they would not consider English-language television as an acceptable substitute when considering television vehicles in which to place their advertising messages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1077699012455392">55</xref></sup> From a legal and policy standpoint, this respondent information can aid discussions concerning whether English and non-English television advertising availabilities exist in common or distinct markets. If two goods are not considered reasonable substitutes, then they are in different product markets, per the SSNIP test and economic theory.</p>
<p>The findings on language should aid legal analysts and policy makers involved in media competition analyses and product market debates. Should a potential merger arise involving both English- and foreign-language broadcast properties, this study’s findings would suggest a lack of substitutability, separate product markets and little to no competitive harm. However, separate concerns could surface regarding ownership diversity and the number of unique corporate voices within a market. Recent actions by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, such as vacating newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rules and other broadcast deregulation proposals in the 2008 Media Ownership Order, indicate that the government is still concerned with protecting ownership and viewpoint diversity. The retention of ownership limits by the court suggests that “the scarcity rationale may have even more force today than it did in 1975, despite the dramatic technological and marketplace changes that have occurred over the several decades since its inception.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1077699012455392">56</xref></sup> If the scarcity rationale is still being applied to mainstream media, one can assume that foreign-language media, which are far less numerous, require equal if not greater protection from consolidation to protect viewpoint and ownership diversity within that product market.</p>
<p>Finally, the FCC recently noted that “[Diversity and Competition Supporters] states that minority-owned stations are more likely to provide programming geared towards minority audiences and that minority communities are underserved as a result of the lack of minority media ownership. We seek comment on how the proposed newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule could affect minority and female ownership opportunities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1077699012455392">57</xref></sup> Such remarks do not seem to indicate a viewpoint of language substitutability in future media policy formulation.</p>
<sec id="section17-1077699012455392">
<title>Implications for the Field</title>
<p>This study also furthered scholarship on the substitutability of media products. U.S. advertisers who use foreign languages overwhelmingly indicated in this study that English-language television was not an acceptable substitute for foreign-language television as an advertising vehicle. This not only bolsters the product market definition argument for separate linguistic media markets,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1077699012455392">58</xref></sup> but also expands current understanding of audience theory and adds credence to a business model centered on linguistic market segmentation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1077699012455392">59</xref></sup> Segmentation by language, a natural “isolation” factor, uniquely targets persons who speak only a given language; it is an efficient strategy for targeting a group of consumers in a way that conveys that the messaging is “just for them,” and strategically excludes those who do not speak the language.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1077699012455392">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study’s finding that 80% of foreign-language television advertisers perceive the practice as “effective”—while neither a substitutability test nor evidence of an isolation effect—provides relevant baseline information about television advertisers’ perceptions of their foreign-language media investments. If such practices are viewed as effective by these advertisers, perhaps the strategy is also considered essential by some. Future studies should probe this question further, as it may have implications for advertising budget allocations, expenditure shifts, and additional growth within this advertising subsegment.</p>
<p>The study’s main finding on non-substitutability buttresses the argument that advertisers who practice foreign-language advertising significantly value cultural and linguistic traits above others, specifically for the market segmentation capability they can provide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1077699012455392">61</xref></sup> Because the data show that foreign-language and English-language audiences are viewed as entirely different products by television advertisers, these two audience products (and thus advertising availabilities) are not substitutable economically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1077699012455392">
<title>Implications for the Industry</title>
<p>The study makes an empirical contribution to the ongoing debate on media and advertising substitutability, which had not heretofore been tested for advertising inventory and language. These results seem to indicate that foreign-language television advertising options are not interchangeable for most advertisers surveyed. Of the television advertisers surveyed who use foreign-language messaging, 90% stated that they did not consider English-language advertising substitutable with foreign-language advertising, given a small but significant increase in price. Adding to knowledge generated from the DOJ’s radio analysis, it seems that for broadcast media, English-language substitutability is not considered a reasonable option for most advertisers targeting foreign-language audiences. Further testing is needed, of course, and across additional media platforms.</p>
<p>Because creating linguistically and culturally specific advertising can incur additional costs in order to reach a smaller and often less economically affluent audience segment, it is important to be able to identify audience traits that make such an expense justifiable in the minds of advertisers—traits considered valuable enough to target these audiences with customized messages. It appears that language is, unquestionably, one of those traits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1077699012455392">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>It is important to acknowledge some limitations to the study. While many client lists were accessed via agency web sites and appeared extensive, it is possible that some of these lists were incomplete. It is possible but unknown whether nonrespondents are in some way different from the respondents. While this study represents a valuable initial step, a future study could compute cross-elasticity of demand based upon real purchasing behaviors of advertisers. Data sets could be sought to test this precisely, to triangulate the results of this study and learn whether these findings hold. The findings would be instructive to policy makers who continue to use substitutability as a tool for determining the relevant product market, so that they may be better equipped to assess competitive harm in future merger reviews. Finally, given the lack of language substitutability on the part of advertisers to purchase advertising time on English-language television, but a willingness by some foreign-language speakers (even if bilingual) to consume English-language television, a comparative audience-demand study of substitutability of media content would be worthwhile. As foreign-language media within the United States continue to expand, the question of substitutability will likely resurface, and rigorous examination of the issue will be in the public interest.</p>

The central argument to the complaint was that “a significant number of advertisers exist who do not have reasonable alternatives to advertising on Spanish-language radio; in other words, these advertisers cannot effectively switch to other media in the face of a small but significant increase in the price (SSNIP) of advertising time on Spanish-language radio” (Office of the Federal Register, “Response to Public Comments,” 2003). See Coffey and Sanders, “Defining a Product Market for Spanish-Language Broadcast Media.”</p>
