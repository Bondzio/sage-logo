<p>International standards underpin the global economy. Without the structure and expectations they provide, globalization would quickly grind to a halt. Yet the process of setting standards has received limited attention from scholars of international political economy, especially global standards set by private agencies. Tim Büthe and Walter Mattli’s book, <italic>The New Global Rulers</italic>, fills this gap as it studies global private standard setting for accounting practices and product regulations. As a student and scholar of political economy, I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a thorough understanding of globalization.</p>
<p>To organize their analysis, the authors develop a useful and informative typology of standard-setting agencies. Their focus is on the agency that is the singular standard setter and private in nature (rather than public, like the International Monetary Fund or International Labour Organization). In other words, the standard-setting agency they study shares characteristics similar to a private firm with a monopoly in production, namely an organization facing no competition but existing as a private entity. Two examples used throughout the book include the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). In studying these particular agencies, this book asks two important questions: Who exactly writes the rules in these private organizations? And who wins and who loses—and why—when standard setting takes place?</p>
<p>To explain who wins and who loses, the authors develop a nuanced theory, using a modified two-level framework, called institutional complementarity theory (ICT). According to ICT, success at shaping international standards requires hierarchical institutions, which facilitate the flow of information to the domestic stakeholders and ensure vigorous representation of the stakeholders’ preferences. Firms embedded in a domestic setting with hierarchical regulatory institutions are expected to shape global private standards in their favor. The authors proceed to test this framework for accounting and product standards.</p>
<p>Specifically, chapter 4 applies the ICT framework to accounting standards set by the IASB comparing the United States and several European countries. Accounting standards in the United States are hierarchical, dominated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, whereas in Europe they are for the most part nonhierarchical. Because of the hierarchical nature of U.S. domestic institutions, U.S. firms are expected to be relatively more successful than European firms “in getting the IASB to take their technical views and regulatory preferences into account” (p. 98). Chapter 5 tests this proposition using an impressive survey data set collected by the authors over the past 8-plus years. Data coverage includes the United States, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, with each country representing at least 18% of the sample (p. 103). The nationality of the firm is used as a proxy for institutional fit, and the dependent variable indicates the degree to which the respondent believes his or her firm has been successful or not in shaping international standards set by the IASB. The empirical evidence supports their argument as U.S. firms universally provide more favorable responses to the IASB’s regulatory process than European firms. Moreover, the regression analysis exhibits that respondents from U.S. firms are more likely to feel they succeed at influencing the standard-setting process at the IASB. The regression analysis includes a number of control variables, including firm size and the frequency of attempts at influencing the IASB (<italic>n</italic> = 348 in Model 4), and the parameter estimates for U.S.-based firms are positive and statistically significant across all four of the models.</p>
<p>In the case of product standards the regulatory situation at the domestic level is almost entirely reversed. Here, the U.S. domestic regulatory framework is nonhierarchical whereas European domestic setting is relatively hierarchical. European firms (and U.S. firms with European subsidiaries) should therefore be more successful than U.S. firms in shaping international product regulations. The empirical analysis tests their hypothesis for standards set by the ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commission. The results, presented in chapter 7, cover the United States, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom for five industries (chemicals, rubber and plastics, medical instruments and devices, petroleum products, and iron and steel). A total of 1,385 survey respondents answered their questions, with the majority (73%) being from the United States and almost half (46%) employed in R&amp;D (p. 165). The dependent variable is taken from answers to the following survey question: “When you try to influence the technical specification of a new international standard, how frequently do you succeed?” (p. 171). Controlling for a number of variables, the authors find European firms and U.S. subsidiaries are more successful than U.S. firms when it comes to influencing international product standards. In addition, introducing the argument’s intervening variable—that is, frequency of involvement—shows the estimates for firm location become statistically insignificant, suggesting that hierarchical institutions encourage more participation (and better information), leading to more successes in shaping standards at the international level. In sum, Europeans exert more influence in shaping international product standards, a view corroborated by the rich anecdotal evidence collected from the American respondents (p. 184).</p>
<p>Altogether, the authors find the hierarchical domestic regulatory structure privileges U.S. firms in shaping international accounting standards and privileges European firms in shaping product standards. In chapter 8 the authors discuss their broader contributions, beginning with those relevant to political science, where they note contributions to the institutionalist literature regarding two-level analyses, historical institutionalism, and the political economy of regulatory barriers. Outside of political science, the authors discuss contributions to sociology, law, and economics. The discussion regarding informational asymmetries is particularly revealing and informative. To mitigate informational asymmetries, standards have traditionally been viewed as a means to address problems of unequal information, but as the authors discuss we should be cautious and less optimistic about their potential to do so because informational asymmetries, although inefficient, still benefit some individual stakeholders. Those benefiting have the greatest incentive to shape standards to their liking, which means asymmetries are likely to persist. As a political process, standard setting might not eliminate asymmetries, and it might make matters worse.</p>
<p>Finally, the book’s concluding chapter discusses issues of institutional design and distribution. In terms of design, the authors argue firms looking to improve their chances of success can either reform the international institutions or reform their domestic counterparts. Of the two, the authors believe reform is most likely to be carried out at the domestic level because the reform process is relatively easier at that level. This is not to say that reform at the domestic level is easy, because it is not. Institutions are usually sticky, characterized by path dependence, but in the context of this analysis reform is likely to be relatively easier at the domestic compared to the international level. Their discussion of reform in the conclusion suggests an interesting issue related to the causal nature of their argument. Thus far, the causal argument developed by the authors is supported by the sequence of events up to this point in time (p. 193). But in the future the causal story is unlikely to be so neat and orderly. As the authors discuss in the conclusion, the lack of success at the international level can affect institutional design at the domestic level such that the latter variable is unlikely to remain exogenous over time. Countries will always want to shape the rules of globalization such that studying global private standard setting will become increasingly complicated and characterized by questions of endogeneity and other related issues. Fortunately, the authors have a powerful command of this topic and will certainly continue to develop compelling and sophisticated explanations regarding this process.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>The New Global Rulers</italic> is a carefully researched book, and it offers an important contribution to the scholarship in international political economy studying globalization. I have a number of further comments and questions that because of various constraints could not be addressed by the authors. My most pressing comment and concern is in regard to the bias of the current standard-setting process. Indeed, the current regulatory framework is basically dominated by firms from either Europe or the United States, as is true of the IASB’s board, which is almost entirely made up of Western members (see p. 79, n. 72). Given the political nature of the process, it is hard not to see that the biased process will exclude the poorest developing countries from shaping these standards. After reading this book, it is clear that new barriers are being constructed and that as a result access to globalization will continue to remain inaccessible for many of the world’s poorest countries.</p>
<p>Yet not all developing countries will be excluded from the standard-setting process. Rapidly growing economies in Asia and Latin America seem likely to become more prominent and successful players in this process. As an authoritarian country, China is likely to speak with one voice at the international level, thus maximizing its chances of success in setting standards. Along with China, other developing countries like Brazil and India will push and pull standards in new directions, introducing their biases into the process. As these biases diversify and expand, it will become crucial to consider who is regulating the regulator. The high stakes and the fact that these agencies are effectively unaccountable mean the potential for serious problems to develop is a reality as this process expands.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you want to understand the depths of globalization and what makes it work, then I highly recommend reading this book. It is an example of first-rate research that offers thick descriptions, compelling theory, and convincing empirical results. The authors have done a masterful job in expanding our knowledge and understanding of globalization, and the book deserves to be widely read.</p>
