<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to enhance awareness of modes of HIV transmission and increase HIV/sexually transmitted diseases (STD) prevention efforts for incarcerated youth through use of an HIV/STD prevention program guided by the Making Proud Choices! curriculum. A convenience sample of 662 youth aged 13 to 18 was recruited from Alabama juvenile detention facilities. Participants took part in three 2-hour sessions. Baseline and postintervention data were collected. There was no significant difference between males and females in intent to use condoms at baseline and postintervention. Intent to use condoms was the most influential predictor of condom self-efficacy. However, there was little change in condom self-efficacy among males and females at baseline and postintervention.</p>

<p>Incarcerated adolescents are at an increased risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Studies show that roughly 15% to 20% of detained youth test positive for an STD, and an alarming 95% of these adolescents have engaged in three or more HIV-associated risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345812458090">Rowe, Wang, Greenbaum, &amp; Liddle, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, research findings suggest incarcerated adolescents engage in sexual activity at higher rates than other adolescents. In addition, when compared to other adolescents, incarcerated adolescents report less condom use, earlier sexual debut, and greater number of at-risk sexual partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345812458090">Belenko et al., 2008</xref>). A recent study estimated that 13.2% of incarcerated adolescents (10.5% males, 19.2% females) were infected with an STD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345812458090">Belenko et al., 2008</xref>). A review study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345812458090">Joesoef, Kahn, &amp; Weinstock, 2006</xref>) of STD prevalence rates among incarcerated adolescents revealed rates of chlamydia infections of up to 14.4% among males and up to 28.3% among females. Gonorrhea infection rates were approximately 6.7% among males and 18.3% among females. These alarming statistics have prompted interest in developing effective means to help decrease the burden of STDs among incarcerated adolescents.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1078345812458090">
<title>Condom Use</title>
<p>The consistent and correct use of condoms has been shown to significantly reduce the transmission of STDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345812458090">Gallo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345812458090">Holmes, Levine, &amp; Weaver, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345812458090">Woodhead, Chung, &amp; Joffe, 2009</xref>). A review study reported strong correlations between condom use and reduced acquisition of genital HSV-2, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, and the accelerated regression of HPV-associated lesions and clearance of warts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345812458090">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>). Although no intervention study has shown 100% consistent condom use among participants, it is suggested that even partially effective interventions can dramatically decrease STD transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345812458090">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>). A study examining self-reported condom use showed a reduction in STD transmission such that men who reported consistent condom use during the week before a follow-up visit showed less than half the incidence of STD than men reporting at least one episode of unprotected sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345812458090">Gallo et al., 2007</xref>). In an investigation of condom use and STDs in middle school students, a retrospective chart review of the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services questionnaire completed by 155 sexually active African American girls revealed that not wearing a condom was associated with increased risk of testing positive for STD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345812458090">Woodhead et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1078345812458090">
<title>Self-Efficacy and Condom Use</title>
<p>Self-efficacy is described as confidence in the performance of an activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345812458090">Bandura, 1982</xref>). In an early study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345812458090">Bandura (1982</xref>) suggested that performance varies directly as a function of perceived efficacy: The greater the level of perceived self-efficacy, the greater the performance accomplishments. Further, Bandura suggested that the method of enhancing self-efficacy was irrelevant to its effects. Additionally, those exhibiting self-efficacy are more likely than others to attempt a behavior, exert more effort in performance, and be more persistent in attempts to succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345812458090">O’Leary, Jemmott, &amp; Jemmott, 2008</xref>). Recently, a number of researchers have demonstrated this aspect of Bandura’s social cognitive theory as favorable with regard to condom use. In 2000, researchers showed that in a population of college students, those reporting confidence in condom use were more likely to use condoms than students who did not report confidence in using condoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345812458090">Dilorio, Dudley, Soet, Watkins, &amp; Maibach, 2000</xref>). In another university sample, sexually active students with high condom self-efficacy had more positive condom attitudes and perceived fewer obstacles to condom use.</p>
<p>Based on current research, it can be concluded that self-efficacy is a strong predictor of condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345812458090">O’Leary et al., 2008</xref>). In response, some researchers have asked the question: What are the predictors for condom self-efficacy? An HIV/STD prevention intervention in a sample of heterosexual couples investigated potential factors associated with condom use. These factors included attitudes toward condoms, condom use knowledge, condom use self-efficacy, intentions to use condoms, and knowledge about HIV/STD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078345812458090">Harvey et al., 2009</xref>). Although the increase in condom use in that study was not significant, the ability to correctly use a condom acted as a predictor of self-efficacy (the effects continued to be significant at 6 months; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078345812458090">Harvey et al., 2009</xref>). In a similar study among a population of female sex workers in China, findings revealed that greater condom self-efficacy was associated with more consistent condom use. Additionally, there was a significant association between the knowledge of correct use and actual correct use and self-efficacy. This suggests, consistent with Bandura’s theory, that skill mastery and knowledge is an effective method for increasing, and thereby predicting, condom self-efficacy. Other findings revealed a significant association between intent to use condoms in the future and condom self-efficacy, suggesting that intent to use condoms could potentially predict self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345812458090">Zhao, Wang, Fang, Li, &amp; Stanton, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>HIV/STD Initiative for Incarcerated Youth</title>
<p>An educational HIV/STD intervention based on the Making Proud Choices! curriculum was implemented in several youth detention centers in the southeastern United States to reduce rates of STDs in incarcerated adolescents. The Making Proud Choices! curriculum is listed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078345812458090">2008</xref>) Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions with Evidence of Effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345812458090">Jemmott &amp; Jemmott, 2012</xref>). Making Proud Choices! is an intervention designed to educate and empower adolescents to reduce unprotected sexual behavior. The goals of the curriculum are to increase knowledge about HIV, STDs, and pregnancy prevention (including both abstinence and condom use) as well as increase awareness of personal risk of contracting HIV and/or an STD. The curriculum goals also include promoting condom use and condom negotiation skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345812458090">Jemmott &amp; Brown, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Primary goals of this study were to enhance awareness of modes of HIV transmission and increase HIV prevention efforts for youth in the juvenile justice system in the State of Alabama through routine HIV/STD counseling and testing services and through the use of the Making Proud Choices! educational program. Secondary goals were to provide information, education, and skill building and to support prevention-enhancing peer norms through an adolescent-specific, group-level HIV prevention intervention.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1078345812458090">
<title>Design, Setting, and Sample</title>
<p>The institutional review board for human participants at the University of Alabama at Birmingham approved the protocol for this descriptive, correlational study. The study recruited a convenience sample of adolescents from four juvenile detention centers in Alabama. These facilities house approximately 2,600 adolescents annually, with the average length of stay being 6 months. Of these adolescents, approximately 68% are African American, 26% Caucasian, 2% Hispanic, and 4% Asian/other. Reasons for incarceration included, but were not limited to, burglary, unlawful possession of marijuana or controlled substance, assault with deadly weapon, violation of probation, attempted murder, murder, and rape/sodomy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1078345812458090">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Study participants were recruited from 2005 through 2008. Each of the four detention centers had “loco parentis authority,” which allowed access to the youth without parental consent. Adolescents who wanted to participate in the educational intervention only had to give verbal consent and attend the sessions. Adolescents were informed about the study purpose and the voluntary nature of their participation. Inclusion criteria were as follows: residence in one of the four youth detention centers during the time of the intervention, aged 13 to 21, and willingness to participate in intervention. No incentive was provided for participating.</p>
<p>Incarcerated adolescents participated in an educational HIV/STD intervention that was guided by the Making Proud Choices! curriculum. The curriculum consisted of eight modules, which were implemented by the education manager and health educator who were trained in the implementation of the Making Proud Choices! curriculum. The intervention consisted of three 2-hour sessions that were held approximately 1 week apart.</p>
<p>Prior to start of the educational intervention, the adolescents completed a self-report survey, which included demographic and sexual behavior history, knowledge of STDs and HIV, and attitudes about sexual behaviors and condom use. An identical self-report survey excluding the demographic and sexual behavior history items was given immediately following completion of the educational intervention. The pre- and post- survey results were compared for significant differences in knowledge about HIV/STD, intention to use condoms, condom use knowledge, and condom self-efficacy.</p>

<sec id="section8-1078345812458090">
<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section9-1078345812458090">
<title>Sociodemographic information</title>
<p>A sociodemographic questionnaire was used to gather data about participants’ gender, age, race and ethnicity, and HIV status. Data regarding recent sexual activities and their sexual partners’ characteristics (e.g., gender, Intravenous drug user, HIV-positive) were also collected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1078345812458090">
<title>HIV/STD knowledge</title>
<p>Knowledge of HIV/STDs was measured using a 16-item true/false questionnaire about HIV and STD symptoms and modes of transmission. Participants were asked to choose the correct answer to each statement. Items included statements like “A common symptom of STIs is a sore on the penis or vagina” and “You cannot have an STI if you feel perfectly fine.” The score for this scale was calculated by summing the number of correct answers. One point was given for each correct answer. Scores ranged from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating greater knowledge about STDs. Cronbach’s α was .84 for this sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1078345812458090">
<title>Condom use knowledge</title>
<p>Knowledge about the proper use of condoms was measured using a 4-item true/false questionnaire. Participants were again asked to choose the correct answer to each statement. Statements included “The penis should be hard when the condom is put on” and “The condom should be completely unrolled before it is placed on the penis.” The scale score was calculated by summing the number of correct answers. Each correct answer was worth 1 point. The total possible score ranged from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater knowledge about how to properly use a condom. Cronbach’s α was .61 for this sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1078345812458090">
<title>Intent to use condoms</title>
<p>A 9-item questionnaire was used to measure intent to use condoms. Individual items were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 <italic>strongly agree</italic>. Items included statements like “How likely is it that you will decide to use a condom if you have sex after you leave the detention center?” and “I plan to use condoms if I have sex after I leave the detention center.” The scale score was calculated by determining the mean of the participant’s responses, resulting in a scoring range of 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating greater intent to use condoms. For this sample, the Cronbach’s α was .75.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1078345812458090">
<title>Condom self-efficacy</title>
<p>This variable was assessed using 15 statements about confidence in being able to use a condom and in being able to communicate with partner about condom use. Participants again responded to statements on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 <italic>strongly agree</italic>. A widely used and validated scale, Brafford and Beck’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078345812458090">1991</xref>) Condom Use Self-Efficacy Scale, was used as a model for this subscale. In particular, the subscales of “mechanics” (confidence in proper use) and “assertive” (confidence in communication with a partner) followed very closely the self-efficacy subscale in the current study’s questionnaire. The scale score was calculated by determining the mean of the participant’s responses, resulting in a scoring range of 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating greater condom self-efficacy. Brafford and Beck’s scale has a Cronbach’s α of .91. For this sample, the scale had a Cronbach’s α of .84.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1078345812458090">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS v. 17. Descriptive statistics (frequency, percentages, means, and standard deviations) were used to describe the study sample and pre-post survey results. Independent<italic> t-</italic>tests were used to compare differences between males and females on the major study variables (HIV/STD knowledge, condom use knowledge, intent to use condoms, and condom self-efficacy). The relationships among study variables were examined with the use of Pearson’s correlation. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the best predictors of condom self-efficacy among the total sample.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section16-1078345812458090">
<title>Sociodemographic Characteristics</title>
<p>A convenience sample of 662 adolescents, aged 13 to 18, was recruited from the population of incarcerated youth in juvenile detention facilities in Jefferson County, Alabama, between February 2005 and December 2008. The sample included 331 males (mean age 15.5) and 331 females (mean age 15.7). Of the 662 participants, 67.7% (448) were African American, 26.1% (173) Caucasian, 3.8% (25) other, 2.1% (14) Hispanic, 0.2% (1) Asian, and 0.2% (1) multiracial. This sample is similar to other incarcerated juvenile populations that have been reported with regard to STI rates and sexual activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1078345812458090">
<title>Sexual Behavior</title>
<p>Although only 1.5% (10) of study participants reported past positive HIV tests, 8.8% (29) of the males and 29.9% (99) of the females had previously been diagnosed with an STD. The majority of males (68.3%, 226) and females (75.5%, 250) reported having engaged in sexual activity with a member of the opposite sex in the last 6 months, while 23% (76) of males and 19% (63) of females reported anonymous sex partners during this time. Additionally, 7.3% (24) of males and 19.3% (64) of females reported sex with a member of the same sex in the past 6 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345812458090">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Relationships Among Major Study Variables</title>
<p>There was a strong positive relationship between HIV/STD knowledge and condom use knowledge (<italic>r </italic>= .653, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and a moderately weak positive relationship between condom use knowledge and intent to use condoms (<italic>r</italic> = .448, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). A moderately weak positive correlation was also identified between HIV/STD knowledge and intent to use condoms (<italic>r </italic>= .400, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01). These results indicate that neither having knowledge about HIV/STDs nor knowledge of how to correctly use a condom changed participants’ intent to use condoms.</p>
<p>A weak negative relationship was identified between HIV/STD knowledge and condom self-efficacy (<italic>r</italic> = −.081, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). This result indicated that despite being knowledgeable about HIV/STD, participants had low levels of confidence in their ability to negotiate condom use or talk to their partners about condoms. There was a strong positive relationship between intent to use condoms and condom self-efficacy (<italic>r </italic>= .742, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), indicating that participants with high levels of intent to use condoms were likely to have high levels of confidence in their ability to negotiate condom use or communicate with their partner about condom use. There was a moderately weak positive relationship between knowledge about condom use and condom self-efficacy (<italic>r </italic>= .464, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<sec id="section20-1078345812458090">
<title>Predictors of Condom Self-Efficacy</title>
<p>The dependent variable condom self-efficacy was regressed on HIV/STD knowledge, condom use knowledge, and intent to use condoms. These predictors accounted for approximately half of the variance in condom self-efficacy (<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .558), which was significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 level. Intent to use condoms (<italic>B</italic> = .655, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) was the most influential predictor of condom self-efficacy, followed by condom use knowledge (<italic>B</italic> = .154, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). HIV/STD knowledge (<italic>B</italic> = .025, <italic>p</italic> = .545) was not a significant individual predictor of condom self-efficacy.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section21-1078345812458090">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The model that included HIV/STD knowledge, condom use knowledge, and intent to use condoms was a predictor for condom self-efficacy. However, the individual variables were not equal in their ability to predict self-efficacy. An incarcerated adolescent’s intent to use condoms was the greatest predictor of his or her condom self-efficacy. Condom use knowledge also predicted self-efficacy but to a lesser extent. HIV/STD knowledge did not hold up as a predictor.</p>
<p>Despite the female incarcerated youth having greater knowledge than males, there was little change in condom self-efficacy. During class discussions with the Making Proud Choices! group, the girls made comments as to why they do not like to use condoms. They made comments such as “I don’t like the way condoms feel,” “He loves me and he wouldn’t give me a disease,” “He’s my baby daddy and he says that I am the only one that he is having sex with.” Other comments included, “He said that he would pull out before he ejaculated” and/or “He said he know how not to get a girl pregnant . . . so it’s OK to have sex without a condom.”</p>
<p>It is evident by the comments that having knowledge about how HIV and STDs are contracted did not influence the girl’s desire or confidence in consistently using condoms.</p>
<p>Although investigating a population very different from the current study, a study on condom use and self-efficacy in female sex workers in China found significant correlations between self-efficacy and correct condom use knowledge and intent to use condoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345812458090">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Participants who reported intentions to consistently use condoms in the future had significantly higher condom use self-efficacy than those who did not report such intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345812458090">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). The current study’s findings are consistent with the findings of that study.</p>
<p>A consideration for subsequent studies of incarcerated adolescents is the issue of drug and alcohol use. Although only 5.3% (1.2% males, 9.4% females) reported using intravenous drugs and 5.9% (1.8% males, 10.0% females) reported sex with intravenous drug users, approximately 45% of the adolescents (46.5% males, 43.2% females) reported having sex while high or drunk in the past 6 months. It would be helpful to determine whether predictors of condom self-efficacy are still effective in predicting actual condom use during times that adolescents are unable to think as clearly.</p>
<p>Additionally, although this study specifically looked at condom use self-efficacy, future research might give even more insight into predicting safer sex behavior in incarcerated adolescents if other contraceptive and safe sex methods could be included in the questionnaire. Because interventions like Making Proud Choices! include teaching on the female condom and dental dams, among others, it may have been useful to add questions investigating the use of these methods. Even so, it is true that the male condom is one of the most widely known, affordable, and available methods for preventing the transmission of STDs.</p>

<sec id="section22-1078345812458090">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study had some limitations. With regard to the study’s design, it is important to note that the data from the questionnaires were self-reported. It is possible that the participants responded to the questions in a manner that they believed was socially acceptable. In an effort to prevent this occurrence, participants were reassured that there was no identifying information on the demographic data form or questionnaires that would allow anyone to identify the person who completed the questionnaire. Another limitation is the inability to evaluate the long-term effects of the HIV/STD educational intervention. Once adolescents are either released or transferred to another facility, there is no way to track their locations to complete 3-month, 6-month, or 12-month follow-up. Therefore, the researchers are unable to determine the long-term effectiveness of this educational intervention in this study sample.</p>
<p>Despite the study limitations, the findings contribute to the understanding of the sexual risk behaviors of incarcerated adolescents. Additionally, findings indicate that HIV/STD educational interventions for incarcerated adolescents do improve knowledge and attitudes about condoms and condom use. However, much effort is still needed to promote consistent condom use among incarcerated youth to decrease their risk of contracting HIV and/or an STD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1078345812458090">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In considering the results from this study taken together with past research, there are several implications for providers of health care. Findings from this study indicate that a majority of incarcerated adolescents have tested positive for an STD, which increases their vulnerability for contracting HIV. Consequently, health care providers who interact with incarcerated adolescents have the unique opportunity to provide information about HIV, STDs, and safer sex practices (e.g., consistent condom use, fewer sexual partners). Additionally, health care providers in the juvenile justice system are in pivotal roles where they can collaborate with other health care providers in the community public health system to implement HIV/STD educational interventions for incarcerated adolescents.</p>
<p>Collaboration between the criminal justice system (prison, jail, parole, and probation) and the community public health system (social services, medical/health clinics, treatment programs, etc.) is essential. Building partnerships can help tackle public health issues while understanding the challenges of public safety and custody priorities. If we truly want to decrease rates of HIV, STDs, and hepatitis in our communities, we have to work together to create a seamless continuum that will improve prevention, care, and treatment both inside prisons and jails and in disproportionately affected communities.</p>
