<abstract>
<p>An integrative small business adoption of a technology model, which incorporates consumer and organizational behavior theories, is developed and tested to explore the direct and indirect impacts of owner and environmental factors on information technology adoption. Through structural equations modeling we present and test a conceptual framework that examines the interrelationships between owner-related characteristics and perceptions, and environmental-related constructs to predict the adoption of information technology by small retailers. The results indicate that all the tested variables affect the adoption of technology by small businesses directly and/or indirectly through mediating variables. The study advances the literature by creating a small business technology adoption model (SBTAM) that highlights the importance of examining interrelationships between the independent variables. The results have significant implications pertaining to organizations interested in marketing technological innovations to retailers and for small retailers that use this technology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, the adoption and utilization of information technology across the world has emerged as an important research topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242610365512">Grinstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242610365512">Simmons, Armstrong and Durkin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242610365512">Sundaram et al., 2007</xref>), particularly within the entrepreneurship and small business literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242610365512">Schindehutte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0266242610365512">Yli-Renko and Janakiraman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0266242610365512">Zahay and Peltier, 2008</xref>). This attention stems from the belief that the adoption and successful implementation of technology creates sustainable competitive advantages, provides a means for adapting to rapidly changing markets and the opportunities they offer, enhances business operation, and is critical for leveraging applicable systems in the practice of customer-centric marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242610365512">Kim and Pae, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610365512">Kyobe, 2004</xref>). In many ways, small businesses stand to gain the most from the adoption of new technology since they often have great difficulty competing with larger firms and have much to gain through the utilization of technologies such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM) and internet-based capabilities to assist in the development of efficient and effective business strategies and tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242610365512">Cooper et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242610365512">McGee and Sawyerr, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the diffusion literature has provided considerable insights in understanding new product adoption, factors that influence the adoption of technology (especially among small businesses) are not well understood for several reasons. First, few researchers have examined how the owners of small firms influence the adoption of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242610365512">Simmons et al., 2008</xref>). Of potential interest to researchers, owners of small firms incorporate the characteristics as both managers of large organizations and as individual consumers and thus, have a multi-dimensional influence on the adoption process (Stewart et al., 1998). On one hand, small business owners make business decisions based on their individual personality or characteristics to pursue personal goals and to produce income. On the other hand, they follow rules and procedures and control environments when making decisions, similar to that of larger organizations. Despite this dual role, diffusion research in marketing has focused almost exclusively on <italic>either</italic> organizations <italic>or</italic> individual consumers as adopting entities. To this end, research is required that unites consumer and organizational behavior theories to understand better the role of small business owners in technology adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242610365512">Bharadwaj and Menon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0266242610365512">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0266242610365512">Wieseke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0266242610365512">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, in spite of the opportunities information technologies offer small businesses for better inventory management, strategic planning, fulfillment and customer relationship management, there is very little research pertaining to the way small businesses adopt and utilize the information technologies needed for effective knowledge management practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242610365512">Hutchinson and Quintas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610365512">Kyobe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242610365512">Papastathopoulou et al., 2007</xref>). Even less is known about how personal characteristics of small business owners and environmental complexities affect technology adoption and innovativeness by small firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242610365512">Bhaskaran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242610365512">Simmons et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0266242610365512">Yli-Renko and Janakiraman, 2008</xref>). Given the critical role that new technologies play in generating competitive advantages for small retail firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242610365512">Brooksbank, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610365512">Kyobe, 2004</xref>), and that small retail firms have been slow in adopting technological innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242610365512">Mohr et al., 2009</xref>), research to understand better what motivates technology adoption by these firms is warranted.</p>
<p>Third, to date, much of the extant research in marketing has been on identifying factors that influence the rate and depth of the diffusion of new products and services by the user (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242610365512">Shih and Venkatesh, 2004</xref>). Little research has been devoted to developing comprehensive models that examine the interrelationships between factors that purportedly influence the diffusion of customer-centric information systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242610365512">Avlonitis and Panagopoulos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242610365512">Papastathopoulou et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, although studies exist that have conceptualized and/or tested comprehensive and interactive diffusion models, relatively few studies have examined interactive relationships between small business owner- and environmental-related innovation variables and how this integration affects the adoption of technology by businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0266242610365512">Wieseke et al., 2008</xref>). As a consequence, research is needed that explores how antecedent factors interact in the face of mediating relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610365512">Speier and Venkatesh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242610365512">Srinivasan et al., 2002</xref>). In that the overwhelming majority of innovation studies limit their investigations to main effects, research that examines direct and indirect impacts of key antecedents on technology adoption and use is especially warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242610365512">Grinstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242610365512">Henard and Szymanski, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Given these issues, an ideal context in which to test interactive decision models that incorporate a range of individual/owner and environmental variables is that of small businesses and especially small retail firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242610365512">Pelham and Wilson, 1996</xref>). Many researchers agree that owner-manager individual characteristics should be an integral part of small business technology adoption since they have significant effect on small business decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242610365512">Simmons et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242610365512">Mohr et al., 2009</xref>). To be successful over time, owner-managers of smaller retail organizations, like those of their larger counterparts, need to develop and implement strategic plans that match internal organizational capabilities with environmental opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242610365512">Escriba-Esteve et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242610365512">Fillis and Wagner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242610365512">Fuller-Love, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0266242610365512">Yli-Renko and Janakiraman, 2008</xref>). While large firms tend to operate in a decision-making environment that involves diverse groups of individuals and a variety of organizational policies and practices and so on, in small firms, owners and lead managers play the primary roles in the decision of whether to adopt an innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242610365512">Bhaskaran, 2006</xref>). This is especially true when the adoption of information technology is being considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242610365512">Fillis and Wagner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242610365512">Kim and Pae, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of our study is extend the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al. (2009)</xref> to develop an integrative diffusion of an innovations model, which explores the interrelationships between key owner and environmental factors and the likelihood that entrepreneurs in small retail firms will adopt technological innovations. The specific focus of this study is on the adoption of information technology by âsmall retailâ firms. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242610365512">US Small Business Administration (SBA) (2009)</xref> uses a US$7,000,000 sales benchmark for denoting a retailer as being a small business. In our study we target small retailers on the low end of the SBA sales continuum and those with a relatively small number of employees. Attention is given to exploring the causal links between the factors identified in the literature that have been shown previously to independently influence the diffusion of innovations. These factors include: (1) owner characteristics (product class knowledge, attitude toward change, owner demographics); (2) ownerâs perceptions of technology (relative advantage and switching costs); and (3) ownerâs perceptions of environmental turbulence (market uncertainty and environmental hostility). Our work is thus motivated by the call for research that reduces the technological divide between large versus small firms regarding the asymmetry in information and technology adoption and use and how entrepreneurs make decisions regarding the adoption process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242610365512">Kaufman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242610365512">Loane, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Research questions</title>
<p>Given the preceding discussion, this article attempts to address the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0266242610365512" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Extending <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al. (2009)</xref>, (a) do the <italic>significant</italic> relationships/paths between the explanatory variables and technology adoption by small firms hold when interactions/indirect paths are included in the model? And, (b) do the <italic>directional</italic> relationships between owner characteristics, ownerâs perception of technology, and ownerâs perception of environmental turbulence hold when interactions/indirect paths are included in the model?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To assess whether (a) owner characteristics (product class knowledge, attitude toward change, owner demographics) affect their perceptions of environmental turbulence and technology, (b) ownersâ perceptions of environmental turbulence affect their perceptions of technology and (c) to understand better the interrelations between model variables.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The study contributes to the innovation literature in several ways. First, we present, discuss and test a comprehensive conceptual framework for theorizing possible relationships between innovation adoption behavior, small business owner-manager characteristics, and environmental variables. Second, through causal modeling techniques we investigate how the direct relationships between these variables and diffusion are affected when indirect paths are included in the model. Last, we develop a better understanding of the underlying interactions driving the adoption or non-adoption of technological innovations by entrepreneurs in small retail firms, a population that has been largely neglected by researchers.</p>
<sec id="section4-0266242610365512">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>To develop a model of small business adoption of technological innovations (SBTAM) we started with the realization that technology adoption by entrepreneurs is multi-faceted and includes a host of individual/owner and environmental variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242610365512">Kim and Pae, 2007</xref>). The model that we developed was influenced by two research streams. First, we considered the adoption of innovation work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242610365512">Rodgers (2003)</xref>, which focused primarily on product-related issues (perceptions) about innovations. Second, we included the findings from the technology acceptance model (TAM) proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242610365512">Davis (1989)</xref>, and extended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242610365512">Venkatesh and Davis (2000)</xref>, which investigated adoption antecedents such as psychological predispositions, social influences, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Given these previous approaches to modeling the adoption of innovations, we developed a framework that focused on (1) owner characteristics (product class knowledge, attitude toward change, age and education), (2) ownerâs perceptions of technology (relative advantage, switching costs) and (3) environmental factors (market uncertainty and environmental hostility). Although few comprehensive diffusion of innovation models have empirically tested interrelationships between individual/owner and environmental dimensions, and virtually none for small retail firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242610365512">Kozan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242610365512">Richbell et al., 2006</xref>), there is an established body of literature that can be used to identify key antecedent variables.</p>
<sec id="section5-0266242610365512">
<title>Owner characteristics</title>
<p>Previous research in consumer and organizational adoption of innovation has found that some individual characteristics can significantly impact the adoption of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242610365512">Simmons et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610365512">Speier and Venkantesh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0266242610365512">Waarts et al., 2002</xref>). Critical factors include ownerâs product class knowledge, attitude toward change and demographic variables such as age and education.</p>
<p><italic>Product class knowledge</italic> is an important variable that relates to a prospective adopterâs level of knowledge with the product category under scrutiny. It is common for highly technological innovations that product-related knowledge is relatively limited or incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610365512">Speier and Venkatesh, 2002</xref>). Some possible consequences of limited category-based knowledge might be that prospects will not have the cognitive ability to adequately understand problems, new ideas or decision scenarios, to identify solution criteria or to develop effective strategies for coping with innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242610365512">Shih and Venkatesh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610365512">Speier and Venkatesh, 2002</xref>). Product class knowledge influences both information search behavior and evaluation processes and thus, is closely related to small business ownersâ adoption of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242610365512">Marinova, 2004</xref>). <italic>Attitude toward change</italic> reflects the general acceptance of new ideas, a risk-taking propensity and/or a preference for innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242610365512">Shih and Venkatesh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0266242610365512">Wieseke et al., 2008</xref>). Small business ownersâ attitude toward change is a prerequisite to change and remains critical to the adoption of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242610365512">Bharadwaj and Menon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0266242610365512">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). Studies show that earlier adopters have a more favorable attitude toward change than later adopters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242610365512">Rogers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0266242610365512">Troy et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, entrepreneursâ attitude toward change and personal risk orientation may influence their technology adoption decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242610365512">Kickul and Gundry, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0266242610365512">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, we investigate how small business ownersâ attitudinal and psychographical factors affect the adoption of technology.</p>
<p>The <italic>demographic characteristics</italic> of consumers and organizations have received attention in the general product adoption literature. However, research investigating how demographic profiles of small business decision makers impact the readiness to adopt technologies and relevant antecedent states is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0266242610365512">Wieseke et al., 2008</xref>). Previous research has found that two demographic factors significantly influence the adoption of technology: owner age and level of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0266242610365512">
<title>Ownersâ perceptions of technology</title>
<p>The concept of perceptions of technology is based on the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242610365512">Rogers (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610365512">Speier and Venkatesh (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0266242610365512">Waarts et al. (2002)</xref>. When companies or individual consumers make adoption decisions, they will assess the perceived advantages of the new technology and the adoption costs by comparing the new system with the current situation or available alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0266242610365512">Waarts et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0266242610365512">Wieseke et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with the technology acceptance model TAM, we are especially interested in identifying cultural factors within the organization useful for distinguishing entrepreneurial managers from owner-managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0266242610365512">Zahay and Peltier, 2008</xref>). Earlier research highlighted the importance of ownerâs perceptions of technology to the adoption of technology, which includes perceived <italic>relative advantage</italic> and <italic>switching costs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242610365512">Goslar, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Relative advantage</italic> refers to the degree to which an innovation has characteristics that are superior to the current products or practices offered by the business or its competition. The adoption of a technology will proceed more rapidly if small business owners think that the adoption will help the organization improve competitive position in the marketplace and acquire and retain customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242610365512">Mole et al., 2004</xref>). Specific to ERP and other forms of electronic information capture and use platforms, perceived relative advantage could be considered in terms of the degree to which the information technology offers an enhanced ability to provide efficient backroom operations and superior customer interfaces and support services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242610365512">Goslar, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242610365512">Simmons et al., 2008</xref>). It is important to note that the acquisition and implementation of innovations may lead to potential costs â <italic>switching costs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242610365512">Burham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610365512">Speier and Venkatesh, 2002</xref>). Usually, the small retailer is already utilizing a certain technology for customer service and in order to apply the newer technology the retailer must replace this existing technology. Switching cost includes much more than just the technology replacement cost; it also includes potentially new application software, training, learning and other costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242610365512">Avlonitis and Panagopoulos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242610365512">Burnham et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>The environment in which a small retailer operates is a key factor likely to affect the diffusion of technological innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242610365512">Fillis and Wagner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242610365512">Kaufman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242610365512">Loane, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0266242610365512">Zang et al., 2006</xref>).

In turbulent, rapidly changing business environments, acquiring technologies such as ERP that allow firms to respond to changing market needs and reduce uncertainty is critical for business survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242610365512">Kim and Pae, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0266242610365512">Wade and Hulland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0266242610365512">Wang and Ang, 2004</xref>). Notwithstanding, there is a general lack of models in the diffusion literature of how organizations adapt to turbulent and uncertain environments through the adoption of technological innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242610365512">Souder et al., 1998</xref>). This dearth of literature is especially true for entrepreneurs in small business settings trying to survive in increasingly complex and turbulent environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242610365512">McGee and Rubach, 1996/1997</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Market uncertainty</italic> can be conceptualized in terms of market complexity and represents the difficulty experienced by small businesses when performing various organizational functions such as selling tasks, monitoring inventories, setting price, tracking customers et cetera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242610365512">Sawyerr et al., 2003</xref>). In response to market uncertainty, successful organizations tend to be those that take a customer orientation when developing and implementing technological innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242610365512">Kara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610365512">Kyobe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0266242610365512">Verhees and Meulenberg, 2004</xref>). Despite the importance of taking a customer-oriented perspective to reducing market uncertainty, how this orientation impacts the successful adoption of technologies has yet to be fully addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242610365512">Grinstein, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Environmental hostility</italic> is characteristic of industries marked by increased competitive intensity and difficulties associated with assessing customer needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242610365512">Calantone et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242610365512">Escriba-Esteve et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>). Hostile environments have some commonality, including a high degree of heterogeneity in consumer preferences, intensive competition and lack of predictability of market opportunity and growth.

<title>Adoption of innovation</title>
<p>The diffusion process culminates with the decision of whether or not to adopt an innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242610365512">Mahajan et al., 1990</xref>). From <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0266242610365512">Veryzer (1998</xref>: 138), an innovation can be defined as âlying along dimensions reflecting changes in: product benefits, technological capabilities, and consumption or usage patternsâ. Expanded further, âtechnologicalâ innovations are those that utilize systematic applications of scientific and technical knowledge that place them near the leading edge of a particular field. They represent the stock of relevant knowledge for deriving new techniques and include both product and process know-how (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242610365512">John et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>). Although there is strong evidence suggesting that information technology offers avenues for increased productivity and competitive advantages, retailers tend to under-utilize available state-of-the-art information technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242610365512">Im et al., 2007</xref>). Entrepreneurs and small businesses have been especially reticent to incorporate information technology into their daily operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0266242610365512">Sullivan and Kang, 1999</xref>). The ever increasing competitive pressures facing entrepreneurs make it critical for small retail firms to utilize advancing technologies, especially those that will allow them to be more customer-oriented and that will help establish greater operational efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242610365512">Mohr et al., 2009</xref>).

<title>Research hypotheses and model development</title>
<p>The preceding review described eight variables that empirical studies have linked with technology adoption. The conceptual TAM developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242610365512">Davis (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242610365512">Venkatesh and Davis (2000)</xref> clearly implied that these eight variables are interrelated and should be explored in a comprehensive equation model. However, few studies have been conducted to explore the impact of these variables on technology adoption in a simultaneous model system. We now propose hypotheses that explore the direct and indirect paths between the eight variables and technology adoption. The path model that depicts the hypothesized relationships is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242610365512">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Product class knowledge</title>
<p>Small business ownersâ product class knowledge is strongly associated with the adoption of technology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242610365512">Hirschman (1980)</xref> noted that individuals with lower knowledge will associate higher levels of complexity and incompatibility to the innovation. This, in turn, translates into greater levels of cognitive effort needed to comprehend and evaluate an innovation. This relationship between knowledge, cognitive effort and search is supported in the organizational buying literature and is likely to lengthen the buying process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242610365512">Im et al., 2007</xref>). In combination, greater product knowledge should lead to a higher probability of adopting an innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242610365512">Srinivasan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0266242610365512">Wieseke et al., 2008</xref>). Past studies have shown that greater product knowledge leads to a higher probability of adopting an innovation, especially in knowledge intensive firms seeking to get close to their customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242610365512">Garcia, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242610365512">Vermeulen, 2005</xref>). Specific to the adoption of ERP technology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242610365512">Avlonitis and Panagopoulos (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242610365512">Buehrer et al. (2005)</xref> found that firms need to focus on technical training and support for implementing to enhance the adoption of this technology. We would expect that small business owners with limited understanding of ERP technology will be less predisposed to adopt these technologies into their operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242610365512">Bhaskaran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242610365512">Kozan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242610365512">Oviatt and McDougall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242610365512">Vermeulen, 2005</xref>). We posit the following hypothesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>H1: The greater the knowledge with a product class, the more likely an innovation will be adopted by a small retailer.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although not well understood in the literature, product class expertise is hypothesized in our model to impact both perceived relative advantage and perceived switching costs. Using the preceding arguments, novices are less able to identify key attributes and comprehend the superior benefits associated with a new product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610365512">Speier and Venkatesh, 2002</xref>). The perceived level of relative advantage is also expected to be lowered if the innovation demands new knowledge or skill that destroys the value of the customerâs prior experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242610365512">Guiltinan, 1999</xref>). A lack of specialized knowledge is also expected to increase perceived switching costs because of the time, effort and resources needed to train less familiar users on specific functions of the innovation and ways in which the innovation may be effectively utilized within the organization (Burham et al., 1998). This reasoning can be employed to justify the following hypothesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>H2: Knowledge with a product class is (a) positively related to perceived relative advantage of the innovation and (b) negatively related to perceived switching costs.</p>

<title>Attitude toward change</title>
<p>A small business ownerâs attitude toward change is the willingness of the owner to invest in new products/processes under conditions of uncertainty, not because of compulsions of survival, but on account of their pursuit of excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>). Some business owners have conservative attitudes and use methods and technologies that have served them well in the past. Conversely, other managers are more apt to take risks and adopt more innovative techniques. Previous studies show that attitude toward change greatly influences the rate and overall acceptance of new technology. Small business owners who have a positive attitude toward change tend to be more creative, have a more favorable attitudes toward risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610365512">Kitchell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0266242610365512">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>), are more venturesome and socially oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242610365512">Rogers, 2003</xref>), are more confident in their decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242610365512">Kickul and Gundry, 2002</xref>) and are more open-minded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0266242610365512">Troy et al., 2001</xref>). This leads to the following hypothesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>H3: The more favorable the attitude toward change, the more likely an innovation will be adopted by a small retailer.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The relationship between attitude toward change and other variables is less clear in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610365512">Speier and Venkatesh, 2002</xref>). However, the preceding discussion suggests that a more favorable attitude toward change is positively related to seeking and accepting new ideas, communicating with others, being creative and having a better understanding of the technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0266242610365512">Thompson et al., 1991</xref>). Intuitively, these characteristics should translate to greater product knowledge across a wide range of categories. Moreover, because individuals/organizations with a more favorable attitude toward change are also less risk averse, they should be more proactive in their decision making and more cognizant of the inherent complexities in their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0266242610365512">Wieseke et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, individuals and organizations that are more acceptant of change should be more willing to challenge uncertain environments. Exploratory hypotheses regarding attitude toward change include:
<disp-quote>
<p>H4: Owner-managerâs attitude toward change is positively related to (a) product class knowledge, (b) market uncertainty and (c) environmental hostility.</p>

<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242610365512">Morris and Venkatesh (2000)</xref> found that the age of the firm owner can affect the way decisions are made within small firms. Younger individuals are more likely to be earlier adopters of innovations. Older owners, on the contrary, may be more conservative and risk averse than their younger colleagues leading to a lower chance of embracing a new technology such as the information technology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242610365512">Morris and Venkatesh (2000)</xref> also found that older owners were less likely to have a positive attitude toward technology and were less likely to adopt it. This finding may be due in part to the fact that younger owners have greater knowledge and experience with technological products, leading to lower switching costs. At the same time, younger owners are less risk cautious and have more positive views toward change. Hypotheses pertaining to direct and indirect relationships between age and adoption are as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>H5: The age of the decision maker is inversely related to the likelihood that an innovation will be adopted by a small retailer.</p>
<p>H6: The age of the decision maker is inversely related to perceived (a) product class knowledge and (b) attitude toward change.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Diffusion studies have also found that education and intelligence are positively related to the propensity to adopt innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242610365512">Dickerson and Gentry, 1983</xref>). More educated individuals are associated with low switching costs since they typically have higher status occupations, have greater knowledge and a better understanding of the functions of technological products (for example, computers) and view the environment as being less complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242610365512">Dickerson and Gentry, 1983</xref>). Moreover, educated individuals typically have a greater exposure to new ideas and are less risk averse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242610365512">Rogers, 2003</xref>). The direct and indirect relational hypotheses for our model are as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>H7: The education level of the decision maker is positively related to the likelihood that an innovation will be adopted by a small retailer.</p>
<p>H8: The education level of the decision maker is positively related to perceived (a) product class knowledge and (b) attitude toward change.</p>

<title>Relative advantage</title>
<p>Relative advantage has been found to be one of the strongest predictors of innovation diffusion rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242610365512">Henard and Szymanski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242610365512">Im et al., 2007</xref>; Kaufman et al., 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242610365512">Schepers and Wetzels, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242610365512">Shih and Venkatesh, 2004</xref>). Supporters of ERP software contend that information technology adoption enhances customer lifetime value through increased customer-oriented and superior operational efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610365512">Li et al., 2008</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242610365512">Mohr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0266242610365512">Zahay and Peltier, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242610365512">Han et al. (1998)</xref> argued perceived advantage of an innovation is positively related to the rate of adoption. If small business owners understand that the new technology can enhance firm competitive advantage and better meet customer needs, they are more likely to utilize the technology. Although essentially unexplored in a small business setting, the value and utilization of ERP and other enabling technologies has been tied to its usefulness in generating business and operational success across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242610365512">Avlonitis and Panagopoulos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242610365512">Buehrer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242610365512">Oviatt and McDougall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242610365512">Plakoyiannaki, 2005</xref>).

<sec id="section14-0266242610365512">
<title>Switching costs</title>
<p>In a broad sense, switching costs add to the total costs associated with adopting an innovation. When switching costs pertaining to a particular innovation are high, the likelihood of adopting the innovation is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610365512">Speier and Venkatesh, 2002</xref>). New technologies that require changes in how a business is managed may play a major role in how potential users evaluate new goods and services. Specifically, though a new technology might offer high relative advantage, such advantages might be offset by increased product complexities that deflate compatibility and product benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242610365512">Vermeulen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0266242610365512">Veryzer, 1998</xref>). With this in mind, and contrary to the increased benefits that accrue to uncertainty-reducing innovations, switching costs associated with a new technology are negative consequences and should lower the perceived relative advantage of an innovation and/or the motivation to make a change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242610365512">Burham et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Market uncertainty and environmental hostility</title>
<p>The adoption of information based technology such as ERP is likely to be very important when market conditions are characterized by high uncertainty and hostility, and firms are attempting to gain a competitive advantage via innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242610365512">McGee and Sawyerr, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242610365512">Papastathopoulou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0266242610365512">Wang and Ang, 2004</xref>).

One response to environmental turbulence is to implement a policy of aggressive technological acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0266242610365512">Wang and Ang, 2004</xref>).

Specifically, environmental turbulence drives owners to place greater priority on seeking out and adopting environment-simplifying innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610365512">Kyobe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0266242610365512">Wang and Ang, 2004</xref>). Technological innovations that have the ability to reduce market uncertainty and environmental hostility may provide entrepreneurs with an additional benefit and add to the relative advantage value of the innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610365512">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Specific to ERP information technology, these arguments have been used to highlight the potential productivity benefits (for example, sales forecasting, inventory control, prospect profiling and so on) associated with the use of computers by salespeople (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610365512">Speier and Venkatesh, 2002</xref>). We thus propose the following hypothesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>H13: The greater the perceived (a) market uncertainty, and (b) environmental hostility, the higher will be the perceived relative advantage of the innovation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We also predict a positive relationship between environmental hostility and market uncertainty. As discussed before, hostile environments are characterized by unstable consumer preferences and rapid changes of technological standards, leading to a more complex market and uncertain environment for small businesses to make strategic decisions such as technological adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242610365512">Ozsomer et al., 1997</xref>). As environmental hostility increases, small business owners cannot accurately predict the outcomes of a specific decision, and cannot know how changing customer needs and technological innovation affect their business performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242610365512">Covin and Slevin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al., 2009</xref>). We propose:
<disp-quote>
<p>H14: The greater the perceived environmental hostility, the greater the perceived market uncertainty.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the focus of this study is on small businesses, we include a control variable, firm size (number of employees), to explore the effects of firm size on the theoretical constructs in this study.</p>

<title>Research methodology</title>
<sec id="section17-0266242610365512">
<title>Research setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted in conjunction with a national buying cooperative in the hardware and variety business. As part of their organization, the cooperative markets a state-of-the-art computerized scanner-based ERP information management system. An ERP system comprises a single database being utilized and containing all data for various software modules. These software modules can include manufacturing, financials, accounting, human resources, supply-chain management, project management, customer relationship management and data warehousing. The cooperative promoted the ERP system as a technology that would dramatically change how member stores track and process customer- and store-related data to its member-owners. While the advantages of the ERP system were presented to the store owners, adoption was slow. The cooperative was interested in understanding the adoption of this and future technological offerings to their members.</p>
<p>This particular small business situation possessed a number of characteristics that made it a particularly interesting research setting. First, the utilization of member-owners as social entities afforded the opportunity to test diffusion of innovation theories at both the organizational and individual level. Second, the hardware and variety business is relatively complex and turbulent, with small business owners facing intense competition from larger entities. Third, the ERP information management system is a considerable technological advancement over membersâ current practices. There are significant costs and benefits associated with the ERP applications allowing the researchers to evaluate the usefulness as first researched by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242610365512">Davis (1989)</xref> with the TAM. Fourth, the ERP technology is relatively complex requiring a concerted effort and major changes in the small businessâ practices to implant the application effectively. This allows for research pertaining to the ease of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242610365512">Davis, 1989</xref>). Fifth, the adoption of this technology is not without risks. There have been a significant number of implementation failures suggesting that ERP applications are not conducive to every situation. Sixth, since relatively few of the cooperative members had purchased the ERP system, those that had adopted the product could be categorized as being âinnovatorsâ (Rogers, 1995, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242610365512">2003</xref>). This created a wonderful opportunity to test the hypothesized relationships by investigating the differences of adopters and non-adopters of the ERP system. Finally, the major suppliers of ERP systems that have experience in dealing with adoption issues at large firms suggest that the adoption process at smaller firms is likely to be dramatically different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0266242610365512">Verhees and Meulenberg, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0266242610365512">
<title>Questionnaire development</title>
<p>Initial stages of the questionnaire development process focused on identifying key diffusion dimensions in the literature. Next, 12 cooperative members that had purchased the ERP information management system and experts in the field were contacted to help identify issues pertaining to environmental uncertainty, relative advantage and potential switching costs. A draft of the questionnaire was developed and distributed to the cooperativeâs sales team managers. Minor changes were made and the instrument was pretested and finalized.</p>
<p>The specific items used to measure each variable and the respective reliability coefficients are contained in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610365512">Table 2</xref>. Each of the items related to relative advantage, market uncertainty, environmental hostility, switching costs, product knowledge and attitude towards change were reported on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0266242610365512">
<title>Sample and data collection</title>
<p>Each of the 322 owner-managers that had purchased the system (roughly five percent of all stores) and 500 randomly selected non-adopters were mailed the survey instrument containing questions related to the seven innovation dimensions. A large number of non-adopter stores were selected because of the assumption that there would be a lower response rate for this group. A total of 142 usable adopter questionnaires (45 percent response rate) and 219 non-adopters questionnaires (44 percent response rate) were returned, for a total of 361 usable surveys. Given that the response rates were nearly identical, response bias for adopter and non-adopter stores is low. These high response rates compare favorably to those obtained in other organizational settings. Though demographics for the individual stores were not included in the analysis, business and owner demographics for the sample were compared to the total (and known) population. No significant differences were found between the sample and the population, indicating a low probability for non-response bias.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242610365512">Table 1</xref> presents the profiles of respondents, which the franchisor management team deemed to be very representative of the entire population of stores. Particularly important is that the stores are clearly small in size, with the average store having 15.5 full- and part-time employees and over 80 percent of the stores having 20 or fewer employees. Moreover, the average sales revenue per store is US$1.6 million, with 78.9 percent having sales of less than US$2 million. In this regard, and consistent with the focus of the study, we are capturing relatively small businesses within the overall subset of small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) classifications. Although the questionnaire did not contain a question of where the business was located, virtually all states were included in the original mailing list.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Initially, the 48 items representing the six theoretical constructs were subjected to an exploratory principle components factor analysis. Items with low and/or multiple factor loadings were dropped from the assessment. Items of each construct were carefully examined to make sure that all items were loaded based on theory. Next, the remaining items were subjected to an item to total correlation analysis. Items with low item to total correlations were eliminated. The coefficient alpha for each of the measures was computed to estimate the reliability. As is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610365512">Table 2</xref>, the coefficient alphas range from 0.708 to 0.912, indicating satisfactory levels of reliability for the measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242610365512">Nunnally, 1978</xref>). The items were then subjected to a confirmatory factor analysis to corroborate the unidimensionality of the measures. Specifically, a model was estimated in which the items were required to load on their a priori specified factors with each factor allowed to correlate with the other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242610365512">Gerbing and Anderson, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The measurement model was estimated using LISREL. While the overall Chi square statistic for the model was significant (chi square = 593.80, 309 df, <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.01) and was expected given sample size, other measures of fit provided stronger support for the measurement model. The comparative fit index (CFI = 0.94) and the goodness of fit index (GFI = 0.90) all suggest that the model depicts a good fit of the data. The standardized factor loadings of the measurement model and the intercorrelations of the factors are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610365512">Table 2</xref>. All of the factor loadings were large and significant at the 0.01 level. In conclusion, the results of the confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence of the unidimensionality of the measures.</p>
<p>Finally, a series of measurement models were estimated in which the correlation between each of the pairs of factors was set to unity. The fit of each of the restricted models was compared to the original measurement model. In each case, the restricted model fit was significantly worse than the original model. This result provides evidence of discriminant validity of the factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242610365512">Bagozzi et al., 1991</xref>). In summary, the results suggested that the measures were distinct and reliable.</p>
<p>Next, a full structural model based on the hypotheses presented earlier was developed and estimated using LISREL. The proposed model is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242610365512">Figure 1</xref>. Paths from firm size to relative advantage, switching costs, product class knowledge, market uncertainty, environmental hostility and attitude toward change were freely estimated to explore the effect of firm size on these constructs. A quadratic term for age was included in the test to capture the possible nonlinear effects of age. The overall Chi square value for the structural model was significant (Chi square 1003.59, 427 df), as might be expected given the size of the sample. However, other fit indices that were not directly tied to sample size, the GFI (0.95), the CFI (0.98) and the incremental fit index (IFI = 0.98) all provided evidence of a good fit. These results provided strong evidence that the model was an excellent fit of the data and a logical basis to test the substantive hypotheses. The results of the tests of the individual hypotheses are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242610365512">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266242610365512">Figure 2</xref>. Corresponding parameter estimates and corresponding <italic>t</italic>-values are included. Since the measurement model results are similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242610365512">Table 1</xref>, only the structural model parameter estimates are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610365512">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Overall, 16 of the 21 proposed hypotheses/paths were found to be significant, including six of the eight proposed direct relationships between the antecedent variables and adoption, and 10 of the 13 proposed interrelationships. Firm size was found to have significant and negative impacts on switching costs and market uncertainty and a significant and positive impact on attitude toward change. Finally, age square is not related to adoption, product class knowledge and attitude toward change. Nonlinear effects of age were not found.</p>

<title>Discussion and theoretical implications</title>
<p>This study extends the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242610365512">Guiltinan (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242610365512">John et al. (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610365512">Speier and Venkatesh (2002)</xref>, which proposed comprehensive models of adoption of innovations. The primary contribution of this study is that it proposes and tests a model of the interrelationships between key individual, organizational and environmental factors associated with the diffusion of innovations by small retail firms. These factors included product class knowledge, attitude toward change, decision maker demographics, relative advantage, switching costs, market uncertainty and environmental hostility. The results indicate that both the <italic>direct effects</italic> and the <italic>interrelationships</italic> among the variables are essential for explaining and predicting diffusion behavior.</p>
<sec id="section22-0266242610365512">
<title>Product class knowledge</title>
<p>Product class knowledge of the decision maker was a major influence in the adoption of the innovation. Specifically, product class knowledge had a direct positive influence on both the adoption of the innovation (H1) and on the assessment of relative advantage (H2a). This result supports the notion that small businesses that are able to learn about new technologies are more likely to be proactive in their decisions to adopt new technology to enhance their businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0266242610365512">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Our findings support the view that proactive owner-managers in small businesses which have made efforts to understand new technology, such as ERP, are more likely to adopt this technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242610365512">Bhaskaran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242610365512">Choi and Shepherd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242610365512">Kozan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242610365512">Oviatt and McDougall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242610365512">Shepherd and DeTienne, 2005</xref>). The findings pertaining to product class knowledge support and build on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242610365512">Garcia (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242610365512">Vermeulen (2005)</xref> by demonstrating that product class knowledge is a key factor in understanding the relative advantages and eventually the adoption of new technology.</p>
<p>In addition, as product knowledge increased, the perceived switching costs decreased (H2b). These findings contribute to our understanding of how knowledge relates to the adoption of innovations. In particular, the more owner-managers knew about the product class encompassing the innovation, the more likely they were to adopt it. Product class knowledge resulted in an increase in the perceived relative advantages of the innovation, while the perceived switching costs were lowered if owner-managers had experience and knowledge in the product class.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0266242610365512">
<title>Attitude toward change</title>
<p>The hypotheses pertaining to attitude toward change were generally supported. A positive attitude toward change did lead to a greater likelihood of adopting the innovation (H3), a greater knowledge of the product class (H4a) and greater perceived environmental hostility (H4c). This generally supports the entrepreneurship literature that suggests that small business owners that have a greater tolerance for risk and change are more likely to accept industry-wide changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242610365512">McGee and Sawyerr, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0266242610365512">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>). Surprisingly, we found a negative relationship between attitude towards change and market uncertainty, which is contrary to the prediction of H4b. The investigation of the relationships between attitude toward change and other factors that influence the adoption of an innovation is a significant contribution in itself, since little work has been done in this area. Overall, attitude toward change had major direct and indirect influences on the adoption of the innovation although we found a negative relationship between attitude toward change and market uncertainty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0266242610365512">
<title>Age</title>
<p>Contrary to previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242610365512">Morris and Venkatesh, 2000</xref>) and the proposed model, the results indicate that the age of the decision maker did not have a significant direct impact on the likelihood of adopting the innovation (H5) and attitude toward change (H6b). However, age did have a significant negative influence on product class knowledge (H6a) and therefore an indirect effect on adoption through paths among product class knowledge, switching costs and relative advantage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0266242610365512">
<title>Education</title>
<p>Education was found to be more influential than age in impacting differential innovation adoption behavior. While the proposed relationship between education and attitude towards change (H8b) was not supported, the education level of the decision maker had a direct positive impact on adoption (H7) and product class knowledge (H8a). These findings are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242610365512">Morris and Venkatesh (2000)</xref> and are intuitively appealing given the nature of the product being investigated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0266242610365512">
<title>Relative advantage</title>
<p>As proposed, relative advantage had a direct positive influence on adoption (H9). This finding is consistent with research of technology/innovation diffusion that product relative advantage is a major driving force for the adoption of an innovation (Rodgers 2003). While relative advantage is considered to be a key factor in adoption, it has received relatively little empirical investigation in small business settings. It is worthwhile to note that relative advantage remained significant even after all of the remaining factorsâ direct and indirect influences on the adoption of the innovation were jointly examined. Moreover, given the many significant paths into relative advantage, its importance to the overall model in terms of interrelationships between variables cannot be overstated. The perceived relative advantage of the innovation was a key predictor of its adoption. This finding is consistent with research of technology/innovation diffusion that product relative advantage is a major driving force for the adoption of an innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242610365512">Mohr et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0266242610365512">
<title>Switching costs</title>
<p>The proposed direct negative relationship between switching costs and adoption was not significant (H10). However, higher switching costs did decrease the perceived relative advantage of the technological innovation (H11) thus, lowering the likelihood of adopting the innovation. Apparently, owner-managers weigh the effect of the switching costs against the benefits associated with the product. This is somewhat contradictory to findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al. (2009)</xref> where switching costs were not found to be a significant predictor of the adoption of an innovation. Given the cost and difficulty of implementation of ERP system technology, it seems logical that switching costs would have a significant influence in this product category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0266242610365512">
<title>Market uncertainty</title>
<p>The effect of perceived market uncertainty was as predicted. Market uncertainty had a direct influence on the adoption of the technological innovation (H12a). This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242610365512">McGee and Sawyerr (2003)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242610365512">Papastathopoulou et al. (2007)</xref>, indicating that firms who take a customer orientation by focusing on solving customersâ problems are more successful at launching technological innovations. However, market uncertainty had no significant impact on relative advantage (H13a).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0266242610365512">
<title>Environmental hostility</title>
<p>Consistent with the proposed model, environmental hostility directly influences the adoption of the innovation (H12b). Further, environmental hostility also has a significant positive impact on relative advantage (H13b). As such, environmental hostility directly and indirectly affects adoption through relative advantage. Conceptually, this also implies that the simple fact that a small business owner perceives that it is operating in a hostile environment is a major reason to adopt an innovation; and at the same time, as owner-managers experienced more hostile environments they were also more likely to realize the relative advantage of a technological innovation that promised to reduce the risk of a volatile environment. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242610365512">Kara et al. (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242610365512">Oviatt and McDougall (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0266242610365512">Verhees and Meulenberg (2004)</xref>, indicating that small businesses perceiving a greater level of competitive intensity and heterogeneity in consumer preferences were more likely to adopt a new technology such as ERP if they understand the benefits it can provide. The bottom line is that competitive forces are likely to spur the need to adopt enabling technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610365512">Kyobe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242610365512">Oviatt and McDougall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0266242610365512">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of the magnitude of path coefficients</title>
<p>Analyzing the magnitude of coefficients of direct paths from theoretical constructs to ERP adoption in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610365512">Table 2</xref>, it is found that market uncertainty, environmental hostility and product class knowledge have large and direct impacts on ERP adoption (coefficients = 0.27, -0.26 and 0.22, respectively), followed by attitude toward change and relative advantage (coefficients = 0.16 and 0.15, respectively). Environmental hostility, attitude toward change and product class knowledge are three critical factors when examining the indirect paths in the model. Environmental hostilityâs impacts on market uncertainty (path coefficient = 0.63) and relative advantage (path coefficient = 0.47), attitude toward changeâs impacts on product class knowledge (path coefficient = 0.46) and environmental hostility (path coefficient = 0.37) and product class knowledgeâs influence on switching costs (path coefficient = -0.39) are all large and significant. In addition, it has to be pointed out that switching costs, age and education are also important in terms of their indirect impacts on ERP adoption although the magnitude of their impacts is smaller than that of environmental hostility, attitude toward change and product class knowledge.</p>

<sec id="section31-0266242610365512">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>All the variables investigated had an impact on the adoption of the technological innovation either directly or indirectly. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266242610365512">Figure 2</xref>, product class knowledge, attitude towards change, education, relative advantage, market uncertainty and environmental hostility all had direct effects on the adoption of the technology innovation, while switching costs indirectly impacted adoption through their influence on relative advantage. Finally, age indirectly influenced adoption of the technological innovation through its impact on product class knowledge.</p>
<p>While the individual factors were discussed above, two additional theoretical implications merit discussion. First, age and education of the owner-manager, along with their product class knowledge and attitude toward change, significantly impacted the likelihood of the adoption of this technological innovation. This demonstrates the relative importance of the individual owner-manager characteristics in the new product adoption process for small retailers. It also emphasizes the need for future models of the small retailer adoption process to include these individual variables (and others) in their depiction. The relative importance of these individual factors for small retailers also suggests that the adoption process for large retailers might be quite different from those where individual owner-managers are the primary decision makers.</p>
<p>Second, the finding that environmental hostility and product class knowledge all had a positive impact on relative advantage, while switching costs had a negative impact is important. It provides evidence for a multidimensional conceptualization of factors that impact relative advantage. It certainly suggests that relative advantage needs more investigation. This study provides a starting point for the development of a model of the variables that influence this important construct.</p>
<p>This study supports the premise that the adoption of technological innovations by small business is in part based on âsequentialâ effects, influenced by how owner characteristics impact upon their perceptions of environmental turbulence and technology, how environmental turbulence impacts perceived relative advantage and how when combined, these constructs impact upon technology adoption. The importance of studying this interrelated aspect of the independent variables is demonstrated by the findings pertaining to switching costs and age. In a recent study investigating the adoption of CRM technology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610365512">Peltier et al. (2009)</xref> found that switching costs, age and education did not significantly impact the adoption of the innovation. In the study reported here, switching costs and age had indirect influences through other variables. These findings were not detectable when employing a regression approach to the data analysis.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this study finds that attitudes toward change negatively impact upon perceived market uncertainty and positively influence perceived environmental hostility. Small business owners in hostile environments tend to be more proactive in accepting new ideas and taking risky actions; while owners in highly uncertain market environments tend to be more conservative to towards dealing with innovation. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242610365512">Covin and Slevin (1998)</xref> who found that organizations in challenging and hostile environments are more aggressive in capturing opportunities to achieve superior market performance. The hostile environment affords fewer opportunities for growth and owners have to take risky actions to avoid losses. Small business owners with a more favorable attitude toward change are more likely to be conservative in highly unpredictable market since risky actions may jeopardize firm performance when the market situation is out of control.</p>
<p>This study explores the impacts of firm size on theoretical constructs. It is found that firm size negatively affects switching costs and market uncertainty and positively influences attitude toward change. Therefore, even for small businesses, relatively big firms are more likely to have a better understanding of the importance of information technology, have more resources to train their employees and have more specialized IT knowledge, leading to greater attitude toward change and lower perceived switching costs. They tend to have more resources to deal with uncertain environments and view the market as being less complex.</p>
<p>This study certainly advances the literature pertaining to small business adoption of technological innovations a number of ways. It incorporates environmental, individual and organizational factors into the model and investigates the hierarchal nature of these factors. Finally, it advances the TAM model by adapting it to a small business setting (SBTAM).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0266242610365512">
<title>Managerial implications</title>
<p>Despite research that demonstrates a strong link between information technology and small business productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610365512">Kyobe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242610365512">McGee and Sawyerr, 2003</xref>), technology resources differ widely between small businesses. The findings reported here lead to a number of important managerial implications pertaining to organizations interested in marketing technological innovations to retailers and for small retailers who use this technology. Moreover, given past findings that indicate franchisees and small independent retailers who adopt new technologies are more likely to be successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610365512">Kyobe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242610365512">McGee and Sawyerr, 2003</xref>), this information is also valuable to franchisers concerned with persuading their franchisees to adopt new technologies and to small independent retailers interested in creating organizations that are technologically advanced and therefore, more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>The research presented here suggests that three of the most important factors in small businessesâ adopting a technological innovation are relative advantage, product class knowledge and environmental hostility. Firms interested in convincing small retailers and franchisees to adopt a technological innovation must focus on increasing their perception that the new technology offers benefits not realized by the current technology. The most direct approach would involve communicating the productâs benefits to potential retailers/franchisees through a variety of promotion vehicles, product demonstrations and perhaps through a personal selling effort.</p>
<p>Given that product class knowledge has both a direct impact on the likelihood of adoption and an indirect influence on purchase by increasing the perceived relative advantage, a second approach to increasing adoption would be to develop communications and activities that improve the target groupâs product class knowledge. Such activities might include special seminars and classes, newsletters, and online demonstrations specifically targeted to the needs of small retailers and franchisees.</p>
<p>The study also found that small retailers who perceived greater levels of market uncertainty and environmental hostility are more likely to adopt technology. Moreover, higher levels of market uncertainty and environmental hostility lead to greater perceived relative advantage of the new product. Thus, the degree to which retailers believe that technological innovation offers a means of reducing uncertainty and offers greater control over complexity, the more likely they are to value the relative advantages of the new product and to adopt it. From a promotional strategy perspective, this finding suggests that when communicating with prospective retailers, marketers might want to highlight the amount of environmental turbulence in the marketplace and how the proposed technological innovation can reduce this turbulence.</p>
<p>Conversely, the study found that higher perceived switching costs reduce the assessment of relative advantage. Small retailers and franchisees often have fewer slack resources than their larger counterparts so the relative advantage provided by technology is not appreciated if these owner-managers believe the time and financial costs of adoption place too great a burden on resources. Marketers/franchisers interested in increasing the adoption rate of an innovation should therefore, develop strategies to reduce both the perceived and actual switching costs associated with adopting the new technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242610365512">Macdonald et al., 2007</xref>). Offering high quality training, troubleshooting hotlines, online help, detailed manuals and on-site technicians are all potential strategies for lowering switching/learning costs. Failure in these areas is likely to lead to frustration and negative communication amongst potential buyers.</p>
<p>A second set of managerial implications involve the development of new technological products. This study provides support for the notion that firms taking a âcustomer orientationâ when developing and launching a technological innovation will be more successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242610365512">Hurley and Hult, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610365512">Kyobe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242610365512">Schindehutte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242610365512">Srinivasan et al., 2002</xref>). The results suggest that the development of new technological innovations should be based on reducing market uncertainty and creating relative advantages important to the small retailer and franchisee. This necessitates that product developers research potential customersâ needs to better develop products that will actually reduce market uncertainty and provide lasting advantages.</p>
<p>A third managerial implication of this research is that the adoption of new technological products is hierarchical and therefore, sequential in nature. Retailers need to be made aware of product features designed with their needs in mind and how those features translate into tangible benefits for the operation. They also need to understand the costs of the new technology â not just monetary costs- but costs associated with training, software updates, system maintenance and downtime as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610365512">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Beyond that, retailers need to see that the benefits of new technology outweigh its cost. As such, marketers and franchisers interested in moving potential customers through the adoption process might want to develop longitudinal contact strategies that present a coherent stream of marketing communications that convert prospects into adopters. As a consequence, through sequenced dialogs utilizing multiple messages and communication formats across the adoption process, more effective marketing campaigns can be developed.</p>
<p>A final marketing implication is the identification of the characteristics of early adopters of technological innovations. The study clearly indicates that that those owner-managers of small retail businesses that are younger, better educated and possess a positive attitude towards change are more likely to be early adopters of technological innovations. This supports the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242610365512">Morris and Venkatesh (2000)</xref> and suggests that one way to increase the successfulness of marketing new technological innovations is to concentrate on those target markets most likely to adopt them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-0266242610365512">
<title>Limitations and directions for future research</title>
<p>The results should be considered in light of the studyâs limitations. First, though the sampling unit we used was owner-managers of the retail stores to which the innovation is targeted, other individuals may also influence the diffusion process. While discussions with more senior managers at the national buying cooperative suggest that owner-managers do most of the purchasing for their retail stores, we did not take a measure of the degree of decision centrality inherent in the buying context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242610365512">Robertson and Wind, 1980</xref>). Similarly, because the study used a small business setting, the generalizability of our findings to larger organizations with multiple decision entities and buying policies may be weakened. This suggests the need to study comprehensive models of adoption by larger organizations and to note discrepancies between organizations of varying sizes. Moreover, because relatively few of the cooperative members had purchased the newer technology, our model focused on differences between adopters and non-adopters. Last, though the model is multi-dimensional, the diffusion literature contains many other variables and potential interactions this study did not address.</p>
<p>The contributions and limitations of the study provide direction for future research. In particular, because these findings clearly show the importance of examining direct and indirect relationships between diffusion variables, additional research is needed that explores other potential interrelationships. For example, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242610365512">Kozan et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242610365512">Richbell et al. (2006)</xref> examining the interrelationships between innovation drivers and small business variables should be extended to include other possible variables. This study demonstrated the importance of relative advantage and market uncertainty in the adoption of technological innovations by small businesses.</p>
<p>While relative advantage is often mentioned in new product adoption, much is still unknown about the concept. The same can be said for market uncertainty. More work is needed in these areas. Finally, the impact of environmental turbulence, relative advantage, switching costs, product knowledge and attitude towards change on new product satisfaction, specifically satisfaction with the technological innovation, needs to be investigated. This is particularly true in light of the potential impact of positive and negative word of mouth on new product adoption.</p>
