<p><italic>Just Neighbors?</italic> grew out of a two-day conference on “The State of Black-Latino Relations,” held at the UCLA Labor Center in 2008 with the backing of the Ford Foundation. The conference brought scholars together with community, labor, and youth activists experienced in black-Latino community organizing. The editors begin the volume with the well-trodden assertion that “the size of the Latino or Hispanic population has now surpassed that of the African American population and it will probably be double the size of the black population by 2050” (p. 1). The overriding question behind this collection of papers is whether the burgeoning Latino population is detrimental to blacks, as the two groups vie for jobs, housing, and the American Dream. Or whether blacks and Latinos can come together, based on their shared experience with racism, and challenge the racial and class hierarchies that limit opportunity for both groups. Indeed, the purpose of bringing together scholars and activists was to explore the possibility of forming coalitions that will unite rather than divide.</p>
<p>Ironically, the relevance of the conflict-cooperation model is thrown into question by the last of the twelve papers anthologized in this volume: a study by Cid Martinez and Victor Rios of youth gangs in two California cities where Latino immigrants settled in erstwhile black neighborhoods. Contrary to media predictions of a race war between rival gangs, Martinez and Rios found that interracial violence was rare. The operative paradigm was one of <italic>avoidance</italic>, as Latinos and blacks went their own way and gangs divvied up neighborhood turf, including illicit trades, along racial lines. In 2007, according to James Diego, “nine in ten black-Latino homicide victims in Los Angeles were killed by someone from their racial or ethnic group” (p. 326), an ironic indicator of ethnic cohesion. Indeed, one wonders whether the whole juxtaposition of Latinos and African Americans, on the assumption that their destinies are intertwined, may be mistaken, insofar as these groups pursue their respective destinies independently of one another.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the papers that make up this volume present a kaleidoscopic view of black-Latino “relations,” based on a range of methodologies. The volume begins with a macroscopic analysis of “Immigration and Labor Market Dynamics,” by Frank D. Bean, James D. Bachmeier, Susan K. Brown, and Rosaura Tafoya-Estrada. The authors conclude that “in broad outline, black male employment does not appear to have moved downward in concert with rising immigration” (p. 43). Beware of the caveat: “in broad outline.” The authors reach this conclusion on the basis of employment and income trends nationally between 1970 and 2006. They cast a blind eye to a canon of studies that focus on particular cities, industries, and work sites, where there has been substantial, sometimes wholesale displacement of African Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094306113491549">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, several contributors to this volume examine the secondary migration of Latino immigrants to cities and small towns in the South, and here the labor competition between immigrants and blacks is undeniable. An unexpected finding is that Latinos view co-ethnics as a greater source of competition than blacks. Mexican Americans, in particular, worry that recent arrivals compete for scarce jobs and depress wages. Furthermore, immigrants often harbor negative stereotypes of black workers, though this is more prevalent among recent arrivals than among Latinos who had developed networks and commonality with African Americans. On the other hand, among blacks resentment of immigrants is widespread, though this attitude is less prevalent among middle-class blacks whose jobs are not threatened by immigrants. However, even blacks who see Latinos as competitors for jobs generally support the movement for immigrant rights.</p>
<p><italic>Just Neighbors?</italic> includes case studies of Houston (by Nestor Rodriguez and Tatcho Mindiola, Jr.) and Los Angeles (by Mark Sawyer), though the authors are more preoccupied with the social psychology of “race relations,” as measured by surveys, than with the historical and structural dynamics that have thrown these two groups into competition with one another, transforming local politics. Sawyer strikes a refrain that runs through the volume when he writes that coalitions between Latinos and African Americans “are neither inevitable nor impossible, but promise and problems are substantial.” And he concludes with an admonition to organizers that their efforts “must be carefully calibrated so as to build bridges and not pour salt into existing wounds” (p. 196).</p>
<p>In a chapter entitled “Black, Brown, Young, and Together,” Regina Freer and Claudia Sandoval Lopez show that although coalitions are a rarity, youth with strong in-group identities display an affinity for working across group lines. In another chapter on “Framing Commonality in a Multiracial, Multiethnic Coalition,” Sylvia Zamora argues that “deploying injustice frames is central to the coalition building process because they function as a tool for members to analyze problems from a structural perspective so as not to blame individuals or the ‘other’ racial-ethnic group for the problems plaguing their neighborhood” (p. 311). But what becomes of “framing” when it bumps up against the cold facts on the ground? As Zamora later concedes, it is not easy to allay the resentments of blacks “who fear competition from immigrants for scarce resources, including jobs, schools, social welfare programs, and other valuable commodities or services” (p. 316). Yet she concludes on a resilient note: “Now is the time for black and Latino leaders to begin to seriously explore the benefits to building alliances as a key strategy to empower both groups” (p. 320).</p>
<p>Indeed, the contributors to this volume share a commitment to building coalitions between blacks and Latinos, and to their credit, they are cognizant of the obstacles. Readers will have to decide for themselves whether coalition is a realistic prospect, or whether there is too much that separates the two groups who, as some have contended, have been on a collision course since the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965. In his controversial book, <italic>The Presumed Alliance</italic>, Nicolas Vaca debunked the idea of coalition as political fantasy. In their introduction, the editors dismiss Vaca with the stock argument that this is not a zero-sum situation where the gains of immigrants come at the expense of blacks. It would have been constructive if the editors had written a concluding chapter that engaged this thorny issue, and grappled with their own contradictory findings concerning “the promise and problems” of black-Latino coalitions. Let me be clear: coalition is a worthy, indeed unassailable objective. However, there is much in this volume that contradicts the rosy images of camaraderie portrayed on the book’s cover.</p>
<p>An egregious omission in <italic>Just Neighbors?</italic> is that there is scarcely any mention of the fly in the ointment of coalition: differences in color or pigmentation among those lumped together under the unitary concept of “Latino.” Mark Sawyer presents suggestive data showing that Latinos have their own taxonomy of “color” that defies the black-white paradigm. And in their introduction, the editors comment, with Mexicans in mind, that “Latinos may be racialized into the third and fourth generations post immigration” (p. 5). But this is a debatable proposition, especially given the soaring rates of exogamy. If we take the long view, it seems likely that light-skinned Latinos will follow in the footsteps of European immigrants, and as Toni Morrison has famously written, disassociate themselves from the black nemesis, including co-ethnics of dark skin. And future generations of Afro-Latinos will assimilate, culturally and politically, into a melting pot for all those groups who are phenotypically “black,” as George Yancey prognosticated in <italic>Who Is White?: Latinos, Asians, and the New Black/Nonblack Divide</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094306113491549">2</xref></sup> In which case “coalition” will come to ironic fruition, stratified along racial lines. Is it possible that sociologists have erred all along by racializing “Latino,” grafting the lexicon of race onto nationalities who are bound by a language that is rapidly succumbing to English? Is it possible that Latinos will not “disrupt the racial binary,” as some imagine, but on the contrary, will only affirm its persistence?</p>
