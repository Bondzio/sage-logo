<title>Ocular Adverse Effects</title>
<p>Ocular adverse effects were examined in a retrospective, cohort study of 14 682 adolescents and young adults who were users of isotretinoin for acne. Adverse events were assessed within 1 year of the first prescription dispensed for the drug. The cases were matched for age and sex with an equivalent number of controls who were acne free and those who were isotretinoin-naïve patients. The mean age of the study populations was 16.55 years. Overall, 13.8% of the isotretinoin group experienced ocular adverse events, with 9.6% occurring in the isotretinoin-naïve group and 7.1% occurring in the acne-free group. During a 1-year follow-up period, the isotretinoin group had an increased risk of ocular adverse effects (hazard ratio = 1.70; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) compared with the acne-free group. No increased risk was associated with the isotretinoin-naïve group. The peak risk was at 4 months after the first prescription for the product was dispensed. The most common events attributed to isotretinoin use were conjunctivitis, hordeolum, chalazion, blepharitis, eye pain, and dry eye.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that there is a strong association between isotretinoin therapy and the development of clinically significant ocular adverse events. These effects may be attributed to the drug’s known effect on induction of meibomian gland dysfunction.</p>

<title>Acute Liver Injury</title>
<p>In a prospective study of 877 adult patients receiving flavocoxid, 4 women (age range = 57-68 years) developed liver injury suspected to be related to the use of the product. All developed symptoms and/or signs within 1 to 3 months after the initiation of the product, which included elevations in alanine aminotransferase (mean peak = 1268 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (mean peak = 510 U/L), and serum bilirubin (mean peak = 9.4 mg/dL). In all patients, liver tests returned to baseline values within 3 to 12 weeks after the product was discontinued without permanent injury.</p>

<title>Cardiovascular Death</title>
<p>A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess the incidence of cardiovascular death associated with use of oral azithromycin in adults. During the study period, 347 795 prescriptions for azithromycin were dispensed, which were matched with 1 348 672 prescriptions for amoxicillin, 264 626 prescriptions for ciprofloxacin, 193 906 prescriptions for levofloxacin, and 1 391 180 control periods in which no antibiotic was prescribed. Azithromycin users were mostly women (77.5%), a mean age of 49 years, and received the drug for infections of the ear, nose, or throat and bronchitis (62%). Among azithromycin-treated subjects, 29 cardiovascular deaths occurred during a 5-day treatment course (85.2 per 1 million treatment courses), of which 22 (64.6 per 1 million courses) were sudden cardiac deaths. Among subjects who did not receive antibiotics, 41 cardiovascular deaths (29.8 per 1 million periods) and 33 sudden cardiac deaths (24 per 1 million periods) occurred. During the first 5 days of amoxicillin therapy, 42 cardiovascular deaths (31.5 per 1 million courses) and 29 sudden cardiac deaths (21.8 per 1 million courses) were observed. When azithromycin use was compared with a period of no antibiotic treatment, the hazard ratio for cardiovascular death was 2.88 (95% confidence interval = 1.79-4.63; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Risk of death from any cause was also increased (hazard ratio = 1.85; 95% confidence interval = 1.25-2.75; <italic>P</italic> = .002). The risk of cardiovascular death remained elevated for 10 days after azithromycin was dispensed, but the risk of death from any cause was not. Amoxicillin use was not associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular or noncardiovascular causes or death from any cause during the first 5 or 10 days of therapy. When comparing azithromycin with amoxicillin, an increased risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio = 2.49; 95% confidence interval = 1.38-4.5; <italic>P</italic> = .002) and death from any cause (hazard ratio = 2.02; 95% confidence interval = 1.24-3.3; <italic>P</italic> = .005) was observed. Compared with amoxicillin, subjects who took ciprofloxacin did not have an increased risk of cardiovascular death or death from any cause during a 10-day treatment course. When azithromycin was compared with ciprofloxacin during the first 5 days of therapy, an increased risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio = 3.49; 95% confidence interval = 1.32-9.26; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) was observed; however, the observed cardiovascular mortality with azithromycin versus levofloxacin therapy was not significantly different (hazard ratio = 1.27; 95% confidence interval = 0.66-2.47; <italic>P</italic> = .48).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that a 5-day course of azithromycin was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death compared with no treatment, amoxicillin treatment, or ciprofloxacin treatment. Azithromycin has previously been reported to have some pro-arrhythmic potential. While the current study supports this hypothesis, it should be noted that causality cannot be established based on the results observed.</p>

<title>Risk of Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension</title>
<p>In a nested case–control study, 1216 pregnant women (older than 15 years) with a diagnosis of pregnancy-induced hypertension without prior history of hypertension before pregnancy were evaluated for antidepressant use. Ten controls were selected for each case. Of the cases, 457 women had pregnancy-induced hypertension without preeclampsia, 795 with pregnancy-induced hypertension with preeclampsia, and 4 women with eclampsia. When compared with controls, the cases had a higher frequency of diabetes, hospital visits before pregnancy, and higher frequency of medical visits during pregnancy. The mean age was 27.4 years and 27.2 years in the case and control groups, respectively. Overall, 345 women had at least 1 prescription for an antidepressant during pregnancy, with 3.7% (n = 45) being cases and 2.5% (n = 300) being controls. After adjusting for confounders, it was determined that antidepressant use during pregnancy was associated with a 53% increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (adjusted odds ratio = 1.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.01-2.33). When examining antidepressant drug classes, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone was significantly associated with the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (adjusted odds ratio = 1.60: 95% confidence interval = 1.00-2.55). The use of other antidepressants (serotonin modulators, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tetracyclics, and dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) was also significantly associated with the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (adjusted odds ratio = 3.71; 95% confidence interval = 1.25-10.98). In a subgroup analysis involving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the use of paroxetine alone was also significantly associated with an 81% increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (adjusted odds ratio = 1.81; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-3.23).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that women who use antidepressants during pregnancy are at increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension with or without preeclampsia. The exact mechanism of this relationship is not clear but may be driven by vasoconstriction.</p>

<title>Risk of Coronary Syndrome</title>
<p>A nested case–control study in the Netherlands examined community pharmacy dispensing records linked to hospital discharge records of 950 000 community-dwelling residents from 1998 to 2008. Cases were defined as elderly patients (older than 60 years) with a first hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome during antipsychotic use. For each case, 4 controls with no hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome were selected. Within the cohort of antipsychotic users, 2803 patients with a first hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome were identified. Both the case and control groups had a mean age of 76 years. Current use of antipsychotics was associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome when compared with past use (greater than 365 days earlier) with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.5 (95% confidence interval = 0.5-0.6). For current users, there was no dose–response relationship and no temporal relationship between the start of antipsychotic therapy and hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome. In addition, no differences in risk were identified between the different types of antipsychotic drugs or between different degrees of serontonergic, histaminergic, or adrenergic affinity.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that in this study, a decreased risk of hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome was observed in elderly patients currently using antipsychotics. They suggested that further study is required to determine if there is a cardioprotective effect or if this reduction is associated with a high nonreferral rate.</p>

<title>Anaphylaxis</title>
<p>A 36-year-old male patient developed anaphylaxis after receiving 1 dose of intravenous ranitidine (50 mg) in the emergency department for renal colic and epigastric discomfort. The patient received concurrent administration of 1 dose of piroxicam (20 mg) intramuscularly. Within 1 minute of administration, the patient experienced diaphoresis, trembling, and dyspnea and subsequently lapsed into coma with undetectable blood pressure. The patient underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and intubation and was resuscitated with intravenous fluids, hydrocortisone, and adrenaline. After 2 days, he was hemodynamically stable and was weaned off ventilator and inotropic support and was discharged 7 days later. Four weeks later, the patient underwent skin prick tests with a reaction to ranitidine and no reaction to piroxicam.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that anaphylaxis was caused by intravenous administration of ranitidine. They also state that there is a lack of evidence suggesting cross-reactivity with other H2-receptor blockers. The authors reiterated that commonly used medications, generally accepted as safe and well tolerated, may cause serious adverse reactions.</p>

<title>Hallucinations on Withdrawal</title>
<p>Two case reports of hallucination associated with valproic acid withdrawal in pediatric patients were described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1.</italic> A 4-year-old female patient with history of idiopathic generalized epilepsy was treated with valproic acid (31 mg/kg/d) for 2.5 years with a plasma level of 82 mg/L. One month prior to admission, valproic acid taper was begun. Dose at time of event was 5 mg/kg/d, with a plasma level of 19 mg/L. The patient experienced visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations every 2 hours for 2 days. Laboratory and diagnostic studies including electroencephalogram, magnetic resonance imaging scan, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Autoimmune encephalitis and abuse were also ruled out as potential causes. After 2 days of symptom onset, the previous dose of valproic acid was restarted. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred within 2 days. After remaining asymptomatic for 1 year while receiving treatment, valproic acid was again tapered over a period of 6 months without recurrent hallucinations up to 2 months after discontinuation.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2.</italic> A 12-year-old female patient was treated with valproic acid (30 mg/kg/d) for cryptogenic focal epilepsy. After 1 year free of seizures, valproic acid was tapered over a period of 6 weeks. Immediately following complete withdrawal, she experienced an increase in oppositional behavior, agitation, and racing thoughts. She also experienced visual and auditory hallucinations. Laboratory and diagnostic studies including electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal. Three months after symptom onset, valproic acid was restarted with immediate and complete resolution of hallucinations and gradual resolution of behavioral symptoms. After 8 months of further symptom-free treatment, valproic acid was again tapered over a period of 8 months without recurrence of symptoms up to 1.5 years after discontinuation.</p>
<p>The authors concluded these cases of hallucinations were caused by a too rapid discontinuation of valproic acid therapy. The proposed mechanism was increased dopamine concentration in the subcortical mesolimbic system secondary to decreased GABA activation or increased glutamatergic activity.</p>

<title>Flash Pulmonary Edema (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012458221">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 52-year-old male patient developed flash pulmonary edema after receiving an induction dose of anidulafungin (200 mg) for persistent febrile neutropenia. Concurrent medications on day of reaction included acyclovir, meropenem, vancomycin, and acetaminophen, all of which he had previously been receiving for treatment of febrile neutropenia. The patient had a negative baseline chest X-ray and lungs were repeatedly clear on pulmonary exam prior to initiation of anidulafungin. Near the end of anidulafungin infusion, the patient experienced an acute onset of spasmodic cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Oxygen saturation decreased to 88%. On physical exam, ronchi were discovered in both lower lobes and chest X-ray showed new bilateral perihilar and interstitial edema. The anidulafungin infusion was discontinued and the patient was immediately given diphenhydramine (25 mg intravenous), hydrocortisone (50 mg intravenous), and albuterol nebulization (2.5 mg). The patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms over the following few hours with a repeat chest X-ray showing marked improvement at 12 hours. To rule out cardiac causes, an echocardiogram was performed, which showed no abnormalities and revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the pulmonary edema demonstrated in this patient was due to administration of anidulafungin. The proposed mechanism of development was histamine-mediated increases in vascular permeability and vasodilation.</p>

<title>Epistaxis</title>
<p>An 82-year-old female patient experienced multiple episodes of epistaxis while receiving dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) for atrial fibrillation. No concomitant medications were reported. The patient was admitted for chest pain and tachycardia and was previously receiving dabigatran as an outpatient for an unspecified period of time. During admission, the patient’s calculated creatinine clearance remained above the threshold for dose reduction, 30 mL/min; however, dabigatran dose was decreased to 75 mg twice daily due to concerns of overestimation of renal function. After discharge, the patient’s dose was increased back to 150 mg twice daily. Eight days after initial discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department with right-sided epistaxis, which resolved spontaneously. The patient returned twice within the following 48 hours with epistaxis ultimately requiring septoplasty, maxillary antrostomy, and sphenopalatine and ethmoid artery ligation. The patient experienced a drop in hemoglobin from 13.0 g/dL before epistaxis and 12.4 g/dL before ligation to 9.6 g/dL postligation. Kidney function remained stable with serum creatinine 0.80 to 0.93 mg/dL and estimated creatinine clearance 43 to 48 mL/min.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patient developed epistaxis due to dabigatran therapy. The authors cautioned that there may be risk associated with using dabigatran in elderly patients with renal dysfunction and that clinicians should be aware of limitations associated with estimating renal function in certain populations such as the elderly.</p>

<title>Morphine, Naloxone (Extended-Release) No. 203</title>
<sec id="section20-0069477012458221">
<title>Review of Adverse Effects During First Year of Use</title>
<p>A retrospective analysis was conducted to review the spontaneous adverse events reported to the manufacturer for the combination product, extended-release morphine and naltrexone, during the first year of availability in the United States. All adverse events were obtained from the manufacturer’s pharmacovigilance database as well as data on total prescriptions filled during the first year of marketing. Events were classified as serious or nonserious with special attention paid to reports with fatal outcomes, overdose, and events of significant interest, which included those related to warnings associated with the product package insert, seriousness, reversibility, and frequency of reporting. The authors also assessed reports of product disruption including withdrawal symptoms and reports of abuse and misuse. From August 13, 2009, to August 12, 2010, approximately 97 000 prescriptions for extended-release morphine with naloxone were filled. During the same time frame, the manufacturer received 182 individual case reports for a total of 429 adverse events, indicating a 0.19% spontaneous reporting rate. Seventy-seven reports were in females, 76 in males; in 29 gender was not reported. Mean age was 50 years for all cases in which age was reported. The most commonly reported adverse events were, drug ineffective, headache, withdrawal syndrome, nausea, and pruritus. Thirty-three cases reported a total of 70 serious adverse events. Two cases reported fatal outcomes, and both were intentional overdoses. There were 5 other cases on intentional overdose reported. Ten cases with other adverse events of interest were reported. Two cases of renal failure were reported, one of which resulted in concomitant hepatic failure and convulsions. Patient outcome was not reported in either case. Two patients had reported QT interval prolongation; however, the reporting physician attributed it to underlying metabolic conditions. Six cases of seizure or loss of consciousness were reported. Two were unwitnessed, and 3 cases were in the context of withdrawal, suicide, or renal/hepatic failure. The last case was witnessed and computed tomography and electroencephalogram were normal. Reports of possible capsule disruption were divided into cases involving withdrawal symptoms (33), suspected abuse or misuse (5), and confirmed abuse or misuse (6). The cases of confirmed abuse or misuse involved ingestion of manipulated medication; however, none resulted in typical overdose symptoms, euphoria, or intended effects of drug abuse.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that the spontaneously reported adverse events indicate a safety profile consistent with that of extended-release morphine. They also determined that exposure to manipulated drug was associated with either withdrawal or events not typical of opioid abuse. The authors acknowledge that the reported adverse events cannot be used to calculate actual incidence rates as it is spontaneously reported and that further clinical research is needed to determine clinical effects on diversion, misuse, abuse, and potential safety benefits.</p>

<title>FDA Safety Alert: Risk of Seizures</title>
<p>On July 23, 2012, health care professionals were updated regarding the risk of seizures associated with dalfampridine based on data from postmarket adverse event reports. The majority of seizures occurred within days to weeks after starting the recommended dose and occurred in patients having no history of seizures. In addition, the FDA is updating the drug label to clarify recommendations that kidney function should be checked in patients before starting the drug and monitored at least annually during treatment.</p>

<title>Prediction of Adverse Event Risk</title>
<p>In a prospective cohort study enrolling 2.2 million adult patient records, the validity of the QStatin risk score was evaluated for its predictive ability in identifying the 5-year risk profile of developing various adverse events during statin therapy. The main outcome measurements were the first recorded occurrences of acute renal failure, cataracts, moderate or severe liver injury, and/or moderate or severe myopathic events. Moderate or severe liver dysfunction was define as an alanine transaminase level greater than 120 IU/L in patients without diagnosed chronic liver disease at baseline. Moderate to serious myopathic events were defined as a diagnoses of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis or raised creatinine kinase of at least 4 times the upper limit of normal (&gt;595 in women and &gt;696 in men). Acute renal failure and cataracts were evaluated from medical record codes in the patient charts. Between January 2002 and July 2008, approximately 2.3 million patients aged 30 to 84 years from 364 general practices in the United Kingdom were registered in a national database. The QStatin scores as a predictive model were in close agreement with observed events for the development of acute renal failure, cataracts, and myopathy. However, the predictive capability of the model performed poorly when evaluating the risk associated with the development of liver dysfunction.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the QStatin scores were effective in predicting the 5-year statin risk for developing acute renal failure, cataract, and myopathy. In contrast, using the same model to identify 5-year statin risk for the development of liver injury was not effective.</p>

<title>Hypotension</title>
<p>A 62-year-old male patient developed sudden weakness and dizziness approximately 2 hours after taking menaquinone (100 µg daily) as a supplement for coronary heart disease. Other medications included rosuvastatin (10 mg daily), aspirin (100 mg daily), atenolol (25 mg daily), and alfuzosin (10 mg daily). Previous to this event, the patient’s blood pressure had been within normal limits for several years as evidenced via frequent blood pressure measurements, including a reading taken 3 days prior. The blood pressure after becoming symptomatic was 110/55 mm Hg. After 2 days of therapy, the blood pressure was 105/50 mm Hg within 2 hours of taking the medication and reduced further (100/50 mm Hg) on the third day of therapy. Symptoms included generalized weakness and dizziness. The product was discontinued on the third day of therapy. One day later, the blood pressure was 115/65 mm Hg and normalized thereafter. After a 10-day free period, the patient was rechallenged with the drug, which resulted in slight hypotension (115/60 mm Hg) on the first day within 2 hours after administration and even lower readings (100/55 mm Hg) on the second day. The patient was asymptomatic on both days. The drug was discontinued with no further rechallenges.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced hypotension related to menaquinone administration. According to the Naranjo causality scale, this reaction was rated as probable in relation to the drug. An exact mechanism of action was not possible as several variables were present in this case.</p>

<title>Adverse Reactions</title>
<p>A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess the risk of hypertension, polycythemia, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and prostatism associated with use of oral and intramuscular testosterone therapy. Subjects were identified from the United Kingdom’s General Practice Research Database between January 1, 1991, and October 2009. A total of 5841 men received a testosterone preparation for at least 1 year. Injectable preparations were most commonly used (72%), followed by oral (23%) or both routes (5%). Among 4895 subjects in the hypertension subcohort, 202 cases of newly diagnosed hypertension were identified. The majority of newly diagnosed cases were exposed to injectable (83%) versus oral (17%) testosterone preparations (adjusted incidence rate ratio for oral versus injectable = 0.8; 95% confidence interval = 0.6-1.2; crude incidence rate = 12.3/1000 person-years and 14.4/1000 person-years, respectively). Of 5813 men in the polycythemia subcohort, 146 were diagnosed with polycythemia or high hemoglobin or hematocrit. Nearly all cases were exposed to injectable testosterone preparations (97%). Rates of polycythemia were significantly lower in subjects who received oral versus injectable testosterone (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 0.13; 95% confidence interval = 0.05-0.35; crude incidence rate = 1.2/1000 person-years and 10.1/1000 person-years, respectively). Among 5523 men in the prostate cancer subcohort, 76 newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases were identified. Among the case subjects, a greater number had received injectable (60%) than oral (34%) or both forms (5%) of testosterone therapy. The incidence of prostate cancer was similar between oral and injectable testosterone users (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 1.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.7-1.7; crude incidence rate = 2.5/1000 person-years and 1.8/1000 person-years, respectively). Of 5766 men in the benign prostatic hyperplasia subcohort, 106 were newly diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Slightly over half of cases had received injectable testosterone (53%) and few had received both forms (5%). Men who received oral testosterone were more likely to develop benign prostatic hyperplasia than those receiving injectable treatment (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 1.5; 95% confidence interval = 1.1-2.2; crude incidence rate = 4.1/1000 person-years and 2.1/1000 person-years, respectively). Finally, among 5422 subjects in the prostatism cohort, 251 new cases were diagnosed. More cases had received injectable (63%) than oral (32%) testosterone preparations, although some had received both (4%). The incidence of prostatism was not significantly different for users of oral versus injectable testosterone products (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 1.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.8-1.4; crude incidence rate = 8.4/1000 person-years and 6.1/1000 person-years, respectively).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the incidence and relative risks of the adverse reactions examined in this study varied according to the route of administration. Potential mechanisms for these adverse outcomes were not proposed.</p>

<title>Fracture Risk After Associated Hyponatremia</title>
<p>In a retrospective study, elderly patients with and without thiazide-induced hyponatremia were followed for the incidence of fractures (n = 223 vs 216, respectively). A total of 61 osteoporotic fractures were recorded in a mean follow-up period of 82 months. The hazard ratio of thiazide-induced hyponatremia was 1.78 (95% confidence interval = 1.05-3.03; <italic>P</italic> = .033). The majority of fractures were in the hip (75.4%). However, in a multivariate backward analysis, thiazide-induced hyponatremia was not significantly associated with fracture risk. In this evaluation, the patient’s age (hazard ratio = 1.1), low body mass index (hazard ratio = 1.09), and being diabetic (hazard ratio = 2.06) were 3 independent predictors of osteoporotic fracture risk.</p>
