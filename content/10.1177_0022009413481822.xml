<abstract>
<p>Electoral violence is a phenomenon which is key to understanding the workings of democracy in interwar Europe, yet there are few monographs which analyse its incidence in different countries between 1918 and 1939. This article is a quantitative and qualitative study of violence during the Spanish general election of 1933. Spain is a particularly significant case: the violence experienced there was a manifestation of the volatile relationship between the various political parties and trade unions, and it was a crucial factor in preventing the consolidation of the democratic Republic. The choice of the 1933 election reflects the fact that this was an especially critical moment for the Second Republic. The contest involved not only a substantial debate between the 1931 Constitution’s supporters and critics over the question of constitutional revision, but was also the first election of the Second Republic in which the parties of the left, right and centre were well-organized and counted upon significant popular support. This article examines the various types of electoral violence and its geographical distribution, and identifies the political and trade-union actors who engaged in it.</p>

<p>‘The feverish times through which we are living may well fill us with pride. We stand before a people in motion. We do not recall any such spectacle previously in Spain.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009413481822">1</xref></sup> This was one Republican newspaper’s depiction of the 1933 campaign, on the eve of the voting. On 19 November the Spanish people – including women, for the first time in a general election – went to the polls in the most open and competitive election in their nation’s history. Candidates and parties had left no resource untapped: speeches, banquets and rallies abounded. In the press, large amounts of space had been devoted to the campaign, public opinion, party manifestos and appeals on behalf of individual candidates. Millions of posters, with striking slogans and drawings, often in colour, covered walls in large and small towns alike. Moreover, the campaign had been unprecedented in its mass use of new technologies. The radio was employed extensively for the first time, and cars and even aeroplanes were used to flood the streets with flyers and leaflets. Party slogans were disseminated by neon lights and hot-air balloons, and even the cinema played a role. All this was in stark contrast to the Constituent election of June 1931, with its more traditional, low-key campaigning and predictable outcome. Altogether, the contest of 1933 may be viewed as Spain’s first modern democratic election.</p>
<p>So much competition also engendered high levels of uncertainty and anxiety in a political culture characterized by intransigence and dogmatism, in which the major forces of both left and right sought exclusion of the opponent rather than cooperation and coexistence. Since there had been no referendum on the Constitution of 1931, the contest of 1933 shaped up as a kind of zero-sum plebiscite between the left, who opposed any revision, and the centre and right, which sought varying kinds of fundamental changes. This threatened to have an explosive effect on a political system which had already experienced considerable violence in 1931–2, and the campaign had been marked by greater violence than in any previous election in the country’s history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009413481822">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The goal of this article is to quantify the violence which took place and to measure its significance in terms of scale, typology, geographical impact and the political affiliation of both perpetrators and victims. It seeks to fill a gap in Spanish historiography that has only begun to be addressed very recently,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009413481822">3</xref></sup> an oversight that has tended to distort perspective on the Republican elections. While their competitive and modernizing character has often been emphasized, the neglect of the more negative aspects has resulted in a ‘presentist’ analysis which encourages artificial parallels between the Second Republic and European democratic systems after 1945.</p>
<p>The absence of any study of electoral violence has meant that there is little sense of the degree to which the political forces of that era accepted in practice the norms of democratic pluralism and co-existence. Political violence in an electoral context provides a useful gauge, since elections generate the maximal tension between parties. The present study seeks to verify the hypothesis that electoral violence in Spain was not simply a by-product of rapidly increasing mobilization and competition, but that for important political sectors the struggle had acquired a Manichean dynamic of friend/enemy in which victory was conceived in absolute terms, while defeat meant total humiliation and marginalization. For the most radicalized parties, violence was a means of driving their rivals from the political arena.</p>
<p>The category of political violence includes actions that inflict physical damage on persons or property with the ultimate objective of limiting or eliminating political competition. It includes violence promoted by those involved in elections, from candidates to other campaigners and party members and sympathizers, as well as by worker unions, employer associations, civil servants and members of the military. Non-violent acts of fraud or corruption may be excluded, since they are of a different order. There can be elections accompanied by violence – depending on its character and extent – that produce authentic results, and, conversely, elections which are fraudulent but peaceful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009413481822">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Electoral violence did not begin with the Republic, for it existed to some extent under the constitutional Monarchy and had even increased after the re-introduction of universal male suffrage in 1890. Such violence, however, was of a different order from that experienced under the Republic because of its sporadic, limited and non-lethal character, employed for purposes of intimidation rather than elimination. Outbreaks of violence had occurred especially in some of the most hard-fought districts and in places where the electoral contest was most evenly balanced, as would also be the case in the 1930s. Such tactics during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were usually the preserve of organized groups known as the ‘Partidas de la Porra’ (strong-arm gangs), whose goal was intimidation, yet such incidents under the Monarchy rarely produced deaths or even significant injuries. Such intimidation was not always organized, sometimes resulting from unplanned confrontations, but it was very much in the interest of candidates that such incidents be avoided, for the resulting injuries might induce the Supreme Court to review the election and possibly even invalidate the results. Another factor was that under the preceding system government intervention in the electoral process was common, and the ‘government delegates’ involved might take aggressive action on behalf of favoured candidates, but rarely to the extent of coercion that inflicted significant injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009413481822">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The limited violence of the Partidas de la Porra was somewhat similar to the very limited disorders which existed in nineteenth-century Great Britain, and the role of government delegates not so different from practices under the early French Third Republic or Germany’s Second Reich.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009413481822">6</xref></sup> Moreover, public opinion in Spain frowned on electoral violence, and candidates who employed the services of the Partidas de la Porra publicly distanced themselves as far as possible from these gangs. Finally, for most of the period of the constitutional Monarchy, political violence was rarely encountered outside electoral campaigns. Violence became a more constant phenomenon from 1917 onward, encouraged by the tensions engendered by the First World War. Four deaths were registered during the electoral campaign of 1919, but this was exceptional, and the contests of 1920 and 1923 produced no fatalities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009413481822">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elections constituted the apex of political conflict under the Monarchy, whereas following the advent of the Republic in 1931 violence during electoral campaigns was merely one aspect of a continuous, violent struggle between the parties. As recent studies have shown, the ‘demonization of the opponent’ and the politics of exclusion practiced by certain groups produced a continuing tension and violence which transcended the boundaries of the electoral campaigns themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009413481822">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increase in violence in Spain was obviously not an isolated phenomenon but reflected the trend toward the ‘brutalization of politics’ in many European countries during the interwar period. Yet it was not merely the product of general cultural influences of the era, but also stemmed from the intense new politicization that resulted from mass democracy, broad mobilization and the crucial importance of the elections themselves in this environment.</p>
<p>In interwar Europe, political violence was most common in countries where mass mobilization was not accompanied by prior agreement on the rules of the game. It was greatest when three different factors converged. The first was a sudden change of regime which had occurred without majority support and consensus. The second was the existence of powerful parties or worker movements openly opposed to the new system, such as Communists, anarchists or radical nationalists who rejected the outcome of elections and sought to overthrow the system. The third was the presence of political forces with a strong capacity for political and electoral mobilization which were only ‘semi-loyal’, whose goal was not to consolidate democracy but to use it as a transitional stage to imposing a more radical or authoritarian system. The lines sometimes blurred between factors two and three.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009413481822">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consolidation of the Second Republic in Spain was made almost impossible by the fundamental cleavage between the parties. The right-wing monarchists, though only a comparatively small minority, totally rejected the new system, while the Catholic and agrarian sectors of the right – who enjoyed mass support in the elections of 1933 and 1936 – also sought fundamental changes. Even the centrist Republican parties who had voted for the constitution conceded by 1933 that key articles needed to be revised. In the elections of that year, the various parties which advocated constitutional reform in a more conservative direction won 65 per cent of the vote (even though they did not at all agree among themselves), while the status quo drew only about 35 per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009413481822">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Efforts to overthrow the system directly were constant, with perpetual conspiracies by the extreme right and a feeble attempt at military revolt in 1932, the Carlists (traditionalist monarchists) organizing clandestine militias for that purpose. Violent reaction by the revolutionary left was, however, much more frequent and broad-based. At first this stemmed mainly from the mass anarchosyndicalist worker movement CNT (National Confederation of Labour) and the smaller elitist FAI (Iberian Anarchist Federation), as well as the minuscule PCE (Communist Party of Spain). Violent strikes and demonstrations were capped by three different anarchist revolutionary insurrections between January 1932 and December 1933. The most broad-based and deadly of the revolutionary insurrections, however, was the one led by the Socialists and the Esquerra (left Catalan nationalists) in October 1934.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009413481822">11</xref></sup> This demonstrated the very limited loyalty to the new system by two of the key leftist forces that had initially collaborated with more moderate parties in founding the Republic. After the collapse of the leftist coalition government in September 1933, the Socialists began to turn from democratic collaboration to violent revolution, a change partially foreshadowed in the electoral campaign of 1933.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009413481822">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the beginning of the campaign on October 10 to the second round of voting on December 3, surviving records reveal a total of 321 acts of violence, with 34 dead and at least 80 others seriously injured.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009413481822">13</xref></sup> Such extensive violence might lead to the conclusion that free campaigning and fair balloting had been impossible, but that would be inaccurate. The recorded violence took place in 250 municipalities, only 2.7 per cent of all those in Spain. The majority of these were small or medium-sized rural districts, though many provincial capitals and larger cities were included. A major incident could play a significant role in an individual district, yet most of the country was untouched and timely police work in every observable case made it possible for the election to take place under stable conditions. Ultimately, violence did not disrupt the elections.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though the study of political violence naturally focuses on its victims, there were many more incidents of limited violence than would be indicated by the number of dead and injured. That many of these did not produce serious casualties was partly a matter of chance, while focusing on incidents of major violence alone tends to overlook the many cases in which political groups simply tried to obstruct or make impossible their opponents’ activities and limit their freedom to campaign.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best gauge of the level of violence is simply the total number of incidents involving any form of violence against persons or property. Though the categorization of such data is complicated in the extreme, they have been organized into six categories in (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022009413481822">Table 1</xref>).

</table-wrap></p>
<p>The first category, assaults on candidates, campaign workers or party or trade-union members, constitutes the most frequent type of violence. In most cases, this occurred when members of one group attacked their rivals in other groups who were engaged in campaign activity – distributing leaflets, putting up posters or selling partisan newspapers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009413481822">14</xref></sup> When those attacked were able to fight back, serious skirmishes often took place, but most often these involved little more than fist-fights that only produced bruises, though the use of knives, clubs or firearms could leave more serious victims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009413481822">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>An additional destabilizing factor was the violence unleashed by the anarchosyndicalist FAI-CNT, who boycotted the elections. The most common anarchist initiative was to initiate politically-motivated strikes in cities and towns where they were strong, accompanied in Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere by physical assaults on workers who refused to participate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009413481822">16</xref></sup> Even worse were attempted killings in which anarchist gunmen fired on campaigners and members of other parties, sometimes striking from concealed positions. The main attacks were made against members of the new Catholic party, CEDA, though Socialist rivals of the anarchists were sometimes also targeted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009413481822">17</xref></sup> Though not the only practitioners of violence, the anarchists were more active than any others in lethal assaults on opponents.</p>
<p>Direct violence was not the only form of intimidation, for in some cases the local authorities acted directly to prohibit rallies and other campaign activities by competitors. They sometimes ordered the municipal police to tear down opposition posters, seize leaflets and even, momentarily, to detain campaigners and activists, as was done by a number of Socialist mayors in the provinces of Badajoz and Granada, and by their left and centre Republican counterparts in Córdoba and Valencia. This aggressiveness helped to guarantee victory for the groups in power on the local level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009413481822">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In some cases violence and intimidation continued through election day, particularly through efforts to destroy ballot boxes in districts where the other side seemed to be winning. This tactic was sometimes pursued by anarchists to climax their electoral boycott, often in the hope of intimidating or driving away poll-watchers or local election supervisors. Local officials in turn often tried to arrest anyone disrupting the balloting, but, if the latter were armed, the results could be deadly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009413481822">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second category – disrupted campaign events – makes up less than a fifth of all the violent incidents recorded. These disruptions tended to follow a pattern in which hecklers in the audience would begin to shout insults at the speaker and then to throw things and even to trash the facilities. The goal was to force whoever might be in charge – local political officials or the security forces – to adjourn the event altogether. Whenever the authorities showed determination, this did not happen. Troublemakers were ejected and the event proceeded. Yet if the authorities were hesitant or, as in some cases, sympathetic to the disrupters, the meeting would be shut down, in some cases as a result of collusion between the two. The worst incidents occurred when the troublemakers did not stop at words and simple missiles but used deadly weapons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009413481822">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The third category of incidents – attacks on the police – generally proved less serious. The Civil Guard constabulary suffered one fatality; when the head of a small post in the province of Navarre was shot and accidentally killed while attempting to arrest a Socialist disrupting a meeting of opponents. Two other Civil Guards were seriously injured while patrolling on election day in Cuenca province, while anarchists fired on Assault Guards (the second Republican constabulary) in two sites in eastern Spain. Sometimes the security forces took their toll in turn, as on 16 November when Civil Guards protecting a Radical Party meeting in Extremadura returned fire against Socialist gunmen, killing one of the latter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009413481822">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bomb attacks have been placed in a fourth category because of their potential destructiveness. The anarchists carried out quite a few during the 1933 campaign, especially during the CNT strikes in Madrid and Barcelona, usually targeting workers who had refused to join the strikes, though bombs were also used in attacks on rightist candidates and activists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009413481822">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fifth category is composed of assaults on political offices and centres, including offices of newspapers published by the parties. When these raids were carried out at night, the only damage was normally to property, as when the headquarters of the CEDA were attacked in Seville and in Santomera (Murcia), and those of the centrist Radical Party in Cádiz and in Basauri (Vizcaya). When the premises were occupied and those within sought to defend themselves, there was bloodshed, as when a Socialist attempting to trash the local Casino Agrario (a rightist social club) in Pego (Alicante) on December 3 was shot and wounded by a CEDA activist inside.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009413481822">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sixth category consists of politically-motivated attacks on property in general, the targets selected because of their owners’ political identity. These incidents took place primarily in rural districts, and damage was normally limited to property alone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009413481822">24</xref></sup>

<p>If violence is analysed in terms of location, it can be found in widely scattered parts of the country, but with much greater intensity in certain areas (Table 2). Even in regions where there were only a limited number of incidents, these sometimes resulted in deaths or serious injuries. Altogether, thirty of Spain’s 50 provinces (in regions such as Aragon, the Balearics, the Canaries, Old Castile – excluding Santander – Galicia, León and Navarre) registered only 15 per cent of all acts of violence, but these produced 21 deaths and 12 per cent of the seriously injured. Eight other provinces – Albaecte, Cáceres, Cádiz, Ciudad Real, Guipuzcoa, Jaén, Oviedo and Santander – revealed more frequent and intense violence, amounting to 15 per cent of all incidents, 18 per cent of the deaths and 16 per cent of the seriously injured (Figure 1).

</fig></p>
<p>These data indicate that there was less tension in regions dominated by rightist and centrist parties, as in the eight regions referred to above, while in others – where the political struggle had become more evenly polarized and the worker left was stronger – violence was more common. It was particularly intense in a number of highly conflictive provinces – Alicante, Badajoz, Barcelona, Córdoba, Granada, Madrid, Málaga, Murcia, Seville, Toledo, Valencia and Vizcaya. These 12 provinces produced 70 per cent of all violent incidents, involving 61 per cent of the deaths and 72 per cent of the serious injuries. What nearly all had in common was either high levels of support for the Socialists – and to some extent for the Communists – or very active anarchist groups (particularly in Barcelona and Valencia).

<p>In these provinces, the aggressors were usually Socialists or anarchists, but the incidents which resulted were often complex, and, if the intended victims fought back successfully, the original perpetrators might end up as victims, or at least casualties, as happened more than once. This makes it more difficult to place members of various groups into the exclusive category of perpetrators or victims. As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022009413481822">Table 3</xref>, of 221 recorded incidents, there were 169 cases, or 76.5 per cent of the total, in which the perpetrators were either members of, or had links to, the worker parties or their unions. More than half of these involved Socialists, about a third stemmed from the FAI-CNT, and the remainder involved Communists. Members of the various Republican parties (whether of the centre or left) were aggressors in 42 cases (19 per cent). Of these incidents, 23 were provoked by members of the Radical Party, nine by those of the Catalan Esquerra, five by members of the left Republican parties, three by those of those of the centrist Progressives, and two by Galicianist Republicans. By contrast, members of the centre-right and rightist parties instigated violence in only 10 cases (eight of them from the CEDA and Agrarians, and two from the Basque Nationalists). Also noteworthy is the fact that there is no recorded incident in which violence seems to have been provoked or initiated by the security forces (Assault Guards or Civil Guards).</p>
<p>The victims were most commonly members of the rightist parties, who suffered a total of 161 attacks (54.2 per cent of the total). There were 105 victims among the CEDA and the Agrarians, plus another 45 referred to in the press only as ‘rightists’, four among the Carlist extreme right, four among the Basque nationalists and three from the Catalan Lliga. The Republican parties came a distant second in terms of number of victims of violence, with 48 cases (16.2 per cent). Of the victims, 36 were from the Radical Party, seven were left Republicans, two Conservative Republicans and one each from the Galicianist Republicans, Liberal Democrats and independent Republicans. Members of leftist parties and worker unions were the intended victims in 44 cases (14.8 per cent), and of these 41 were Socialists, two Communists and one from the CNT. Of victims without known political affiliations, 18 were policemen, 23 were employers and landowners, and three were non-unionized workers. These data make it clear that the principal instigators of violence were from the worker left. Communists, for example, initiated 14 incidents but were the victims of apparently unprovoked attacks in only two cases, while the Socialists were responsible for 97 assaults, while suffering 41 attacks from others, a much less disproportionate ratio.</p>
<p>Cross-referencing such data yields the conclusion that the CEDA and its conservative allies were the main targets. Even if we take into account the cases for which the affiliation of the aggressor is unknown, the disproportion remains. Moreover, rightists were on the receiving end of attacks by ‘unknowns’ more than any other sector. Since conservatives rarely instigated violent incidents, the aggression displayed by the Socialists and even by Republicans is all the more noteworthy. Most attacks on Socialists came from the anarchists and Radicals, rather than from conservatives, though in 14 cases it has not been possible to determine the affiliation of the aggressors. In turn, most of the assaults on the Radicals and other centrist Republicans came from the Socialists, though the few attacks on left Republicans seem mostly to have been carried out by anarchists.

<p><italic>Sources</italic>: AHN (Gobernación), Leg. 31, Exps. 4 to 8; press and bibliography cited.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009413481822-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The most extreme incidents, resulting in deaths or serious injuries, merit special attention. It is important to bear in mind that such lethal incidents cast a shadow over the campaign and the balloting in the districts where they occurred, as distinct from the minor effects of non-lethal clashes, which, in the Spanish political culture of that day, were often considered an inevitable and inconsequential by-product of party competition.</p>
<p>The 34 deaths and 80 serious injuries recorded during the campaign were distributed across 24 provinces, or nearly half of Spain (Figure 2). In the other 26 provinces there was either little violence or none whatsoever, though with certain exceptions. Córdoba, for example, was one of the most conflict-ridden yet produced no serious casualties, but this was an anomaly, for in general the provinces with the highest levels of violence also registered the most deaths and serious injuries. The regions with the highest rates were Andalusia, Extremadura, New Castile and Valencia, and, at the provincial level, Barcelona and Vizcaya. Conversely, the provinces of León, Lugo and Navarre registered limited overall violence but a number of serious injuries.</p>
<p>Of the 34 deaths, it has been possible to ascertain the political identity of both the victim and the aggressor in 30 cases, that of only the aggressor in one case, and that of the victim alone in two incidents. In the 80 cases of serious injury, the affiliation of both victim and aggressor can be determined in 58, that of the aggressor alone in 13, and that of the victim alone in three. The largest number of victims – 14 deaths and 24 serious injuries – were from the CEDA and its rightist allies, though the disproportion in this category is not so great as in the totals for all violent incidents, cited above. In total, the left suffered nine deaths and 21 serious injuries. Of these, the Socialists had six dead and 14 seriously injured, the anarchists two dead and three seriously injured, the Communists one dead and four seriously injured. In addition, the left and centre Republicans registered five dead and 10 seriously injured – the Radicals two and five, the Galicianist Republicans one and one, the ‘azañistas’ one dead, the independent Republicans one dead, the Catalan Esquerra three seriously injured and the Liberal Democrats one seriously injured. Finally, the security forces suffered two dead and three seriously injured, while two non-union workers were killed and one seriously injured by the anarchists.</p>
<p>With regard to perpetration, members of worker organizations caused 22 deaths and 44 serious injuries, of which, respectively, the anarchists were responsible for 11 and 20, the Socialists for nine and 21, and the Communists for two and three. Conversely, only two deaths and 16 serious injuries can be attributed to rightist parties or the Basque nationalists. Members of Republican parties caused three deaths and six serious injuries, of which two deaths and five injuries were carried out by Radicals and the remainder by Galicianist Republicans. The remaining victims suffered injuries at the hands of the security forces, totalling four deaths and five serious injuries.</p>
<p>Cross-referencing these data provides further analysis of the nature of these incidents. For example, there is no evidence that any of the fourteen rightist victims had done anything in particular to provoke their attackers, of whom six were Socialists, six were anarchists and two were Communists. At a meeting in Daimiel (Ciudad Real), one of the victims was apparently attacked because he shouted ‘Casas Viejas’ (referring to a police atrocity that had occurred earlier in the year under the leftist coalition government), but that could hardly be considered a serious provocation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009413481822">25</xref></sup> There were, however, a few exceptions in the cases of the 26 seriously injured rightists, as in the case of the Carlist wounded in Campezo (Alava) after becoming involved in a dispute with Basque nationalists. In the cases of the one Republican killed and two more injured by Socialists, in only one instance of injury is there any indication that the confrontation had been provoked by Republicans. On the other hand, two Republicans were killed and two seriously injured as a result of brawls in Galicia between activists of the Radical Party and those of the Galicianist Republicans, while three members of the Catalan Esquerra were seriously injured in a physical struggle with Carlists they themselves had initiated.</p>
<p>Fatalities suffered by the left frequently stemmed from the intervention of the security forces in altercations in which the left was involved, resulting in four of the nine deaths and five of the 21 serious injuries, the victims in every case being either Socialists or anarchists. Two more deaths were the consequence of Socialist scuffles with anarchists in one case and with Communists in another, while two more were killed in brawls with Cedists and one in a skirmish with Radicals. Of these last fatalities, two were Socialists killed in assaults on property, in one case the home of a Radical Party mayor (Cadalso in Cáceres province), the other the local CEDA headquarters in Almoradí (Alicante). The third leftist was slain by a CEDA activist distributing leaflets in Seville, who shot and killed a Communist taunting him. Of the 13 remaining cases of serious injuries of leftists, nine resulted from clashes with the right and four from clashes with Radical Party activists.</p>
<p>Various studies have amply demonstrated that the elections of November 1933 were the most hard-fought and competitive to that date in Spanish history, and also the most democratic. The data that have been presented here also demonstrate that it was the most violent, though the violence did not disrupt the balloting itself. If these are also compared with the results of a study of violence in the following elections of February 1936, it becomes clear that this was the aspect that most distinguished the Republican elections from those that have taken place under the constitutional monarchy since 1977.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009413481822">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, though in other respects the Republican elections were generally fairer and more democratic than those held under the preceding regime, the progressive reduction in fraud and increasing competitiveness of the contests held under Alfonso XIII unfolded in a context of greater civility. The highest death toll in the latter was the four fatalities in the elections of 1919, far less than the 34 in 1933 or the 37 in 1936.</p>
<p>The widespread violence in 1933 bore no resemblance to minor disturbances which may have taken place in France and Britain during that era, but were much more similar to circumstances in Italy after World War I and in Germany under the Weimar Republic. Moreover, as in those years in Germany and Italy, political violence in Spain was not a temporary phenomenon accompanying electoral campaigns but a broader feature of political life throughout the Republican period. The minimum death toll from political violence during 1933, including the victims of the two anarchist revolutionary insurrections of that year, is 266, compared with a total of 88 combined for the two preceding years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009413481822">27</xref></sup> As in Germany and Italy, such violence reflected the deeper conflict referred to at the beginning of this study: profound lack of consensus, deep cleavages, the refusal to permit peaceful reform, the existence of mass movements who sought revolutionary overthrow of the system, and the merely conditional loyalty on the part of some of the largest parties.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in key respects the situation in Spain in 1933 was different from that in Italy and Germany. In Spain the authorities never lost control of the streets. Moreover, the struggle between the left, the Radical party and the right coalition, the first seeking to maintain the system founded two years earlier and the latter seeking in varied ways to alter it substantially, did not necessarily imply an end to parliamentary democracy, for that was not the goal of the majority of political actors. Not all Socialists favoured revolution, and not all Cedists supported a corporative, as distinct from a directly parliamentary, regime. Moreover, it became clear that neither of the two largest forces of left and right could secure a clear majority, so that the elections of 1933 were not yet a dispute between two totally irreconcilable blocs capable of excluding all moderates.</p>
<p>This may explain why the electoral violence, though considerable, was more restrained than earlier examples elsewhere. The death toll of 34 was proportionate to population slightly smaller than 105 deaths recorded in Prussia during the election of July 1932 and much smaller proportionately than the 102 deaths recorded during the Italian elections in 1921.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009413481822">28</xref></sup> In Spain political paramilitary organizations scarcely existed and played almost no role. The nearest equivalents were the local ‘defence committees’ of the FAI-CNT or the ‘Escamots’ militia of the Catalan Esquerra, both of whom assaulted opponents’ meetings and, occasionally, their properties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009413481822">29</xref></sup> With the chief exception of activism of the FAI-CNT, however, electoral violence was sporadic and local in character, not systematically organized, clustering especially in the districts with the most intense competition and polarization, aimed at intimidating the opposition and imposing a monopoly of political expression. It is also the case, however, that the violence may have been fuelled by the highly aggressive speeches of leaders of both the left and right, who talked of excluding the opposition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009413481822">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>A final defining characteristic was that electoral violence in Spain was mutidirectional, uneven and not merely polarized between right and left. To that extent it cannot be considered merely a prelude to the Civil War of 1936, but was the product of a complex struggle between multiple actors. Activists of the FAI-CNT, who opposed elections altogether, attacked not merely members of the CEDA but Socialists and Communists, as well. Similarly, there were clashes between Socialists and Communists, and between centrists and rightists, even though the latter would soon form a coalition government.</p>
<p>The data reveal that virtually all groups participated in some degree of violence, but that certain ones were much more active than others. The main instigators were the worker left – mainly anarchists and Socialists, though also Communists to the extent that the latter’s meagre membership would permit – since they initiated approximately three out of every four violent incidents for which the aggressors can be identified, and caused two out of every three deaths and serious injuries. This should not lead to the conclusion that all the members in these organizations were eager for violence, for this was not the case, and they too suffered a significant proportion of the casualties.</p>
<p>These data, however, make clear that while the CEDA and the Agrarians questioned the status quo, they respected legality more than did the Socialists, and much more than did the anarchists. All 18 of the recorded cases in which the security forces had to intervene to protect the freedom of rightists to campaign or hold a meeting were provoked by initiatives of the worker left. None was initiated by the police, who operated within established guidelines. It should also be borne in mind that the security forces during those weeks were under the authority of national and local governments administered by centrists and the moderate left, and in no instance by the right. Thus, to attribute political violence blandly to the ‘intransigence of right and left’, as is so frequently the case in commentary on Spain, does not reflect the data generated by research on the elections of 1933.</p>

The 1933 election commenced on 10 October with the publication of the decree calling the election by Diego Martínez Barrio’s government and with the opening activities of the campaign, and continued until 3 December, when the second-round ballot was held. Seriously injured denotes life-threatening gunshot or knife wounds which had to be treated as medical emergencies.

<fn id="fn17-0022009413481822"><label>17</label><p>For example, in Valencia on 18 November members of the FAI shot at Cedistas who were putting up campaign posters, killing one – Enrique Rodríguez Estellés – and seriously wounding a further four. On 29 November, Domingo Huete and Carlos Mañas, both members of the JAP (Juventudes de Acción Popular – Acción Popular youth) were shot and killed in Cuenca by a CNT member. On Valencia, see Archivo Histórico Nacional (hereafter AHN), Gobernación, Serie A, Leg. 31, Exp. 8; <italic>ABC</italic> and <italic>El Sol</italic> (19 November 1933); on Cuenca, see <italic>ABC</italic> and <italic>El Sol</italic> (30 November, 2 December 1933).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn18-0022009413481822"><label>18</label><p>Nevertheless, on occasion party activists resorted to violence in the face of arbitrary conduct on the part of local authorities. This was the case on 18 November in Salobreña (Granada), where a group of Socialists opened fire on the mayor and the local police –both at the service of the Radical party – producing a total of four seriously injured. Aggressive behaviour on the part of mayors and the local police was so widespread that the press and official sources are replete with examples. AHN (Gobernación), Serie A, Leg. 31, Exp. 6; <italic>ABC</italic>, <italic>Ahora</italic> and <italic>El Sol</italic> (18 November 1933).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn19-0022009413481822"><label>19</label><p>In this manner Francisco Puchades, a CEDA scrutineer in Torrente (Valencia), was killed on November 19 by an anarchist who had destroyed a ballot box. On some occasions party agents were also armed, and attempts to attack ballot boxes ended in violence. Also on November 19, Radical party scrutineers and Socialists attempting to sabotage ballot boxes exchanged fire in Moratalla (Murcia), AHN (Gobernación), Serie A, Leg. 31, Exp. 4; <italic>ABC, Ahora</italic> and<italic> El Socialista</italic> (21 November 1933).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn20-0022009413481822"><label>20</label><p>In this manner on 14 November 1933 a group of Socialists surrounded the Centro Agrario (Agrarian Centre) in Fuente de Cesna (Granada), shooting at the right-wingers who were attending a meeting there and seriously injuring two people. Sometimes the objects of these attacks chose to fight back, leading to veritable pitched battles, as occurred between the Socialists attending a meeting in Gijón on 17 November and the Anarchists who sought to ‘boycott’ the event, and between the Radical party members holding a rally in Zalamea de la Serena (Badajoz) the previous day and a group of Socialist saboteurs. On 6 November, in the course of a CEDA event held in Almoradí (Alicante), party members repulsed with gunshots an attempted attack by a group of Socialists, killing the young José Amorós and seriously wounding another two. Overall, it was the FAI which proved most adept at carrying this type of disturbance to tragic extremes, as when Anarchist gunmen shot a Socialist in Gijón, and killed Segismundo García Matilla, a right-winger, at a rally in San Fernando (Cádiz), AHN (Gobernación), Serie A, Leg. 31, Exps. 5, 6 and 7; for Zalamea, see also <italic>Ahora</italic>,<italic> El Socialista</italic> and<italic> El Sol</italic> (17 November 1933); for Almoradi, <italic>El Sol</italic>,<italic> ABC</italic> and<italic> El Socialista</italic> (7 November 1933); for San Fernando, <italic>La Tierra</italic> (13 November 1933); <italic>ABC</italic>, <italic>El Sol</italic> and <italic>El Socialista</italic> (14 November 1933).</p></fn>

<fn id="fn22-0022009413481822"><label>22</label><p>For example, during the 1933 campaign a bomb was hurled at CEDA candidate Victor Lis as he travelled around the city of Vigo by car. The homes of prominent CEDA members in Cordoba, Murcia and Valencia were also bombed, AHN (Gobernación), Serie A, Leg. 31, Exp. 5, 7 and 8.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn24-0022009413481822"><label>24</label><p>In 1933 the only one of these incidents to produce a fatality occurred in Cadalso (Cáceres), when a group of Socialists were readying themselves to attack the home of the mayor, who belonged to the Radical party. On becoming aware of the threat, the mayor fired on the group, killing one of its members, Clemente Rodríguez, AHN (Gobernación), Serie A, Leg. 31, Exp. 6; <italic>ABC</italic> and <italic>El Socialista</italic> (4 November 1933).</p></fn>
