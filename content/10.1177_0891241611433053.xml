<abstract>
<p>In this article, I use in-depth interviews with black university men to investigate race, gender, and emotions. Participation in dominant institutions requires African American men to exhibit extraordinary emotional restraint. Because anger is culturally associated with men, however, black men’s suppression of anger violates masculine expectations. Thus, racial subordination not only creates difficult emotional expectations but may also create emotional dilemmas in which expected emotional displays undermine other identity expectations. In this article, I examine both how a group of black university men achieve emotional restraint and how they use their emotions to craft and manage their identities as black middle-class men. I argue that black men distance themselves from the controlling image of the angry black man by developing a shared identity I call moderate blackness. Moderate blackness entails emotional restraint, a moderate approach to campus racial politics, and the ability to get along with white people. These strategies work together to produce positive, restrained emotions and to manage anger and agitation, but they require black university men to “not see” racism. Black men use defensive othering to push the stereotype of the angry black onto black women. In doing so, they shore up their masculinity but leave women responsible for combating racial inequality.</p>

<p>In the 2008 election season, “No Drama Obama” was lauded for his implacable personal and political cool. Obama, commentators noted, was not “an angry black man.” Obama’s approach, which depended on avoiding both anger and too much talk about race, garnered him unprecedented support from white voters. Obama’s style was distinct from that of previous generations of black politicians. For example, Jesse Jackson used fiery rhetoric about racial inequities to fan black support, but the white public ridiculed him. In both cases, emotional displays, and their connection to race-based claims, were the basis of public interpretations of credibility.</p>
<p>Sociologists are increasingly interested in the role of emotions in inequality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241611433053">Schwalbe et al. (2000</xref>, 434) argue that “sustaining a system of inequality, one that generates destabilizing feelings of anger, resentment, sympathy, and despair, requires that emotions be managed.” Managing emotions may be a “generic process” in the reproduction of inequality, but we know much more about gender and emotions than we do about race and emotions. Moreover, most empirical and theoretical work on gender and emotions has “universalized” conceptions of men and women, failing to consider how race may modify gendered emotional dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891241611433053">Mirchandani 2003</xref>, 721). Experiences of racial inequality themselves create “destabilizing feelings” that require management, but race also changes expectations about emotional performances in ways that may complicate the relationship between gender and emotions. In this article, I use in-depth interviews with black college men to investigate the relationship between race, gender, and emotions.</p>
<p>As the example of Obama illustrates, black men face complex emotional dilemmas at the juncture of race, gender, and class. Middle-class black men must avoid being stereotyped as “the angry black man”—“a middle class, educated African American male, who despite his economic and occupational success, perceives racial discrimination everywhere and consequently is enraged” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891241611433053">Wingfield 2007</xref>, 12)—by adhering to “racialized feeling rules” that both strenuously prohibit anger among African American men, and oblige them to deny race-based inequities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611433053">Wingfield 2010</xref>). Successful participation in dominant institutions, then, requires black men to exhibit extraordinary emotional restraint. Because anger is culturally associated with men, however, suppressing anger also violates masculine expectations. Thus, African American men not only face more difficult emotional expectations but also face emotional dilemmas in which expected emotional displays undermine other identity expectations. In this article, I examine how black men at two predominantly white universities achieve emotional restraint and how they use their emotions to craft and manage their identities as black middle-class men.</p>
<p>Black university men’s emotions link to a form of identity work arising from, and attempting to reconcile, contradictions within and between blackness, masculinity, and middle-class status. “Identity work” is the interactional process through which people use “signs, rules, and conventions” to signal their “identities” to both others and themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891241611433053">Schwalbe and Mason-Schrock 1996</xref>, 115). Emotions help signal people’s identities whereas identity work itself generates new emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241611433053">Francis 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241611433053">Wilkins 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241611433053">Wolkomir 2001</xref>). Research on emotions and identity work, however, has not examined the process through which people use emotions to generate or manage racial identities, or the ways in which gender and class shape those identities simultaneously. Here, I am concerned with both the ways black university men create emotional restraint and how they use their emotions to signal and manage race, class, and gender identities as “moderate black” men—as emotionally restrained, politically temperate black people who get along well with whites. Moderate blackness is useful to black university men as it makes many of their feelings and experiences more tolerable and because it signifies their identities as easygoing black people who aren’t “out to start a revolution.” But by relying on intraracial gender hierarchies to shore up their masculinity, black men’s solutions perpetuate the racial inequalities that shape their dilemmas in the first place. By feminizing black anger, black men sustain the idea that anger is both illegitimate and undesirable.</p>
<sec id="section1-0891241611433053">
<title>Emotions, Race, and Gender</title>
<p>Like many cultural stereotypes, the image of the “angry black” reveals something real. Emotions are not evenly distributed. If hardship generates anger, then it makes sense for black people to be angrier than white people. Some research supports this claim, finding that, in a racially stratified society, black people are more likely than white people to confront conditions of powerlessness and chronic stress that may generate anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891241611433053">Chito Childs 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241611433053">Thomas and Gonzalez-Prendes 2009</xref>). Journalist Ellis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891241611433053">Cose (1994)</xref> argues that for middle-class African Americans, discrepancies between post–Civil Rights expectations of equal opportunities and persistent racial inequality foster rage. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891241611433053">Mabry and Kiecolt (2005)</xref> find that black people are less likely than white people to feel or express anger because they respond to eliciting states differently.</p>
<p>Here, I treat anger not as an inevitable, justifiable reaction to conditions of inequality but as a social product contained, transformed, given meaning, and used strategically. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241611433053">Hochschild (1983)</xref> defines “emotion work” as people’s private efforts to suppress and/or produce emotions in self and others. Emotion work brings emotional displays into line with feeling rules. “Racialized feeling rules” in professional workplaces demand more stringent emotional restraint from African Americans than from white people, and more stringent restraint from black men than black women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611433053">Wingfield 2010</xref>). Because of the limited literature on race and emotions, however, we know little about how African Americans achieve emotional restraint, or how they link it to questions of identity.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a few studies provide clues. Parents and important adults equip black children for participation in middle-class institutions by teaching them strategies of deference and restraint. For example, institutional authorities, both white and black, interpret black children’s behavior as disrespectful and punish them for displays of “emotional willfulness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891241611433053">Hill 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891241611433053">Pugh 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241611433053">Tyson 2003</xref>). Adults work to eliminate girls’ “attitudes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241611433053">Froyum 2010</xref>) and punish boys’ “naughtiness.” Boys, however, may earn notoriety from their peers for acting out, undermining adults’ socialization efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241611433053">Ferguson 2000</xref>). Research on Latinos suggests that participation on sports teams may inculcate boys into an individualistic and meritocratic worldview that leads them to understand race and racism in individualistic terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891241611433053">Barajas and Pierce 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies of middle-class black adults suggest a range of emotion work strategies. Some black adults may exercise restraint in white spaces, such as work, and vent their anger among sympathetic co-racials in black spaces (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241611433053">Lacy 2007</xref>); similarly, some black men take out pent-up anger on family members (Hill 2005). Black fraternity and sorority virtual communities foster emotional restraint differently, through “struggle and success” stories that acknowledge racism, emphasize overcoming inequality, and negatively sanction the ventilation of anger among co-racials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241611433053">Hughey 2008</xref>). Professors, faced with students who question their competence and authority, suppress their anger by downplaying the importance of race to their interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241611433053">Harlow 2003</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that African Americans do not all tamp down anger in the same ways, and that gender may shape both emotional expectations and emotion strategies. With the exception of Froyum’s work on black girls (2010), however, they do not explicitly explore the way gendered racial identities mediate black emotion work, especially for men.</p>
<p>Anger is not just a raced emotion, but is also a gendered one. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241611433053">Shields (2002)</xref> argues that anger presents a cultural paradox because it is the exception to a general prohibition on the expression of emotions among men. We see women as “more emotional” in general yet we prohibit women from expressing anger. Not just gendered cultural expectations grant men permission to display anger but also status and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891241611433053">Fields, Copp, and Kleinman 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241611433053">Shields et al. 2006</xref>). Status makes it less necessary for men to hide their anger; they may feel and express anger when their status is breached; and they may also use anger strategically as an acceptable means of asserting and maintaining control.</p>
<p>The links between anger, status, and masculinity create problems for women who occupy high-status positions. Women face an emotional double bind in which gendered expectations of deference do not match high-status emotional standards: women are deemed unfeminine if they are too emotionally controlled or autonomous, but are evaluated as less effective if they exhibit emotional care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891241611433053">Pierce 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611433053">Ridgeway, Johnson, and Diekema 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891241611433053">Rudman and Glick 1999</xref>). Because racialized feeling rules also prohibit black men from expressing anger, the case of black men would seem to challenge the notion of universal gendered differences in the expression of anger.</p>

<sec id="section2-0891241611433053">
<title>Intersectionality and Black Men’s Emotional Dilemmas</title>
<p>An intersectional framework helps us understand the complexity of black middle-class men’s emotional dilemmas. Intersectionality holds that gender, race, and class are interlocking and mutually reinforcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241611433053">Collins 2004</xref>). Black men face different expectations and interpretations of their racial performances than black women, and different expectations of their gender performances than white men. These differences, in turn, vary by class. Thus, when middle-class black men attempt to avoid the image of the angry black man, they do not just navigate racial expectations but also gender and class expectations. These expectations are often contradictory, creating emotional dilemmas at the intersection of gender, race, and class.</p>
<p>Because cultural rules about displays of anger also vary by class, class shapes the emotional strategies black men can use to manage their identities. Poor black men may compensate for race and class subordination with displays of anger that accord masculine status in the form of “respect” (Anderson 1989; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891241611433053">Bourgois 1995</xref>), but these same angry displays are incompatible with middle-class emotional expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891241611433053">Stearns 1994</xref>). Cultural ideas about masculinity grant dominant men dispensation to display anger. Indeed, white men’s situational anger signals and shores up their control, but black men’s anger signals their <italic>lack of control</italic>. Thus, when black men display anger, they do not gain power, but instead lose credibility and risk institutional sanctions, including incarceration or termination, at odds with class mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241611433053">Collins 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241611433053">Ferguson 2000</xref>). Emotional restraint is not a simple solution to these expectations, however, as it fosters gendered and raced identity dilemmas for black men. On one hand, avoiding the caricature of “the angry black man” requires stringent emotional control. On the other hand, black men’s suppression of anger denies them access to masculine privilege and power. The expectation that black men will never express anger contrasts with display rules for white men, and articulates with a history of race relations in which whites demanded that black men perform their subordination through acts of deference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241611433053">Collins 2004</xref>). Thus, avoiding anger can evoke troubling cultural meanings: restrained emotional displays on the part of African American men may seem, not self-controlled, but <italic>deferential</italic>. Thus, when white men display general restraint combined with situational anger, they confirm their position of power, but for black men, both restraint and anger confirm their position of race and gender subordination. To participate in middle-class spaces, then, black men must manage their emotions, but they must do so in a way that allows them to navigate the double binds caused by contradictory gender, race, and class expectations.</p>
<p>In this article, I examine the way black university men use emotions to resolve these identity dilemmas. Moderate black men apply cultural ideas about black emotions to solve the problems posed by participation in predominantly white institutions, and to fashion creditable black selves. By crafting emotional distinctions between black men and black women, moderate black men create distinct identities as black men. For these men, the trope of black anger is not only a problem to be managed but a resource used in the construction of identities.</p>

<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>This study is part of a larger project aimed at investigating the lives of black university students. With the help of a research assistant, I conducted forty-three in-depth open-ended, life history interviews with black or African American–identified undergraduate students or recent graduates (twenty-five women and eighteen men) attending one of two large, predominantly white public universities. Interviews lasted from one to three hours. A research assistant and a professional transcriptionist transcribed the recorded interviews. I supplemented interviews with participant observation at formal and informal campus events, including classes, formal black organization- and Greek-sponsored banquets, talent shows, and picnics, and with multiple, informal conversations. This article focuses on the interviews with the men, but uses the interviews with the women and participant-observation to contextualize and interpret the men’s accounts.</p>
<p>I recruited participants from two state universities I call Midwestern and Western. These universities are similar in many ways. Both are state flagship campuses with low numbers of black students. At Midwestern, black students make up 0.54 percent of the undergraduate population, while at Western, they are only 0.14 percent. The schools are in different regions of the United States: the Midwest and the interior West. Both universities are housed in local communities widely seen as progressive, and that mirror campus racial demographics.</p>
<p>In constructing this study, I sought out participants in diverse campus networks. By using a range of recruitment strategies to identify students who occupied different university social spaces, I ensured that the sample included both students who were central to the “black community,” as defined by students themselves, and those outside it. Students described the “black community” as a network of black students who socialize together and engage in various forms of community organization. I initially mapped the terrain of black students and then developed targeted recruitment strategies. The final sample combines multiple snowball samples with opportunistic and targeted recruiting. The sample here contains members of black organizations, athletes, engineering and social science majors, black Greeks, black members of predominantly white fraternities or sororities, heterosexual and queer blacks, first-generation Americans and children of native-born blacks, and black-identified multiracial students.</p>
<p>Most participants identified themselves as “middle-class,” but descriptive details of their families and neighborhoods indicated a broader range of economic backgrounds. Four of eighteen men come from class-disadvantaged backgrounds. In this study, all but one athlete was middle-class. Participants were from suburban, urban, and rural backgrounds, and grew up in two-parent, single-parent, and stepparent homes. Most participants lived in predominantly white communities and/or attended predominantly white schools prior to university. All had at least one working parent, and no one received public assistance. Most had attended public high schools, but some had gone to private high schools, and most of the students’ parents had gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that their children received a good education (e.g., moved to new neighborhoods because they had better schools, and ensured that their children were part of desegregation programs that bused them to better schools). Regardless of economic background, I conceptualize these students as middle-class aspirants. Participants were of traditional college age, except two participants, who were in their midtwenties. All students had matriculated to college immediately after graduating high school; none had taken time off from postsecondary education.</p>
<p>The interview protocol was not specifically concerned with either emotions or the caricature of the angry black. Instead, emotions emerged inductively from the data itself. I did not use any qualitative software. Instead, I read entire interview transcripts to identify emergent themes, wrote analytic memos to flesh out those themes and to develop more refined analytic categories, and then returned to each interview a second and third time to identify when, how, and why categories emerged, and to link those categories to other patterns in the data. To do this, I constructed tables connecting emotional categories to other emergent patterns in the data. For example, I identified the components of moderate blackness before identifying the components of the emotion work itself. Although I am a feminist researcher primarily interested in gender, I did not initially divide the data by gender but instead looked for themes across the data. Indeed, I only linked moderate blackness to gender after identifying gender differences across the accounts. I developed the gender analysis by systematically comparing the use of emotions in the men’s and women’s interviews. In this article, I focus on the men.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0891241611433053">
<title>Findings: Moderate Blackness</title>
<p>The men in this study do not call themselves moderate blacks, nor do they even claim to have a shared identity. Nonetheless, their accounts of race, campus life, and themselves use shared narrative strategies. I call these strategies “moderate blackness.” Moderate blackness has three components: restrained, positive emotional standards; a temperate approach to black politics; and the ability to get along with white people. It is thus moderate in two senses. First, it moderates the importance of blackness to individual identities; for moderate blacks, blackness is one among many identity attributes. Second, it moderates racial discord, distancing itself from stereotypes of blacks as angry and/or dangerous.</p>
<p>Moderate blackness is a strategic way of crafting middle-class (or upwardly mobile) racial identities in the (middle) class context of predominantly white campuses. The emotional strategies of moderate blackness likely transcend the university, but for the men in this study, moderate blackness solves the particular constellation of identity problems they face as black men on predominantly white campuses. As I will show, moderate blackness is a means of juggling concerns about racial authenticity, class mobility, and masculine control.</p>
<p>My argument develops in three parts. First, I place moderate blackness in context, examining how gendered racial dynamics shape campus experiences. Gendered racism insulates some black men from blatant racist dynamics. This insulation, however, is neither complete nor consistent and thus cannot fully explain the widespread adoption of moderate blackness by the men in my study. Instead, moderate blackness requires men to do emotion work that enables them to <italic>see</italic> the campus as racially friendly despite experiences to the contrary. In part two, I address the question of <italic>how</italic> black men achieve moderate blackness, detailing the emotional strategies they use to interpret campus life as positive. In the third section, I examine men’s identity work, showing how and why men use moderate blackness to manage identity concerns at the intersection of class, gender, and race. The links between moderate blackness and black masculinity compel black men to adopt moderation even if it does not match their experiences or if it creates other identity dilemmas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0891241611433053">
<title>Gendered Racism and Campus Life</title>
<p>Richard, a slight, dynamic, nonathlete at Western, exemplifies moderate blackness. He says, “I like to be happy. I don’t like being mad.” To achieve his good feelings, he maintains an easygoing attitude about race: “I have no problems. I don’t let problems get in my way, ’cause I have a purpose. I have things to do with my life. I don’t have time to be bitching and complaining about anything, really.” Richard presents himself, and comes across as, a naturally happy person, but his emotions require work. He creates and sustains good feelings by discounting the importance of race and racism to his experiences and identity. He uses his good emotions and moderate approach to campus life, in turn, to fashion himself as a particular kind of black person—one who does not “bitch and complain” or let other people “get him down.” Richard’s talk distances him from the caricature of “the angry black man”: he is neither angry nor focused on racial inequality.</p>
<p>Richard claims to be happy, but most men in this study portray themselves, a bit differently, as easygoing people who do not let things, especially racism, bother them. Like happiness, being easygoing is a positive, restrained emotional display embedded in a broader strategy of political moderation. Accordingly, all of the men in this study describe the campus in surprisingly positive terms, making claims like “I feel very embraced by [the campus],” and “my time at college has been one of the greatest experiences” of my life. If one relied on these accounts alone, one might believe that little work is necessary to make campuses welcoming spaces for black students. These characterizations of campus life contradict other research on black experiences in predominantly white universities, which finds persistent social and academic marginalization and everyday racial hostility (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891241611433053">Feagin, Vera, and Imani 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891241611433053">Solorzano, Ceja, and Yosso 2000</xref>). Like universities in other research, both universities host recurring, well-publicized incidents of antiblack racism. At Western, prominent black students received death threats. White students hold annual anti-affirmative action demonstrations that seem designed deliberately to taunt students of color. At Midwestern, people deface the black cultural center regularly with antiblack symbols. On both campuses, moreover, black women describe ongoing racial hostility and marginalization.</p>
<p>Given the persistence of campus racism, how can we understand men’s positive characterization of college life? Perhaps they develop more benign accounts because their experiences are different from black women’s experiences. The gendered texture of campus racism insulates some college men more than women. This insulation is uneven among all black men, and is incomplete even for the most well-insulated men. Positive characterizations notwithstanding, these men’s accounts reveal gaps and inconsistencies in their experiences of campus life that expose the emotion work required to maintain their easygoing attitudes.</p>
<p>Athletic status organizes campus life for black men. The six athletes in this study, all football players, contend that being an athlete—or being mistaken for an athlete—attenuates racial vulnerability. In this study, they are protected both by the idea that they are big and strong, and by their status, as Dominick notes: “I don’t get that—bad experience, if you want to say, because I do play football here. I am looked at as what they say a superstar sometimes.” As superstars, athletes are included in white social events and networks. Dennis explains that, “if you play football, you’re cool, you know.” In addition, many white women pursue athletes as potential sexual and romantic partners. Finally, athletes report good relationships with white teammates, and regular contact with white coaches and team boosters. As Craig says, “They say there’s no color in a foxhole. Sports is the same way.”</p>
<p>Despite such glowing descriptions of their experiences, being a black athlete has costs. Other campus participants stereotype them as less intelligent and academically unmotivated. I have observed white students roll their eyes when black athletes speak in classes; in informal conversations, faculty members and graduate students characterize athletes as academically unprepared; nonathlete black students in this study dismissed athletes as “not taking their education seriously”; and athletes in this study themselves complain that they are steered away from majors that are considered difficult or time-consuming. Dennis recalls, “I was never encouraged to do anything except to drop engineering. They explicitly told me that I should look at other majors or something like that.” David notes:</p>

<p>I guess I get it twofold, because I’m African American and I’m an athlete. So I think running around this campus there’s a very dumb athlete stigma that we’re painted with, and then also being African American, they’re like, “Jesus, he only got here because he’s African American and he’s an athlete.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And Dominick says about the dumb, lazy athlete stereotype: “I hear that. I hear that shit all the time.” Athletes tend to accentuate the positive and gloss over the negative, but, as these examples show, they are also aware of their complex position in campus life, expressing irritation about the stereotypes that follow them.</p>
<p>In this study, twelve of eighteen men were what black students call “regulars”—that is, they were not rostered as college athletes. Regular black men do not garner the same benefits of black masculine cool, both because they are not athletes and because they often do not conform to its expectations, which include hip hop and/or athletic attire, a kind of swagger, and “being the life of the party.” As Tim, a regular, complains, unless he can pass as an athlete, he is not welcomed at predominantly white social events. In contrast to athletes’ hypervisibility, regulars are, as Nick confesses, “kinda the invisible ones.” Phillip laments, “I’m not seen as something attractive. And I do feel that that’s related to, ‘Because you’re a black male, duh.’” Being a black man but not an athlete is a liability in campus erotic markets. Students, both black and white, often assume that regular black men are gay, as Ekon, a regular, explains: “that is one of the stigmas. . . . Society has it engrained that athletes are supposed to be men . . . and if you’re not that . . .” Tim also complains that “everyone says—you gotta be gay, man; you gotta be gay.” Thus, regulars do not benefit from stereotypes of black men as “cool,” and even incur gender penalties for their failure to live up to its expectations.</p>
<p>It is not, perhaps, difficult to understand why athletes paint the campus in rosy tones. Cultural status tints their interpretations of campus life, reinforcing the utility of emotional restraint. It is less obvious, however, why regular black men, who do not experience the athlete’s glorification, nonetheless share his positive evaluation of campus. Despite different experiences, moderate blackness arises out of the particular identity dilemmas black men share on predominantly white campuses. As upwardly mobile black men, black college men must all navigate the stereotype of the angry black man while also maintaining their gender identities as men. Moderate blackness resolves these problems for them by connecting positive emotions to masculinity. The links between moderate blackness and manhood, in turn, compels all of these men to view the campus in positive terms despite variations in their experiences.</p>

<title>Emotion Work</title>
<p>The angry black man image stigmatizes black men both for being angry and for “playing the race card” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891241611433053">Wingfield 2007</xref>). To sidestep this image, then, black men must learn to control both their anger and their acuity of racism. Black men achieve this control through emotion work that moderates racism and the anger it might generate. To be sure, moderate black men do not deny that racism exists, but instead claim that racism does not affect their daily lives or life chances. They enact a range of emotion strategies to create and sustain this view: defining racism narrowly; imagining that racism happens to other people, but not to them; framing race-based interactions as unimportant; and interpreting perpetrators as innocent or ignorant. Together, these strategies allow them to displace racism from their everyday lives, and to see the campus as a welcoming place.</p>
<sec id="section7-0891241611433053">
<title>Defining Racism: Regulating Discourse</title>
<p>What people can and cannot say determines what they can and cannot feel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891241611433053">Fields, Copp, and Kleinman 2006</xref>). Black university men manage their emotions by regulating definitions of racism. They define racism narrowly, identifying it only as extreme incidents, such as “getting jumped.” Jackson says, “I never experienced racism. Racism is deep, like lynching.” And Richard: “which, there was a case when someone was beaten. Then, of course, we all have a problem. But other than that, it’s not worth my time.” Jeffrey similarly identified an incident where “a black gentleman was jumped” as racist. Dominick used an off-campus, historical example: “My mom did have a brother, but he did pass away. He was a victim of racism, racial beating or whatever.” Four men identified off-campus police surveillance of black men as a problem. Dennis recalls, “I have a car but I’ve been pulled over eight to nine times in the last year in [college town]. It could piss me off but it just makes me laugh, this dude with his gun and his dumb ass education, his low education I should say.” These examples of racism set a high, historical, or off-campus standard for unjust behavior and thus locate racism outside of everyday experiences, allowing men to dismiss, ignore, or not see everyday racism, while also making it difficult to identify as racist any incidents that do not meet these criteria. Notably, these men reinforced the boundaries around these definitions, as I will show, by criticizing black students who were concerned with everyday interactions. The racist practices these men recognize as legitimate are not incidental. Physical violence and police surveillance are forms of racism associated with black men, and around which there has been much black outrage. Thus, the invocation of these particular forms of racism link men to a kind of black masculine authenticity, but one that has limited applicability to their daily lives.</p>

<title>Deflecting Racism: Creating Invulnerability</title>
<p>Because being in control is central to cultural ideas about manhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241611433053">Schrock and Schwalbe 2009</xref>), black men cannot admit personal racial vulnerability without jeopardizing their masculinity. Black university men claim invulnerability by contending that it happens to other, often less masculine, people (both women and less masculine men) but not to them. For instance, Jesse says, “I’ve been in situations where I felt people were rude, maybe, or just a little bit insensitive or inconsiderate, but I wouldn’t say they’ve ever done anything extremely discriminating, I guess, or off the wall. I know people who have been in bad situations like that.” The six athletes all crafted personal invulnerability by contrasting their experience to those of weaker, more vulnerable men. Marcus says:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had a football team that was behind me, so we really didn’t have too many racial problems, but I know a lot of my black friends that go here that weren’t athletes, they had a lot of racial problems goin’ on. I just think that . . . they try to pick on the people they think are weak and won’t do anything about it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In another example, Dominick says: “I’ve had people who may down-talk one set of black friends or black associates, [but] ten minutes later if I’m around they’re acting like we’re best buds since hopscotch and kickball.” The twelve nonathletes cannot similarly distance themselves from “weaker” men, but four deploy a related strategy by contrasting their experiences to those of black women, often by positioning themselves as their protectors, as Jeffrey, a regular, exemplifies: “brothas are extra protective of sistas.” Ekon explains, “If anything, the [racist] experience happens to everybody else, my other friends. Like my friend [Latisha] was called a black bitch her freshman year.” Regular men less frequently used this distancing strategy than athletes, but all but one avoided any direct admissions of personal vulnerability. Instead, regular men relied heavily on the strategies I describe in the next section.</p>
<p>Phillip, a regular, is the exception. As a queer man, he says, he often feels physically exposed, particularly in male-dominated spaces. Although he uses as an example his wariness about walking across a field of drunk white male students, he notes, “the situation would not have made me feel better if they [the men] were black.” For Phillip, then, it is not his race that makes him feel vulnerable, but his sexuality and its implications for his gender identity. The connection he makes between vulnerability and gender further reveals the importance of invulnerability to moderate black men’s identities as <italic>men</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section9-0891241611433053">
<title>Reframing: Creating Innocent White People</title>
<p>Men’s efforts to avoid seeing racism are not always sufficient. Racially charged interactions occur too frequently. Lance admits, “The problem is, though, there are so many of those tiny moments that we just become tired.” When forced to recognize them, men use additional strategies to minimize the racial implications of interactions. One way they do this is to discount racially charged incidents as unworthy of their attention. For example, Richard notes that white students routinely question his academic credentials, assuming the only way black men can get to college is through an athletic scholarship, but he says, “I just take everything with a grain of salt and flick it right off because there’s no point for me to have a grudge.” While Richard, at other times, claims that race does not affect his experiences, here he acknowledges everyday racism but transforms its meaning, reconfiguring it as unimportant to his identity and to his daily life. This strategy works in tandem with his narrow definition of racism; in the absence of physical violence, he is able to view racialized insults as annoying but inconsequential.</p>
<p>More commonly, moderate black men reinterpret motivations. All but one man revealed some version of this strategy. Here, Tim illustrates one way they do this:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>But with the white kids—all my friends were nice. They’ve never really done anything. They might joke and throw the n-bomb every once in a while just to try to be cool. . . . Cuz they hear it in music videos and stuff and they’re like, “Oh man it’s cool right, I can call you the n-word . . . and it’s like NO!”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Tim is unable to dismiss this interaction as unworthy of his attention, as Richard did, because the perpetrators are not strangers but his friends. To maintain his friendships and defuse the interaction, Tim reinterprets the incident as a “joke” motivated by the desire to be cool. He assigns benign motivations to his “friends” —“nice” people who have “never really done anything.” Like white people who manage their discomfort with white racial joking by portraying joke-tellers as “racial innocents” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891241611433053">Picca and Feagin 2007</xref>), Tim neutralizes white jokes, preserving both the myth of white racial innocence and his positive view of the campus. More generously, Marcus says: “I think that’s lovely [being called ‘nigga’]. I even let some white players say it. It’s just a sense of love.” In this case, Marcus interprets these interactions as authentic efforts to create racial common ground. Vincent trivializes campus racial segregation by explaining that campus is just “chopped up. . . . We [he and white students] haven’t had the opportunity to have a conversation, sit down and talk. There’s a lot of white people back home, like we call each other brothers.” In his account, he not only portrays segregation as no one’s fault, but also emphasizes good experiences with (noncampus) white people to maintain the myth of harmonious campus race relations.</p>
<p>Men also reinterpret motivations by thinking about issues and people as socially complex. Ekon explains that he became “more aware” of racism when he came to the university, but that he also learned that “if you open yourself up and realize that everything is not black and white . . . then you actually enjoy yourself and I did.” For Dominick, unkind behavior has nothing to do with race: “I’ve been around great white people. I’ve been around shitty ones. I’ve been around great ones. I’ve been around shitty black people, I’ve been around great black people.” And Jackson says, “People are just people. Yeah, there’s differences because of what’s happened historically. . . . But you have to tolerate people.” By attributing bad interactions to social causes besides race, or by assuming that race itself is not a “black and white” issue, black men displace antiblack motivations and maintain their good feelings toward their white peers.</p>
<p>By portraying racial barriers as inconsequential, unintentional, or complicated, framing strategies all have the same affect: they permit men to see white students as racially innocent, well intentioned, and educable, rather than racially hostile, and thus allow them to maintain good feelings toward them. Moreover, men’s framing strategies put the burden of change on black people, rather than white. Vincent makes this dynamic most clear when he explained that he holds black people accountable for the diversity of their friendship groups, expecting them to be friends with both black and white students, but does not have similar expectations of white people. When I asked why he did not judge white students for the racial composition of their social networks, he shrugged, “I guess I thought it was okay.” Ekon similarly holds black students to higher standards than he holds white students. When I asked him to identify the biggest racial problem on campus, he said, “I think the fact that people aren’t educated on it. People don’t, like a lot of white students don’t know that they have privilege. . . . And I think a lot of black students can be defensive.”</p>
<p>Men’s emotion strategies are mutually reinforcing. Emotional restraint facilitates a particular interpretation of campus life: seeing interactions as friendly, well-intentioned, or unimportant allows men to avoid anger, while a generally easygoing approach makes possible interpretations of campus as a tolerant, even welcoming place. The emotional restraint men’s strategies create likely makes their temperate interpretation of campus racial dynamics <italic>feel</italic> real (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241611433053">Wolkomir 2001</xref>), while feelings of ease and happiness make it seem that the campus is indeed an enjoyable, friendly place and that moderate blackness is a sensible approach to racial interactions. These emotion strategies occlude inconsistencies in men’s experiences by leading them to accentuate positive, and underplay negative, experiences.</p>
<p>Dennis was one of three men in this study who did not fully embrace moderate blackness, although he does avoid anger. In contrast to his peers’ celebration of sports as a space that “[break] down racial barriers like no other,” Dennis saw football as a site of racial oppression:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One day I woke up—and I went to practice and the coaches were getting’ on my nerves. I didn’t feel like they had a reason to talk to me like I was a boy when I was takin’ care of myself. . . . [describes exhaustion, brutal workout regimes, and his visceral reaction to seeing dark-skinned men being broken down by white coaches] And we [he and another player] talked at that time also that it [football] was slavery.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dennis’s marginal athletic status enabled his damning critique of football. As a walk-on player who knew he had no NFL prospects, he had less to lose from not glorifying sports as a site of racial harmony. Indeed, his reinterpretation of football as racially oppressive justified his subsequent decision to stop playing and to invest instead in his engineering curriculum. Regardless, his story underscores the degree to which men’s accounts of campus harmony are shaped by emotion work.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-0891241611433053">
<title>Identity Work</title>
<p>Men’s emotion work allows them to distance themselves from “the angry black man,” as Ekon makes clear: “I used to have a serious temper and . . . you know I don’t want everybody to be afraid of [me].” By managing his emotions, Ekon also managed others’ fear. Their emotion work pays off in other ways as well: they report that tamping down their anger makes them feel less “crazy,” reduces “tension” in their relationships with white peers, and expands their college social lives. But men’s emotion work is also identity work. They don’t just use emotions to manage the expectations of college life; they use them to think about themselves as different <italic>kinds</italic> of black people.</p>
<p>Black college men explain who they are, in large part, by explaining who they are <italic>not</italic>: not angry, “not out to start a revolution,” “not hung up on slavery,” not uncomfortable around white people. Such boundaries are woven throughout their talk. Dominick did not hang out with any “African American people” until his senior year, when he met ones who “aren’t trying to start a revolution and whatever. They’re just people. They’re just acting like people. Not acting like they’re being discriminated on.” Jeffrey criticizes other black students, for whom, he says, race is “crippling. Race is used as a limit rather than an opportunity for interaction, growth, social change.” By emphasizing their treatment of race as an “opportunity for growth [and] social change,” rather than for outrage, these men distinguish themselves from the caricature of the angry black man.</p>
<p>When black men orient themselves away from racial inequality, however, they risk being seen, and seeing themselves, as racially inauthentic. Craig notes, black men “don’t want to feel guilty that they’re not part of BSU [Black Student Union], even though they’re black.” David laments:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Town] is a difficult place to navigate as an African American if you don’t have a strong sense of you, because there are two ways you can go: You can either become unbelievably pro-black or you can become quote-unquote, and I don’t like this term, but I can’t think of anything better, “whitewashed.” And then obviously, there’s no absolutes. There are people who stand somewhere in the middle. But if you don’t have a strong sense of identity, those are the two places you’re probably gonna go to.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>David reveals the racialized identity hazards facing men in white middle-class spaces like these; they could respond to the persistent threat of racism with suspicion and anger or they could respond to it by denying the relevance of race to their identities. The first response leads to racial immoderation (becoming “pro-black”), while the second leads to racial inauthenticity (becoming whitewashed). David presents these problems in racialized terms, but they are also about class. Being pro-black potentially undermines participation in middle-class institutions, but being whitewashed implies that one is a racial “sell-out” who privileges class mobility over racial authenticity. David proposes that only those with “a strong sense of identity” can successfully manage this dilemma, and links this solution to cultural ideas about masculinity; as he says, “we’re men.” Moderate black men seek to create identities that balance the race and class concerns they face as upwardly middle-class blacks while also maintaining their claim to manhood.</p>
<sec id="section11-0891241611433053">
<title>Moderate Blackness and Racial Authenticity</title>
<p>Moderate black men reconcile racial authenticity with strategies of moderation by acknowledging the importance of race but not of racism. To do this, they invoke black culture. Jackson’s account illustrates how an emphasis on culture works together with other emotion strategies to claim racial authenticity while also minimizing antiblack racism and sustaining easygoing feelings:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’d like to see more black people involved culturally. Things that will empower them spiritually, mentally. Like this class I’m taking now on African American folklore. I’m the only black person in there. I’d think there would be at least one other black person in there. But then again we’re all young but that would be an excuse. That’s what I’m getting at. Black people think that . . . you know, that film <italic>Crash</italic>, a very good film, produced and written by a white guy. There was a panel; this black girl was accusing white people of coming for extra credit only. You want to keep battling people like that? Black people have a tendency to only notice the black things that are happening. They don’t realize that movie touched on all kinds of racial issues, not just black–white issues. I looked at the black girl. It doesn’t really matter how they [white people] got here, it just matters that we’re all here getting the same message. That’s good [when white people can participate]. The fact of the matter is they’re open minded enough to attend. Everybody has ignorant moments. But some black people are so hung up on that slavery happened.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jackson directs his attention away from racism by linking blackness to a particular cultural heritage, rather than to structural disadvantages. He distances racism from his everyday experiences by attending to race as a concern that transcends the black–white dichotomy. He interprets white people as innocent and educable, disparaging black people who focus on inequality and who “battle” white people instead of talking with them. Emphasizing culture allows Jackson to proclaim an authentic racial identity (an interest in what it really means to be black that is not shared by his fellow black students) while also deemphasizing racism. This approach to blackness allows men like Jackson to treat race, but not racism, as consequential to their identities.</p>
<p>In addition to Jackson, eleven men juxtapose cultural blackness against political blackness, portraying them as opposites. Blackness, in this approach, adds “richness,” but is not a site of inequality, as Marcus illustrates: “I think the [BSU] here is confused. I think they got caught up in just bein’—having too much black pride, I would say, whereas . . . I’m into just showin’ that black is a beautiful thing and that we’re one and the same but we’re still different at the same time.” One can, of course, simultaneously value black culture <italic>and</italic> recognize racism; indeed, the Black Power movement revalued black culture as a form of resistance to white domination. These men invoke culture differently; however, their use corresponds with a dominant, middle-class kind of multiculturalism that values cultural differences without acknowledging structural inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891241611433053">Bell and Hartmann 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Three of these men take this use of culture to its logical extreme. In their formulation, being black makes them more interesting, rather than more vulnerable to inequality. Bryan, a regular, shows how an emphasis on culture can be extended to treat blackness as a structural advantage rather than a liability: “I think I have a good story to tell, and I think that helps out. . . . So people are going to remember [Bryan]. . . . It’s hard to keep track [of job candidates], and it’s those little things [like race] that make you stand out that are really gonna help you out.” Bryan does not see race as an impediment but instead imagines that his blackness will help him get a job. Raised by white grandparents in an all-white community, he seems particularly naïve. But Bryan is not alone in imagining a future with no occupational obstacles. Dominick, an athlete, and Richard, a regular, expressed similar views, suggesting that occupational doors would open to them in their post-college lives. Dominick, a bit differently, imagines that his collegiate athletic performance will overcome any barriers race may pose: “You know, they may not give, just (a) regular African American student that goes here the job, but I walk in the door and I have the job before I even sit down. You know, it’s, I guess it’s like a status type of a deal.”</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, six of the eighteen men depicted cultural and political identities as compatible, expressing some political consciousness about race. Regulars were more likely to adopt this approach, although most did not. These men were members of various black political organizations, including their BSUs and Queer People of Color (QPOC). Three of these men, discussed later, adopted more fluid identities, while three fully embraced moderate blackness. These men enacted black authenticity through participation in black political organizations. Despite their greater awareness of racism as a system of inequality, however, they not did promote revolution, but instead advocated measured emotional responses and open dialogue as the best remedies for inequality. In this way, they integrated political participation with the language and strategies of moderate blackness.</p>
<p>Describing himself as “aware and proud,” Jeffrey exemplifies this approach. Despite his use of the word “proud,” Jeffrey carves out a moderate position in which being black entails both “recognizing . . . one’s own culture—hip hop, embracing that culture” and simultaneously “recognizing the social stereotypes and obstacles that have to be overcome.” He explains:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I want my life to stand for change—having to face it on my own. Change—something on a large scale, also interpersonal, how you carry yourself as a person rather than fitting with the stereotype. For me, it’s articulation. You can make a lot of change by how you use words—the careful choice—humor and sensitivity, passion and conviction.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jeffrey draws on familiar emotion strategies. He sets a high bar for racism and enacts careful, restrained responses to any race-based interactions. Overcoming racism, he explains, requires educating white people (and thus presumes that white people are educable and innocent) and monitoring his cross-racial interactions by “staying true to [him]self—so [he doesn’t] live up to stereotypes of black men.” Lance adopts a similar approach. He, too, recognizes that blackness shapes how he is viewed, and presents himself carefully: “It’s those defining moments that define how every other person on this campus will look at us. It’s our responsibility to take hold of that definition and make it our own.” Like Jeffrey, he condemns angry responses, and advocates restrained responses aimed at educating white people. He differentiates himself from angry black students by fashioning himself as a leader, describing them as his “children,” and condemning their emotional responses. He says, “That anger, it’s an unbridled, pure, passionate anger, and it’s like, this is not gonna help anybody.” Despite their nod to change “on a large scale,” for these men, the primary strategy for “change” is to avoid being lumped with other black people. Thus, while moderate black men use race flexibly to defensively manage their identities, they similarly deemphasize racial conflict, instead promoting more individual strategies of inclusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0891241611433053">
<title>Moderate Blackness and Class Identities</title>
<p>Men’s focus on inclusion, in turn, meshes neatly with their class strategy. For the men in this study, positive relations with white people signify middle-class status or upward mobility. All but three men boasted about his ability to get along with white people, and used this quality to distinguish himself from other black people. Corey explains that his closest friends, like him, are the kind of black men who “interact with whites and blacks.” Vincent notes: “It’s better to be diverse every day. I guess you develop a better personality from being around white kids, Asian kids.” And Jesse says, “I know how to deal with the other races. . . . I can communicate with anybody comfortably.” Many credit their ability to transcend racial boundaries to their backgrounds. Jeffrey explains:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I grew up in a predominantly white school and a predominantly white neighborhood. I’m able to interact with white people in a more sincere way. If you grew up in a predominantly black area, you may not be able to interact effectively because [you’re] used to one kind of culture.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Unlike “guys who had never even seen white people,” Dominick notes, “I’m glad that I don’t have that stigma in my mind where I don’t know what to do. You know. I can relate to people who make this much money and I can relate to people who make billions.” In these claims, men’s backgrounds signify middle-class origins, and contrast with predominantly black backgrounds in rural or urban, presumably poor, communities. Thus, these men portray experiences in integrated backgrounds as naturally fostering good relationships with white people. This explanation naturalizes moderate blackness, masking the emotion work that goes into maintaining equanimity and good cross-racial relationships. Like other contemporary processes of emotion work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891241611433053">Irvine 2000</xref>), naturalization allows men to see moderate blackness as authentic—as who they really are.</p>
<p>At the same time, men use their ability to cross racial boundaries to signify valued personal qualities, including maturity, sophistication, and implicitly, racial progress, as David illustrates:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As you get older, it’s no problem. The skin color doesn’t matter. It’s just—Oh, that’s my boy. We play football together. It doesn’t have anything to do with skin color. . . . That’s the thing, I think that that’s the thing that comes with experiences like mine. The older I get, I recognize people for who they are. There are good people and bad people in every race. You’ve got to find the good people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this study, ten men attributed moderate blackness to their middle-class backgrounds, and used it to claim broadly valued middle-class qualities. In this way, they use moderate blackness not just to meet the interactive expectations of middle-class settings but to convey middle-class identities, asserting an innate class fit.</p>
<p>Emotional restraint is a way of fashioning black identities aimed at naturalizing membership in middle-class institutions. But although these men connect (middle) class to moderate blackness, they do not imply that men whose class origins are not in the middle class cannot achieve moderate blackness. Instead, men from lower-class origins learn restraint over time. Marcus illustrates this process in his description of a teammate: “as the years progressed, he started to adapt and he started to, say—I wouldn’t say, fully accept it, but he started to understand white people a little bit more, instead of just, “Get out of my face.” Men espoused moderation regardless of their own class origins, and men from middle-class backgrounds worked to teach moderation to other black men after they entered the university. As Lance says, “they [the younger black students] are looking to us for how to act.” And Ekon notes, “I tell a lot of the freshman you know, it’s going to happen. But don’t let it consume you, because you are more than your race. Keep moving.” These efforts to teach restraint to younger men reveal that moderate blackness is not as natural as these men claim, but is instead a shared strategy aimed at fashioning middle-class black masculine identities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0891241611433053">
<title>Moderate Blackness and Masculinity</title>
<p>To resolve their race and class dilemmas, black men carve out a middle space—one that is, in David’s words, enabled by the “strong sense of self” that accompanies being “men.” But David’s claim notwithstanding, moderate blackness threatens black university men’s claims to masculinity—precisely because it requires them to ignore, trivialize, or reinterpret cross-racial interactions. This emotion work puts black men in the position of changing their reactions and behaviors in order to maintain good relations with whites. In short, it requires them to defer. To maintain their masculinity, then, moderate black men must resignify the meaning of their emotional displays.</p>
<p>To do this, black men define moderation as masculine by inverting the link between anger and gender, portraying anger as a <italic>feminine</italic> emotional response. Black men feminize anger through symbolic boundaries and defensive othering in which they “seek to deflect the stigma they experiences as members of a subordinate group” by suggesting that the “angry black” stereotype may apply to black women, but it does not apply to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241611433053">Schwalbe et al. 2000</xref>, 425). Black university men create these gender boundaries in two ways. First, they typify black women as political and angry, and black men, in both explicit and implicit contrast, as apolitical and easygoing. Second, some men characterize anger and immoderate racial politics as features of black campus political organizations, such as the BSU, and associate these organizations with black women. By feminizing immoderate blackness, they masculinize moderate blackness. Six men directly assigned emotional immoderation to black women by describing them as angry, having an “attitude,” or “strong.” Dominick comments, “You know and there’s the, of course, the stereotype of African American women having an attitude . . . which, there, I’ve experienced that.” And Nick says: “I just feel like they’re always—they [black women] kind of always have a bone to pick with white people in general, just about everything.” He adds, “Black women, it seems like they are the ones that talk about a lot more issues than what black men do.” All but two men in this study explain that black women are too angry about black men’s behavior and especially about their relationships with white women. Tim illustrates these claims: “But there are days where they [black women] have confrontations about, why don’t black guys date black girls and all this drama. And I hate it when they talk about it, because it’s just a lot of talk and nothing gets solved and there’s no real reason.” Women’s anger, David notes, is “not always a conversation. It’s a look or it’s a glare or it’s a smacking of the teeth.” Women’s “attitudes” about interracial relationships symbolize their differences from black men: their immoderate emotions, unwillingness to depoliticize others’ behavior, and insistence on focusing on race. Men’s more easygoing attitudes about interracial relationships, in contrast, underscore their emotional and political moderation.</p>
<p>Eight men, mostly but not all athletes, also implicitly ascribed immoderation to black women by characterizing black campus organizations as emotionally and politically extreme, and associating those organizations with women. As Marcus says, “You know, you don’t see too many black women here who aren’t in [the BSU].” Most commonly, men associate these organizations with women by explaining that men, for various reasons, do not participate in them, and complaining about women’s persistent efforts to get them to come to meetings. Craig explains that black women “charge up to a lot of the other guys about it. . . . I think a lot of the guys just think of them as particularly persistent about [BSU].”</p>
<p>Most men dismiss BSU as racially extreme. Dominick, an athlete, mocks participants: “A lot of the [BSU] students . . . would always be like, ‘oh, oh, white man bringing me down. . . .’ And it’s like, really? Why do you go here? . . . If you don’t like it here, no one’s making you go here.” Less contemptuously, Phillip, says: “Everybody [in BSU] seemed very—in one way or another, they were angry.” Nick explains, “They are—like, I don’t want to make generalizations, but they are black power types.” And Richard comments, “All they do is bitch and complain. When something goes wrong, they make it into this big old deal, and I’m like, ‘Get over it! It is not gonna kill you.’”</p>
<p>Not all men criticize BSU. Four men in this study were members, and two of these were student leaders. Yet these men often colluded in the depiction of black women’s emotions as immoderate, and sometimes in the characterization of political organizations as feminine spaces, joining other men in criticizing women’s “attitudes” about interracial relationships, as we heard Tim, a BSU member, do. Three claimed to have a special connection to black women, while also making gendered distinctions. For example, Lance explained that black women see him as “special,”—“the most sensitive guy ever!” The only man invited to their “bitching sessions,” he nonetheless does not suggest that he joins them as an equal; instead, he describes his role in providing men’s perspective. Lance may be more sympathetic to black women than many men, but he also distinguishes himself from women’s “bitching” and dismisses their concerns about interracial relationships.</p>
<p>Men’s attribution of “bitching” and “attitude” to black women draws on both gender and racial stereotypes. The term “bitching” is a racially generic gender stereotype, while “attitude” is a gendered racial stereotype that discounts black women’s emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241611433053">Froyum 2010</xref>). Thus, men’s defensive othering not only resists identification with the stereotype of the angry black man by pushing the characterization onto black women but does so by evoking racialized gender stereotypes. The use of gender distances men from black anger, but dismissing women’s concerns as “attitude” or as “bitching and complaining” also defines their feelings as unnecessary and incommensurate to the situation, and thus bolsters the legitimacy of men’s definitions of racism and of their emotions. But more, by dismissing both black women and, often, black organizations, as immoderate spaces, black men abandon their collective responsibility to fight racial inequality, focusing instead on individual strategies of mobility and leaving the work of fighting racism up to women.</p>
<p>An examination of the three men who do not fully embrace moderate blackness underscores its use as a gender strategy. All men in this study adopted some elements of moderation—and specifically opted out of anger—but three evinced more complex identities. For different reasons, Phillip, Ekon, and Dennis “did” masculinity in different ways than the other men in this study and were thus less reliant on moderate blackness as a gender strategy. Phillip and Ekon both identified as queer, claiming that their sexuality gave them more latitude to embrace feminine qualities, “because,” in Ekon’s words, “you can kind of do whatever you want and not have to live up to certain stigma.” Dennis, the athlete who compared football to slavery, linked himself to a different tradition of black masculine leadership. Thus, alternative ways of doing gender enabled some men to opt out some of the masculinized expectations of moderate blackness.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this paper, I have examined emotion work among black university men, both athletes and nonathletes, at two different universities. I find that despite their differences, both kinds of men develop similar emotion strategies and link them to an identity I call moderate blackness. Moderate blackness facilitates membership in institutions in which the white middle class establishes the emotional rules. Black men use moderate blackness to accord with the more general emotional culture and to manage public ideas about (angry) black men. Thus, while moderate blackness is a <italic>racial</italic> strategy, it is compelled by the specific problems black college men face not just as black people but as upwardly mobile black <italic>men</italic>. Ironically, however, while moderate blackness responds to the <italic>gendered</italic> dilemmas facing black university men, it also fosters gender problems. Existing research assumes a consonance between emotions and identity work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241611433053">Wilkins 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241611433053">Wolkomir 2001</xref>), but here, the intersectional lens reveals a more complex relationship, in which emotional restraint and moderate blackness create identity dilemmas that need to be managed through other forms of identity work.</p>
<p>Moderate blackness is a strategy of emotional restraint. Black men control their emotions by learning to ignore, trivialize, and reinterpret everyday racism, and to see white peers as (educable) allies rather than (hostile) enemies. Their strategies are both rewarded and rewarding, as they allow them to see the campus as a friendly place, to enjoy a greater range of campus events, and to maintain working relationships, and potential intimacies, with white people. Although many of the men naturalize their emotion work by attributing it to their experiences growing up in integrated social settings, black men from various backgrounds learn and teach moderation in the context of the university. These strategies may build on preexisting emotional skills for some men, but other men learn strategies of moderate blackness in college. My findings suggest that college provides black men an opportunity to acquire, practice, and share the emotional skills they will need as black middle-class adults. College is a space in which black men learn to play by the racialized emotion rules set by the dominant culture, facilitating their ability to transition into the middle-class workplace.</p>
<p>Clearly, age matters. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241611433053">Ford’s (2011)</xref> recent work on a similar population, she finds that college does not provide black men immunity from (and may actually increase) pressure to adopt the racialized, gendered persona of the thug. The black college men in her study manage their discomfort with what often feels like an inauthentic presentation of self by imagining future selves in which they are able to enact a more respectable version of black manhood. In my data, too, the expectation that black college men will conform to narrow cultural images of black masculinity shapes the experiences of the men in my study, providing some with more resources in their emotion work, and others with more dilemmas. In this study, athletes were better able to approximate the thug ideal; these men, in general, were more accepted by their white peers. But while athletic status mediated experiences, it nonetheless affected the adoption of moderate blackness only in terms of specific strategies. Athletes, for example, were able to claim invulnerability by distancing themselves from regular black men, while regulars could not. Regulars, in contrast, were somewhat more likely to combine moderate blackness with political participation.</p>
<p>Athletic status probably shapes the costs of moderate blackness, however, as athletes have socially acceptable spaces (games and practice) in which they are expected to exhibit aggression, while regulars do not. Athletic status likely also protects men from some of the gender costs of deference, as they are able to combine emotional restraint with a kind of toughness associated with masculinity. Regular black men, in contrast, <italic>appear</italic> much more easygoing, and less masculine, than athletes. Because their failure to embody the thug is feminizing, they must invest even more in moderate blackness as a strategy for securing a masculine identity. Thus, neither the resources to enact emotion control, nor its consequences, are evenly distributed among black university men, despite their shared strategy. It is possible that this dynamic will reverse after college. Athletes’ bigger size may generate more fear among whites they encounter once it can no longer be cast as a sports persona; thus, former athletes may have to do even more work to manage their emotional display than nonathletes. More work is needed on the ways race and gender, and the cultural expectations (not just the material resources) they entail, constrain and enable the transition to adulthood.</p>
<p>Here, my focus is different. In this study, I have focused on college as a space in which black men manage one component of their identities—emotions—to develop racialized mobility strategies. College men are not just concerned with mobility, however. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891241611433053">Kimmel (2010</xref>, 130) writes about ages 16 to 26, “this is perhaps the most gendered stage of a person’s development.” The men in this study, like other men, are not just concerned with class mobility; they are also concerned with their claims to manhood and the privileges it entails. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891241611433053">Schrock and Schwalbe (2009</xref>, 280-81) lament that “laudable” efforts to diversify masculinity studies have “fostered a kind of categorical essentialism in studies of men,” creating the impression that there are different flavors of men, and overlooking the things “males do to create, maintain, and claim membership in a dominant membership group.” In his ethnography of East Harlem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891241611433053">Bourgois (1995)</xref> argues that workplace emotion rules, and especially the expectation that men will defer to the white women who typically supervise them, often push poor Puerto Rican men back into the crack economy. Participation in the formal workplace is simply too costly to their manhood. Here, however, the men figure out other ways to manage potentially feminizing emotional expectations. Like other men who are unable to meet the expectations of dominant masculinity, black college men transform the gendered meanings of their restrained emotional displays and retie their emotional displays to other conventional masculine signifiers. The links between masculinity and moderate blackness challenge the idea that avoiding anger is a passive, feminine emotional response, aligning emotional restraint instead with a discourse of invulnerability, self-control, and “a strong sense of identity.” Thus, in sidestepping anger, black college men must relinquish a conventional prerogative of masculine status, but they do not abandon their masculine power over black women. Instead, they invert the gendered meaning attached to black anger, pushing it onto black women. The links between anger and femininity, in turn, compel men to adopt moderate blackness, even when it fits less well with their experiences of campus life and when it creates other dilemmas for them. As I have shown, only men who have other ways to anchor their masculinity are able to avoid some of moderate blackness’s more stringent demands.</p>
<p>Despite the inversion of the gendered meaning of anger, the equation of emotional restraint with black men and emotional excess with black women is a racially specific version of a broader use of gendered emotional distinctions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891241611433053">Sattel (1976)</xref> argues that men use emotional in-expression to exercise power. Because women expect men to be inexpressive, they treat emotional disclosure as a gift. Men and women interpret women’s disclosure, in contrast, as a matter of course, and thus not worthy of gratitude. Similarly, because black students expect men to be emotionally restrained and apolitical, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891241611433053">Kolb (2007)</xref> finds, men’s involvement in campus racial politics may feel like a gift, according men more credit and gratitude for less political effort. In this study, similarly, Lance’s acknowledgment of women’s concerns made him seem “special.” Moderate blackness also sustains black women’s role as the emotional keepers of their communities. Anger may be viewed as unfeminine, but it is a form of emotion work done on behalf of the black community. Black women use anger to challenge white racism in the classroom and on the campus more broadly—emotion work enacted not just to benefit themselves but to benefit all black students.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is also important not to overlook the difficulties race poses for upwardly mobile black men. The intersectionality of their identity location, and the contradictions between classed racial expectations and gender expectations, makes their identity work more fragile. They use cultural resources in creative ways to solve their identity problems, but their identity claims are also always at risk of being challenged. Black men may have much in common with other men, then, but they are also different in key ways. For black men, racialized feeling rules and the stereotype of the angry black man make their emotion work much more precarious than that of other men, as the example of Obama reminds us. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611433053">Wingfield and Feagin (2010)</xref> argue that, in the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama sidestepped intersectional identity dilemmas by enacting a “cool strategy” that allowed him to combine emotional control while also signaling masculine authority. However, since the election, Obama’s relentless commitment to emotional restraint, symbolized by his insistence on “working across the aisle,” has changed public perception of his gender performance. Once lauded for his cool-headedness, Obama is now lambasted frequently as a “wimp.” In this case, a too tenacious commitment to restraint (accompanied by deference to the Republicans) has destabilized his masculinity.</p>
<p>The strategy of moderate blackness exacerbates these dilemmas by sustaining the expectations that prompt them in the first place. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891241611433053">Fields, Copp, and Kleinman (2006)</xref> argue, positive emotions can reproduce inequality. Men’s good feelings not only allow them to tolerate race-based inequalities; they also prevent men from identifying them. Moderate blackness circumscribes the range of men’s emotional and political expression, constraining not just their feelings but their cognitive attention as well. It thus manages the individual problems black men face on college campuses but does not challenge the basis for the different emotional rules that constrain them in the first place. At the same time, it limits their ability to see or address other forms of race-based treatment that might constrain their future mobility. It may thus leave them psychologically vulnerable in another way: if they invalidate race-based mistreatment as a basis for unequal outcomes, then they will need to hold themselves individually responsible for any obstacles they encounter.</p>
<p>Moderate blackness relies on two strategies of identity work—“propping up dominants” and “defensive othering” found among other subordinate groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241611433053">Schwalbe et al. 2000</xref>). Much work on “propping up dominants” examines the ways women endorse men and masculinity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241611433053">Ezzell 2009</xref>); here, black men’s identity work props up racial dominants. In the case at hand, black men do not so much attribute superiority to white people as they simply let them off the hook for their racist behavior by ascribing benign motivations and holding themselves accountable for any racial change. This strategy maintains racial hierarchies by allowing racist dynamics to continue unchecked. “Defensive othering” also maintains racial inequality. By attributing black anger to black women, moderate blackness fails to challenge the links between blackness and (inappropriate) anger. Black men’s defensive othering casts black women as not only gender inferiors but as racially inferior: their anger makes them the wrong kind of black people. Thus, men’s identity work supports the cultural devaluation of black women on predominantly white campuses, while sustaining the idea that black anger is both real and inappropriate.</p>
