<p>During her opening remarks at the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) 2-day workshop on telehealth technology held from August 8 to 9, 2012, in Washington, D.C., Dr. Mary Wakefield—the current administrator for the Health Resources and Services Administration—emphasized that telehealth can play an important role in what is clearly a rapidly evolving health care environment in the United States and that it will continue to grow as more people across the nation are able to seek full complement of health care services with the continuing implementation of the Affordable Care Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313495917">IOM, 2012</xref>). With the current administration’s continued focus on improving health care access in rural and isolated areas across the United States, all mental health professionals including psychiatric-mental health nurses must position themselves ready to embrace, adopt, and implement innovative practice and nontraditional care delivery models that improve and increase health care access for all. The current mental health workforce shortage in the United States coupled with increased need for mental health services and the nation’s ongoing health care system transformation has set the stage for innovative approaches to improving care and how this care is delivered. Although it is imperative to increase the number of psychiatric providers as well as addressing financial coverage, psychiatric nurses must also examine alternate ways of reaching their patients.</p>
<p>Over a decade ago, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390313495917">IOM (2001)</xref> has recommended that the U.S. health care system adopt a variety of approaches to deliver care including electronic communications without face-to-face interactions. <italic>Telemental health</italic> is a broad term that describes the delivery of mental health services from a distance. Direct patient care, via real-time televideoconferencing, or asynchronous activities that support patient care are included in this definition, whereas telepsychiatry refers to direct patient care only. Direct patient services include evaluations, consultations, medication management, therapy services, and other forms of care. Indirect support can be provided through remote monitoring (e.g., store and forward videos), smart phone and other mobile devices, virtual realities, email, and other web-based activities. Mental health is well-matched to the use of all of these technologies for delivery of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313495917">American Telemedicine Association, 2009b</xref>). Psychiatric nurses need exposure to the modalities in order to consider the adoption of telemental health.</p>
<p>Articles pertaining to the use of telemental health by psychiatric nurses are limited to physician supervision via televideo communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313495917">Heckner &amp; Giard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390313495917">Staller, 2006</xref>) or indirect mention regarding decreased staffing costs or as part of a multidisciplinary team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390313495917">Mitchell, MacLaren, Morton, &amp; Carachi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390313495917">Smith, Scuffham, &amp; Wootton, 2007</xref>). To date, one article directly presents the telehealth services of an advanced practice psychiatric nurse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313495917">Ellington, in press</xref>). The exact level of nurse participation in telemental health is unknown, but the paucity of observable nursing involvement would indicate that it is most likely limited. Minimal use of this modality may be due in part to its unfamiliarity in the nursing profession, concerns about the ability to develop a strong therapeutic alliance with patients at a distance, or the complexity of legal, regulatory, and technical issues. As more psychiatric nurses become familiar with telemental health, adoption of this innovative approach to care begins.</p>
<p>Adoption of a new idea, even one with apparent benefits, is a complex process that often takes significant time and effort to achieve. According to Everett Rogers, a leading expert in both theory and research of innovation adoption theory, diffusion is “the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313495917">Rogers, 2003</xref>, p. 11). An innovation is any new idea, practice, or object that can be adopted by an individual or group. It is not necessary that the innovation is newly created, but rather it is perceived to be new because of its current lack of adoption. The adoption or rejection of an innovation can be explained through its characteristics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313495917">Rogers (2003)</xref> describes five attributes of innovations: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. Telemental health has been practiced for over 50 years, and the literature is no longer in its infancy as evidenced by increased original research, systematic reviews, expert opinion, and organizational guidelines. The use of televideo communication as a means of delivering psychiatric care is considered an innovation nonetheless, and the five attributes of an innovation offer a framework for understanding potential adoption of telemental health by psychiatric-mental health nurses.</p>
<list id="list1-1078390313495917" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Relative advantage is the extent to which telemental health is perceived as better than the alternative. The alternative to telemental health is traditional face-to-face care, services by a primary care practitioner, or no services at all. Advantages include increased accessibility to services, potential cost-effectiveness, comparable treatment outcomes, and interest in technology, particularly by the younger population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313495917">Ellington &amp; McGuinness, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compatibility is the extent to which telemental health is perceived to be in line with the adopters’ values, past experiences, and needs. Compatibility with traditional practice patterns, nursing and mental health practice guidelines, convenient location of equipment, environmental setting, privacy issues, and patient/provider satisfaction must be examined by each potential adopter.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complexity is the extent to which telemental health is perceived to be challenging to understand and use. The complex nature of the following issues requires consideration: lack of a single place for psychiatric nurses to learn about telepsychiatry, privacy laws and regulatory requirements, different states resulting in a set of checkerboard compliance standards surrounding telemedicine, lack of interstate licensing, insurance reimbursement, malpractice coverage, technology training with ongoing technical support, and ability to provide face-to-face consultation if needed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Trialability is the extent to which telemental health may be experimented with on a trial basis. Opportunities for nurses to experiment with the technology before committing to adopting it must be explored.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Observability is the extent to which the results of an innovation are evident to others. The lack of published articles or other observable involvement in telemental health by nurses requires increase in its visibility.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Despite the barriers and challenges to adoption of telemental health, there are many compelling reasons for psychiatric nurses—both generalist and advanced practice—to consider this innovative modality and help accelerate its adoption in their practice settings. Whether considering direct patient care as a provider/presenter or considering the incorporation of smartphones and other mobile mental health applications, it is imperative that one reviews the current literature as well as resources developed by organizations such as publication titled “Evidence-Based Practice for Telemental Health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313495917">American Telemedicine Association, 2009a</xref>). Early adopters play an important role in the technology adoption cycle and in successfully mainstreaming various evidence-based technological innovations in health care. Thus, it is vitally important for psychiatric nurses who are early adopters to share their expert knowledge and increase visibility of psychiatric telehealth nursing (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.telepsych4nurses.org">www.telepsych4nurses.org</ext-link> for a nurse’s journey in telepsychiatry). The American Psychiatric Nurses Association’s (APNA) <italic>Member Bridge</italic>, an online networking community and discussion forum, has served as recent venue for professional knowledge sharing and exchange of ideas regarding health care technology use. Clearly, there is a growing interest on telemental health within APNA based on the recent online postings, discussion threads, and topics discussed in various member-led online forums related to telemental health and other related topics on technology use in psychiatric-mental health nursing practice.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the mental health care system in the United States will continue to evolve in this era of health care reform, and the ongoing convergence of technology in health care is a current reality. In this technological and digital age, telemental health provides psychiatric nurses with exciting opportunities and the ability to transform traditional mental health practice. By harnessing the power of technology and combining it with their expertise in evidence-based mental health care, psychiatric nurses can provide and continue to deliver quality mental health care through innovative and nontraditional means while making it more accessible. But first, in order for psychiatric nurses to fully realize the potentials of any type of current or emerging health care technology, its adoption is key.</p>
