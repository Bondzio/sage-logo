<p><bold>Andrew Kaye and Tara Melton from Royal National Institute of Blind People look at what Joint Strategic Needs Assessments mean for public health</bold></p>
<p>Why have not-for-profit organizations turned to one another to share tips on the most practical routes for influencing Joint Strategic Needs Assessments (JSNA)? Are we beginning to see a growing public interest in JSNA, or at least their potential to highlight and address the diverse health needs of whole populations? Based on recent evidence, that could be the case; the question then is what does this mean for shaping public health?</p>
<p>Original guidance on JSNA stated that “community engagement is an essential element of JSNA…the process, will in itself, have a positive impact on health and wellbeing”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912444049">1</xref></sup> Unfortunately, four years later effective engagement with the voluntary and community sector remains an aspiration in many areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913912444049">2</xref></sup> It is also unclear whether voluntary organizations have the tool sets and resources to engage with JSNA joint health and wellbeing strategies (JHWS) and shadow health and wellbeing boards.</p>
<p>Last November the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) and Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) came together to host a workshop on influencing JSNA in collaboration with the public health NGO Forum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913912444049">3</xref></sup> Colleagues from organizations as diverse as Age UK, Action for Blind People, Action on Smoking and Health and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents all took part. What became immediately obvious were the varying levels of confidence in and preparation for engaging with JSNA.</p>

<title>The value of JSNA</title>
<p>JSNA were originally designed to lead to stronger partnerships between communities, local government and the NHS. Now they have an enhanced role; a critical function of JSNA is building a unique “picture of place”. A JSNA must make links between determinants of health, through telling a story about a community; its people; its assets; and the health challenges that still exist. Only when a JSNA does all these things can it help inform a decent JHWS and focus on the wider determinants of health.</p>
<p>JSNA is not in and of itself a tool for tackling health inequalities or improving health outcomes. Groups that were once neglected but now seek a higher profile for their health and wellbeing priorities nonetheless view JSNA as a useful stepping-stone. JSNA represents an effective vehicle for raising awareness of various groups’ health and wellbeing needs.</p>

<title>Lessons from the sight loss sector</title>
<p>RNIB together with its partners on the UK Vision Strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912444049">4</xref></sup> have positioned ourselves as sector leaders and have started to dedicate more resource to engaging with JSNA. Early results are very promising in terms of increased recognition of eye health and eye care within many local JSNA. However, bringing the needs of people at risk of, and living with sight loss to the attention of JSNA leads, not to mention seeing this data used to then guide investment decisions, was certainly not straightforward.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly one of the most useful things RNIB did from the outset was to commission research on the future costs and prevalence of sight loss. It was very well convincing ourselves that tackling avoidable sight loss was a moral imperative, but unless the economics stacked up, it was going to be difficult bridging the voluntary-statutory sector divide.</p>
<p>In 2010 RNIB identified at least two JSNA in each region that made insufficient reference to promoting eye health or eliminating preventable sight loss. In places like Wiltshire, Devon and most impressive of all Bristol, we got stuck in and JSNA leads started to sit up and take notice of what the RNIB, Action for Blind People and other sight loss organizations had to say. In some places we made the initial approach through JSNA events organized with a Local Involvement Network (LINk).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1757913912444049">i</xref></sup> In other areas we were treated just like every other organization that comes face-to-face with hard-pressed commissioners, with objectivity and a healthy dose of scepticism about the validity of our data. However, over time we managed to secure much better sections on the eye health needs of local communities within JSNA. This is particularly important when we consider that the total number of people with sight loss in the UK will rise to over 2,500,000 by 2020.</p>

<sec id="section3-1757913912444049">
<title>Opportunities for integration</title>
<p>Our next challenge is to build effective relationships with health and wellbeing boards and clinical commissioning groups. With limited resources it is important that we help Directors of Public Health and commissioners recognise the risk factors linking sight loss with other long-term conditions and disabilities. There are proven links between smoking and sight loss for example. We all know about the links between diabetes and certain kinds of eye disease. People from black and minority ethnic communities are also at greater risk of some of the leading causes of sight loss and we now know people with learning disabilities are ten times more likely to have serious sight problems than other people. Our role is to help local areas make sense of these facts and support them with their analysis of local need.</p>
<p>As we move into a new era for commissioning and delivering services, voluntary and community organizations are well positioned to provide evidence and ensure an integrated approach. Clearly there is a limit to what we can do but our plea is that in this period of transition voluntary and community organizations are actively sought out and involved in JSNA processes. Community engagement promises improved JSNA, and we hope better health outcomes, as a result.</p>
