<p>The media coverage of climate change issues is in decline in both the developed and developing countries. This situation calls for innovative ways by which the costs associated with climate change coverage can be shared and defrayed; it needs to attract true partners within the media sector and beyond in addressing climate change issues; and it must develop practical solutions to overcoming the systemic public apathy toward climate science and climate science journalism in developing countries.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The media play an important role in creating awareness of climate change and fostering an understanding of the subject by both governments and the public. Unfortunately, media coverage of climate change issues is in decline; it fell by 20% in developed countries between 2010 and 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1075547012464216">Fischer, 2012</xref>). Recent surveys show that, while climate change coverage in East Africa has improved significantly, it still falls short of expectations in terms of positioning, quality, and quantity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547012464216">Okomo-Okello, 2009</xref>). The findings from a study covering Mozambique, Swaziland, and Zambia point to a lack of systematic, planned, purposive, targeted, and coordinated communication strategies and support for awareness creation among different climate change stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547012464216">Kayula, 2009</xref>). The media have an important role to play in fostering dialogue, challenging the community and the government to action, and galvanizing efforts to find solutions. Disturbingly, in countries most vulnerable to climate change, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, the subject attracts low public interest and is insufficiently covered by the media.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1075547012464216">
<title>Challenges to Climate Change Coverage</title>
<p>A free press strengthens the public sphere by mediating between citizens and the state, facilitating debate about climate change and opening dialogue about available mitigation and adaptation options. Despite Africa’s vulnerability, climate change issues remain poorly understood, in part because of the prevailing structural and capacity weaknesses of the media sector. These weaknesses range from the inadequate business models of media organizations to the lack of skills by journalists to interpret and report information and by editors, analysts, and researchers to efficiently and accurately find and analyze climate change information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547012464216">Kakonge, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result, in many sub-Saharan Africa countries, climate change reporting is events-driven with little or no attempt to link local events to the larger climate change discourse. The ever-present element of uncertainty in climate science and research and the abstract nature of the material make it difficult for climate change news to compete with more sensational material such as politics and violence. Furthermore, it has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547012464216">Fahn, 2009</xref>) that the challenge of reporting on climate science to the public is more daunting in Africa, where the prevalent widespread illiteracy levels require that the climate change message be localized and communicated in vernacular tongues, and principally through radio and television.</p>
<p>News editors often cite low public interest in climate change issues to justify inadequate and sporadic coverage of the subject. The supposed lack of demand is translated into high costs of climate change reporting, low sales volume, and ultimately reduced profit margins. Some of these concerns are unfounded, since effective media are capable of narrowing the gap between marginal costs and marginal revenues relating to the production and dissemination of news. Moreover, print media may reap economies of scale from the increased audience interest that is generated by enhanced production and circulation. Appropriate and deliberate actions by media owners can hasten this process.</p>
<p>As technology brings Africa closer into line with the capabilities found in the rest of the world, there is evidence of growing public interest in following climate change–related stories, sourced both externally and internally. This is especially true among the youth, who constitute an increasingly large segment of the population in many countries. The media can collaborate with other business entities to prepare and publish carefully targeted special reports on climate change. Commentators have pointed out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547012464216">Porter, Bird, Kaur, &amp; Peskett, 2008</xref>) that the cost of producing and publishing these reports and features can be covered by advertising revenue for products that are popular with the target audience.</p>
<p>A wide range of public awareness activities focused on climate change are currently under way in most African countries, but these are not well coordinated and their impact has been minimal. Unfortunately, most of these activities are confined to urban areas. Very little effort is being made to include traditional ecological knowledge and practices as part of climate change public awareness strategies. Without this kind of approach, it is evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547012464216">Kakonge, 2011</xref>) that rural populations in Africa would be severely marginalized in the current climate change debate.</p>
<p>There are several ways some of these challenges could be addressed, as outlined below.</p>
<sec id="section3-1075547012464216">
<title>Training</title>
<p>The continued training of journalists in the areas of climate change could help bridge the knowledge gap that exists in many developing countries. A curriculum that involves investigative journalism and humanizing storylines, that finds a nexus between local events and the larger climate change debate, and that avoids climate change jargon in favor of familiar, everyday terminology is most desirable in developing country contexts. In this vein, the high-level side event meeting during the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDC-IV) in Istanbul in May 2011 recommended that established media companies, environment-oriented multinational companies in developing countries, foundations, and development partners should assist in funding the training of journalists, media editors, and reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1075547012464216">South-South News, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1075547012464216">2011b</xref>). In addition, as noted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1075547012464216">Aga Khan (2010)</xref>, the future schools of journalism should include in their curriculum subjects such as environmental science and other related areas. This, in turn, will be cost-effective and will reduce the costs of having to organize separate courses for journalists, reporters, and editors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1075547012464216">
<title>Bringing Media Organizations on Board</title>
<p>Reaching out to, and engaging, media owners and editors concerning the importance of climate change reporting could have a big impact. What gets published reflects, in large part, the editorial policies and decisions taken by these two groups. Climate change reporting is crucial in bringing about policy and behavioral change supportive of mitigation and adaptation strategies. While concerns over profits and low public interest may be legitimate, they should not be used as a pretext to neglect covering climate change. It is the corporate responsibility of media organizations to participate in the provision of public goods and services, including climate change awareness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1075547012464216">
<title>Cultivating Partnerships</title>
<p>The successful delivery of complex news involving climate change requires the fostering of partnerships across multiple platforms. The business community, especially those that produce and sell environment-friendly products and services, can work with media organizations to publicize climate change concerns. An increase in both the demand for, and the coverage of, climate change in the media is a win-win approach for both constituencies. In addition, governments, charities, foundations, and other institutions can also partner with media organizations by funding climate change coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547012464216">Kakonge, 2011</xref>). The media can reap tremendous benefits by partnering with climate change experts, universities, research institutions, and other resource centers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1075547012464216">
<title>African Experts in the Diaspora</title>
<p>Media experts in the diaspora (i.e., African experts who are living abroad but have connections with their countries of origin) can make a difference in the African region where climate change issues are poorly covered by the media. Not only are they able to provide critical editorial, programming, and management expertise, they can readily place local environmental events within their relevant global contexts. When done properly, such reporting can contribute to the deepening of climate change journalism, making it more likely for the media to challenge both the public and the government to act responsively.</p>
<p>In Africa, especially where the public is largely illiterate, local-level climate change issues are of particular importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547012464216">Kakonge, 2011</xref>). African media experts in the diaspora can contribute to the effective use of vernacular tongues, appropriate visual aids, and traditional knowledge in explaining climate change, mitigation, and adaptation. With the necessary goodwill, those members of the diaspora with relevant expertise can undoubtedly contribute toward the establishment and functioning of community and village media sources, including radio, television, and newspapers.</p>
<p>In short, the question of how to improve media coverage of climate change in the most vulnerable communities deserves urgent attention. It calls for innovative ways by which the costs associated with climate change coverage can be shared and defrayed; it needs to attract true partners within the media sector and beyond in addressing climate change issues; and it must develop practical solutions to overcoming the systemic public apathy toward climate science and climate science journalism in African countries. To achieve those goals, Africa should tap into the abundant resources of its diaspora, especially in helping build local capacity.</p>
