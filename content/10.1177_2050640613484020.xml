<sec id="sec25-2050640613484020"><title>Objectives</title>
<p>This study aimed to resolve controversy regarding the effects of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication therapy and <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-2050640613484020"><title>Design</title>
<p>A randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial was performed in patients presenting with reflux symptoms. <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients were randomized to receive either antibiotics or placebo for 7 days. <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative patient controls received placebo. All received esomeprazole 20 mg b.d. for 7 days, followed by 40 mg o.d. to complete an 8-week course, and were followed up for 32 weeks by telephone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec27-2050640613484020"><title>Results</title>
<p>In this study, 198/589 (34%) patients were <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive and 113 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative patients served as controls. Baseline endoscopy revealed 63% Los Angeles grade 0A and 37% Los Angeles grade BCD oesophagitis with no difference between patient groups. Symptom improvement on esomeprazole was seen in 89%. <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication was successful in 82%. <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication had no effect on symptomatic relapse (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.74–1.8; <italic>p</italic> = 0.5). Overall, <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients had a lower probability of relapse compared to <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative controls (hazard ratio 0.6, 95% CI 0.43–0.85; <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). Relapse hazard was modulated also by oesophagitis grade (BCD vs. 0A, hazard ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.5–3.0).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec28-2050640613484020"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Relapse of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms after a course of high dose acid suppression took longer for <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients than <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative controls; however eradication therapy had no effect on the risk of relapse; ClincialTrials.gov number, NCT00574925.</p>

<sec id="sec1-2050640613484020" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common medical problem with a spectrum of symptoms and varying degrees of severity. It is estimated that 20–40% of the adult population experiences heartburn or other symptoms related to reflux and this can impact on quality of life and health costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2050640613484020">1</xref></sup> Moreover, there is a strong relation between acid reflux and the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2050640613484020">2</xref></sup> These concerns highlight the importance of identifying modifiable risk factors for GORD. One such factor may be gastric <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection.</p>
<p>There is an on-going debate about the appropriate management of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in GORD. Many authors recommend <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication prior to the initiation of long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy because the combination of <italic>H. pylori</italic> and acid suppression accelerates development of gastric mucosal atrophy and there is some anxiety that this may increase the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2050640613484020">3</xref></sup> Other experts caution against this approach,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2050640613484020">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2050640613484020">5</xref></sup> as most epidemiological studies indicate that reflux symptoms, mucosal disease, and oesophageal cancer are less common in patients with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2050640613484020">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2050640613484020"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2050640613484020"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2050640613484020"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2050640613484020"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2050640613484020"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2050640613484020">11</xref></sup> Clinical studies show that acid suppression is more profound and the healing of reflux oesophagitis during treatment with PPIs is more rapid in patients with than in patients without gastric <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2050640613484020">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050640613484020">13</xref></sup> Additionally, two case–control studies report an increased risk of developing GORD after eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in patients with duodenal ulcer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050640613484020">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2050640613484020">15</xref></sup> although others find no significant effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2050640613484020">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2050640613484020"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2050640613484020">18</xref></sup> There are concerns, therefore, that treatment of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in GORD patients may exacerbate the disease.</p>
<p>Five prospective controlled trials have studied the effects of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and eradication in patients with GORD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2050640613484020">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2050640613484020"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2050640613484020"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2050640613484020"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2050640613484020">23</xref></sup> For patients with reflux symptoms and normal mucosa or grade A oesophagitis on endoscopy, Moayyedi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2050640613484020">19</xref></sup> observed no difference in the relapse rate between the antibiotic, placebo, and <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative control groups for up to 18 months of follow up. Negative results were reported also by Kuipers et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2050640613484020">21</xref></sup> in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients with reflux oesophagitis. In contrast, Schwizer et al. in a study that recruited patients with all grades of endoscopic findings reported that <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication delayed the time to relapse compared to the placebo group and <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2050640613484020">20</xref></sup> These divergent findings are likely due to differences in patient populations or the failure to account for the pattern of gastric infection and inflammation in the <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive treatment groups. The latter point may affect clinical outcomes as antral gastritis is associated with increased acid output, whereas corpus gastritis is associated with reduced acid output.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2050640613484020">24</xref></sup> Thus, in principle, <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication may increase or decrease acid secretion and so the likelihood of acid reflux and related symptoms.</p>
<p>This large, multicentre trial is designed to provide more definitive evidence whether <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection impacted on the severity or prognosis of GORD and to inform the clinical decision whether to eradicate <italic>H. pylori</italic> in patients presenting with reflux symptoms. Subjects are stratified according to the presence and grade of reflux oesophagitis at baseline to assess whether the impact of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication, if any, is observed across the spectrum of GORD. Additionally, gastric biopsies obtained before and after treatment assess whether the severity or pattern of gastritis, mucosal thickness, or parietal cell numbers is related to clinical outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-2050640613484020" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Erastrat is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy in patients presenting with typical reflux symptoms of at least moderate severity as defined by a score of &gt;25 on the Eraflux questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2050640613484020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2050640613484020">25</xref></sup> Three parallel groups are studied. Patients in the randomized groups were <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive and assigned to eradication treatment or placebo. Patients in the non-randomized control group were <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative and received placebo. Patients were stratified by endoscopic classification of reflux disease according to the Los Angeles (LA) system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2050640613484020">26</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec3-2050640613484020"><title>Patient recruitment</title>
<p>A total of 19 hospital- and office-based gastroenterology practices participated in the study, from Austria (<italic>n</italic> = 2), Germany (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and Switzerland (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Patients aged above 18 that met the inclusion criteria were recruited: (i) present with heartburn or acid regurgitation; (ii) at least 8 weeks duration; (iii) at least three times a week; and (iv) with at least moderate intensity, corresponding to mild impairment in daily life and need for medication. Exclusion criteria include history of previous oesophageal or gastric surgery, alcohol or drug abuse, severe organic or psychiatric disease, pregnancy or lactation, women with child-bearing potential without contraceptive measures, allergy or contra-indication to study medications, or need for concomitant medication. Prior knowledge of <italic>H. pylori</italic> status and previous treatment with PPIs were not exclusion criteria. The trial was approved by ethical committees at each centre and written informed consent was obtained.</p>
<p>Study participants underwent endoscopy. Patients with Barrett oesophagus, malignancy, or peptic ulceration on endoscopy were excluded. Endoscopy and biopsy were repeated at the end of the study. <italic>H. pylori</italic> status was assessed by a <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050640613484020">13</xref></sup>C urea breath test at recruitment and at the end of the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2050640613484020">27</xref></sup> Gastric biopsies (author MV) and breath test samples (author AL) were forwarded to reference laboratories. Local investigators remained blind to the <italic>H. pylori</italic> status throughout the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-2050640613484020"><title>Randomization</title>
<p>Computer-controlled inclusion and randomization of patients were operated by an independent study monitor (PharmaPart, Thalwil, Switzerland). Patients that met entry criteria were randomized by a dynamic, centralized procedure that ensured blinding to <italic>H. pylori</italic> status and treatment group allocation. Probability of rejection was computed such that the projected fraction of patients in each group was constant at each point in time during the study. This system ensured that the appropriate numbers of patients with LA grade 0, AB, or CD oesophagitis on endoscopy were recruited and that a balanced sample of patients was entered at each site.</p>
<p>Patients with evidence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection on <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050640613484020">13</xref></sup>C urea breath test were randomized either to the antibiotics group for eradication or placebo (gastric histology was not considered). <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative control patients all received placebo. Because of the higher prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative compared to <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients, a computerized early random rejection scheme was applied that accepted one-third initially and was dynamically adjusted to ensure balanced recruitment throughout the entire study. Prior to transferring data for analysis, monitors removed all information on drug randomization and <italic>H. pylori</italic> status from the database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-2050640613484020"><title>Study protocol</title>
<p>Once the centralized system had rejected or accepted the patient, the local investigator was informed by fax. If accepted, study medication was dispensed and a central call centre was informed so that telephone interviews could be arranged (no clinical details were transferred). As outlined in the flow chart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2050640613484020">Figure 1</xref>), patients were contacted by the call centre to assess symptom severity before and after 8 weeks treatment with esomeprazole and subsequently at 2-week intervals until recurrence of reflux symptoms on two subsequent occasions (relapse) or the completion of 32 weeks of follow up. At the end of the study (i.e. relapse or 32-week follow up), the patient underwent repeat endoscopy and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050640613484020">13</xref></sup>C urea breath test. Further management decisions were based on clinical discretion.

</fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-2050640613484020"><title>Study medications</title>
<p>For <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication, patients were randomized to receive either amoxicillin 1000 mg, and clarithromycin 500 mg, administered twice daily for the first 7 days (antibiotics group), or identical placebo tablets (placebo group). Treatment of GORD with esomeprazole (Nexium; AstraZeneca, Zug, Switzerland) was not randomized. All patients received 20 mg b.d. for 7 days from study start, followed by 40 mg o.d. for 49 days to complete an 8-week course of esomeprazole. This management has been proven effective for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2050640613484020">28</xref></sup> oesophagitis healing, and symptom resolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2050640613484020">29</xref></sup> After acid suppression was withdrawn, patients were provided with an alginate preparation (Gaviscon; Reckitt Benckiser, Slough, UK) as rescue medication for recurrent symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-2050640613484020"><title>Symptom assessment</title>
<p>The Eraflux questionnaire measures the frequency, duration, and intensity of reflux symptoms: heartburn, regurgitation, chest or retrosternal pain, and dysphagia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2050640613484020">20</xref></sup> Relapse was defined as recurrence of GORD symptoms to an Eraflux score of 25 at two consecutive interviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2050640613484020">25</xref></sup> The day of the first interview was taken as date of relapse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-2050640613484020"><title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to assess whether <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication treatment extends the time to symptomatic relapse after withdrawal of PPI therapy in patients with a clinical diagnosis of GORD. In addition, the time to relapse in the two <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive study groups with the non-randomized <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative control group was compared. Data analysis was performed with patients stratified according to oesophagitis grade at inclusion. Secondary objectives were to compare the effect of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and eradication on reflux oesophagitis and to compare the pattern of gastric inflammation and atrophy in the two <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive treatment groups with the <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative control group at relapse. Outcome data was analysed by ‘intention-to-treat’ (ITT) and ‘as treated’, defined by <italic>H. pylori</italic> status at relapse or the end of the study (eradicated, non-eradicated, negative control).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-2050640613484020"><title>Histology</title>
<p>Biopsies were obtained from the oesophagus, gastric antrum, and corpus (midportion at the greater curvature) with standard forceps at recruitment and at the end of the study. Specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and stained with haematoxylin and eosin and Alcian blue periodic Schiff. Histology was assessed by independent investigators (MV, RG) for determination of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, presence of gastritis, mucosal thickness, and density of parietal cells. <italic>H. pylori</italic> gastritis and mucosal atrophy were graded according to the Sydney System.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2050640613484020">30</xref></sup> Histologists were not aware of clinical and endoscopic findings or treatment allocation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-2050640613484020"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Clinical data was entered manually into an on-line database. Data from early dropouts within the first 8 weeks (i.e. during treatment with esomeprazole) were not used. Data from dropouts during the 32-week follow up (off treatment) are censored to the date of the last telephone interview. Statistics were computed with R.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2050640613484020">31</xref></sup> Two-sided tests were used throughout the study; results are reported as significant for <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0·05. Cross-tabulations were tested with a χ<sup>2</sup> test. Cox-proportional hazard regression was used for estimation and comparison of survival curves and to test the effect of covariates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050640613484020">32</xref></sup> 95% confidence intervals (CI) of estimates were calculated. To test the hypothesis that reduced inflammation in the gastric corpus is related to reduced relapse hazard, a three-level variable was defined for each patient, with 0 for no change, 1 for improvement, and −1 for deterioration, and was analysed by a generalized linear model.</p>
<p>The ITT analysis contained all patients who took at least one medication tablet. The as-treated subgroup included patients with complete information from gastric biopsies and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050640613484020">13</xref></sup>C breath test at recruitment and at the end of study. No gender-specific effects were present at baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2050640613484020">Table 1</xref>). No breakdown for smoking, alcohol, or non-steroidal antinflammatory drugs (NSAID) consumption was done, because the numbers of patients that smoked, consumed &gt;20 g alcohol/day or took NSAID were too low. To assess the effect of oesophagitis on outcomes, subjects were stratified by oesophagitis grade. A secondary analysis compared outcome of patients with LA grade 0A and BCD endoscopic findings. This grouping was based on findings of longitudinal studies of GORD natural history and to allow direct comparison to previous publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2050640613484020">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2050640613484020">33</xref></sup>

The risk of symptomatic relapse is reported as 50 and 45% in the antibiotic and placebo groups, respectively, with no difference between groups (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.74–1.8; <italic>p</italic> = 0.5). This result was not altered by correction for age, sex, or other potential confounding factors included in the analysis.</p>
<p>Important additional information was obtained when patients were stratified according to grade of oesophagitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2050640613484020">Figure 4</xref>). For patients with endoscopy-negative reflux disease or mild oesophagitis (grade 0 or A, <italic>n</italic> = 196), the relapse hazard in the <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative control group was significantly greater than that of the eradicated patients (HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.23–3.70; <italic>p</italic> = 0.006), with a relapse hazard at 32 weeks of 77 and 50%, respectively. Whereas for patients with moderate to severe oesophagitis (grade B, C, or D, <italic>n</italic> = 115), symptomatic relapse was rapid and <italic>H. pylori</italic> status had no effect on relapse hazard (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.52–1.69; <italic>p</italic> = 0.8). The findings were not altered by <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication in either subgroup. Thus, the presence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection prolongs the time to symptomatic relapse in patients with absent or mild endoscopic disease, but other factors, likely related to disruption of the oesophago-gastric junction and high levels of oesophageal acid exposure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2050640613484020">1</xref></sup> determine the natural history of disease in patients with more severe reflux oesophagitis.</p>
<p>These findings are in agreement with epidemiological reports that the risk of reflux symptoms and mucosal disease is reduced in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients. Raghunath et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2050640613484020">9</xref></sup> undertook a systematic review of 20 studies including more than 4000 patients and found that the odds ratio for <italic>H. pylori</italic> prevalence in GORD patients was 0.60 (95% CI 0.47–0.78). However, the results differ from previous randomized controlled trials which report little or no difference in time to relapse between the <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive and –negative groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2050640613484020">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2050640613484020">20</xref></sup> The current study had a similar design but important strengths. First, a much larger study population. Second, inclusion of patients across the spectrum of GORD allowed stratification of results with severity of oesophagitis. Third, recruitment of patients with typical reflux symptoms from multiple centres, with the majority from office-based practices and district hospitals. Patients presenting to tertiary care have a high rate of somatization and psychosocial morbidity and these factors may be more closely related to treatment outcomes than disease activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2050640613484020">35</xref></sup> The excellent response (∼90%) to initial PPI therapy and the high ‘ongoing remission’ rate at 32 weeks (∼50%) off medication in the current study is higher than that reported by previous randomized controlled trials based in tertiary care and may be more representative of those sampled in epidemiological and community-based studies in which similar effects of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in GORD were found.</p>
<p>The biological mechanism underlying the relatively rapid relapse of reflux symptoms in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative controls compared to <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients is not established. One explanation for the ‘protective’ effect of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in GORD is persistent reduction in gastric acid secretion. Rebound acid hypersecretion and reflux symptoms have been reported in healthy <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative subjects and also <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative reflux patients after discontinuation of omeprazole;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2050640613484020">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2050640613484020">37</xref></sup> in contrast, many <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients show persistent acid suppression after eradication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2050640613484020">36</xref></sup> Direct measurements of acid secretion were not performed; however, the results are consistent with these observations. <italic>H. pylori</italic> status has no effect on the success of initial PPI therapy and yet, during 32 weeks of follow up after withdrawal of acid suppression, <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative patients have a higher risk of relapse than <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients irrespective of allocation to eradication therapy or placebo. Histology shows a dramatic improvement in gastritis in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients following successful eradication therapy and resolution of corpus inflammation is associated with a trend to symptomatic relapse. Over time, recovery of acid-secreting capacity may occur in patients with gastric mucosal atrophy as parietal cell mass recovers;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2050640613484020">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2050640613484020">39</xref></sup> however, in this study, very few <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients had mucosal atrophy and there was no difference in mucosal thickness or parietal cell numbers between <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive and -negative patients at baseline or at the end of the study. These results imply that the reduction in acid secretion with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is caused by other mechanisms; for example, downregulation of parietal cell H,K-ATPase expression in gastric mucosa by <italic>H. pylori cag</italic> gene products that significantly inhibiting acid secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2050640613484020">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2050640613484020">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study population was under 70 years old. It is possible that results may be different in an older population with a greater proportion of gastric atrophy, and also in specific patient groups, such as those with duodenal ulcer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050640613484020">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2050640613484020">15</xref></sup> and with strains of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection or host inflammatory responses (e.g. interleukin 1β) that powerfully inhibit acid secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2050640613484020">42</xref></sup> Patients were diagnosed and recruited on the basis of typical reflux symptoms rather than ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring; however, symptom-based diagnosis and the response to therapeutic trials are considered acceptable surrogates in most clinical settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2050640613484020">34</xref></sup> Overall, slightly less patients entered the study than planned (311/318, 98%); however, sufficient numbers were attained for a robust ITT analysis of primary and secondary endpoints. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the confidence intervals of the ITT analysis are fairly wide, thus a small effect of eradication therapy on treatment outcome cannot be excluded or could become apparent with longer follow up. Findings from the as-treated analysis were not qualitatively different; however, the differences between groups were less pronounced because repeat <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050640613484020">13</xref></sup>C breath tests and gastric histology were available for only 56% of the total study population. Incomplete data collection also reduced the statistical power to determine the effects of changes in histological biomarkers following <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication on relapse hazard.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy has no impact on the success of PPI therapy for GORD or the risk of symptomatic relapse after withdrawal of acid suppression. Instead, the presence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection at study entry decreases the risk of symptomatic relapse, especially in patients with absent or mild mucosal disease. This is the first time that the protective effect of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in GORD described by epidemiologists has been demonstrated in a prospective, clinical study.</p>
<p>These findings have direct implications for practice. Clinicians and patients can be reassured that the short- to mid-term management of GORD patients can be focused on symptom control, independent of the decision to investigate and treat <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. Indeed, it will often be easier to discontinue PPI therapy in reflux patients with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. If long-term PPI therapy is required, then <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection can be identified and eradication therapy prescribed; however, again, this can be performed without undue concern that this will exacerbate GORD symptoms or mucosal disease.</p>
