Exposure of islets to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (50 µm, 2 h) increased intracellular oxidant formation such as reactive oxygen species and subsequently apoptosis and decreased viability, glucose-induced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Pretreatment with CeO<sub>2</sub> and/or Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles reduced the oxidant formation and apoptosis and increased viability, glucose-induced ATP production and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These results suggest that this combination may protect β-cell apoptosis by improving the oxidative stress-mediated apoptotic pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type I diabetes mellitus, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease that is caused due to the death of insulin producing pancreatic β-cells. Current therapy for IDDM patients is the persistent substitutive insulin injection. However, insulin therapy cannot duplicate a normal physiological response and patients usually experience cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Therefore, there is a strong need for suitable treatments or supplements. Islets transplantation seems a promising treatment for IDDM patients and has been under attention of researchers in the recent years. During islets transplant, various types of stresses related to the isolation and transplantation procedure compromise the function and viability of islets. The main restriction is the loss of healthy islets at the end of the operation due to the inevitable-prolonged time required for islets isolation. Isolated islets are avascular and are therefore ischemic from the time of isolation through to revascularization. Prolonged ischemia makes a significant loss of islet cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327112468175">1</xref>
</sup> As a result of ischemia and the islet isolation, oxidative stress occurs that damages some of the isolated islets. Interestingly, islets have lowest levels of intrinsic antioxidant defenses. Therefore, the free radicals easily induce their toxicity. In fact, a significant loss of islet cell mass in transplantation procedure is due to apoptosis and necrosis partially mediated by oxidative stress.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327112468175">2</xref>
</sup> To overwhelm oxidative stress during islet transplantation, various antioxidants like vitamin supplements, trace elements and drugs have been widely examined.<sup>

</sup> On the basis of evidences, we recently hypothesized that the combination of cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>) and yttrium oxide (Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) nanoparticles with a potential free radical scavenger behavior should be useful to make isolated islets survive until transplanted.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327112468175">5</xref>
</sup> Therefore, in the present work, we studied the protective effects of this combination in isolated islets by measuring the biomarkers involved in the survival of islets in an ex vivo model.</p>

<title>Chemical and reagents</title>
<p>All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Gmbh Munich, Germany) unless otherwise stated. CeO<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were purchased from Navarrean Nanoproducts Technology (Navarra, Spain). Rat specific insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was obtained from Mercodia (Uppsala, Sweden).</p>

<title>Islet isolation</title>
<p>Rat islets were isolated from male adult Wistar rats (&gt;12 weeks) weighting 200–250 g, according to the ethical guidelines, and the study was approved by the institute (code: TUMS-14936). Islets were isolated from the pancreas by collagenase digestion followed by repeated dextran gradient centrifugation as previously set up in our laboratory and described in detail previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327112468175">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0960327112468175">7</xref>
</sup> Briefly, animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). After laparotomy, the common bile duct was ligated at its exit into the liver. The duct was cannulated at its exit from duodenum and then the pancreas was perfused by the injecting of 10 mL of Krebs buffer. Perfused pancreas was dissected from duodenum and the tissue surrounding the islet was digested by break down using collagenase, and after separation from fat, the tissue was washed by Krebs–N-2-Hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-Ethanesulfonic Acid (HEPES) buffer three times. The extract tissue was centrifuged in Krebs buffer for two rounds of 60s and then 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added for the completion of digestion. Finally, the islets were separated from the remaining tissue by hand picking under stereomicroscope and the purity evaluated by dithizone staining that was &gt;95%. The islets between 100 and 150 µm in diameter were used for the experiments.</p>

<title>Dose optimization for CeO<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles</title>
<p>Before starting the experiments, the purified isolated islets were cultured overnight in the culture media that contained RPMI-1640 medium, in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. Optimization of dose was done by pretreating the islets with various concentrations of CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (50, 100 and 200 µm) and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles (0.5, 1 and 2 µg/mL) for 3 days to reach effective doses (200 µm and 2.214 µm, respectively). Then the islets were divided into eight groups of 10 islets including: (1) Con (negative control), islets in RPMI-1640 medium alone for 3 days; (2) hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (positive control), islets in RPMI-1640 medium alone for 3 days + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (50 µm) for 2 h; (3) Nan Cer Ox (nano cerium oxide; islets in RPMI-1640 medium + CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (200 µm) for 3 days); (4) Nan Cer Ox + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (islets in RPMI-1640 medium + CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (200 µm) for 3 days + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (50 µm) for 2 h); (5) Nan Ytt Ox (nano yttrium oxide; islets in RPMI-1640 medium + Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles (2.214 µm) for 3 days); (6) Nan Ytt Ox + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (islets in RPMI-1640 medium + Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles (2.214 µm) for 3 days + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (50 µm) for 2 h); (7) Nan Cer Ox + Nan Ytt Ox (islets in RPMI-1640 medium + CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (200 µm) + Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles (2.214 µm) for 3 days); (8) Nan Cer Ox + Nan Ytt Ox + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (islets in RPMI-1640 medium + CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (200 µm) + Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles (2.214 µm) for 3 days + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (50 µm) for 2 h).</p>

<title>Islets viability assay</title>
<p>This assay is based on the reduction of 3-4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), a yellow tetrazole to purple formazan by mitochondrial respiration in viable cells. After removing the medium, pretreated islets were washed twice by Krebs–HEPES buffer, and 20 µL of MTT solution was added and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. After washing, the formazan was resuspended in 100 µL dimethyl sulfoxide and the absorbance was measured in 570 nm by ELISA reader. The viability of the groups was shown as the percentage of controls that is assumed as 100%.<sup>

<title>Measurement of reactive oxygen species</title>
<p>To measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, a fluorometric assay using intracellular oxidation of 2,7-dichlorofluoroscein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was performed, that was set up in our laboratory and was described previously in detail.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327112468175">9</xref>
</sup> Briefly, pretreated islets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then incubated with 40 µM DCFH-DA for 30 min. At the end of incubation, the islets were washed with PBS, lysed with NaOH and aliquots were transferred into the blank well plate. Then, the fluorescence of dichlorofluoroscein, which is the oxidized product of DCFH-DA was measured by ELISA fluorimeter with excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The values were standardized by the amount of total protein in each well.</p>

<title>Evaluation of energy as ATP/ADP ratio in islets</title>
<p>Pretreated groups of 100 islets were sonicated in 250 µL of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (6%) and then centrifuged at 12,000<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C to obtain a protein-free sample. The supernatant was neutralized with 4 M potassium hydroxide and centrifuged at 10,000 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min at 4°C. Neutralized sample was cleaned using a solid phase extraction (SPE) column (C18, 22%, 100 mg/1 mL). The SPE column was initially activated by passing 1 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O and 1 mL of methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) in turn and following the addition of sample to the SPE column. Detection was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with Waters 510 pump and solvent delivery system, column (SUPELCOSIL™ LC-18-T) with guard column holder and Waters 486 ultraviolet–visual detector. The protocol was based on isocratic elution with tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate (TBAHS) (4 mM) in potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH 5.5) and CH<sub>3</sub>OH (85:15 v/v) with 1 mL/min flow rate for 20 min. Cleaned samples were used to measure the concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (nanomoles per milligram of protein) and to get a standard curve; standard solutions of ATP and ADP were used.</p>

<title>Caspase-3 and -9 activity assays in islets</title>
<p>Caspase-3 and -9 activities were measured by colorimetric assays based on the identity of specific amino acid sequences by these caspases. The tetrapeptide substrates were labeled with the chromophore ρ-nitroaniline (ρNA). ρNA is released from the substrate upon cleavage by caspase and produces a yellow color that is monitored by an ELISA reader at 405 nm. The amount of caspase activity present in the sample is proportional to the amount of yellow color produced upon cleavage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0960327112468175">11</xref>
</sup> Briefly, the pretreated islets were lysed in the supplied lysis buffer and were incubated on ice for 10 min. The whole cell lysates were incubated in caspase buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol) containing 100 µM of caspase-3 and -9 specific substrate (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Ac-DEVD-pNA:), N-acetyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Ac-LEHD-pNA), respectively) for 4 h at 37°C. Then, absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Caspase activity was defined as nanomoles per ρNA released per hour per milligram of protein (nanomoles per hours milligrams of protein) by a ρNA calibration curve.</p>

<title>Glucose-induced ATP generation</title>
<p>The effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Nan Cer Ox and/or Nan Ytt Ox on ATP have been examined in isolated rat islets by calculating the ratio between ATP and ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0960327112468175">Figure 4</xref>). This ratio is more important for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion than the ATP level. At low-glucose levels (2.8 mM), neither H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> nor pretreatment with Nan Cer Ox and/or Nan Ytt Ox resulted in changes of ATP/ADP ratio. But high levels of glucose (16.7 mM) resulted in a twofold increase in the ATP/ADP ratio, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment significantly inhibited the increase in this ratio (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Pretreatment with Cer Ox or Nan Ytt Ox prevented the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced decrease in ATP/ADP ratio but pretreatment with the combination of Cer Ox and Nan Ytt Ox provided further protection against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced decrease in this ratio (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). We also examined the effects of pretreatment with Nan Cer Ox or Nan Ytt Ox on ATP in islets in comparison with controls after 3 days and found an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio and also a further increase in this ratio by the combination of Cer Ox and Nan Ytt Ox (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The prerequisite for successful islet transplantation is possessing a large number of viable and functional pancreatic islets after isolation. Regarding the production of oxidative stress during islet isolation and transplantation in one hand, and the lowest levels of intrinsic antioxidant defenses in islets on the other hand, a major challenge in the preparation of islet happens. ROS levels were found to correlate with viability and apoptosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0960327112468175">12</xref>
</sup> Apoptosis is implemented by the activation of a family of caspases. Caspases-8 and -9, as initiators, are activated through self-processing and then cleave downstream procaspase-3 to the active form of caspace-3, which acts as the executor of apoptosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0960327112468175">11</xref>
</sup> In the present study, we observed a significant increase in ROS and a decrease in the cell viability of islets exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Also, we found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis increases the activity of caspases-9 and -3, whereas pretreatment of CeO<sub>2</sub> or/and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles in these conditions improved all of these defects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as in all aerobic cells, the mitochondrial respiratory chains represent a major source of ROS in beta-cells and also are a primary target for ROS attacks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0960327112468175">13</xref>
</sup> One of the first events occurring after the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is an intensive decrease in the concentration of reducing equivalents but it is unknown if this is secondary to the depolarization of mitochondrial (mitochondrial membrane potential) ΔΨ. These changes in ΔΨ reduce the production of ATP. It seems that there is a close link even for mild oxidative stress to the K<sub>ATP</sub> current and beta-cell function.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0960327112468175">13</xref>
</sup> Low levels of ROS facilitate the regulation of insulin gene expression and beta-cell function. In contrast, excessive concentrations of ROS decreases the insulin gene expression and thus insulin secretion that led to the damage of islets.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0960327112468175">14</xref>
</sup> Three factors, glucose metabolism, ROS generation and ATP production (and thus K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity) are closely coupled. Increasing the exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> impairs ATP production and opens K<sub>ATP</sub> channels that result in hyperpolarizing the beta-cells to limit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and glucose-induced insulin secretion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0960327112468175">15</xref>
</sup> The ROS accumulation in mitochondria, ATP depletion and depolarization of ΔΨ are closely coupled to cell metabolism and also apoptosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0960327112468175">13</xref>
</sup> Our findings confirm these subjects by an increase in ROS and apoptosis, and decrease in ATP levels, viability and insulin secretion in islets after exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, we observed a significant improvement in these factors via the pretreatment of islets by CeO<sub>2</sub> or/and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Reducing the deleterious oxidative stress on islets function, viability and ROS-induced cell death by enhancing antioxidant capacity or decreasing ROS generation are the promising strategies to prevent the oxidative damage of pancreatic islets for transplantation. For this, we now confirm a novel approach for the improvement of islet transplantation procedures using a combination of CeO<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327112468175">5</xref>
</sup> CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles are known as a biological free-radical scavenger or antioxidant having oxygen vacancies for dual oxidation states that is created by the loss of oxygen and the reduction in Ce<sup>+4</sup> to Ce<sup>+3</sup>. Moreover, these nanoparticles have several advantages over other antioxidants: first, CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles act as catalysts to mimetic superoxide dismutase activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0960327112468175">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0960327112468175">17</xref>
</sup> Second, the antioxidant activity of these nanoparticles is mediated at oxygen vacancies on the surface. Therefore, one CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles offer many sites for catalysis, despite the fact that enzymes or pharmacological agents have only one active site per molecule. Finally, these nanoparticles remain resident and active in a living cell for an extended period of time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0960327112468175">18</xref>
</sup> Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is notable because the free energy of oxide formation from elemental yttrium is among the highest known. Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles have also shown potential scavenger behavior similar to ceria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0960327112468175">19</xref>
</sup> Most recently, CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles have been tested for the ability to serve as free-radical scavengers or antioxidant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0960327112468175">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327112468175"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0960327112468175"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0960327112468175">23</xref>
</sup> Also, similar properties were found with Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0960327112468175">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In summary, with no doubt, we need a strong antioxidant mixture to protect islets during transplantation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0960327112468175">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0960327112468175">25</xref>
</sup> and to overcome diabetes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0960327112468175">26</xref>
</sup> Nanoparticles composed of CeO<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can have antioxidant properties that promote cell survival under the conditions of oxidative stress. Our study suggests that these nanoparticles may be a therapeutic regenerative material that will scavenge ROS that are responsible for ROS-induced death of islets and the accompanying loss of function. This study demonstrates that the combination of CeO<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles may protect the β-cells by improving the oxidative stress-mediated apoptotic pathway and have the potential to become a ‘theranostic agent’.</p>
