<title>Background</title>
<p>A patient’s response to treatment may be influenced by the expectations that the patient has before initiating treatment. In the context of clinical trials, the influence of participant expectancy may blur the distinction between real and sham treatments, reducing statistical power to detect specific treatment effects. There is therefore a need for a tool that prospectively predicts expectancy effects on treatment outcomes across a wide range of treatment modalities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1740774512465064">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>To help assess expectancy effects, we created the Stanford Expectations of Treatment Scale (SETS): an instrument for measuring positive and negative treatment expectancies. Internal reliability of the instrument was tested in Study 1. Criterion validity of the instrument (convergent, discriminant, and predictive) was assessed in Studies 2 and 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1740774512465064">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The instrument was developed using 200 participants in Study 1. Reliability and validity assessments were made with an additional 423 participants in Studies 2 and 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1740774512465064">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The final six-item SETS contains two subscales: positive expectancy (α = 0.81–0.88) and negative expectancy (α = 0.81–0.86). The subscales predict a significant amount of outcome variance (between 12% and 18%) in patients receiving surgical and pain interventions. The SETS is simple to administer, score, and interpret.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774512465064">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The SETS may be used in clinical trials to improve statistical sensitivity for detecting treatment differences or in clinical settings to identify patients with poor treatment expectancies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While the majority of treatment outcome – beneficial as well as adverse – is likely treatment specific, some outcome variance is influenced by nonspecific factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512465064">1</xref>]. One such nonspecific factor is patient treatment expectancy, or the positive and negative experiences a patient believes that they will have as a result of receiving treatment. Pretreatment expectancy has long been recognized as a factor that shapes treatment outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512465064">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512465064"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512465064"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512465064"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774512465064"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512465064"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512465064"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512465064">9</xref>]. The impact of such expectancies on outcome has been demonstrated in several treatment modalities (e.g., acupuncture, pharmaceutical, and psychotherapeutic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774512465064">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774512465064"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512465064">12</xref>] and, in some cases, may be a better predictor of outcome than actual treatment condition (active versus sham) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774512465064">13</xref>]. Expectancy can also be a powerful factor in the development of adverse treatment outcomes, such as nausea from chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512465064">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512465064"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774512465064"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774512465064"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774512465064">18</xref>]. These expectancies may be driven by multiple factors, including a patient’s own preconceived notions or the words used by clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774512465064">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774512465064">20</xref>].</p>
<p>The need to measure patient expectancies may be particularly important in the context of clinical trials, where expectancies can blur the distinction between real and placebo conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774512465064">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774512465064"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774512465064"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774512465064">24</xref>]. It is also important, given the large percentage of patients who report adverse side effects from sham treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774512465064">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1740774512465064">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1740774512465064">26</xref>], to be able to identify the degree to which expectancy contributes to the occurrence of adverse events. The need to disentangle expectancy from treatment-specific adverse effects is especially important, given that reported adverse events during placebo conditions may closely match those in the active treatment condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774512465064">27</xref>].</p>
<p>It is not known how much patient expectancies influence outcomes, although it is likely quite variable across treatment modalities. The ability to assess treatment expectancy effects across studies is hindered by the lack of a standardized assessment tool of expectancy. Previous attempts at measuring pretreatment expectancy have largely involved items that have not undergone reliability or validity testing. Earlier studies by researchers such as Irving Kirsch effectively utilized single-item measures to determine the impact of expectancies on specific outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512465064">28</xref>]. These single-item measures have demonstrated predictive validity and show that expectancy can be assessed before treatment initiation. However, most of these tools use language that limits their application to a specific treatment modality or disease type, and they are not intended to be used outside of a specific treatment context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774512465064">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774512465064"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1740774512465064">31</xref>]. An exception is the Credibility and Expectancy Scale, which was developed in 1972 by Borkovec and Nau [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1740774512465064">32</xref>]. The instrument yields two subscores: credibility and expectancy. While the instrument has shown success in predicting some outcome variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1740774512465064">33</xref>], it is not clear that the instrument (particularly the credibility subscale) is a useful tool for predicting treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1740774512465064">34</xref>]. Furthermore, because the instrument incorporates different response scales for different items, it is somewhat complex to complete and score.</p>
<p>Because previous questionnaires of pretreatment expectancy may not meet the particular demands of clinical trials, we attempted to develop a new instrument for such measurement. We had six major goals in developing the instrument. First, that it be quick and easy to administer – consisting of as few items as possible, and using the same response scale for all items. Second, that it be easy to score and interpret, with as few subscales as necessary, and subscale scores that are easy to calculate. Third, that it have strong internal reliability. Fourth, that it have demonstrated validity in predicting treatment outcomes. Fifth, that it be applicable to a wide range of treatment interventions. And sixth, that it measures both positive and negative expectancies, in order to assess expectancy’s impact on both placebo and nocebo effects.</p>
<p>This article describes the development, reliability testing, and predictive validity testing of the Stanford Expectations of Treatment Scale (SETS). The instrument was designed to meet all the criteria outlined earlier, including being universally applicable across a wide range of treatment modalities (pharmaceutical, psychological, complementary/alternative, surgical/procedural, behavioral, device based, etc.). We conducted three studies to create the SETS and test its reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774512465064">Figure 1</xref>). The studies are described in the following, with each study having corresponding ‘Materials and Methods’ and ‘Results’ sections. Following these descriptions is a general discussion.</p>

<title>Study 1: development and testing of the initial item pool</title>
<sec id="section8-1740774512465064">
<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>In Study 1, an item pool was generated and tested for acceptable psychometric properties in 200 participants. The initial pool of items was generated by soliciting key phrases from physicians, psychologists, and researchers with experience in clinical trials and/or clinical treatments (psychotherapeutic, pharmacologic, and surgical). The clinicians and researchers (<italic>N</italic> = 19) were invited via email to provide statements that a patient might endorse if he or she expected a strong beneficial response, or a strong adverse response, to an upcoming treatment. Respondents were not instructed to think of any particular treatment modality when generating items. Both positive response items and negative response items were included because patients may expect beneficial outcomes, while simultaneously expecting adverse events to occur. The statements received from the experts were highly duplicative, resulting in just 21 unique items (Supplementary Table 1). A seven-point Likert-type response scale was chosen, with the following anchors: (1) ‘strongly disagree’, (2) ‘moderately disagree’, (3) ‘slightly disagree’, (4) ‘neither agree nor disagree’, (5) ‘slightly agree’, (6) ‘moderately agree’, and (7) ‘strongly agree’. The seven-point scale was indicated by our previous study in this area that showed a five-point scale to not have appropriate variance at the higher end of the scale, and because other researchers have found it to be superior to other options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1740774512465064">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Participants in the initial screening of items were patients preparing to undergo surgery at the Stanford Hospital. Placebo effects have been demonstrated to shape patients’ perception of quality of outcome in surgeries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774512465064">36</xref>]. Sample size was determined using the 10:1 observation-to-item ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1740774512465064">37</xref>] as a guiding rule. Surgery type varied considerably, including procedures such as hip or knee replacement, tumor removal, surgery for back pain, hernia repair, and tonsillectomies. Ambulatory surgeries are handled by a separate hospital unit, and those patients undergoing minor procedures were not included in the sample. Surgery was chosen as the target treatment for scale development because it is a discrete intervention with a well-defined timeframe and because participants were highly likely to complete the treatment. To collect survey responses, participants in the preoperative waiting room were approached and asked to complete the 21-item anonymous form. The first 200 individuals who agreed to participate were included. There were no age restrictions, but the center was an adult surgery unit, so individuals under the age of 18 years were not seen. Questionnaire sheets also asked for optional age and gender information. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Stanford University School of Medicine. Because no personal identifying information was collected and the procedure was judged to pose minimal risk, participants were not required by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) to provide written informed consent.</p>
<p>Psychometric analyses were conducted in SPSS version 19 (IBM, New York). Analyses were conducted by the lead author (J.Y.). Psychometric analyses were performed at the item level to determine whether the distributions were appropriate for inclusion in the instrument. Unacceptable skew and kurtosis values were a priori set at below −1.5 or above +1.5. Factor analysis was carried out using the maximum likelihood approach, with a varimax rotation. Factor orthogonality was subsequently tested to justify the use of a varimax rotation. Internal reliability of factors was assessed using Cronbach’s α.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1740774512465064">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The average age of the patient sample was 52.8 years (standard deviation (SD) = 15.0), with less than 1% omitting age information. The sample was 46.2% female and 43.8% male (with 10% not reporting gender).</p>
<p>Two items (see Supplementary Table 1) did not meet our criteria for acceptable distribution: items 1 (skewness = −2.2 and kurtosis = 5.5) and 5 (skewness = 1.6 and kurtosis = 2.0). These items were rejected from further analysis.</p>
<p>A factor analysis was performed on the remaining 19 items. Two significant factors emerged, with eigenvalues of 7.6 and 2.5. Factor 1 consisted of items 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 20, and 21. Factor 2 consisted of items 3, 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19. Factor 1 comprised items measuring positive expectancy, while Factor 2 comprised items measuring negative expectancy.</p>
<p>Scale reliability analyses were used to eliminate items not necessary for measuring positive and negative expectancies. Our goal was to reduce the number of items per subscale to three, under the condition that acceptable internal reliability could be achieved with that number of items. Three items per subscale was a desirable target because we wanted participants to be able to complete the instrument very quickly.</p>
<p>Initial internal reliability of the positive expectancy factor was 0.87. Items were deleted based on their weak contribution to internal reliability (item-total correlations are reported in Supplementary Table 1). Items were removed serially, and the ‘α if item removed’ output reassessed on the remaining items with each iteration. Items 7, 9, and 20 were retained through this process, yielding a final α of 0.86.</p>
<p>The negative expectancy factor had an initial α of 0.88. Items were removed using the same process as described earlier. After completing the process, items 10, 15, and 19 were retained, with a final α of 0.81. The final SETS version is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774512465064">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1740774512465064-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In addition to the six expectancy items, there is a seventh, yes/no item that asks, ‘Have you ever received this treatment before now?’. This item is intended to allow researchers a way to assess whether conditioning and prior exposure may be contributing to the expectancy–outcome relationship. In this study, individuals indicating prior exposure to the treatment were excluded from analyses.</p>
<p>Scores for positive and negative expectancies were computed. The positive expectancy subscale had a mean of 5.6 (SD = 1.5) and the negative subscale had a mean of 3.8 (SD = 1.7). Men and women did not differ on scores of positive (<italic>t</italic>(197) = 1.19, <italic>p</italic> = 0.234) or negative (<italic>t</italic>(197) = 0.65, <italic>p</italic> = 0.517) expectancy.</p>
<p>To determine the readability of the scale, the text was submitted to a standard readability assessment tool. The Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level of the entire scale was 7.8, indicating an eight-grade reading level. The Flesch Reading Ease score was 62%, indicating standard English level.</p>

<sec id="section10-1740774512465064">
<title>Study 2: further reliability testing and initial assessment of predictive validity</title>
<p>Study 2 was designed to confirm the internal reliability of the two subscales with an independent group of participants and establish the ability of the scales to predict treatment outcome.</p>
<sec id="section11-1740774512465064">
<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>The recruitment and data collection process were the same as that used in Study 1, with the exception that treatment outcomes were also collected. As with the previous studies, a research assistant approached patients in the preoperative waiting room at the Stanford Hospital and asked if they would be willing to participate in the study. Additional participants were also recruited in the same manner from the Pain Management Center at Stanford. Participants agreeing to the study completed the six-item expectancy instrument, which was then collected by the research assistant. Participants were also given a packet that contained outcome measurements and instructed to fill out the outcome measurements 2 weeks after their treatment. The packet contained a self-addressed, stamped envelope so that the posttreatment surveys could be returned anonymously. The pretreatment expectancy instrument was linked to the posttreatment outcome measures via a unique identifier number stamped on the forms. No identifying information was collected on any of the questionnaires. For their participation, patients were given a US$5 gift card from local retailers. The payment was added to the study because of the additional burden of filling out a response packet at home and mailing it to the laboratory. To preserve participant anonymity, the gift card was given as a prepayment and therefore was not conditional on completing and sending the outcome packet.</p>
<p>Treatment success was measured with the seven-point, single-item Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774512465064">38</xref>], using the following format, ‘Since my treatment, my medical issue is: very much worse, much worse, minimally worse, not changed, minimally improved, much improved, or very much improved’. The PGIC is a commonly used outcome measure that is applicable to many treatment modalities and medical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1740774512465064">39</xref>]. The instrument is frequently used as a ‘gold standard’ for determining treatment outcome, especially when pain is a chief complaint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1740774512465064">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1740774512465064">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Adverse effects were measured with the item, ‘How severe were the negative or unwanted effects of your treatment?’ rated on an 11-point scale with anchors from ‘no negative effects’ to ‘very severe negative effects’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1740774512465064">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Complete pretreatment expectancy surveys were collected on 423 individuals. The sample was 49.5% female and 41.5% male, with 9% not reporting gender. Mean age was 53.2 years (SD = 15.8), with less than 1% not reporting age. A total of 379 of those individuals came from the surgery unit, undergoing procedures described in Study 1. Again, ambulatory surgery patients were not included. In all, 44 of those individuals came from the Stanford Pain Management Center and underwent treatments such as trigger point injections, acupuncture, ketamine infusions, nerve blocks, and pharmaceutical treatments. All individuals were analyzed together. Internal reliability was 0.81 for positive expectancy and 0.86 for negative expectancy.</p>
<p>Predictive validity was assessed on 163 individuals (of the 423 above, a 37% response rate) who were given and completed a posttreatment outcome questionnaire. In all, 25 of those individuals came from the Stanford Pain Management Clinic. Positive expectancy was correlated with beneficial outcome (<italic>r</italic> = 0.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), predicting 12% of outcome variance. None of the three individual items outperformed the positive subscale at predicting outcome (<italic>r</italic>s = 0.22, 0.30, and 0.21). Negative expectancy was correlated with severity of adverse side effects (<italic>r</italic> = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), predicting 18% of outcome variance. None of the individual items outperformed the total subscale (<italic>r</italic>s = 0.35, 0.36, and 0.42). Positive and negative expectancies were not correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> = 0.560).</p>

<title>Study 3: convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity testing</title>
<sec id="section14-1740774512465064">
<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Study 3 was designed to confirm the predictive validity of the SETS in an independent sample of participants, as well as test convergent and discriminant validity using trait measures of optimism and anxiety. Some research has suggested that optimism is a predictor of placebo response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1740774512465064">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774512465064"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1740774512465064">44</xref>]. Similarly, trait anxiety has been identified as a predictor of treatment outcome, including pain after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1740774512465064">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1740774512465064"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1740774512465064">47</xref>]. Using the same procedure described in Study 3, individuals completed the SETS, but participants also completed two additional measures: trait optimism and anxiety.</p>
<p>The same pretreatment and posttreatment questions were administered as described in Study 3. In addition, two questionnaires were added to the pretreatment packet. Trait optimism was measured with the Life Orientation Test–Revised (LOT-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1740774512465064">48</xref>]. The LOT-R is a widely used five-point, 10-item questionnaire. General anxiety was measured with the anxiety items of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1740774512465064">49</xref>]. The anxiety scale consists of seven items on a four-point scale. The HADS is widely used in clinical populations.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Completed packets were collected from 69 individuals (out of 156 administered, for a 46% response rate). Mean age was 53.7 years (SD = 16.5), with 100% of participants providing age information. The sample was 45.5% female and 39.1% male, with 15.4% not reporting gender. The mean positive expectancy score was 5.29 (SD = 1.61), and mean negative expectancy score was 4.05 (SD = 1.76). The positive expectancy subscale had an internal reliability of 0.88, and the negative subscale had an α of 0.85.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we report the development of an instrument to measure treatment expectancy. The SETS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774512465064">Figure 2</xref>) is a quick and easy-to-administer tool that provides separate scores for positive and negative expectancies. The instrument contains six items, which are all coded in the same scale and direction. Most participants are able to complete the SETS in approximately 1 min. Scoring is also quick, requiring items 1, 3, and 5 to be averaged for positive expectancy, and items 2, 4, and 6 averaged for negative expectancy. The simple tool is meant to be applicable to a wide range of treatment modalities. The positive and negative subscales demonstrate strong internal reliability and are able to predict posttreatment response.</p>
<p>We found the SETS to predict approximately 12% of positive outcome variance and 18% of negative outcome variance. While these percentages are modest, we note that most of the individuals received a surgical procedure – other treatment modalities may involve a greater element of expectancy. Although untested in this initial report, we also suspect that the SETS would predict considerably more outcome variance in individuals receiving sham treatments. Some evidence suggests that expectancy is a more important predictor of sham treatment outcome than active treatment outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1740774512465064">50</xref>]. Further study will be needed to determine the predictive validity of the SETS in those individuals receiving sham or placebo treatments.</p>
<p>In order to verify the object of participants’ positive and negative expectancies, four additional questions are included at the bottom of the SETS. Item 7 asks the participant to list the treatment they will be receiving. This question is to confirm that the participant is thinking of the correct treatment when completing the SETS. Item 8 asks about specific benefits the participant expects to receive, and Item 9 asks about specific fears or worries the participant has about the treatment. These items provide additional qualitative data that can be used to determine what specific outcomes the participant was referring to when completing the instrument. Item 10 asks whether the participant has ever received the treatment previously. The interpretation of treatment outcome expectancies would be changed if the participant had prior experience with the treatment.</p>
<sec id="section17-1740774512465064">
<title>Does the instrument predict placebo and nocebo responses?</title>
<p>Much effort in conventional clinical trials involves separating treatment-specific effects from nonspecific effects, and controlling for placebo and nocebo responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512465064">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512465064">9</xref>]. These effects can adversely impact statistical power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1740774512465064">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1740774512465064">52</xref>] and may have been growing in the recent years, further complicating study design and leading to a greater number of negative trial outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1740774512465064">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1740774512465064">54</xref>]. Unfortunately, there is no established method for directly measuring placebo and nocebo processes in clinical trials. While the neurobiological processes of placebo and nocebo responses have begun to be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512465064">7</xref>], quantifiable neurobiological measures are impractical in large clinical trials. However, treatment expectancies (which are more easily measured) may be a primary driver of placebo and nocebo responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1740774512465064">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1740774512465064"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1740774512465064">57</xref>]. Response expectancy theory posits that what people experience is strongly shaped by what they expect to experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512465064">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1740774512465064">58</xref>].</p>
<p>Factors other than expectancy may also shape placebo and nocebo. For example, prior experience (i.e., conditioning) can affect the placebo response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512465064">5</xref>]. Future studies could examine the moderating influence that prior treatment exposure has on the expectancy–outcome relationship. To facilitate that type of analysis, an additional item on the SETS form asks if the participant has been exposed to that treatment previously. Other drivers of the placebo response can include patient motivation and effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1740774512465064">59</xref>]. The very act of engaging in positive, goal-oriented activities (such as completing a treatment protocol) may shape placebo response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1740774512465064">60</xref>]. As placebo responses are driven by more than just pretreatment expectancies, this instrument is not intended to predict the full extent of the placebo response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1740774512465064">
<title>Clinical use</title>
<p>The accurate measurement of pretreatment expectancy may be equally important in clinical contexts. Patients are becoming increasingly sophisticated at online medical research and frequently rely upon information found on the Internet to form their expectancies of treatment responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1740774512465064">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1740774512465064">62</xref>]. A great deal of misinformation may be accessed through blogs and other sources that contain unrepresentative and extreme (both positive and negative) accounts of treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1740774512465064">63</xref>]. Expectancy screening could identify those patients with low expectations of a beneficial outcome and/or high fears of adverse events. Such patients may be at a higher risk of poor treatment response, so it would be advantageous for the clinician to address those patients’ expectations prior to beginning the treatment regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1740774512465064">64</xref>]. Part of optimal medical treatment may involve harnessing knowledge of pretreatment expectancy to enhance outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1740774512465064">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1740774512465064">66</xref>] as studies have shown that early interventions to change preconceived notions of treatment response can increase beneficial effects and minimize adverse side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1740774512465064">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1740774512465064">67</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1740774512465064">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are a few limitations to this instrument and the methods used to develop it. First, the SETS was tested mainly on samples of convenience; the vast majority of participants were surgical patients at the Stanford Hospital. Surgical patients represent a sample that is appropriate for testing an outcomes measure because it is simple to identify participants who are at a pretreatment stage. It is also easy to verify that the patients complied with and received the treatment. However, it should be noted that in many cases, surgery is part of a more complex treatment regimen. Generalizability will need to be further established by testing the SETS in other medication conditions, treatment modalities, and treatment locations. It is expected that the predictive ability of treatment expectancy will vary considerably over different treatment modalities. For example, expectancy may predict approximately 40% of outcome in cognitive therapy for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774512465064">30</xref>].</p>
<p>A second potential problem with the SETS is that participants may fear negative repercussions if they do not report full confidence in the treating physician. While the introductory paragraphs of the instrument contain language to assuage fears of retaliation, it is possible that some respondents will still feel compelled to report very high positive expectancy. Other patients may have a defensive need to avoid thinking about treatment failure, thus leading to inflated scores of positive expectancy. Other limitations include the short duration of the outcome assessment and the low response rate for the outcome measures (introducing a possible selection bias). Also, because there are no existing valid measures of treatment expectancy, construct validity is difficult to test.</p>

<sec id="section20-1740774512465064" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We suggest that the SETS be used as a quick assessment of pretreatment expectancy in clinical trials. One use of the SETS would be to include baseline scores of positive and negative expectancies as nuisance covariates in models testing for differences between real and sham treatments. Individuals who strongly believe that they will benefit from a treatment may be more likely to report benefit following a treatment. Likewise, individuals who believe strongly that they will experience adverse effects may be more likely to report adverse effects. To the extent that these pretreatment beliefs drive outcomes, they represent placebo and nocebo responses and do not accurately reflect the physiological properties specific to the active treatment. If pretreatment expectancy effects are removed statistically, then the models may have greater power to detect treatment-specific outcome differences – thus reducing the required sample size and resulting cost associated with the study. While we did not test the SETS in that manner, we look forward to that application.</p>
