<abstract>
<p>Incorporating health literacy in adult education instruction is a promising approach to increasing the health equity of people who face racial/ethnic health disparities. Six adult education centers throughout a small Northeast state received 1-year Health Literacy Project grants from a local foundation to increase their capacity to teach health literacy through Study Circles. The evaluation of the project assessed changes in adult learners’ skills needed to navigate health systems, manage chronic diseases, and engage in preventive behavior; learners’ self-efficacy; and how the education centers increased their capacity to teach health literacy skills to adult learners of color. Quantitative and qualitative data indicated that students’ knowledge about health issues and self-efficacy increased significantly as a result of the health literacy instruction. All six centers improved their capacity to teach health literacy. By the end of the Health Literacy Project, almost three quarters of classes included health literacy instruction. Almost half of the Study Circle teachers continued to attend professional development activities for health literacy and share their knowledge with other teachers. Each center also developed partnerships with health care providers and created an infrastructure to continue to teach health literacy. Implications of the identified strengths and challenges on future efforts to increase health literacy and equity are considered.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Low patient health literacy, or “the ability to obtain, process, and understand health information to make informed decisions about health care” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912437367">DeWalt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912437367">Hispanic Health Council, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912437367">Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2009</xref>), is a contributing factor to the communication and outcome differences experienced by people of racial and ethnic minority status in clinical settings. Although inadequate health literacy is highly prevalent, affecting more than 90 million Americans, special populations are more likely to exhibit lower health literacy than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912437367">Kutner et al., 2007</xref>). Adults with limited education (lacking a high school diploma or GED), members of a minority group, and immigrants have low health literacy when compared with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912437367">Kutner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912437367">Rudd, 2007</xref>). For instance, approximately 25% of White adults score at basic or below basic health literacy levels, whereas 66% and 58% of Hispanic and Black adults, respectively, exhibit basic or below basic health literacy. In contrast, 14% of White adults are assessed to have proficient health literacy compared with 4% of Black and 2% of Hispanic adults. For many racial and ethnic minorities, cultural differences and limited English proficiency interact with low health literacy to make effective health communication all the more challenging for both patients and providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912437367">Andrulis &amp; Brach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912437367">Singleton &amp; Krause, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-1524839912437367">
<title>Background and Literature Review</title>
<p>Low health literacy is related to poor health outcomes and a higher risk of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912437367">Berkman et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, adequate health literacy can be an equalizer, helping all people navigate health care systems to access care, better advocate for their health, and ultimately improve health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912437367">Paasche-Orlow &amp; Wolf, 2010</xref>). Focusing on adult education as a vehicle for increasing health equity is ideal because adult education students often come from populations that face disparities in health in terms of prevention, chronic disease, and access to health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912437367">Davis &amp; Cohen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912437367">IOM, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912437367">Mead, Cartwright-Smith, Jones, Racos, Woods, &amp; Siegel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912437367">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). For instance, more than one quarter of the 40 million adults who have not earned a high school diploma (i.e., adult education target population) are below the poverty level; more than one third of this population are from racial and ethnic minority groups, and English is the second language of one third of these individuals as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912437367">Lasater &amp; Elliott, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of this research and the IOM’s seminal report, “Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities in Medicine” (IOM, 2003), a health care conversion foundation in a small Northeast state adopted a 10-year strategic objective to improve patient–provider interaction for patients of color to reduce health disparities. Recognizing that today’s health care consumers need more sophisticated health literacy skills that can help improve patient–provider interaction, the foundation funded adult education centers to teach health literacy skills to adult learners.</p>
<p>In developing this grant project—Health Literacy in Adult Education Settings (Health Literacy Project)—the foundation adopted the Study Circles model as its strategy. Study Circles involve meetings and seminars geared toward professionals working in adult education settings to learn about and discuss new research that can be applied in the classroom. The model incorporates three study areas: disease prevention and screening, chronic disease management, and health care access and navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912437367">Rudd, Soricone, Santos, Zobel, &amp; Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839912437367">Soricone, Rudd, Santos, &amp; Capistrant, 2007</xref>). The Study Circles model was pilot tested in New York and was found to be a promising model for increasing health literacy among adult learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912437367">Magi Educational Services, 2004</xref>). The foundation selected six centers that predominantly serve people of color and immigrant and low-income populations, given the cultural and language factors related to variability in the quality of care these populations receive. The foundation made 15-month grants of up to $75,000 for each of the six centers, which enabled centers to fund teachers to attend professional development training, purchase supplementary materials, and procure experiential learning opportunities for students to build and integrate organizational health literacy capacity. The grant also supported the participation of 20 teachers in nine Study Circles. The majority of teachers who participated in the Study Circles spent 20% to 50% of their total instruction time teaching health literacy to adult learners.</p>
<p>Whereas much of the health literacy research focuses on general health literacy, specific conditions, or on the provider, relatively little has been done to consider health literacy instruction in adult education centers. The findings and lessons learned from the evaluation of this project, therefore, add greatly to this underresearched field. This article discusses the natural partnership between health promotion professionals and adult education centers to reach communities facing health disparities. Through this lens, our article takes the perspective that building the capacity of adult learners to navigate health systems and manage their chronic health conditions can be an effective means for reducing disparities. Specifically, we discuss findings and lessons learned related to adult learners’ health literacy and adult learning centers’ capacity to incorporate health literacy into their curricula.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The funder contracted a research and development organization headquartered in the mid-Atlantic region that focuses on community and systems change solutions to social problems, to evaluate the grant project. The evaluation sought to determine the effectiveness of infusing health literacy instruction into adult education curricula on adult learners’ health literacy. The evaluation was designed to assess</p>
<list id="list1-1524839912437367" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the extent to which adult learners improved the healthy literacy skills needed to navigate systems, manage disease, and engage in preventive behavior;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the level to which adult learners’ self-efficacy for health literacy increased; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the ways in which adult education centers increased their capacity to teach health literacy skills to adult learners from racial and ethnic minority groups.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Over the course of the grant project in 2008, approximately 2,412 adult learners were exposed to health literacy instruction. Of these learners, a total of 565 students participated in the evaluation: 204 students completed the pre and post Short Test of Functional Health Literacy (S-TOFHLA), and 361 students completed the pre and post Self-Efficacy Assessment (SEA). Students in higher level courses took both the S-TOFHLA and SEA, whereas students in lower level courses took the SEA only. Twenty-one teachers and the director at each of the six centers participated in the evaluation as well. Students were informed about the evaluation and that they would be asked to complete a confidential questionnaire about their health literacy and self-efficacy at the beginning and end of the semester. Students were told that their decisions about whether to participate would have no bearing on their grades or future enrollment. They were encouraged to attend class the day the surveys were administered. As an incentive, the evaluation team provided teachers with stipends to purchase snacks for the day of the tests.</p>

<title>Health literacy</title>
<p>The S-TOFHLA was designed to gauge the health literacy skills between participants of the grant project. The instrument incorporated items from the Brief Version of the TOFHLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912437367">Parker, Baker, Williams, &amp; Nurss, 1995</xref>) and administration was adapted for groups of adult students in Adult Basic Education (ABE), General Education Diploma (GED), and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes at the adult education centers participating in the project. Students were invited to ask questions during administration of the instrument. Participants’ health literacy was scored on a reading scale of 0 to 36. As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912437367">Table 1</xref>, health literacy scores were translated into a functional health literacy level of <italic>inadequate, marginal</italic>, and <italic>adequate</italic>.</p>

<title>Self-efficacy</title>
<p>An individual’s perceived self-efficacy—one’s belief in one’s ability—to complete a behavior is a key factor in actual behavior change and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912437367">Bandura, 1994</xref>). The higher the degree of self-efficacy the more likely an individual will seek out healthy behaviors. Prior research in diabetes care and heart disease prevention has shown that improving self-efficacy can improve self-management behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912437367">Farquhar et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912437367">Sarkar, Fisher, &amp; Schillinger, 2006</xref>). Yet little is known about the concept and measure of self-efficacy across race/ethnicity and health literacy levels. Because no comparable standardized instrument was available in the field, the evaluators designed the SEA to assess students’ self-efficacy in using health literacy skills. The SEA was developed based on literature on self-efficacy and health literacy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839912437367">Owens, 2006</xref>) and included items that matched the content taught in the classrooms. The SEA was pilot tested with adult learners in a mid-Atlantic state sharing similar demographic characteristics as the learners in the state in which the initiative took place. Teachers participating in the Health Literacy Project also provided feedback; based on the feedback, the evaluators changed the response categories for education levels to be consistent with those used by the centers when they enroll students in classes and used pictures to illustrate the 6-point scale ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (<inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1524839912437367-img1.tif"/>) to <italic>strongly agree</italic> (<inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1524839912437367-img2.tif"/>). Reliability of the measure was tested using Cronbach’s alpha; the internal consistency of the SEA was high, α = .84.</p>

<sec id="section7-1524839912437367">
<title>Health Literacy Project experience</title>
<p>To determine the impact of the Health Literacy Project on the adult learners and the education centers, adult learners completed short essays to describe an experience in which they used skills learned in class related to talking to a health professional. The evaluation team collected 148 story essays from the adult learners across the six centers. Teachers completed a survey at the end of each semester of the Health Literacy Project about the support they received from their centers to implement health literacy education. Center directors also submitted progress reports to the foundation.</p>
<p>Additionally, phone interviews with center directors shed light on the centers’ capacity to teach health literacy by discussing current institutional supports (e.g., policies and procedures) with the potential to facilitate the teaching of health literacy skills, professional development opportunities for staff to learn about health literacy education, current center partnerships with health care organizations, plans for developing new partnerships, and plans for infusing health literacy into other classes at the center.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839912437367">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To determine changes in student health literacy skills and self-efficacy, the evaluation team used repeated measures <italic>t</italic> tests to compare pre- and postlearning scores for the S-TOFHLA and SEA. The data were analyzed across sites as well as by class type (i.e., ABE, GED, and ESL) to identify differences among students. Differences between the classes in their changes in health literacy and self-efficacy from pre- to posttest were assessed using analyses of variance (ANOVA). To evaluate adult education center capacity to teach health literacy skills, teacher survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Interview responses from center directors and center progress reports were reviewed and coded into salient themes across three or more centers to obtain further information about center capacity.</p>
<sec id="section9-1524839912437367">
<title>Missing data</title>
<p>Because student attendance varied throughout the semester, not all were present to complete the assessments at the beginning and end of the semester. Only students who completed both the baseline and final questionnaires and who had not been previously exposed to health literacy instruction were included in the statistical analyses. Missing SEA data were minimized by using mean substitution. For each center and class type, the mean score for each of the 10 items that assessed self-efficacy was calculated. The respective mean for each item then replaced missing responses.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Progress reports and the student essays also indicated that students became more knowledgeable about health behaviors and showed enthusiasm toward health literacy instruction.</p>
<p>Five of the six centers documented that students told their teachers that they had a better understanding of the health care system, medical terminology, and patient rights and responsibilities. The centers also reported that students had applied the skills that they developed, such as healthier eating, scheduling doctor’s appointments, describing symptoms to a health professional, and following medical directions.</p>

<p>Qualitative analyses of student essays also suggested increased self-efficacy of the students. Slightly more than one quarter (27.0%) of students reported increased confidence to ask questions of their provider; approximately one fifth (19.5%) of students indicated that they had learned useful information related to taking medication, dental care, first aid, and injury prevention.</p>

<title>Diffusion of relevant information</title>
<p>Teacher surveys and center progress reports suggested a supportive environment for teaching health literacy across all six centers. Over the course of the year, at least 85% of the teachers reported that their centers’ leadership understands the importance of health literacy, with many noting champions committed to incorporating health literacy into their instruction. All center directors indicated that their center was better able to teach health literacy skills at the end of the Health Literacy Project. By the end of the project, almost three quarters of classes across all centers included some type of health literacy instruction, including classes beyond those taught by teachers who participated in the Study Circles. Two of the six centers had incorporated health literacy instruction into all of their ABE, ESL, and GED classes; across all centers, the instruction was most frequently incorporated into ESL classes. Directors reported that their centers had access to more health-related materials and developed additional partnerships with outside organizations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524839912437367">
<title>Institutional support</title>
<p>Both teachers and center directors confirmed that information and assistance from the Study Circles were one of the reasons why the centers were better able to teach health literacy. Qualitative information from center director interviews corroborated the presence of a supportive environment. For example, the centers supported teachers’ attendance at the Study Circles and trainings sponsored by the grant, as well as team meetings during which teachers shared information. Centers gave teachers autonomy in the classroom to respond to student interests and implement an adult education curriculum that included health literacy. All center directors noted the availability of professional development opportunities for teachers to continue to learn about health literacy and to develop health literacy teaching skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1524839912437367">
<title>Partnerships</title>
<p>Each center developed or strengthened 2 to 12 partnerships with health service providers in its region over the course of the project. The partners provided health services, presentations, field trips to local health care facilities, and other support to the adult education centers. These partnerships also led to unanticipated benefits, such as discovery of job opportunities at a local hospital during a field trip, new knowledge about prescription discount programs and free antibiotics during a workshop, and development of healthy food shopping habits after a visit to a local farmer’s market. All centers indicated plans to continue developing partnerships.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Given the correlation between low health literacy and negative health outcomes, improving health literacy is crucial to address health disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912437367">Paasche-Orlow &amp; Wolf, 2010</xref>). Partnering with adult education centers presents a unique opportunity for addressing health disparities between communities of color and low income, which are among those most affected by disparities in health and health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839912437367">Soricone et al., 2007</xref>). The findings of the Health Literacy Project evaluation suggest that the model of using adult education centers to impart health literacy skills to adult learners is effective, with sufficient support to the students and their teachers.</p>
<p>Research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912437367">Paasche-Orlow &amp; Wolf, 2007</xref>) suggests that health literacy be viewed as a system and patient phenomenon that includes access to and utilization of care, patient–provider interaction, and self-care. Through the Health Literacy Project, students demonstrated increased knowledge about health behavior, increased confidence in their ability to manage their health conditions, and increased confidence in their ability to navigate the health care system; ESL students experienced the greatest changes. The evaluation revealed that all participating adult education centers achieved their expected goals and unexpected benefits. Additionally, the adult education centers benefited from enhanced partnerships and improved collegiality among center staff. At the same time, centers also experienced challenges, such as dealing with the reality that, although students became more knowledgeable about health, they still lacked the financial resources to act on their own health needs.</p>
<p>Center directors’ and teachers’ lessons learned reflect two key themes: (a) Flexibility in health literacy instruction is critical because of the varying levels of knowledge, skills, and experiences between students as well as their irregular class attendance, and (b) it is important to avoid making assumptions about students’ understanding of health issues. Directors and teachers suggested that students benefit most when learning about health issues first before interacting with health facilities and that students’ demographic characteristics need to be understood to better tailor health literacy instruction to their education level, culture, age, gender, and available resources. Additionally, directors indicated that collaboration with other health providers is vital when teaching health literacy to make applicable the practicality of the material.</p>
<p>A key benefit of the Health Literacy Project was the sustainability of health literacy instruction. At the end of the project, all of the centers reported that strategies had been integrated so that health literacy was not a priority solely in the classroom and would continue into the future. These strategies included professional development opportunities, partnering health literacy with other classes and programs, continually engaging outside partners, and creating resource areas at their center (e.g., in the lobby, in the library) to display health literacy information.</p>
<sec id="section15-1524839912437367">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This evaluation was conducted in six adult education centers in a New England state, and therefore, results cannot be generalized to all adult education settings. This evaluation was also limited by the standard issues arising from using self-reported data. We attempted to minimize this limitation by analyzing student essays in addition to reporting test scores and triangulating qualitative data through interviews and conversations with center directors and teachers. This evaluation was also limited in the number of students who participated in the evaluation (i.e., 23%) relative to the total number of students exposed to health literacy. Given that participation in the evaluation required student participation in the pre- and posttest, the total number of students included was less than desirable. Additionally, the study was limited in that self-efficacy was a major component of the evaluation, and the field lacks a validated instrument to measure self-efficacy in health literacy. We attempted to compensate for this by developing the SEA to measure self-efficacy. Although the reliability was high (α = .84), the results are based on one pilot test. A final limitation is the lack of reliability data for the S-TOFHLA.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Integrating health literacy into adult education is a good opportunity to build the capacity of people to manage their health. Adult education centers serve as an access point to communities experiencing health disparities. Including health literacy in adult education will help students connect the importance of increasing their knowledge, skills, and confidence needed to successfully navigate the workforce and health systems, thereby promoting their overall well-being. Initiatives seeking to improve health equity can benefit from the evaluation’s findings of such an effort. Most important, similar efforts must understand that in addition to health literacy and self-efficacy, adequate resources are needed for people to apply skills to manage their health. Consideration of a continuum that includes health literacy, self-efficacy, and resources will help ensure <italic>access</italic> to services (via sufficient services and means to pay for services) and <italic>utilization</italic> of services (via self-advocacy that comes from health literacy skills and confidence). Health consumers who are educated and informed about their health status and conditions are more likely to change their behaviors, and health consumers who have positive interactions with their providers are more likely to listen and follow instructions, as the literature has shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912437367">Arora, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912437367">Epstein &amp; Street, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912437367">Kripalani, Gatti, &amp; Jacobson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912437367">O’Hair, 2003</xref>). These behavioral modifications improve individuals’ health and in the long term can reduce health disparities.</p>
