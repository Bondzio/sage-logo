<p>This book contests a fundamental assumption in liberal political and legal theory that violence occupies a secondary and tightly regulated place within the law’s frame of rational rules and norms. Through an engagement with the discourse on custodial torture in the United States and India, it demonstrates a continued accommodation by law of ‘excess violence’—violence the law claims not to require but cannot/will not do away with.</p>
<p>Lokaneeta argues for understanding torture in terms of ‘law’s struggle with violence’, i.e., even as it continues to deploy violence, the law struggles to ‘forget’ this violence, distantiate it as a question of implementation, and distinguish it from non-state violence as subordinate to judicial interpretation. She focuses on the space that judicial interpretation itself provides for excess violence.</p>
<p>Thus, the narrative of routine/normal jurisprudence in both countries shows that a preoccupation with physical forms of torture and an acceptance of the inherent coercion of interrogation have served to elide the existence of a problematic space of unauthorized psychological violence stretching between these poles. This pervasive ambiguity has been further exploited in extraordinary contexts such as within the jurisdiction of the detention centre at Guantánamo Bay in the US context, and through the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act, 1985 (TADA) and the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (POTA) in India. In the former case, the government employed an ‘aggressive hyperlegality’ to exploit ambiguities in the Federal Torture Statute to radically narrow definitions of torture, exempting all but the most egregious forms of brutality. In the latter context, these laws broke with a long legal legacy to allow senior police officials to record confessions in cases of terrorism, despite a continuing concern about custodial torture and deaths. In both cases, Lokaneeta shows, the responses of the Supreme Courts indicated an inability or unwillingness to assume interpretive responsibility over these issues, deflected with a studied silence in the American case, and a deference to Parliament’s legislative supremacy in the Indian case.</p>
<p>These narratives highlight contingent advances and reversals in a jurisprudential struggle against custodial torture, underwritten by a structural lack that fails to prevent recourse to such violence. However, in conceptualizing this violence as ‘excess’, Lokaneeta’s theorization fails to fully confront the structural lack of the law itself. This is better understood by considering Lokaneeta’s reading of Michel Foucault’s and Giorgio Agamben’s ideas alongside her description of the troubling tendentialities of Guantánamo Bay.</p>
<p>Lokaneeta argues that Foucault’s focus on disciplinary and governmental mechanisms ignores the continuing presence of excess legal violence and hence the state’s continued centrality as ‘a primary mode of control through its monopoly over legitimate violence’. However, Foucault’s work does not argue for a stagist conception of the disappearance of torture, but points to how legal violence is reconceptualized and reinserted into larger economies of violence. One such instance appears in the new psychological techniques of interrogation operative in Guantánamo Bay described by Lokaneeta. Here, strategies such as environmental manipulation and sleep deprivation were justified on the basis that such deprivations are part of everyday lives in lower intensities; affect interrogators as much as detainees; have been applied in training American armed forces personnel; and have been applied under medical supervision to ensure the safety of the detainee. Thus, the attempt is not only to bend the rules of torture safeguards without breaking them, but to bring the coercion of interrogations within a general economy of discipline and conduct. This gradation follows a similar logic to that which Foucault describes in <italic>Discipline and Punish</italic> (1995, pp. 232–233) arising in the double nature of the penitentiary system: the coercion of prison is classified within this system through a juridico-economic equivalence between offences and durations of punishments that repay one’s debt to society, as well as in a techno-disciplinary distribution that stretches outside the prison through the school, the barracks and the workshop.</p>
<p>Similarly, Lokaneeta argues, against Agamben, for understanding Guantánamo Bay in terms of a ‘hyperlegality’ or selective and aggressive application of existing law rather than in terms of a suspension of law in the state of exception. The latter formulation, she argues, hides the ambiguities of normal law by suggesting a break between routine contexts and states of exception characterized by ‘lawlessness’. However, for Agamben, states of exception are neither lawless states nor distinctly marked off from the normal. Firstly, Agamben (<italic>State of Exception</italic>, 2005) argues that the effort in a state of exception is to maintain the juridical status of law even when its normative content is voided out. But such efforts fail because this process renders the law indistinguishable from a state of non-law (pp. 55–57). The example that Lokaneeta draws on against the exception paradigm is of the withdrawal (in the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal) of the President’s exceptional powers to authorize excessively coercive interrogations, even as these methods continued under extant definitional ambiguities. However, this example can also be read as a reaction to the unhinging of the legal status of such violence, in the wake of images of soldiers drawing pleasure from torture and hence rendering law’s violence corrupted by human desires and vices. Such violence, therefore had to be disconnected from the President’s exceptional powers, so that the status of law attributed to those powers would not also be questioned.</p>
<p>Second, Agamben’s argument regarding the increasing centrality of the state of exception as the dominant paradigm of government (p. 2), points towards an inexorable blending of normal and exceptional circumstances rather than their separation. The zones of indistinction, he delineates, lie not on the borders between normal times and emergency situations but run throughout the body of the law, at every point at which legal power is further extended as legal protection is foreshortened. The notion of aggressive hyperlegality, then, is already within Agamben’s logic of the exception, since such proliferations and transformations of laws and rules are founded upon and yet suspend foundational distinctions drawn between distinctions such as citizen and alien, or necessary and excessive violence. Such exploitation of these thresholds points not towards excess and illicit deviations of law over the threshold of the norm, but its very existence being defined by an indistinction between normative limits of violence and the factual impossibility of such limits.</p>
<p>What we can draw from Foucault’s and Agamben’s expositions is that Lokaneeta’s characterization of the invisibilized space between physical torture and inherent coercion as ‘excess’ violence maintains the very thresholds that the state exploits. The problem does not lie in the state’s use of greater violence than acknowledged, but in the impossibility of defining limits once violence has been given a space in law at all. If this fundamental aporia is not confronted, then all that is left is a rearguard action in defence of our rights in the face of a state that advances and withdraws in a space where expedience and normative grounding wear each other’s faces.</p>
<p>While <italic>Transnational Torture</italic>, therefore is useful for focusing attention on the linkages between judicial interpretation and torture, one only wishes this theorization had been taken further, to draw out the most crucial conclusions that arise from it.</p>
