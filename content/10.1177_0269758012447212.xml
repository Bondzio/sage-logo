Globally, one-third of the world’s female prisoner population is confined in the United States and China, followed by Russia and Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758012447212">Walmsley, 2006</xref>). Between 1977 and 2004 the rate of female incarceration in the US increased by 750%, and women are being jailed at a rate that is almost double the rate of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269758012447212">Frost, 2006</xref>). African American women are six times more likely than white women to face imprisonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269758012447212">Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2000</xref>). Statistics Canada reports the number of women admitted to remand (pre-trial custody) has risen by 36% between 2001 and 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269758012447212">Babooram, 2008</xref>), and Indigenous women now comprise 72.5% of the federal female prisoner population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269758012447212">Pollack, 2009</xref>). In the United Kingdom, over the past decade, the female prisoner population has almost tripled and is deeply racialized: approximately 20% of female prisoners are classified as foreign nationals and 28% as ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758012447212">Walmsley, 2006</xref>). The Australian Institute of Criminology reports that between 1984 and 2003 there was a 75% increase in the number of adult male prisoners, yet there was a 209% increase in the number of female prisoners. Furthermore, approximately 40% of Indigenous women prisoners are serving a prison sentence for fine default, where many others are incarcerated for ‘trivial crimes’ such as using offensive language in public, disorderly conduct or welfare fraud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269758012447212">Bartels, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269758012447212">Forsythe and Adams, 2009</xref>).</p> <p>Overwhelming empirical evidence indicates that most criminalized and imprisoned women are poor, prostituted and victimized. The ruinous effects of neo-liberal austerity measures have been compounded by neo-conservative largesse seen in the expansion of the prison industry complex, increasing police budgets, dismantling of legal aid, legislating of mandatory minimum sentencing, the criminalization of drug dependency, and increasing use of prisons to warehouse the mentally ill. This paradoxical state has increased the likelihood of women’s victimization, criminalization and imprisonment. Most women prisoners are convicted of poverty, drug and prostitution related offences, but also report extensive histories of sexual and physical victimization as a result of their impoverishment and social exclusion. In Australia, 37% of Indigenous women prisoners reported being victims of sexual violence, 30% reported experiences of child abuse and 68% reported being assaulted by an intimate partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269758012447212">Forsythe and Adams, 2009</xref>). In Canada, whereas Indigenous women are four times more likely to be charged with homicide than non-Indigenous women, violence <italic>against</italic> Indigenous women is three times higher and Indigenous women five times more likely to be victims of homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758012447212">Brzozowski et al., 2006</xref>). In the United States, 57% of women in state prisons report that they were sexually or physically abused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269758012447212">Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2000</xref>). The intersection of violence and imprisonment in the lives of poor and racialized women is further entrenched in the violence of incarceration itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269758012447212">Scraton and McCulloch, 2009</xref>). Once imprisoned, the use of segregation, strip searching, and restraint techniques are used to control women, resulting in institutional charges for resisting staff, suicide attempts, self-harm, prolonged periods in isolation, or involuntary institutional transfers for the ‘good order of the institution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269758012447212">Amnesty International, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269758012447212">McCulloch and George, 2009</xref>). In this way we see the prison has become as a site of violence against women.</p> <p>This special issue considers many dimensions of the victimization, criminalization and punishment continuum in the lives of marginalized women in Australia, the United States and Canada. In this collection, feminist scholars examine the intersectionality of victimization, criminalization and punishment in the lives of prostituted women, women prisoners and Indigenous women. Carine Mardorossian provides a provocative discussion of the place of victimhood in US cultural practices since 9/11 and how women prisoners’ own identity is severed from their own personal narratives of abuse. Amanda Glasbeek’s historical inquiry of three young women convicted of killing a prison matron reveals the ambivalent and paradoxical media construction of young women’s own violence and their feminine vulnerability. Through this lens, Glasbeek examines the victimization, criminalization and imprisonment of young urban working girls. Corey Shdaimah and Shelly Wiechelt consider how prostituted women are portrayed by the media and court officials as both vulnerable victims and offenders who have broken the law. The authors are critical of diversionary court policies to address the systemic needs of prostituted women, such as access to affordable housing and safety from sexual violence. Whereas Glasbeek and Shdaimah and Wiechelt explore the tensions across gendered and classed stereotypes of the criminalized white urban working girl in historical and contemporary contexts, Elena Marchetti examines the racialized official discourse surrounding the deaths of Indigenous women prisoners in Australia. Her study reveals how ‘drunken squaw’ narratives about the women’s lives obscure the conditions of women’s confinement and their significant victimization histories. Colleen Dell and Jennifer Kilty consider how Indigenous women convicted of drug offences have internalized their colonial identities and the importance of authentic Indigenous identity in their healing from abuse and addiction. </p> <p>How do we begin to document the role of the state at the intersection of victimization, criminalization and incarceration in women’s lives? How can we transform ‘hegemonic tales’ of dangerous and undeserving women into ‘subversive stories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269758012447212">Ewick and Silbey, 1995</xref>) about gendered conditions of endangerment inside our communities and prisons? Progressive sentencing reforms introduced in Canada over a decade ago, to address the high rates of incarceration of Aboriginal offenders, have not recognized the continuum between victimization and criminalization in the lives of Aboriginal women. Gillian Balfour suggests that law reforms envisioned to be restorative rather than punitive have not enabled a decolonializing sentencing process. Finally, Shoshana Pollack reminds us of how women’s prisons – regardless of feminist-inspired research and reforms – continue to operate as sites of violence against women through the use of segregation as risk management. </p> </body> <back> <ref-list> <title>References</title> <ref id="bibr1-0269758012447212"> <citation citation-type="book"> <collab collab-type="author">Amnesty International</collab> (<year>1999</year>) <source>Not Part of My Sentence: Violations of the Human Rights of Women in Custody</source>. <publisher-loc>Washington, DC</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Amnesty International</publisher-name>.</citation> </ref> <ref id="bibr13-0269758012447212"> <citation citation-type="book"> <person-group person-group-type="author"> <name> <surname>Bambooram</surname> <given-names>A</given-names> </name> </person-group> (<year>2008</year>) <source>Changing Profile of Adults in Custody, 2006/2007</source>. <publisher-loc>Ottawa</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Statistics Canada</publisher-name>.</citation> </ref> <ref id="bibr2-0269758012447212"> <citation citation-type="book"> <person-group person-group-type="author"> <name> <surname>Bartels</surname> <given-names>L</given-names> </name> </person-group> (<year>2010</year>) <source>Indigenous Women Offending Patterns: A Literature Review</source>. <comment>Research and Policy Series, No. 107</comment>. <publisher-loc>Canberra</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Australian Institute of Criminology</publisher-name>.</citation> </ref> <ref id="bibr3-0269758012447212"> <citation citation-type="book"> <collab collab-type="author">Bureau of Justice Statistics</collab> (<year>2000</year>) <source>Women Offenders</source>. <publisher-loc>Washington, DC</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>United States Department of Justice</publisher-name>.</citation> </ref> <ref id="bibr4-0269758012447212"> <citation citation-type="book"> <person-group person-group-type="author"> <name> <surname>Brzozowski</surname> <given-names>J</given-names> </name> <name> <surname>Taylor-Butts</surname> <given-names>T</given-names> </name> <name> <surname>Johnson</surname> <given-names>S</given-names> </name> </person-group> (<year>2006</year>) <source>Victimization and Offending amongst the Aboriginal Population in Canada</source>. <publisher-loc>Ottawa</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics Canada</publisher-name>.</citation> </ref> <ref id="bibr5-0269758012447212"> <citation citation-type="journal"> <person-group person-group-type="author"> <name> <surname>Ewick</surname> <given-names>P</given-names> </name> <name> <surname>Silbey</surname> <given-names>S</given-names> </name> </person-group> (<year>1995</year>) <article-title>Subversive stories and hegemonic tales: Toward a sociology of narrative</article-title>. <source>Law and Society Review</source> <volume>29</volume>: <fpage>197</fpage>−226.</citation> </ref> <ref id="bibr6-0269758012447212"> <citation citation-type="web"> <person-group person-group-type="author"> <name> <surname>Forsythe</surname> <given-names>L</given-names> </name> <name> <surname>Adams</surname> <given-names>K</given-names> </name> </person-group> (<year>2009</year>) <article-title>Mental health, abuse, drug use and crime: Does gender matter?</article-title> <source>Trends &amp; Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice</source> <comment>No. 384: 1−8.
