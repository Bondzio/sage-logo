<p>What is new? It is not exactly fair to begin a book review with this question. It is, however, both justifiable and necessary if one is to do justice to Thomas Brady’s aims. The book offers an evaluation of Germany’s transition over 250 years to the early modern era which will no doubt preoccupy historians for some time. The book deals with all the significant topics of that time, the so-called <italic>Reichsreform</italic>, the older forms of German statehood, the Reformation and the Confessionalization process. In the final chapter, these topics are linked convincingly with the concerns of the present and they are also linked in an original manner with some older speculations about ‘German Futures’. As the book’s dust jacket announces: ‘Brady argues that the character of the political changes (dispersed sovereignty, local autonomy) prevented both a general reformation of the Church before 1520 and a national reformation thereafter’. During this period, German unity was forfeited and, as a result, it was only from the nineteenth century onwards that one can speak of <italic>one</italic> German history.</p>
<p>According to Brady, there was nonetheless a successful transformation during the period between 1400 and 1650: the transition from a universal Reich to a German Reich, characterized by a ‘multiplicity and autonomy of polities’ on the one hand as well as denominational plurality on the other. In Brady’s opinion, the primary reason why German history unfolded as it did was the successful reform of the Reich before 1520. It is not necessary to agree with every aspect of his analysis to appreciate that his exploration of various perspectives – caesaropapist, national and communal illusions – provides some plausible answers to open questions. A Reich emerged around 1500, whose boundaries cannot be exactly determined, but which was essentially restricted to the German nation. In the Reich, ‘Emperor and Estates’ made political decisions together, although the latter reigned over their territories more or less autonomously. After this first successful adaption to the European trend of national statehood, Brady argues, neither the general or national reformation of the church, nor the communalist plans of the peasants had a realistic chance of being realized. Thus, the Reformation movement, which Luther had triggered, could no longer be stopped and it inevitably became the political concern of ‘Emperor and Estates’, who accommodated the movement within the political constellation of the imperial constitution. The Peace of Augsburg 1555 was a preliminary resolution to this politically regulated denominational divide, which was finally completed with the Peace of Westphalia. After that time the German state church system comprised two national churches – the recourse to Leopold von Ranke is indeed appropriate at this point.</p>
<p>Apart from this overall argument, which is really only revealed in the conclusion, Brady’s narrative offers much that is well known and familiar. The plural ‘Histories’ of the title, as well as the general argument, becomes rather blurred over the course of 400 closely-printed pages. Despite the compilation of much detail and the quotation of many individual contemporary perceptions, Brady’s work does not constitute a handbook or an introductory synthesis. He does not declare his own position within the current state of research, or even make reference to alternative views. Many works of the last 40 years are not taken into account. These include the studies of the character of the Swabian or Schmalkaldic League (V. Press, H. Carl, G. Haug-Moritz), or of the Empire and its Estates (P. Moraw, V. Press, H. Angermeier, H. Neuhaus, G. Schmidt, B. Stollberg-Rilinger, A. Gotthard, etc.). The same applies to the pages devoted to social or intellectual history (for instance, G. Franz on the decrease in population during the 30 Years War or V. Leppin on Luther’s concept of liberty). Furthermore the usual bibliographical data is missing for many points that are made. Statements that appear rather surprising, such as Justus Lipsius’ declaration that ‘Liberty is characteristic of the Germans’, remain unexplained. The knowledge of certain contexts, which do not necessarily reveal themselves to the reader, is simply assumed: although the foundation of the Protestant Union and the Catholic League is mentioned, the author does not explain what prompted their foundation – the events at Donauwörth. Clearly, there is no reason why Brady should necessarily agree with the current state of research; nevertheless, it would be interesting to know why he does not agree. The implicit answer, namely that he shares many of the religious and political assumptions of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century (Protestant) historiography, will not be obvious to every reader. In general Brady confirms the old and frequently reiterated image of the Holy Roman Empire and the Reformation: a politically fragmented body, which – and this is relatively new – generated state structures, but did not follow the example of the centralized western European model of state formation. The Reich failed to find unity, Brady suggests, because it was divided into two confessional camps.</p>
<p>Even so, the numerous figures, charts, and maps do serve to illustrate a narrative of ‘German Histories’. Brady believes that the plural is necessary because the religious divide, which had been enshrined in the constitution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, was the main reason why the German nation did not achieve unity, even in later centuries. Brady sees no political or institutional continuity between the Old Reich and today’s Germany, but he does discern continuity in confessional terms. This is certainly debatable. However, one might also question whether there are not points of reference other than the unified and sovereign nation state, experienced as such internally and perceived as such externally. This might enable one to see more in the confessional pluralism and political diversity of the Old Reich (complementary levels of statehood, the division of power, a multi-layered system) than merely an obstacle to national development. Might this not conceivably serve as the historical context and frame of reference for ‘German Futures’ in a unified Europe?</p>
