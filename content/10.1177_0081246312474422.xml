<body>
<p>At the 2012 International Congress of Psychology hosted in Cape Town, I had the opportunity to attend a screening of the documentary <italic>Doctors of the Dark Side</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0081246312474422">Davis, Gribble, Kerman, &amp; Muskat, 2011</xref>). The documentary sought to provide a critical “expose” of the alleged role played by some U.S. military physicians’ and psychologists’ complicity in torture in the so-called “war on terror.” The involvement of psychologists in “Behavioral Science Consultation Teams” in interrogations of “enemy combatants” came to a head in 2005 when the American Psychological Association (APA), under the direction of a presidential task force on psychological ethics and national security, released 12 statements guiding the conduct of psychologists in line with ethical best practice and universal human rights laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0081246312474422">APA, 2005</xref>). Two years later, the APA reaffirmed its stance against psychologists’ involvement in “torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0081246312474422">APA, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Military psychology, that is, the application of psychological theory, research, and intervention in military environments, is not only one of the fastest emerging and dynamic disciplines of psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081246312474422">Adler, Bliese, &amp; Castro, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0081246312474422">Kennedy &amp; Zillmer, 2006</xref>) but also one of the most taboo, and some may argue misunderstood. This is not only the case abroad but also in South Africa. During apartheid, although not excluding the time before the National Party (NP) came into government, it was legally mandated and commonplace for the NP government to employ military (and paramilitary) forces to maintain the apartheid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0081246312474422">Mankayi, 2008</xref>). This took various forms often in joint operation with the state police and intelligence services such as, for example, the use of armed forces to quash township protests; covert incursions into neighboring Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique to “neutralize” antiapartheid activists; the deployment of the South African Defense Force (SADF) during the “boarder wars” with Angola; and the use of military trained operatives to engage in counterintelligence operations and planned assassinations of leaders of the apartheid resistance movements at home and in exile. There has, however, been substantial speculation and controversy regarding the ethical compliance of some health-care professionals working in the military (or under the guise thereof) in the detainment, interrogation, and/or torture of political prisoners in “defense” of the apartheid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0081246312474422">Foster, Davis, &amp; Sandler, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0081246312474422">Foster &amp; Sandler, 1985</xref>). Under the specter of this checkered past, the role played by military and civilian psychologists has come under question in potentially unethical conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0081246312474422">Naidoo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0081246312474422">Nicholas &amp; Cooper, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>It is in the context of South African psychology’s precarious relationship with military and national intelligence environments, and the expanding roles played by psychologists in the military as well as the government service, public safety domain, and correctional services, that <italic>Ethical Practice in Operational Psychology: Military and National Intelligence Applications</italic>, is well timed. Using the outline of the text as a point of departure, I will move to a brief comment on the structure of the text. This is followed by an overview of the salient features of the text’s content.</p>
<sec id="section1-0081246312474422">
<title>Outline of the text</title>
<p>“As psychologists’ roles and duties expand . . . so too must our understanding of how professional ethical standards relate to this expansion”—these are some of the opening words included in the inner sleeve of <italic>Ethical Practice</italic>. Now, more than ever, best ethical practice has been at the forefront of psychologists’ work. The historical effects of apartheid and racialized oppression, as well as the contemporary difficulties attached to that legacy, have sensitized psychologists in South Africa to rendering psychological services and interventions that are congruent with the human and health-care rights enshrined in the constitution. Accompanied by increasing litigiousness in health-care professions, there has been the recent publication of some notable texts covering the intersections of psychology, ethics, and law (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0081246312474422">Tredoux, Foster, Allan, Cohen, &amp; Wassenaar, 2005</xref>). Sensitivity to psychology’s intersections with these other fields is evident in the South African ethical code of conduct for psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0081246312474422">Professional Board for Psychology [PBP], 2002</xref>). In this regard, the APA’s seminal “Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0081246312474422">APA, 2010</xref>) often serves as a key orienting point for many other countries’ ethical codes of conduct for psychologists. Using this document as a guide, the authors of <italic>Ethical Practice</italic> take on the ethical dilemmas faced in the subdiscipline of Operational Psychology.</p>
<p>Operational Psychology is pointedly defined as the “actions by military psychologists that support the employment and/or sustainment of military forces (in particular, military commanders) to attain strategic goals in a theatre of war or theatre of operations by leveraging and applying their psychological expertise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0081246312474422">Kennedy &amp; Zillmer, 2006</xref>, p. 194). <italic>Ethical Practice</italic> provides substantial insights to buoy psychologists’ in the murky and, on occasion, choppy waters of public safety, defense and security, and intelligence. This is also of note considering the heated debate around prospective changes in South Africa’s state security laws. Lending credible weight to the text is the collective knowledge and practical experience of the editors Carrie Kennedy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0081246312474422">1</xref></sup> and Thomas Williams, and their selection of contributors. The editors offer a refreshingly frank recognition of the “ongoing debate about psychologists consulting to interrogations, [and] the emotional reactions regarding this topic” (p. xi), in a post-9/11 era. These concerns are equally palpable for South African psychologists working in and out of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) who are acutely aware of our country’s history and abuses in the name of “psychology.” In the editors’ words, the intention of this text is to “provide firsthand knowledge about the key areas of operational psychological practice and the ethical analysis needed to operate in this relatively unchartered territory” (p. xii).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0081246312474422">
<title>Structure of the text</title>
<p><italic>Ethical Practice</italic> is divided into seven chapters and one noteworthy appendix. The first chapter, authored by the editors, provides the overarching framework for the text through an accessible foregrounding of the field of Operational Psychology, the primary duties and tasks operational psychologists perform, and the evolving challenges faced in the application of psychology in military and national intelligence environments. Military and operational jargon is forgone as contributors discuss the ethical dilemmas inherent and emergent in the field through understandable ethical terminology common to psychologists, for example, “multiple roles,” “privacy and confidentiality,” and “competence.”</p>
<p>Barring the first and final chapter, the chapters follow a relatively consistent formula of (1) an accessible overview of an operational context, such as assessment and specialist selection, or interrogation and debriefing; (2) the ethical boundaries and dictums defining a psychologist’s involvement in that context according to the APA Ethics Code; (3) common ethical dilemmas that emerge; and (4) practical suggestions and recommendations for resolving the ethical quandaries consistent with law. Ethical dilemmas are explicated through realistic and engaging case examples and scenarios based on the contributors’ experiences in the field. Some chapters can be read in isolation, for example, Chapter 6, which provides an outline of duties psychologists can undertake during hostage negotiations. I, however, recommend that Chapter 1 be given pointed attention for its overview of this ever-expanding field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0081246312474422">
<title>Content of the text</title>
<p>The first chapter opens with an incisive discussion on the evolving and expanding roles played by psychologists in support of (para)military and intelligence operations. Here, the editors provide an updated definition of Operational Psychology as “<italic>the application of the science and profession of psychology to the operational activities of law enforcement, national intelligence organizations, and national defense activities</italic>” (p. 4, emphasis original). In light of the movement of psychologists into the realms of law enforcement, intelligence, and military agencies, the editors outline the principal ethical dilemmas faced by operational psychologists, namely, mixed agency, competence, multiple relationships, and informed consent.</p>
<p>South African psychologists would understand the concept of <italic>mixed agency</italic> more colloquially as “role conflicts,” or the “divided loyalties,” which emerge in the context of a psychologist having to serve both their employer/client, in this case, the state, as well as the person they may be rendering an assessment or therapeutic service to. Interesting parallels can be drawn here between organizational psychologists working for companies and forensic psychologists rendering services on behalf of the court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0081246312474422">Roos &amp; Vorster, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that Operational Psychology is still relatively young compared to other fields of applied and research psychology, there are still challenges in establishing standards of practice—in theory, research, education, and training for Operational Psychology. This places a unique challenge on operational psychologists in having to obtain <italic>competence</italic> in a field of psychology that is always in a state of flux due to internal developments in the discipline, and operational factors such as environmental pressures or changes in laws and national security policy. Moreover, the field of Operational Psychology is performed in an environment that deals in sensitive information and often delays the publication of manuscripts, as information is subject to military and government approval. Operational psychologists, in exercising their psychological expertise, are also required to be competent in negotiating the organizational culture in which they are operating; this is especially an imperative for psychologists working in the military, where factors such as rank, chain of command, or organizational procedure, complicate the performance of certain psychological duties.</p>
<p><italic>Multiple relationships</italic> are quite a common dilemma faced by operational psychologists. For example, a clinical psychologist on deployment may be required to provide therapeutic interventions, debriefings, and psychometric assessments for service men and women they are stationed with. In this regard, operational psychologists share much in common with psychologists working in small or rural communities where fewer mental health resources place the burden on these psychologists to assess the potential for multiple relationships to become harmful. Significantly, this also implies the need for operational psychologists to build strong professional relationships with colleagues for support and supervision.</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>informed consent</italic> is covered as an ethical dilemma that proves to be quite contentious as it ties into issues of confidentiality. Here, a fascinating example is given of psychologists being consulted to provide indirect assessments, in the form of psychological profiles, of hostage-takers or suspected terrorists. In this case, often no informed consent is obtained on the part of the individual or group being profiled as it may compromise both the profiling process and public safety. The editors put the ethical dilemma here succinctly: “this involves a balancing act between weighing the rights of individuals who are suspected of a significant crime or plan to harm the interests of others and the welfare of society at large” (p. 18).</p>
<p>Along with the principal ethical dilemmas encountered by operational psychologists, Chapter 1 also includes an overview of the most common roles and responsibilities of operational psychologists, including assessment and selection of high-risk operational personnel; security clearance evaluations; survival, evasion, resistance, and escape training for operational personnel; repatriation of personnel (such as prisoners of war); support to counterintelligence and counterterrorism; consultation to interrogation and debriefings; indirect assessments (often employed in surveillance contexts); crisis and hostage negotiations; and psychological autopsies or equivocal death analyses. The contributing authors subsequently discuss the principal ethical dilemmas through the abovementioned duties performed by operational psychologists.</p>
<p>Notably, the final chapter, Chapter 7, shifts focus to the development of a proactive ethical frame of reference for operational psychologists. Here, the editors outline a five-step framework for ethical decision making, which is practical, concrete, and pliable to context, as well as a three-tiered recommendation for ethical role management that operational psychologists can employ.</p>
<p>The text contains an appendix, a reprint of “The Twelve Guiding Statements of the APA Presidential Task Force on Psychological Ethics and National Security” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0081246312474422">APA, 2005</xref>). This is not only an interesting read toward understanding the current mandate under which operational psychologists in the United States operate but also provides a useful ethical framework in and of itself for operational psychologists working in other militaries outside the United States.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The new SANDF has undergone substantial transformations in its structure, organizational culture, and function, since 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0081246312474422">Martin, van Wijk, Makhaba, &amp; Hans-Arendse, in press</xref>). Currently, psychologists serving in the SANDF fall under the command structure of the Directorate of Psychology in the South African Military Health Service (SAMHS), and conduct duties and render services in line with the requirements directed by the Health Professions Council of South Africa and the PBP code of ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0081246312474422">PBP, 2002</xref>). This text should be of foremost interest to psychologists serving in the SANDF. <italic>Ethical Practice</italic>, as a ground-breaking text toward developing a coherent ethical framework for this discipline, covers a variety of operational experiences and ethical dilemmas that speak directly to some of the tasks of psychologists in the SANDF. In this regard, I recommend this text as an imperative to SANDF psychologists. However, the authors’ forthright and comprehensive approach to negotiating both common and hot-button ethical dilemmas offers engaging insight for readers who are interested in being introduced to this new discipline, those involved in teaching and studying ethics, and psychologists working in government services, public safety, and correctional services. Undoubtedly, as the purviews of defense and intelligence evolve in a heightened zeitgeist of “safety and security” in post-9/11 world, psychologists may find themselves involved in ethically questionable practices. This text provides all psychologists a yardstick that roots our professional conduct firmly in best ethical practice.</p>
