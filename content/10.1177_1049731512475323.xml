<abstract>
<p>The Hughes et al. paper is critiqued generally and in specific areas. The weak nature of the authors’ empirical work is discussed along with their enigmatic writing and vague and incorrect use of references, and their simultaneous use of sweeping statements of opinion and narrow analytical focus. This review examines the authors’ errors regarding differential response (DR) and child safety, confusion of child safety and family risk, incorrect portrayal of DR family assessments, incomplete review and analysis of inconsistency in pathway (track) assignment, incomplete analysis of external validity, and mistaken interpretation of field experiments. A short essay on the purpose of DR is presented along with other literature which readers are encouraged to read and interpret for themselves.</p>

<body>
<p>We are pleased to have been asked to respond to the article in this journal on differential response (DR) by Hughes, Rycus, Saunders-Adams, Hughes, and Hughes of the Institute for Human Services. Several of the issues raised in the article are important and call for further discussion and research. Unfortunately, because the article contains a long list of misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and errors, it is a flawed vehicle for such a discussion. Before getting to the more egregious errors, some general comments: The “research” of Hughes et al. relies on very little actual “data”—28 “key informant” interviews and a cursory, often inaccurate review of the research of others. The article does not lack for opinion or speculation, however. Some of the statements of the authors are simply puzzling. For example, “A primary deterrent to achieving rigor in field-based research is the presence of variables in the study environment that cannot be identified, isolated, or measured, yet which may strongly influence both program implementation and study outcomes. To claim or imply that an intervention being evaluated is responsible for observed outcomes without fully considering the potential role of these other variables can provide a distorted and exaggerated picture of the state of our knowledge about an intervention’s effectiveness” (p. 500). How exactly is a researcher to “<italic>fully</italic> consider” the “<italic>potential</italic> role” of something that “<italic>cannot be identified</italic>, isolated, or measured” (italics added)? This is something truly mysterious—like Donald Rumsfeld’s famous “unknown unknowns.” But, is not this why we use random assignment and control groups?</p>
<p>There is also the troubling matter of the authors’ lack of clarity about what DR is. This is a problem in a paper about DR. Among other things they write this about the impact of AR in Minnesota: “Hence, any improvements noted in the experimental group could potentially be attributed to the extra resources provided the AR group rather than differences in how an agency responds to an allegation” (p. 510). In fact, Minnesota’s AR is a multipart model that involves both increased services and differences in approach to families. This is something at least one of the authors of Hughes et al. knows to be the case since there is an earlier section of the article in which services to AR families are described as something troubling and concerning and, particularly in three track systems (such as Minnesota has developed), something “agencies should avoid” (See <italic>Finding # 4</italic>). We agree this resource question is a serious issue for states, but no one already knows this better than state agency administrators, and it is one of the reasons they seek cost effectiveness studies. Moreover, a closer reading of our Minnesota evaluation reports would reveal that we attempted to parse out the effects of services explicitly, separated from approach (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512475323">Loman and Siegel, 2004b</xref>, “Effects of Services on Recurrence,” pp. 125–129; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512475323">Siegel and Loman, 2006</xref>, “Chapter 2. Ongoing Impacts of Family Assessment Response”). This parsing was moved forward with greater statistical rigor in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512475323">Loman and Siegel (2012</xref>), where we show significant effects 9 years later of <italic>both</italic> the DR approach and increased material services to families from the Minnesota study. This illustrates a basic problem with the authors’ approach to criticism: rather than presenting issues as if they were the first to recognize them, a more constructive method would have been to acknowledge and describe the analyses of others and show why they agree or disagree. That would be a critical method with the potential to lead to useful dialog.</p>
<p>Responding to the many sweeping statements made in Hughes et al. is difficult because they provide so little documentation to support their pronouncements, and their criticisms of DR research have references that often lack page numbers or even report chapter numbers. We are often left wondering, what exactly are they referring to? For example, under “Finding # 3” they write, “In traditional CPS investigations, caseworkers are expected to conduct in-person interviews with all family members, see and talk with alleged child victims and siblings, gather information from collateral contacts, screen for other types of maltreatment, gather in-depth data to assess risk, and initiate safety plans when needed. As noted above, our research suggests that many of these activities are often not implemented in the alternative track and, in fact, are often discouraged (Loman and Siegel, 2004b, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731512475323">2009</xref>)” (Hughes et al., 2013, pp. 502–503). Where exactly have we said these things so that we can respond? And which of the “many” such activities are they speaking about? Surely, even in the social sciences an indictment requires a bill of particulars. And, there is a question here that goes begging: Where is the comparative documentation that informs us how frequently each of these activities is actually done in investigations?</p>
<p>Reflecting on Hughes et al., it seems a waste that a more constructive and informative paper was not chosen to anchor a critical dialog about this reform effort. The interested reader is referred to the literature review produced by the Children’s Bureau QIC for DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512475323">QIC-DR, 2011</xref>). This said, we stand ready to engage in healthy and friendly conversation with anyone who wants to know more about DR or our research studies. Now to turn to some of the most serious errors in Hughes et al.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049731512475323">
<title>1. Child safety and family risk</title>
<p>DR in its simplest form involves two pathways (or tracks) into which reported families are directed: a traditional forensic investigation or a family assessment (FA). There is an assumption in the Hughes et al. paper that child safety has been disregarded or at least downplayed in DR FAs. Nothing could be further from the truth. Child safety was a primary concern in the four-state Child Protection Services (CPS) DR programs we evaluated. Child safety assessments were conducted using formal tools as part of virtually <italic>all of the thousands of family assessments </italic>in the states. When child safety problems were identified, safety plans were created in a joint process between workers and families. The unfamiliarity of Hughes et al. with this is particularly baffling in Ohio where their organization is contracted to provide training to CPS workers. How could they not be aware that Ohio uses a version of the structured decision making (SDM) child safety assessment and planning tool and the SDM family risk assessment for FA cases?</p>
<p>A partial explanation may be the authors’ confusion of child safety with family risk, concepts they use interchangeably throughout the paper. Safety refers to imminent physical and psychological threats to children, such as the presence of a sexual predator; lack of food, clothing or safe housing; probable physical abuse by a caregiver; and so on. Risk refers to the presence of characteristics in families that are statistical predictors of <italic>future</italic> maltreatment, such as one or more past reports of maltreatment, parental substance abuse, caregiver depression, special needs children, family poverty, and so on. The two concepts are not synonymous. The primary consideration for assignment to investigations in DR is child safety not family risk. This can be seen in an analysis of the DR population in our study of the use of the SDM Family Risk Assessment tool for over 15,000 families in Minnesota. Our analysis found that 17.4% of families screened as appropriate for FAs were assessed as high or intensive risk, only slightly less than the 22.3% in the general CPS population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512475323">Loman &amp; Siegel, 2004c</xref>, pp. 13, 63). The distinguishing factor for assignment to a FA is that the presenting problems in the report and child safety assessment findings at that particular time were less severe. This finding concerning family risk shows that the assumption of low recurrence rates for DR families by Hughes et al. is incorrect.</p>
<p>Hughes et al. are concerned that child safety cannot be accurately assessed at the time of pathway assignment. No one is assuming that it can. This is why the first step in a FA is a child safety assessment. In this regard, the authors seem to have an incomplete understanding of the use of pathway (track) change, an element in all DR programs. FA workers do sometimes find other immediate safety threats to children that call for a traditional investigation and change the response from assessment to investigation. Hughes et al. also seem confused about whether FA workers interview families and seem to assume greater ignorance on the part of FA workers. Yet, we show in numerous locations throughout our studies that FAs are on average more intensive: They last substantially longer than investigations; FA workers have more contacts (both in person and otherwise) with families, and they have more collateral contacts; FA workers are more knowledgeable about a greater range of family strengths and needs than investigative workers; and FA workers do the same child safety and family risk assessments as investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512475323">Siegel and Loman, 1997</xref>, pp. 65-86, 120-123; Loman and Siegel, 2004b, pp. 40, 47-49, 52-66; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512475323">Loman, et al., 2010</xref>, pp. 68-82, 148), another example of the authors’ ignorance of or carelessness toward quantitative findings of previous research. In short, contrary to the speculations of Hughes et al., there is no empirical evidence that FAs involve less concern about child safety, and there is ample evidence that FAs lead to increased knowledge about risky characteristics of families as well as broader knowledge of needs and strengths. Based on misinterpretation of a few worker comments, Hughes et al. conclude that reported allegations are ignored in FA. The existence and content of the report is the first thing out of the FA worker’s mouth and a prime consideration in the safety assessment and planning process.</p>
<p>Regarding our research on child safety, we focused on the presence of a wide variety of immediate child safety threats at the time of first contact as well as the remediation of those threats by the time of final contact with the family. In Missouri, this involved case reviews of pilot and comparison cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512475323">Siegel and Loman, 1997</xref>, pp. 43–64, 236–240). In Minnesota and Ohio, the methods were dependent on information provided by workers in samples of experimental and control cases (Loman and Siegel, 2004b, pp. 104-127; Loman et al., 2010, pp. 130-133). These were not scales of child safety, as the authors seem to think. Rather than attempting to provide child safety scale scores, whatever that might mean, we studied specific safety issues. For example, was there adequate food in the home and if not was this problem addressed and changed during the case? Safety and changes in safety were measured and reported in this way. This approach has the advantage of remaining close to specific safety issues rather than more nebulous scale scores for a concept that is exceptionally multidimensional. Hughes et al. present no <italic>empirical</italic> evidence that children are less safe in FAs, only conjectures. Also, the authors’ criticism of the use of worker responses is particularly curious in a paper whose sole source of empirical data is interviews with similar individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049731512475323">
<title>2. Inconsistent assignment to pathways</title>
<p>Hughes et al. are concerned about inconsistencies in DR programs, particularly in assignment to pathways. From the start, we were concerned about the inconsistencies we saw in pathway (track) assignment. The large-scale data collection and analyses we conducted and our conclusions about this are simply ignored in their review (Siegel and Loman, 1997, pp. 15-18; 29-33; Loman et al., 2010, pp. 20-34; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512475323">Loman &amp; Siegel, 2004a</xref>, pp. 49–57), yet another example of presenting issues that have been systematically considered by others as if they were something only Hughes et al. had noticed. Each state used a standard pathway assignment protocol. We found that the discretionary items on the protocols were used differently and this was the primary source of variations in assignment. This is indeed an issue that should be addressed when inconsistencies affect child safety and services to families, as should all other inconsistencies in CPS, such as differences among and within states in rates and types of report acceptance, substantiation, opening of service cases, and children placed in out-of-home care. The evidence for variations in these and other areas within traditional CPS is massive and generally recognized.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049731512475323">
<title>3. Family responses to investigations</title>
<p>The most consistent finding in our work is that, on average, families react more positively to FAs than to forensic investigations (Siegel and Loman, 1997, pp. 135-155, Loman and Siegel, 2004b, pp. 31-49, Loman et al, 2010, pp. 56-67; Siegel et al., 2010, pp. 57-70). If this can be accomplished without endangering the children, one wonders why anyone would object. Yet, the authors seem to believe the findings of research are suspect and that investigations could result in family engagement were investigators properly trained. Our research is empirical (with two of the studies using random assignment) and depends on family responses to questions about satisfaction with workers, levels of participation in decision making, appropriate and sufficient services, and emotional responses to the worker. Hughes et al. believe that the methods, especially those measuring the latter (Loman and Siegel, 2004b, pp. 34-35; Loman et al., 2010, pp. 56-58), are suspect. The internal consistency of our findings within and among workers and families—something presented in great analytic detail in our studies—is a critical indicator of their validity. The concern of Hughes et al. that the family samples may not have been representative is a concern in any voluntary survey. While this was examined in several of our studies, our most thorough investigation of this question can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512475323">Loman and Siegel (2012</xref>), where we demonstrate the close similarity of the Minnesota family sample to the entire DR study population, again analyses that Hughes et al. simply ignore.</p>
<p>A related question concerns whether increased family engagement has implications for child safety? In the Missouri study, an important difference was lower levels of cooperation and substantially higher levels of family flight (moving with no forwarding address) among comparison families where only traditional investigations were conducted (Siegel and Loman, 1997, pp. 49–53). Similar findings concerning cooperation were found in Minnesota and Ohio (Loman and Siegel, 2004b, pp. 38-39, 120-121; Loman et al., 2010, pp. 88-89). The empirical findings indicate that investigations are more likely to result in family disengagement (dissatisfaction, fear, anger, and resentment), which later service workers must overcome, and when that disengagement cannot be overcome it is reasonable to assume that the children are in greater danger. For a full discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512475323">Siegel (2012a</xref>, pp. 33–37).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049731512475323">
<title>4. External validity</title>
<p>Hughes et al. are at pains to instruct readers about external validity—whether research findings are generalizable. Establishing external validity was not a goal of our evaluations, but this is a legitimate area for further study. We wonder why Hughes et al. did not do this, since we present in great detail the characteristics of families in our studies. The reader will notice the absence of quantitative or statistical reanalysis in their article. It is much easier simply to speculate, as Hughes et al. do, than to do the hard analytical work necessary to demonstrate external validity. In this context, Hughes et al. say that random sampling might have accomplished this, a puzzling suggestion since our evaluations were studies of entire populations of counties where pilot programs were being tested. We assume, of course, they are not advocating the clearly unethical procedure of random sampling with no regard to presenting problems and child safety.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049731512475323">
<title>5. Maltreatment recurrence rates</title>
<p>Hughes et al. use their confused conception of the concepts of risk and safety and their perplexing ideas about random sampling to suggest that the findings of the evaluations concerning maltreatment recurrence are somehow deficient. Two of the studies utilized the gold standard of evaluation research: random assignment to an experimental and control group. The authors suggest, with no clear explanation, that because recurrence rates ought to be low (a misunderstanding of risk, as noted above) for families determined to be appropriate for FA, that the experimental findings are somehow confounded. Hughes et al. correctly note that “one would expect to see comparable recurrence rates in the two groups regardless of whether they were served in the [family assessment] or [investigation] track” (p. 502). This is definitely true, and the fact that the recurrence rates were significantly lower in the experimental (FA) group supports the greater effectiveness of the FA approach compared to the approach for the control (investigation) group. What is incorrect about this sentence? Furthermore, because in most developed DR programs, more than 60% of reports are on average assigned to the FA track, the finding would appear to apply to the majority of families reported to CPS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049731512475323">
<title>6. Bias</title>
<p>Perhaps, the most irritating thing about the Hughes paper is the accusation of bias. We had no hidden agenda in approaching these evaluations. Our objective has only ever been to provide honest, thorough, and usable evaluation reports. We were not marketing ourselves in any way. We do not have a marketing communications coordinator on staff, as does the company of the authors.</p>
<p>But if one is to be led to the gallows, one would hope the court got the evidence right. First, it is important to point out that the views of caseworkers and families were included in our reports because these were explicitly requested by the state agencies. Policy makers wanted to know what their caseworkers thought about the practice change being implemented and what their experiences were, and they wanted to learn how families responded to the new approach compared with traditional investigations. Quotes of caseworkers and family respondents included in the reports are representative samples of what interviewees told us. They are not “testimonials,” but just what people told us, positive and negative, about FAs and investigations. They were not the primary data we relied on to present the views of these groups—surveys were the source for that and conclusions were based on quantitative analyses of large samples. But the open-ended comments of respondents provided an important window into what went on when caseworkers met with families. Surely anyone relying on a single, small set of “key informants,” such as Hughes et al., can appreciate the importance of what even one individual has to say. (Hughes et al. give us very little information about who these key informants might be. What makes them “key”? We are told only that they were “knowledgeable” and “appropriate,” and were “from state agencies and/or from local implementing agencies.” Whoever they were, it is curious that not one of them seems to have had a single positive thing to say about DR).</p>
<p>Second, it is stating the obvious to point out that Hughes et al. would not know there were caseworkers critical of aspects of FAs, if we had not included this information and specific caseworker comments in our reports. For instance, how did Hughes et al. learn there were caseworkers in Minnesota who referred to AR as “TR-light?” Does this seem likely to come from researchers more interested in AR “promotion” rather than “science”? How did Hughes et al. know there was a great deal of variability among counties in screening (pathway assignment) of maltreatment reports as appropriate for FAs? Only because we went into great detail describing this implementation issue. If Hughes et al. had read the annual reports on the pilot project (available through the QIC-DR, 2011 literature survey), they would have learned much more about this issue. The interested reader can learn more about our concerns about implementation problems in Minnesota and Missouri in a paper on our website that has been available since January 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512475323">Siegel, 2012a</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, it is important to interpret one’s own criticisms accurately. Late in the very long section on safety (<italic>Finding #3</italic>), Hughes et al. write this: “Alternative track caseworkers are now instructed to focus on family strengths and needs rather than seeking information about maltreatment incidents. Loman &amp; Siegel reference this DR principle when they contend that the alternative track focuses on ‘looking forward with the family rather than looking back at an incident’” (Loman and Siegel, 2004b, p. 82) (Hughes et al., 2013, p. 502). Setting aside, for the moment, the oversimplification of their discussion, the casual reader may well conclude, as it is clear Hughes et al. did, that these were words we wrote and that they had something to do with safety. In fact, the quote put in our mouths was a quote of a caseworker we reported (with quote marks) in a section on “Worker Attitudes toward AR.” Attributing the quote to us rather than to a worker, we interviewed and taking the quote out of context suggests either a not-very-close reading of the reports they were critiquing, sloppy coordination among multiple authors, or something worse. Continuing on (p. 503), Hughes et al. proceed to insinuate we do not appreciate the predictive significance of prior incidents of child maltreatment. This also indicates a fundamental ignorance of our studies, in which prior CPS contacts are studied in detail (e.g., Loman and Siegel, 2004a, pp. 8-19; Loman et al., 2010; Loman, 2006; Loman &amp; Siegel, 2004c; 2012). Overall, it seems Hughes et al. have mostly limited their reading of our reports to the comments of CPS workers included in them, or to digests of them, or prefaces in them.</p>
<p>We have produced five final evaluation reports of DR pilot projects (in Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, and two in Minnesota) and two reports of extended follow-ups (Minnesota and Missouri) that are readily available to anyone—about 1,000 pages of material, which does not include more numerous interim and annual project reports and special analyses requested by state agencies. In their section “Science or Promotion,” Hughes et al. include a table with six specific complaints of our work that “concern” them. Two involve quotes from caseworkers—although in one instance the reader cannot know this because Hughes et al. did not include the original quote marks. Three are reactions not to a final evaluation report, but to a “digest” of a report requested by the state agency. And one is taken from the preface of a report—in a paragraph that ends with the caution that AR is “not a magic bullet.” Each of the points made by Hughes et al., we contend, misrepresents our work; together they seem designed to impugn our integrity. Is it not Hughes et al. that should explain their motives?</p>
<p>In their article, Hughes et al. refer to our report on the Nevada DR Pilot. They refer to an interim report. The final report on the project has been available online since the fall of 2010. To give the reader some idea of our thinking about the complicated relationship between child safety and maltreatment reports, we would like to include the first few paragraphs of the Nevada report’s concluding chapter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512475323">Siegel, Filonow, &amp; Loman, 2010</xref>, p. 138):
<disp-quote>
<p>Experienced child welfare workers know that a particular report to a child abuse/neglect hotline is often only the tip of the iceberg. The report is only what an observer—a teacher, a doctor, a neighbor—happens to notice that leads to a hotline report being made. There are often other, and sometimes more serious things, hidden below the surface. Repeated reports on families over time, then, may best be understood as rolling icebergs,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049731512475323">1</xref></sup> with different aspects of the family and its troubles revealing themselves and being observed. To some extent, what may be seen by an outsider at a particular time is an accident; many things that go on within a family are never noticed by anyone outside the family. This argues for a process in which families are approached broadly and prospectively, along the lines prescribed in the family assessment model. This is not to relegate the accusation to a less important status, but to understand that any accusation or incident is part of a broader context or pattern or condition within a family. With an investigation’s often tight focus on a particular allegation, other important aspects of the family’s life may never be discovered or, if hinted at, not pursued. By probing beneath the surface, however, other problems and issues that may have profound consequences on the lives of children may be discovered. Factors likely to lead to problems in the future can be identified, and only if identified can they be addressed and resolved before something else happens to a child, something that may have tragic consequences.</p>
<p>The decision to refer a report to the investigative response may be seen as the safer course of action in situations where the actual threats to a child cannot be fully appreciated through allegations alone. The choice may be viewed as one between child safety (the province of CPS investigations) and preventive social work (the area for family assessments). This, however, is a false choice, a false dichotomy and a misreading of differential response. It may apply to the hotline situation in which the decision must be made to accept or reject an incoming report of child maltreatment, determining whether the report requires some formal system response or can be addressed in some other way, if it needs to be at all. The safety versus prevention distinction is not a calculation meant to be made by a child protection system employing a differential response approach. The safety of children is not assumed or taken for granted in the family assessment pathway any more than in an investigation. Safety of children is always of paramount importance in a family assessment. However, the differential response assumes that the actual safety of children, in the present and in the future, often requires attention to what may formerly have been relegated to preventive services and that investigating specific accusations without addressing underlying conditions that may adversely affect a child’s wellbeing and safety in the future, is an insufficient response. Differential response is not simply about approaching families in a more friendly, supportive manner, to gain the family’s cooperation and participation, but it is also about rationality and system accountability: intervening in an effective way, for the sake of children now and for the sake of children tomorrow.</p>
<p>While family-centered practice, to some degree or another, has made its way into CPS, best practice is not always common practice in a crisis-driven program, and the focus of investigations in most instances remain relatively narrow. This is not to say that a good investigation, having substantiated a report, may not look at the range of factors that may have led to the incident: Was the excessive discipline caused by an ignorance of child development or the alcoholism of a parent or on-going domestic violence in the home? Knowledge of the cause can direct the case plan and remediating services. However, in the best of systems this occurs in a minority of cases where allegations are substantiated. Moreover, even in these the full extent of underlying problematic conditions is often not fully explored, much less addressed. When reports are not substantiated it is the rare child protection system that delves further. A fully implemented differential response system involves institutionalizing family-centered practice, transforming it from an ideal into required practice (and subject of training) done to the maximal extent possible by all workers.</p>
</disp-quote> The only good we see coming out of the Hughes et al. paper is that readers may decide to read for themselves the reports referenced in it. It would be a damaging outcome if the brief op-ed summaries and conclusions of Hughes et al. were the only exposure someone had to these documents. But, as is the case with the Nevada report, there are other papers Hughes et al. missed in their literature review, perhaps skewing their judgment. We would like to draw the interested reader’s attention to the following: (1) An analysis of chronic child neglect cases that absorb a very high percentage of resources in a resource-limited CPS environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512475323">Loman, 2006</xref>). The dual-response approach has grown out of a need to emphasize prevention, not just reaction, and to find ways to thin the stream of cases entering CPS that turn into chronic cases, (2) An analytical article that links poverty, chronic neglect, and DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512475323">Loman &amp; Siegel, 2012</xref>), (3) An article on the cost-effectiveness of DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512475323">Siegel, 2012b</xref>), an issue discussed in each of the reports on state DR programs otherwise referenced, (4) The final report of the Minnesota Parent Support Outreach Program (Loman et al. 2009), a program which seeks to initiate preventative intervention at an earlier point than traditional CPS, (5) A paper on the history of state DR projects that we have evaluated and what has been learned about why DR works and when it does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512475323">Siegel, 2012a</xref>), and (6) A paper on the Minnesota DR model—a model that has been influential in the design of multiple-track systems in other states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512475323">Siegel, 2011</xref>). The Hughes et al. paper provides evidence that although it appears relatively simple, DR is often misunderstood.</p>
