<abstract>
<p>In an earlier article in this journal, C. A. Bowers suggests that transformative learning, particularly Paulo Freire’s pedagogy, is a Trojan horse of western globalization, by deepening the ecological crisis and colonizing indigenous cultures. He charges that critical pedagogues avoid their own complicity in neoliberal globalization; he advocates for an alliance between conservative politics and environmentalism; and he promotes a “conserving education.” This article will critique the first three facets of Bowers’ argument: first, by agreeing with the critique of the enlightenment underpinnings in transformative learning theory but resolving them in more nuanced ways; second, by explaining the ontology implicit in Freire that Bowers misunderstands; and third, expanding the critical stream of transformative learning by arguing that every sustainability educator needs a strong political economic as well as cultural analysis, combined with honoring local contexts, including indigenous traditional knowledge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In a 2005 issue of the <italic>Journal for Transformative Education</italic>, ecopedagogue Chet Bowers suggests that transformative learning <italic>ala</italic> Paulo Freire, is a Trojan horse of Western globalization and that Freirean pedagogy itself has now become a “banking process.” Bowers argues that what is often considered transformative and liberatory by critical theorists may actually be part of that which is now most problematic. Rather, he says, only indigenous cultures can be the “real source of resistance to the imperialism of market liberalism” (2005, p. 123). In particular, he charges that Freire and his followers are complicit with neoliberalism by perpetuating some of the deepest and most destructive Western cultural patterns, including enthnocentrism, liberal hegemony, anomic individualism, a market mentality including consumerism, and moral universality. These Western cultural patterns, he says, undermine traditional knowledge systems, indigenous moral ecologies, cultural integrity, community self-sufficiency, intergenerationality, and the ecological commons. Instead, Bowers proposes a “conserving education” as genuine resistance, which fosters the ability to conserve cultural and natural systems.</p>
<p>Many of these critiques of Freire are not new, but Bowers offers them from within a deep ecology framework aligned with the indigenous cultural preservationism movement, which indeed challenges some of the conceptual foundations of transformative learning. In this article, I will only engage with three of the five facets of Chet Bowers’ argument for reasons of complexity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1541344612453880">1</xref>
</sup> Bower’s ideas are further explicated in his book <italic>Rethinking Freire</italic> (2005), which I will also address. First, I support Bowers’ contention that transformative learning theory and practice is founded on some problematic Enlightenment assumptions, but I also challenge his resolutions. Second, I will discuss the Marxian ontology behind Freire’s work that leads Bowers and many other theorists and practitioners to misinterpret his theories and misapply his pedagogy. Third and finally, I shall argue for a careful political economic as well as cultural analysis of each educational context before any pedagogical engagement. Such an analysis is vital for any community seeking sustainability, especially for supporting the self-determination of indigenous societies in a globalized world.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1541344612453880">
<title>Bowers’ Argument</title>
<p>As explicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541344612453880">Mayo (2003)</xref> in the very first issue of this journal, Freire theorized a critical approach to transformative learning that includes a questioning of how and why society functions in the way it does to create mass poverty, the ever-widening gap between North and South, the continued displacement of people globally, the constant rape of the earth for profit, and persistent structures that create social injustice along the fault lines of gender, class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and ability/disability (p. 42). Generally, Bowers argues that this process of radical critique, as part of critical pedagogy, is based on the same Western Enlightenment assumptions that underpin neoliberal globalization and its promotion of a market economy, industrial technology, and consumer lifestyles, which I will contend.</p>
<p>Specifically, the first critique by Bowers is that Freirean transformative learning promotes a way of knowing that is “fundamentally different from the cultural ways of knowing of the indigenous groups” (2005, p. 117). He says that Freire’s ideas undermine the local commons by transforming indigenous ways of knowing, making them more susceptible to economic and technological globalization, and thereby contributing to the loss of traditional ecological knowledge systems and thus to environmental degradation. In this way, Bowers considers Freire to be impositional by promoting one universal approach to knowledge, and to be reductionist using a Western-centric definition for what it means to reach “full humanity.”</p>
<p>The second critique by Bowers is that globalization and the market mentality require a form of transformative learning and thus, industrial culture is not a conservative force as often theorized by critical pedagogues, but a liberal force utilizing transformation to perpetuate Western hegemony. He suggests that Freirean practitioners are complicit in Western liberalism because they consider industrialism to be a conservative force rather than “transforming” force as Bowers contends (2005, p. 118). Therefore, Bowers insists that critical pedagogy neither has the conceptual basis for a more fundamental critique of neoliberal globalization and its destructiveness, nor the vocabulary for supporting learners in renewing traditional knowledge that will protect the commons.</p>
<p>His third critique is that transformative learning promotes anomic individualism which is implicit in ideas of autonomy and critical reflection, undermining intergenerational spiritual and moral traditions. For Bowers, Freire’s ideas are ethnocentric and universalist, as they work to reduce cultural/linguistic diversity; the diversity that encodes intergenerational ecological knowledge.</p>
<p>His fourth critique is that Freire has an essentialist “penchant for interpreting cultural differences as representing different stages in the evolutionary development of cultures” (2005, p. 119). For Bowers, Freire’s theory of conscientization implies a unilineal approach to knowledge aligned with Western notions of progressivism.</p>
<p>The fifth and final critique by Bowers is that Freire and his followers have not been critical of the banking nature of their political agenda and how this restrictive agenda ignores the importance of natural systems and maintaining the commons as nonprivatized and noncommodified. Bowers remains doubtful of Gadotti’s assertions that Freire was developing an ecopedagogy near the end of his life that would have made him a “pioneer environmental thinker” (2005, p. 119).</p>
<p>In summary, Bowers charges that Freire is a “reactionary” and a “western thinker” with “oppressive” ideas. He charges Freirean followers and critical pedagogues of being “critical theory fundamentalists.” While Bowers has been a long-time critic of Freire, self-professed since 1983, he most recently uses articles by various Southern theorist–practitioners in his edited book <italic>Rethinking Freire </italic>(2005) to support his contention that Freire’s pedagogy constitutes cultural invasion. I turn now to examine these critiques, including the Enlightenment roots of transformative learning, the Marxian roots of Freire’s pedagogical theory, and Freirean pedagogy in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1541344612453880">
<title>The Enlightenment Roots of Transformative Learning</title>
<p>As a practitioner and scholar of critical transformative learning for over 20 years, particularly in international development and sustainability education, I agree with Bowers’ primary argument that transformative learning, whether practiced in the Northern or Southern hemispheres, is founded on some problematic Enlightenment assumptions. However, various social theorists have proposed important antidotes to these assumptions that return the Enlightenment assumptions to their intellectual origins; these ideas cannot be dismissed.</p>
<p>The most notable Enlightenment idea assumed by transformative learning theory is the liberal belief in the primacy of individual judgment for determining issues of conscience and definitions of the good life. Modern thought privileges the responsibility of each citizen for deciding how to live with others in society, through a conscious contractual relationship. In the often uncritical use of “critical reflection” and even of “ideology critique” from critical pedagogy, transformative learning does perpetuate this ideal of individual sovereignty and it’s authority over traditional/institutional authorities.</p>
<p>However, as Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541344612453880">Taylor (1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541344612453880">1991</xref>) has traced, the original notion of individualism was part of a rigorous morality that understood self-truth as embedded in a larger social responsibility. Individualism was meant to rest on the moral ideal that the individual would take the reflective time necessary to be connected to their inner moral voice and from this basis determine what kind of society they wished to live in, and then to participate in creating that social vision. This concept is what the practice of Western democracy is founded on. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541344612453880">Taylor (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541344612453880">Lasch (1991)</xref> have both suggested that this socially rooted understanding of individualism has only recently become trivialized and vulgarized, through a moral subjectivization (nothing beyond me matters) and a narcissistic self-absorption (my self-fulfillment is primary). They both promote a return to a socially embedded understanding of individualism.</p>
<p>I also agree with Bowers’ critique that transformative learning is founded on the key Enlightenment assumption of progress (2005, p. 157), which privileges change over tradition and even reifies change. Change as an Enlightenment concept originally meant the rejection of all medieval strictures—specifically feudal cosmology, the corrupt despotism of divine right monarchy, agrarianism, superstition, oppressive religious dogma, the constant slaughter of war, and the suffocating nature of tradition—as well as the unfettered faith in change as betterment. “Transformation” has been embraced by the modernist project because it was considered the most radical, complete form of change and thus the most advanced form of “betterment.”</p>
<p>Originally, change did not imply progress as we understand it now. Rather, the concept of “change” was transmogrified into the powerful concept of “progress,” connected to a sense of linearity or rather an ascending trajectory toward a utopian form. In this view, every change cumulatively builds on previous changes, each stage is an advancement, change is an inevitability, and only human agency can accelerate this otherwise evolutionary process (Sztompka, 1993). We now know the pretension of universality implicit in the notion of progress as well as its Western-centric definitions of a good life, and its promotion of unlimited growth—culminating in neoliberal economic globalization—that fails to recognize social and environmental limits. It is also true that some proponents of transformative learning have not been aware or critical of these implications within their practice.</p>
<p>There is now a profound questioning of the central Enlightenment tenets within social theory, particularly of progress and its impact on the modern era. Nevertheless, a number of social theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541344612453880">Lasch, 1991</xref>; Sztompka, 1993) suggest that the concept of change can be rehabilitated, through the reintroduction of the notion of limits and the reintroduction of hope. The notions of limits and hope can reintroduce moral demands, acknowledge the importance of spiritual disciplines for a larger horizon of meaning, affirm the natural cycles of regress and decay as well as growth, and reorient us to an enspirited cosmology that moves beyond scientific materialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344612453880">Keohane, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541344612453880">Lasch, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541344612453880">Taylor, 1989</xref>). Within the field of transformative learning, I myself have critiqued the contemporary idea that the deepest, most sedimented ideas of individuals and societies necessarily need to be disturbed and transformed. In my empirical research, I found that restoring some ideas and ethics to their rightful place proved to be an important learning process that accompanied the process of transformation, both dynamics challenging current dominant cultural values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541344612453880">Lange, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, I agree with Bowers’ argument that transformative learning has often promoted a rationalist way of knowing. Kant’s idea of enlightenment was for individuals to emerge from intellectual immaturity using their rational-thinking processes to think for themselves, without relying on the authority of “entrenched guardians”—religious leaders to give spiritual answers, doctors to give medical answers, politicians to give governance answers, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541344612453880">1784/1983</xref>). Through reasoned thought in an educational context, Kant expected that individuals would develop moral ideas as well as moral qualities—generosity, strength of will, and self-control—thus attaining full human dignity.</p>
<p>As several theorists suggest, rationalism is primarily a method of thinking but, over time, was cut loose from any sense of external moral purpose or standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541344612453880">Borgmann, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541344612453880">Ralston Saul, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541344612453880">Taylor, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541344612453880">Borgmann (1992)</xref> calls this the amoral triumph of procedure over substance. This instrumentalism can sidestep value judgments, notions of the common good, and moral or political imperatives. It can lead to treating each other with means-ends efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344612453880">Briton, 1996</xref>, p. 8). We know that rationalism can marginalize other ways of knowing, by gender or culture, and that it also sidelines extrarational capacities, such as intuitive or spiritual ways of knowing. Max Weber concluded that rationalism culminated in the “disenchantment of the universe,” where higher principles, heroism, mysteries, and spiritualities no longer matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541344612453880">Gerth &amp; Mills, 1946</xref>) and where the system world of technocracies and bureaucracies colonize the lifeworld, creating high levels of social conformity or “one-dimensionality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541344612453880">Habermas, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541344612453880">Marcuse, 1964</xref>).</p>
<p>However, a rational-thinking process is necessary and vital for human thinking, whether to debate the weaknesses of theories themselves (as Bowers utilized in his critique of Freire) or to discern ethical implications, analyze ideologies, and recognize the limits of human agency and rationalism themselves. The critique of rationalism has already spawned much writing in the area of transformative learning. Early attempts to transcend the typical binaries between secular and sacred, material and spiritual, and culture and spirit to move toward a more holistic approach can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541344612453880">Jarvis and Walters (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541344612453880">English, Fenwick, and Parsons (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541344612453880">Griffin (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541344612453880">Dirkx (1997)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541344612453880">Tisdale (2003)</xref>. Many indigenous scholars have attempted to detail an indigenous research methodology that affirms the importance of rationalism but also respects traditional knowledge and indigenous ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344612453880">Grande, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1541344612453880">Stewart-Harawira, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541344612453880">Tuhiwai Smith, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, while transformative learning is founded on some key assumptions from the Enlightenment that are problematic, various theorists have proposed that we reclaim the original intentions and richer concepts of individualism, rationalism, and change, prior to their vulgarization and trivialization, as well as reintroduce extrarational ways of knowing, the notion of limits and hope. Important to this article is the question of whether the problematic forms of these concepts are present in Freire’s thought.</p>

<title>Freire’s Theorizing and Marxist Ontology</title>
<p>What is so interesting is that Bowers’ critique of neoliberal globalization shares the same concerns found in the original theorizing of Karl Marx. Early in the history of industrialism, Marx described alienation as implicit in capitalist production, when he compared the modes of production in feudalism and capitalism. Alienation means to lose contact with or to be estranged, detached, or distanced from a part of one’s life. In other words, it is the condition of alienation where a number of essential ties have been severed from the social whole. Marx understood alienation to be comprised of several elements:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Humans are alienated in their work or life activity because they have no part in deciding what to do or how to do it and are required to work in detrimental, uncreative conditions;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Humans are alienated from their products or what they create as they have no control over what they make or what becomes of it;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Humans are alienated from other humans because of competition and hostility among all groupings in society eliminating a feeling of genuine human community; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Humans are alienated from the natural world by the inorganic conditions of human existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541344612453880">Ollman, 1971</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Marx understood well how the social fabric of communities was frayed and eventually torn apart by the enclosure movement, industrial processes, capitalist forms of waged labour, and the monied economy associated with it. Although contemporary business ideology has attempted to ameliorate these aspects of alienation, the root causes of alienation in the capitalist economy, workplace and in the community, remain untouched. What few theorists have attended to is not only how many humans globally have been distanced from the social mode of their existence, including a sense of community and moral obligations, but from the sources of life as found in the natural world. By reinterpreting the natural world as raw resources for industrial processes, rather than for the satisfaction of human needs including aesthetic and spiritual needs, the natural world has indeed been viewed instrumentally for the accumulation of capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541344612453880">Hart, 1992</xref>, p. 106). The primordial unitive consciousness that existed in many cultures and societies, drawing meaning from the fundamental human relationship with the Earth, was broken. For Marx, life and human dignity included physical and intellectual life, human morality, human activity and enjoyment, and human essence as a totality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541344612453880">Ollman, 1971</xref>, p. 301). When one or more of these essential human capacities are blocked and the potentialities for wholeness are thwarted, then one is alienated from oneself, one’s community, the Earth, and the dignity of work.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this clearer than when we place record corporate profits side by side with dramatic increases in global unemployment and poverty, and place the production of trivial consumer items side by side with escalating hunger and homelessness. This point was recently made by several social movements, including the Occupy Movement in the Fall of 2011, when thousands of citizens occupied key financial districts and undertook social actions in over 1,500 cities globally. Promoting and using participatory democratic processes, they were protesting economically and politically unjust structures, particularly the predatory lending practices that led to the subprime mortgage scandal. This triggered a global financial crisis; yet, the financial elites received record incomes and banks and other multinational corporations received substantial bailouts. The key slogan has been “We are the 99%,” referring to the economic expansion between 2002 and 2007 where the income of the top 1% of Americans grew 10 times faster than the income of the bottom 99%. As critical pedagogues have pointed out, this is the restoration of capitalist class power that has a reinvigorated hostility to public spaces and the democratic impulses of these movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541344612453880">Macrine, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Marx, and Freire as a follower of the early humanitarian Marx, were specifically critiquing industrial capitalism and envisioning a social change process beyond it. It is important to understand the vital differences between a liberal and radical ontology and their theorizing about economic systems, the relations between humans, and the relations between humans and natural systems. Bowers offers a cultural critique developed in depth through his numerous books,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1541344612453880">2</xref>
</sup> but this must be deepened through a political economic analysis, in essence, bridging an idealist and materialist ontology. This connection would help create the unique theoretical ground that environmental and sustainability educators can stand upon. Let me explain.</p>
<p>In 1970, through the publication of <italic>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</italic> Paulo Freire was considered a revolutionary Third World voice disrupting the hegemony of Western educational practice by offering a liberatory pedagogy for the most marginalized and impoverished of Latin American citizens. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541344612453880">Freire (1985)</xref> asserted that education is never neutral, but always political, because learning is positioned within power structures either in a domesticating way or in a liberating way. As a reaction against authoritarian formal schooling, nonformal adult education in its radical form was an approach to adult education that generally worked <italic>against</italic> repression, poverty, oppression, and injustice as well as struggled <italic>for</italic> justice and equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541344612453880">LaBelle, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541344612453880">Vio Grossi, 1981</xref>). Paulo Freire proposed that the task of humanization or “cultural action for freedom” is the fundamental purpose for education. To be fully human is to be critical and creative producers of the conditions of existence, our societies, ourselves and our destinies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541344612453880">Allman &amp; Wallis, 1990</xref>). This concept of liberation arose in Latin American in direct opposition to two realities—the oppressiveness of feudalism in the rural areas and the oppressiveness of modernization in urban areas,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1541344612453880">3</xref>
</sup> both yielding a brutal economic, political, and cultural domination of the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541344612453880">Gutierrez, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541344612453880">Mayo (1999)</xref> points out that Freire certainly had his blind spots and limitations and Schugurensky (2011), discusses the unresolved tensions in his work. They both explain that this was partially due to his social location and to the historical, political–economic and ideological contexts he was working in, and to the eclectic nature of his influences. There has been sustained critique of Freire’s work and much has been written on these blind spots—particularly that Freire required a more extensive class analysis as well as attention to intersecting forms of difference, including by gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and physical ability. He often responded to these criticisms by rethinking his language and his concepts, evidence that he saw his ideas as a work in progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541344612453880">Schugurensky, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1541344612453880">2011</xref>). Feminist poststructuralists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541344612453880">Weiler (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541344612453880">Brady (1994)</xref> acknowledge the historical specificity of Freire’s analysis and are clear that they are working to enrich his work within primarily a Northern context and specifically within a university classroom setting. They extend his contributions by including the concepts of difference, positionality, contingency of truth claims, feeling knowledge, and multiple subjectivities/identities. He has also been critiqued by cultural anthropologists for his portrayal of consciousness development and for using a modernity–tradition dualism that imposes “the logic and values of urban western society,” which Bowers restates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541344612453880">Schugurensky, 1998</xref>, p. 24). Bowers and the other authors in his <italic>Rethinking Freire</italic> volume reiterate issues that have been identified in Freirean literacy training generally, particularly its impact on oral cultures and the languages and knowledge of traditional communities. And now, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541344612453880">Bowers (2005)</xref> specifically offers a critique of his ecological blind spot. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541344612453880">Schugurensky (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1541344612453880">2011</xref>) explains, Freire was open to critique and reconsidering his assumptions, yielding a body of work that was “dynamic” over his lifetime, while retaining a general coherence.</p>
<p>It is true that Freire’s formation remains rooted in Western political thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1541344612453880">Schapiro, 1995</xref>), but while some modernist assumptions are problematic, others hold promise and will have relevance for some time to come. Paula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541344612453880">Allman⁴ (1994)</xref> is adamant that the misappropriation of Freire into practice is not necessarily due to his faulty theorizing, but the lack of understanding of his philosophical roots in Marxism (1999, p. 88). I will contend that Bowers himself is still rooted in Western political thought, demonstrating how difficult it is to transcend the “limit-attitudes” of our historical age even if Bowers claims to do otherwise. More importantly, Bower’s cultural analysis from an idealist position misses the vital importance of a political economic analysis and misunderstands the vital differences between a liberal and radical ontology. Therefore, he is unable to identify the key elements of Freire’s theorizing that clearly distinguish Freire from Western liberalism.</p>
<p>One of the key differences between a liberal and radical ontology revolves around the relation between the individual and community. Carol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344612453880">Gould (1978)</xref> explains that Marx proposed a social<bold> </bold>ontology whereby individuals are fundamentally individuals-in-social-relations rather than liberal autonomous individuals who relate to an external world. For Marx, individuals are constituted by their relations to other humans, to history, to society, and to the Earth. A social ontology, then, is the “study of reality that reflects on the social roots of the conceptions of reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344612453880">Gould, 1978</xref>, p. xv). In other words, our daily movements are informed and shaped by the ideas and concepts that are part of our social world, many of which have originated in the material realities of our lives (including our relation to the living systems that form the life support system for humans). Marx discusses the “commodity fetish,” where we come to desire, even lust after, commodities because we associate their value with their intrinsic properties, never seeing the social and environmental relations embedded in them.</p>
<p>This Marxian ontology is diametrically opposed to the ontology within capitalist free market societies—where reality is composed of separate, atomistic individuals who relate to each other and things in external ways. This is the classical liberal idea of individualism—a person separate from others whose rights are protected by law and whose interactions constitute a society. In contrast, Marx strongly asserted that bourgeois liberal society artificially separates individuals from the community, community from environment, economics from politics, and production from production relations, rather than seeing these phenomena as all internally related, as faces of the same phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541344612453880">Sayer, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541344612453880">Marx (1857)</xref> suggested that politics and economics were conceptually separated in liberal bourgeois thought as a way to dominate without appearing to dominate, through what is now called pastoral power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541344612453880">English &amp; Mayo, 2012</xref>). For instance, as long as people have a vote and a say through their representative in a political democracy, they will not contest injustice and the profound lack of democracy in the economic sphere.</p>
<p>Human freedom in liberalism, then, is about exercising individual choice, notably in the marketplace, with minimal governmental encroachment on individual rights, notably property rights. Macpherson argues that liberal democracy developed only after the capitalist market system was well established, serving to legitimize it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541344612453880">1965</xref>, pp. 9–10). Liberal notions of freedom are illusory, however, as individuals “divest their political power and activity, their choices, their decisions and the execution of political activities, to other people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541344612453880">Allman, 1999</xref>, p. 41). We accept a profound lack of democracy in our economic lives and a desiccated version of political democracy that lacks any deep engagement, given the hegemonic ideologies legitimizing them.</p>
<p>In 1970, Freire was developing his pedagogy with the Brazilian rural poor who were oppressed by large landowners, as well as with the urban poor who had been dispossessed of their land and subsequently urbanized and exploitatively waged (or underwaged/unwaged). His assumption was that both groups had already been enclosed into a capitalist economic system where they had become “beings-for-another” rather than “beings-for-themselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541344612453880">Freire, 1970</xref>, p. 34). They had been subsumed into a system of domination where “the oppressor consciousness tends to transform everything surrounding it into an object of its domination. The earth, property, production, the creations of men [<italic>sic</italic>], men [<italic>sic</italic>] themselves, time—everything is reduced to the status of objects at its disposal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541344612453880">Freire, 1970</xref>, p. 44). Such capitalist social relations create a fatalistic consciousness supported by ideologies convincing the populace that being dominated is natural and inevitable. Freire, then, was not working with indigenous peoples prior to being dispossessed of their land relation or incorporated into Latin American feudalism. They were already subject to the colonizing powers of capitalism.</p>
<p>Of concern to Bowers and most intriguing is Marx’s evolutionary thinking that Freire built upon. Rather than a romantic view of indigenous societies, Marx asserted that relations of domination and inequality still existed in precapitalist societies, even though these societies were classless with communally held land. He discusses precapitalist societies, particularly nonnomadic societies, as often stratified by rank and status and social positions ascribed by birth, and where kinship created dependency and servility among some subgroups. Hegel called this phase <italic>being in itself</italic> where people do not understand themselves as differentiated from others but part of an uncontested unity that subordinates the self to the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344612453880">Gould, 1978</xref>, p. 132).</p>
<p>Marx argued that the next stage of economic change was capitalism—an intrinsically exploitative economic system by taking more labour from workers than it pays for, to create profit. Marx considered capitalism to be a historical necessity in that it develops self-differentiation through the liberal notion of individualism. However, while people differentiate themselves as individuals in liberal democratic capitalist states, it is predicated on an abstract notion of freedom, enshrined in law. They actually remain dependent because they are reliant on wage labour to procure their basic needs. They acquire formal equality through the law but not concrete equality because they remain a “being for another” in the economic realm and within antagonistic relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344612453880">Gould, 1978</xref>, pp. 6–7). The consciousness that emerges is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541344612453880">Freire (1985)</xref> called a naïve transitive consciousness, awakened but easily manipulated, which we see daily in advertising psychology.</p>
<p>Freedom and justice for Marx, then, is moving to a third stage that he anticipated would be “communal individuality”—where there is both concrete and abstract equality. Individuals would become “beings in and for themselves,” where all members are aware of themselves as individuals but self-consciously reroot themselves in their social and natural relations. They transcend the disunity that is fostered through abstract and fragmented liberal notions and achieve a “differentiated unity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344612453880">Gould, 1978</xref>, p. 7), thereby overcoming alienated relations.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would argue that Freire’s work is definitely not aligned with liberal individualism given the Marxian ontology implicit in Freire’s work. Bowers is correct that Freire has a “progressive” orientation but it is via Marx—anticipating a dialectical shift in consciousness as socioeconomic realities change. Both Marx and Freire hold a vision of ultimately overcoming the alienation intrinsic to capitalism and restoring human relationships within community and with the Earth. Therefore, individual self-determination is not the highest form of existence as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541344612453880">Bowers (2005</xref>, p. 139) claims is implicit in Freire’s work, but it is a step toward overcoming the four forms of alienation manifested in capitalist societies. Thus, Freire’s work is also not universalist, except that he encourages the problematization of the effects of capitalist relations in whatever form they may be found. While Freire’s early work was anthropocentric and his environmental concerns undeveloped, his theoretical framework does lend itself to an ecopedagogy as part of a relational ontology.</p>
<p>This argument, using Marxian social ontology to understand some assumptions within Freirean theory, raises some significant questions in relation to indigenous societies. Even though the land may be communally held and consciousness profoundly shaped by kinship/spiritual relations to the land, are there still relations of domination? If there are, is Bowers suggesting these relations of domination must remain intact as part of traditional belief systems? Should injustice be accepted, given that it is traditional? This is a profound conundrum manifested in many societies today, which Bowers conveniently sidesteps.</p>
<p>Maori scholar Linda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541344612453880">Tuhiwai Smith (1999</xref>, 2008) notes that many academics have charged that critical approaches to community development and research have failed, and that, logically, the development of alternative approaches is a resistance to critical theory (p. 186). This is similar to Bowers’ argument that the existence of alternative pedagogies contests the legitimacy of Freirean-informed pedagogies. Rather, Smith argues that the aims of critical theory need to be localized so that groups “take hold of the project of emancipation and attempt to make it a reality in their own terms” (p. 186). She asserts that oppression does not have universal characteristics independent of history, context, and agency, and that attempting to manifest empowerment on the ground has a dirtiness, complexity, and often contradictory nature about it that is often not acknowledged by academics. In her communities, she describes how research needs to emanate out of the connection between the Maori language, knowledge, and culture. Yet, in developing Maori women’s theories, such research does not preclude “question[ing] the accounts of Maori society provided by men, including Maori men, but which still hold to a position that argues that the issues of gender for Maori do not make us the same as white women” (p. 188). Such localized approaches to critical theory seek to understand these issues within the “wider framework of Maori values and attitudes, Maori language, and Maori ways of living in the world” (p. 188). This is in no way contrary to Freire’s way of thinking or educating, but does take it a step further given the historical moment we are in.</p>
<p>Further, an assumption implicit in Bowers’ writing is that indigenous groups are holders of static, pristine knowledge standing outside capitalist relations and therefore serving as a bulwark against the predations of neoliberal globalization. Yet, Bowers is overlooking more than 500 years of colonization and genocide that have systematically denigrated the economic sufficiency, political sovereignty, spiritual knowledge, and social relations of many indigenous societies, reaching a zenith in neoliberal globalization. Freire, like many world systems theorists, considered most societies to already have been penetrated by capitalist political economic relations to some degree. Therefore, a political economic analysis is necessary to understand indigenous realities in various contexts and how best to protect their societies from (further) intrusion. As another Maori scholar Makere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1541344612453880">Stewart-Harawira (2005)</xref> explains, the work of decolonization requires new forms of resistance as well as the re-creation of “traditional indigenous social, political, and cosmological ontologies [that] are profoundly important to the development of transformative alternative frameworks for global order and new ways of being” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1541344612453880">Stewart-Harawira, 2005</xref>, p. xiv). Thus, I agree with Bowers that conserving and restoring indigenous ontologies and epistemologies are important to the global future, but these are being developed dynamically out of the fragments that remain, through the process of decolonization.</p>
<p>Further, Native American Sandy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541344612453880">Grande (1999)</xref> cautions that “the image of Indian as ecologically noble savage has been employed by environmentalists to serve the various needs of that community” . . . thus continuing the domination of Indian peoples, the use of Indigenous knowledge instrumentally as a cultural critique of the “overconsumptive and oppressive frameworks of Western society” that perpetuates Western raced constructions and colonizing knowledges, and to advancing Western careers (pp. 309, 311, 313). As Schwarz asserts, “We [environmentalists] respect their traditions so long as they fit our preconceived notions of what those traditions should be. . .[so]. . .if an Indian shoots an eagle we are outraged” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541344612453880">Grande, 2005</xref>, p. 319). In other words, Grande suggests, it is not indigenous knowledges or societies that will “save” the day, but the restoration of a multiplicity of knowledges, social relations, and forms of engagement—from political resistance, to passive resistance, to simply being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541344612453880">Grande, 2005</xref>, p. 320). This legitimation of other ways of knowing is critical, as is the dynamic process of knowledge restoration that cycles back and moves forward simultaneously, all within a political economic and cultural analysis.</p>
<p>I am arguing, then, that Marxist communal individuality and indigenous relational ontologies can be considered similar phenomena as they honor the social and natural fabric of reality and the unique individual within that fabric. Further, I would argue that the stories told by various educators in the volume <italic>Rethinking Freire</italic> are actually attempting to overcome alienation and create communal individuality, by rerooting humans back into human community and back into relation with the Earth, through local epistemologies, while utilizing the best attributes of individualism, progressive change, and reason. This offers a more nuanced theoretical stance that builds on the strengths of the modern era while reknitting the epistemological and ontological goods lost on the way.</p>
<sec id="section5-1541344612453880">
<title>Applying Freire’s Liberatory Pedagogy</title>
<p>Many years ago in a university classroom, I heard Freire say that each theorist–practitioner needs to assess his or her own context and carry out their own political economic analysis. He said that educators need to work to rethink and reinvent power in their own time and place, a message he oft repeated. In others words, Freire urged practitioners not to universalize his pedagogy in an instrumental way, done one way in all times and places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541344612453880">Schugurensky, 1998</xref>). Freire explains, in several of his books:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>One cannot expect positive results from an educational or political action program which fails to respect the particular view of the world held by the people. Such a program constitutes cultural invasion, good intentions notwithstanding. The starting point for organizing the program content of education or political action must be the present, existential, concrete situation, reflecting the aspirations of the people. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541344612453880">Freire, 1970</xref>, p. 84)</p>
<p>[An educator must] not believe in the myth of the ignorance of the people. . .they cannot sloganize the people, but must enter into dialogue with them. . . Otherwise, education continues to be a form of social manipulation. (1985, p. 159)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When in India, Freire recognized:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Conscientization . . . is a very strong Western concept. The Western tendency is to act upon reality, to confront reality and try to change it. The Indian tendency is to understand history as something in which you lose yourself . . . We have to take into account the cultural differences between East and West. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1541344612453880">Zachariah, 1986</xref>, p. 68)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Despite these cautions, it is likely true that some practitioners have made Freire’s pedagogy into a banking practice. In reviewing the stories of Freirean practitioners in <italic>Rethinking Freire </italic>who subsequently critique his pedagogy, alongside critiques from other educators featured in this journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541344612453880">Hodgkins, 2008</xref>), it is clear that in some cases these practitioners were imbued with Western notions that shaped their use of Freirean pedagogy, as many of us were during the era of development (a critique of my own work can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541344612453880">Lange, 1998</xref>). In India, Siddhartha explains that he considered Freire’s ideas imperialistic as they, “implied that people gave up their own worldview and embraced the one offered by Freire” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541344612453880">Bowers &amp; Apffel-Marglin, 2005</xref>, p. 87). From Mexico, Terán charges Freire with universalism saying, “Educational theories that promote a single universal solution to the pressing social issues of our time foreclose the possibility of finding alternative paths to the good life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541344612453880">Bowers &amp; Apffel-Marglin, 2005</xref>, p. 71). No doubt Freire would have agreed, given his humility and caution about dogma. Our job as educators who respect Freire’s heritage is to think for ourselves and thus reinvent pedagogy in ways that relate best to the context we are working in. Likely, there are forms of injustice, domination, and oppression in most human situations. The goal is to foster inner, interpersonal, and societal transformation that can manifest the better qualities of humankind, create (or preserve) nonalienating and just social conditions, and restore a nonalienated relationship with the Earth. Any number of pedagogies—whether art-based, story-based, or reason-based—are possible (for one example with middle-class people in the Northern hemisphere, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541344612453880">Lange, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In returning to the idea that indigenous communities are the only real resistance to neoliberal globalization, is Bowers suggesting that indigenous societies constitute resistance simply by virtue of their existence, while not being cognizant of their resistance? One response would be to echo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541344612453880">Bauman’s (2001)</xref> contention that being in community is an unconscious act, and by becoming conscious of it, we make the bonds more tenuous and ultimately dissolvable, an important point. Yet, it is not clear if simply continuing to live as a traditional, sustainable community in an unconscious way could adequately be considered resistance to globalization. Does not the choice need to be conscious? Further, can communities live ‘uncontaminated’ by Western society before they need to make choices about the forces that will ultimately come to bear, given the inherent expansionist dynamic within capitalism? This is why a political economic analysis needs to accompany an idealist or cultural analysis, and why “ecology needs Marx” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541344612453880">Gimenez, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Bowers is arguing that indigenous peoples understand themselves to be part of the neoliberal globalization resistance movement, then are they not already conscious of Western ideology and economics and have mastered ideology critique as part of transformative learning via the Enlightenment heritage? In Terán’s chapter, all of the Mexican protagonists were university-trained and in a self-conscious way implemented what they called a vernacular education center. They had overcome the bourgeois concept of individualism by relocating “politics” within their day-to-day lives rather than as a separate sphere of activity, and thus consciously reembedded themselves in their social and environmental relations, similar to the Marxian social ontology. They very purposefully regenerated cultural spaces, reconstructed traditional stories, learned traditional wisdom and knowledge, and lived sustainably from the land—in defiance of expert knowledge and the waged economy. Can it not be argued then, that these community members are manifesting a “communal individuality,” through a critical consciousness of the global significance and local impact of their actions? This is a core contradiction in Bowers’ argument.</p>

<sec id="section6-1541344612453880">
<title>Conclusion: A Contextual Pedagogy for Sustainability Education</title>
<p>In sum, then, I have agreed with Bowers that transformative learning, both critical and Mezirowean streams, are predicated on the problematic Enlightenment concepts of individualism, progress, and rationalism. However, I proposed three different resolutions that return these concepts to their nonvulgarized origins; particularly back to a socially embedded and morally informed understanding of individualism, a concept of progress informed by the notion of limits and hope, and an acknowledgement of rationalism as only one aspect, but a necessary aspect, of human thinking. I explained the historical context that Freire was working in and the critique of Freire’s blind spots by many other scholars, which prompted Freire to continuously push his thinking further, giving his work a dynamic quality while retaining a general coherence in the corpus of his writings. I have demonstrated how Freirean theorizing is predicated on a Marxist social ontology, not on Western liberalism, that acknowledges the four faces of alienation within capitalist societies and proposes that the liberal notion of individualism is a necessary step toward a communal individuality—where humans attain both concrete and abstract equality and where they self-consciously restore nonalienated community relations and noninstrumentalized relations with the Earth. Citing the work of various indigenous scholars, I illustrated how critical forms of transformative learning are being used in the processes of decolonization and in the restoration of traditional knowledges, manifesting I believe, a communal individuality. Finally, despite Freire’s cautions, I illustrate how some practitioners may have used Freirean pedagogy in a banking way, myself included early in my career; this ought to prompt us to always remain skeptical of our own emancipatory projects (St. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541344612453880">Pierre &amp; Pillow, 2000</xref>). Overall, these illustrations and the above arguments are meant to show that Freire’s work does lend itself to an ecopedagogy and that it can be used in ways that honor indigenous social relations and diverse forms of traditional knowledges while remaining vigilant to injustice in any form. It is hoped that this explication contributes to the critical theorizing on transformative learning.</p>
<p>The global challenges facing us today raise the question: What is required of us as educators in this historical moment? Thus, my final critique of Bowers is a pedagogical one. The deep changes in cultural patterns of thinking that Bowers says are needed, include moving to a view of individuals as nested in complex networks of relationships; understanding responsibility in terms of past, present, and future; not understanding technology as culturally neutral or universally progressive; moving away from a commodification of knowledge, skills, and relationships; and moving beyond thinking that non-Western cultures are undeveloped and that each generation must make itself anew. I have appreciated these elements in the work of Chet Bowers. However, Bowers also needs to differentiate his educational agendas. His agenda is to promote a “conserving education” that conserves linguistic/cultural diversity and ecological knowledge. While this may be most appropriate for societies that have been less penetrated by the capitalist system and have more traditional knowledge stores available, Western liberal democratic capitalist societies have been very successful in conserving their structures of injustice, cultural homogenization, and ecological degradation and certainly do not need assistance as they seek to globalize these structures. Thus, Bowers needs to be careful not to universalize his own ideas.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a contextual analysis and dialogue must be carried out in any community, before an educational approach is created. This process needs to ascertain the factors of Western economic and cultural globalization at play as well as determine the unique complexity of social, cultural, and local knowledge capacities available. It also needs to uncover the self-determination goals of the community, for themselves and for surrounding natural systems. Educators can enrich each other’s work by sharing findings around attempting to (re)create sustainable societies in their own communities—the struggle to reweave the social fabric, protect and foster environmental relations, and nurture relational ontologies in anticipation of communal individuality. In this understanding, Freirean transformative learning is not the Trojan horse of globalization or the enemy of sustainability education.</p>
