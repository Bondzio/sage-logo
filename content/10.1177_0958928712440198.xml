<abstract>
<p>This paper argues that immigration has varying implications for attitudes about government redistribution depending on the level at which immigration is experienced. Working in occupations with higher shares of foreign-born employees can raise individual economic insecurities in ways that might overwhelm the way high foreign-born shares of the population can reduce solidarity or increase fiscal burdens. Hence, experiencing more immigration in one’s occupation might more positively affect support for government redistribution than does experiencing more national-level immigration. We test this and other expectations on survey data in 17 European polities, focused on occupational and national measures of immigration. While national-level exposure to foreign-born populations tends to have little effect on support for government redistribution, occupational-level exposure to immigration tends to spur such support. These results suggest that immigration directly influences the politics of inequality, but in ways more complicated than recent scholarship suggests.</p>

<p>Among the most salient issues in contemporary political life are the consequences of immigration for the social and economic health of receiving countries. Such consequences include welfare states and income redistribution to address economic inequalities. Policymakers, media commentators and scholars have all developed arguments about how and whether immigration affects social, economic and political relations in ways that could alter welfare and tax systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928712440198">Nannestad, 2007</xref>). On the one hand, exposure to immigration in one’s country and/or workplace might well undermine social capital or solidarity, or might increase the costs of redistribution efforts, all in ways that might undermine general support for redistribution in industrialized economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928712440198">Eger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928712440198">Freeman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928712440198">Luttmer, 2001</xref>). On the other hand, such exposure might actually increase substitutability of foreign for domestic labour that can increase subjective risks of income loss or unemployment, risks that might in turn increase rather than decrease support for redistribution as a way to indemnify risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928712440198">Finseraas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0958928712440198">van Oorschot, 2008</xref>). The evidence marshalled to adjudicate these competing views has been sparse to date, focusing on how national immigration flows or stocks affect social policy spending – assuming, more often than exploring, the way immigration affects individual or public support for government policies to address redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0958928712440198">Senik et al., 2009</xref>). The few exceptions, meanwhile, focus on national-aggregate measures of immigration, thereby smoothing over the substantial variation within countries as to how immigration can be expected to influence workers and citizens, and hence their support for social policy and redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928712440198">Finseraas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928712440198">Mau and Burkhardt, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This paper explores how immigration affects social policy by directly investigating support for government redistribution as a function of immigration measured at both national and occupational levels. Immigration varies across countries, across communities within countries, and across occupations and sectors of employment. We expect immigration to have offsetting effects for the politics of redistribution, and to have net effects that vary across levels at which immigration is experienced and measured. At any given level at which immigration is experienced, immigration may erode solidarity and social capital and thereby diminish support for income redistribution, while at the same time increasing individual economic insecurities that may nourish such support. We explain how these offsetting conditions can be expected to play out differently for different levels at which immigration is experienced and measured. For instance, variation in exposure to immigration at the level of occupations captures how immigration can spur individual economic risks, but not so much how it affects broad social solidarity or fiscal solvency. Variation in exposure to national-level immigration, however, might well capture the spatial and regional effects of immigration for solidarity and fiscal health while smoothing over or being more distant from individual economic insecurities. We thus expect immigration measured at the level of the occupation to have more net positive implications for support for redistribution than is the case for national-level measures of immigration.</p>
<p>We empirically test these alternative possibilities on European Social Survey (ESS) data on attitudes towards government redistribution of income in 17 European polities. We focus on two measures of exposure to immigration: individual-level exposure to immigration based on data on the share of foreign-born employees in a respondent’s particular occupation; and a country’s exposure to foreign-born residents. We find that occupation-level exposure to immigration tends to spur support for redistribution more strongly than any marginal negative effects of national-level exposure to immigration. These results suggest that immigration is relevant to the politics of inequality, but in ways that are more uneven and complicated than we are often led to believe.</p>
<sec id="section1-0958928712440198">
<title>Literature and argument</title>
<p>Immigration always involves people from abroad settling in one’s country to live and work. Such immigration varies, and is experienced, across countries and communities, and across occupations and sectors of employment. Whatever the level at which immigration is measured or experienced, intuition and existing research provide reasons to expect immigration in some ways to increase and in other ways to decrease support for redistribution.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most common view is that immigration will tend to be bad news for support for government redistribution, owing to plausible economic and social consequences of immigration. The economic consequences are mainly fiscal in nature. Immigrants into European countries tend to be less educated and perform more poorly on standardized tests than the native population into which they move (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928712440198">OECD, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928712440198">2009a</xref>). They tend to find employment, further, in sectors in which unemployment waves with cyclical downturns have been hardest hit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928712440198">OECD, 2009a</xref>). Partly because of these characteristics, foreign-born residents have significantly lower employment rates and higher unemployment rates than their native counterparts though in some countries this pattern is reversed. In late 2008 most European countries for which comparable data are available have seen foreign-born unemployment rates that are much higher (9.1%) than for the native population (5.7%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928712440198">OECD, 2009b</xref>: 72). The spread is highest in the Netherlands and Norway (where foreign-born residents are one and a half times more likely to be unemployed than their native counterparts) and smallest in Poland (where native unemployment is 10% higher than for foreign-born residents).</p>
<p>These socioeconomic characteristics lead quite predictably to higher dependence on many social policy programmes and relatively low contributions to the revenue base, such that immigrants are often seen as net fiscal burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0958928712440198">Gilens, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928712440198">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928712440198">Luttmer, 2001</xref>). Immigrants tend to rely less on contributory transfers and services, such as pension and unemployment programmes financed through payroll taxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712440198">Boeri et.al. 2002</xref>). However, given that immigrants tend to have more children, higher unemployment rates and longer unemployment spells, they tend to rely more than natives on non-contributory government services and welfare programmes – such as social assistance, housing benefits and public schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712440198">Boeri et.al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928712440198">Boeri, 2010</xref>). According to one recent estimate pooling the experiences of nine European Union (EU) countries, migrants are 20% more likely to rely on such non-contributory benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928712440198">Boeri, 2010</xref>: 14). As for net tax contributions, migrants tend to pay a substantially lower share of total revenue than their native counterparts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928712440198">Boeri (2010)</xref> calculates that in nine countries surveyed, migrants pay on average only 57% of the level proportional to their share of the population – that number being most downward skewed in Nordic countries (30% in Finland and Norway) and least in Spain (where immigrants pay slightly more than their share of total revenue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928712440198">Boeri, 2010</xref>: 658). What this all means for net fiscal burden or contribution is difficult to judge, given the offsetting reliance on contributory and non-contributory programmes. Studies have varied substantially in their estimates of such net contributions, though for European countries the majority have found a modest net burden, particularly recently, though mostly less than 1% of average national gross domestic product (GDP) (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928712440198">Fehr et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0958928712440198">Rowthorn, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In any event, the end result for opinion is that pluralities of European polities surveyed consider immigrants to contribute less in taxes than they receive in social benefits (47.3%) and that they are bad for the economy as a whole (38.6%). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928712440198">Hanson et al. (2005)</xref> find evidence that such sentiments are related: the higher the costs of immigration in settings where redistributive policies are burdened by immigrants, the lower the support for immigration in such settings, compared with those with policies that are less generous.</p>
<p>The reality or belief that immigrants pose a net fiscal burden, particularly with respect to skewed dependence on non-contributory social policy benefits, may stoke concern about the economy and about the economic sustainability of government redistribution in particular. Hence, more immigration might well tend to lower support for government redistribution, all other things equal, out of concern for the latter’s higher net cost or risk under high immigration conditions.</p>
<p>Separate from such fiscal calculations, immigration might also lower support for government redistribution as a result of more social implications. There are good reasons to hypothesize, and some empirical evidence, that polities experiencing more immigration tend to experience feelings of difference and interact less with one another, even among their own ethnic or regional group. Such findings motivate the expectations and findings of some that immigration, particularly that which might constitute ethnic heterogeneity, may lower feelings of solidarity, trust and levels of social capital. This is now a matter of fierce theoretical and empirical debate (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928712440198">Banting et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928712440198">Hooghe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712440198">Crepaz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0958928712440198">Putnam, 2007</xref>). The possibility that immigration is bad news for solidarity is real, however. If so, immigration could spell problems for support for government redistribution, as trust and solidarity are significantly positively related to support for redistribution and social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928712440198">Alesina and Glaeser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0958928712440198">van Oorschot and Uunk, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In any event, there is also evidence that native groups in Europe tend to see immigrants as less deserving of social benefits and protections than other groups, such as the elderly, disabled or unemployed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0958928712440198">van Oorschot, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0958928712440198">van Oorschot and Uunk, 2007</xref>). Such attitudes imply that increasing immigration could emphasize a proportionate rise in the ‘undeserving’, plausibly sapping support for redistribution – and particularly whether this should be combined with disproportionate reliance on social policy, as appears common.</p>
<p>Whatever the particular logic, a number of empirical studies suggest a broadly negative link. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0958928712440198">Soroka et al. (2006)</xref> find aggregate evidence that higher proportions of foreign-born people in the population tend to decrease growth in social policy spending. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928712440198">Alesina and Glaeser (2004)</xref> find that ethnic heterogeneity tends to correlate negatively with support for redistribution. More directly relevant to our concerns, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928712440198">Mau and Burkhardt (2009)</xref> find that European countries with higher proportions of foreign-born residents, and particularly higher proportions of non-western foreign-born residents, tend to be less supportive of government redistribution. Finally, other studies considering possible interactions between immigration and host country attitudes or social policy conditions also paint broadly negative portraits of the social policy implications of immigration for redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928712440198">Finseraas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0958928712440198">Senik et al., 2009</xref>). Such evidence, combined with the fiscal and social reasoning above, support a first hypothesis, coinciding with what has been called the ‘efficiency hypothesis’ in literature on globalization and the welfare state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928712440198">Arts and Gelissen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928712440198">Alesina and Glaeser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0958928712440198">van Oorschot and Uunk, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Hypothesis 1 (efficiency hypothesis). Higher levels of immigration into a country or a particular occupation within a country ought to increase fiscal costs of redistribution and/or diminish social trust and solidarity in a polity, thereby decreasing support for government redistribution.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There are, however, well-established reasons in the literature on international political economy to expect the opposite effect – where immigration spurs rather than constrains support for solidarity and government redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712440198">De Beer and Koster, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928712440198">Finseraas, 2008</xref>). These reasons are associated with the well-studied distributional economic consequences of immigration. The Stolper–Samuelson or specific-factor Ricardo–Viner models, which focus on factor or sector profiles underlying international economic movements, expect factor–price equalization to result from migration as well as from goods and capital. It does not matter to factor–price equalization whether we are referring to trade that moves jobs to people or immigration that moves people to jobs. Both should yield factor–price equalization, including convergence of wages and working conditions between the labour markets that send and receive migrants. In Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries where the scarce factor tends to be un- and semi-skilled workers, and the abundant factors tend to be skilled workers and capital, the expected consequences of higher immigration should be up-skilling. This would imply a higher labour supply of un- and semi-skilled workers, and hence lower wages and poorer working conditions, and higher risks of unemployment and income loss among these groups. This implies stronger interest in and support for redistribution to indemnify against such risks for un- and semi-skilled workers – but less for skilled workers and capital owners. Such effects, however, are likely to be moderated by the degree to which immigration takes place among countries with similar factor profiles and to the extent that effects on consumer–product prices are skewed to benefit lower-income workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0958928712440198">Baker, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Separate from such effects for levels of labour supply and demand, however, is how immigration, like other faces of globalization, tends to increase elasticity of labour supply and demand – regardless of the relative factor profiles of sending and receiving countries. The effects are thus likely to involve increased income and employment insecurities regardless of skill level of the workers in the immigration-receiving countries. These conditions suggest that immigration, like other faces of globalization, might increase insecurities that spur support for government interventions.</p>
<p>In fact, there are reasons to expect immigration to have sharper effects on support for government redistribution than other faces of globalization. First, and most modestly, is that it is likely that immigration affects a broader swath of occupations and sectors than do trade and investment – at least in the short and medium term. Migrants move to jobs in tradable as well as non-tradable sectors. Their effects on the level and elasticity of labour demand thereby can spread more quickly than those of other faces of globalization whose workings move primarily through trade flows’. Related to this is that the physical presence of migrants in workplaces is likely to lead to a stronger, more palpable presence of globalization pressures. This might increase the salience and perception of incumbent workers of the globalization pressures.</p>
<p>Second, as already alluded to, immigrants applying to European countries tend to have a lower skill profile than the native workers for whom they are substitutes. This is captured, among other ways, by how native populations in European countries have higher overall education on average (lower share of primary and higher percentage of secondary and somewhat higher tertiary education) than their foreign-born populations – more so than in non-European OECD countries (see, for example, Table 3.1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928712440198">OECD, 2008</xref>: 82–83). For instance, the proportion of the working-age foreign-born population with lower than upper secondary education averages 35% for the EU-25, almost 10 percentage points higher than the 25% for the native population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928712440198">OECD, 2009a</xref>: 128). Such a skew, moreover, has got worse in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928712440198">Boeri, 2010</xref> 18, Table 6). These conditions suggest more problems for lower-skilled workers, owing to the factor–price equalization that such skewed immigration can unleash. Such a skew shows up in studies comparing immigration and trade effects on wages, where the effects of migration on up-skilling and on less-skilled wages is seen to be stronger for migration than for trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928712440198">Borjas, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928712440198">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0958928712440198">Okkerse, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, foreign-born workers diminish the capacity to bargain to dampen factor–price equalization. This goes beyond the substitutability of foreign for native workers, or the lower income or longer work-day backgrounds of immigrants. It includes also the possibility that foreign-born employees tend to be more difficult to organize and easier for employers to pressurise than native workers on the whole. Foreign-born workers tend to be less familiar with regulations and rights, in more non-standard working contracts and paid less, and come from groups with higher unemployment. They themselves, or their families, often have precarious legal positions that may make them somewhat more docile in their dealings with employers. To be sure, we have only modest empirical work on this matter, but there are many anecdotal examples and some research to support this expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928712440198">Camarota, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712440198">Newman and Lennon, 1995</xref>). These conditions lead to a situation where workers put at greater risk by immigration might be handicapped in their attempts to address such risks in workplace by bargaining on wages and working conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928712440198">Burgoon and Raess, 2011</xref>). This is likely to mean that workers will turn more readily to the government to provide some external support for income and employment risks; hence, greater support for government policies entailing redistribution.</p>
<p>These considerations motivate the following, second hypothesis, coinciding with what, in the globalization literature, has been referred to as the ‘compensation hypothesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0958928712440198">Rodrik, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Hypothesis 2 (compensation hypothesis). Higher levels of immigration into a country or a particular occupation within a country ought to increase economic risks of workers, increasing support for government redistribution to address such risks.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both of these competing hypotheses may obtain for any given level at which immigration is experienced – at the workplace, city, regional or national level. The compensation hypothesis expects economic risks of immigration to spur subjective risks and support for public indemnification from such risks, such that countries that have more immigration, as well as occupations within countries that have more immigration, ought to have residents more supportive of redistribution. The efficiency hypothesis expects fiscal costs and sapped solidarity in ways that occupations as well as countries with more immigration ought to have people less supportive of redistribution. The implicit null hypothesis, of course, is that the pressures highlighted by the compensation and efficiency hypotheses negate one another such that higher numbers of foreign-born people tend to have no significant net effect on support for redistribution. At stake for all these hypotheses, in any event, is whether the implications for individual economic risk dominate or are dominated by the implications for solidarity and fiscal burden. For now, we treat this as an empirical rather than a theoretical question, at whatever level immigration is measured and experienced.</p>
<p>We do, however, expect that the intervening conditions implicated by the competing hypotheses are more or less relevant for a given level at which immigration is experienced. The compensation hypothesis (Hypothesis 2) emphasizes how immigration might influence individual economic risks associated with exposure to the competition from immigrants in the workplace. It thus stands to reason that differences in immigration shares across such workplaces within countries will most directly capture the effects underlying that hypothesis: even a country with cross-nationally modest immigration will have variation in foreign-born shares of employment in different occupations or sectors, where possible increased economic insecurities of workers might show up. National-level variation in immigration will do so less, we suspect, because it will tend to smooth over the individual economic effects or, in any event, be distant from the economic experiences relevant to such insecurities. On the other hand, the possibilities that immigration poses fiscal burdens or diminishes social solidarity are less likely to be as strong in those occupations with higher foreign-born shares than in regional or fiscal entities such as nation states, where fiscal and solidarity conditions are more palpable and politically relevant.</p>
<p>Hence, variation in immigration across occupation-years ought to make the compensation hypothesis (Hypothesis 2) hold more than the efficiency hypothesis (Hypothesis 1), while at the level of the nation the pattern ought to be the opposite (the efficiency hypothesis holding more than the compensation hypothesis). The observable implication is quite simple: higher levels of immigration into a particular occupation ought to increase economic insecurities more, and affect fiscal costs of redistribution and/or diminish social trust and solidarity less, than higher levels of immigration into a country. Hence our final, synthesizing hypothesis.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Hypothesis 3 (synthesizing hypothesis). Higher occupation-level immigration should more substantially increase (or less substantially decrease) support for government redistribution than does higher country-level immigration.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section2-0958928712440198">
<title>Survey evidence in Europe</title>
<p>We test these expectations on a cross-sectional dataset of individual attitudes in Europe, combining the four waves of the ESS with fine-grained occupational-level data on immigration from the OECD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712440198">ESS, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928712440198">OECD, 2008</xref>). The subset of the resulting dataset comprises countries from between one and four waves of the ESS (in 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008) for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. This dataset is particularly suitable for testing the arguments above because it harbours substantial national and individual variation in support for government redistribution over at least a modest time period, and provides the broadest cross-section of countries and individual economic information to study in detail the consequences of international migration.</p>

Government redistribution in practice occurs via some combination of more or less progressive taxation, including negative income taxes, and the provision of various aspects of the welfare state, including some mix of income transfers or social services. We interpret the question to be addressing the broad principle of redistribution, involving either no practical considerations or considerations of some combination of the specific tax or spend provisions.</p>
<p>The grand mean for <italic>Support redistribution</italic> for all four waves is 3.82 (standard deviation 1.04), suggesting that a significant majority of Europeans support government redistribution of income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0958928712440198">2</xref></sup> Such support, however, varies substantially over time and across countries, as is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0958928712440198">Figure 1</xref>. This figure shows the percentage of national sample populations to support or strongly support redistribution (with <italic>Support redistribution</italic> scores of 4 or 5) in 2002 and 2008. Here, national means range from a low of 0.41 in Denmark in 2008 to a high of 0.92 in Greece in the same year. Such a distribution is a reminder that respondent support for government redistribution is likely to be influenced, at least in part, by existing levels of inequality and/or actual redistribution. The over-time developments captured in these data also suggest significant changes in support for redistribution, averaging out as a very modest decline (an average decline of two percentage points), but significant differences across countries – for instance, where Norway experienced a drop in support of 10 percentage points, and Austria an increase in four percentage points.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0958928712440198">3</xref></sup></p>

<p>Our principal explanatory variables are measures of exposure to international immigration. We focus on two measures, in line with the arguments surveyed above. The first is a fine-grained measure of a respondent’s exposure to immigration in his or her occupation. This is based on a respondent’s ESS-coded occupation, based on main job and qualification, coded at the four-digit level from the ISCO-88 classification. For 17 of the sample countries, the OECD International Migration Database supplies cross-nationally comparable information on the number of foreign-born and native employees for each occupation, at the three-digit level of ISCO-88 classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928712440198">OECD, 2008</xref>). This is the most fine-grained information on such immigration exposure of which we are aware – much more so, for instance, than the OECD’s or EU’s sector-based information. This measure allows us to concord the OECD immigration and ESS occupation data on a one-to-one basis for each respondent to be able to measure the foreign-born proportion of total employment in each respondent’s occupation (yielding more than 200 different occupational categories per country). This measure, <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> allows a judgement of how workplace-related exposure to immigration affects support for government redistribution. Unfortunately, the data on people who are foreign-born from particular regions or countries of birth are much sparser – unavailable for enough country-occupations to offer substantial within-country variation. The sample distribution for basic <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic>, in any event, averages 0.087 (i.e. 9%) and is highly dispersed (standard deviation 0.096), ranging from 0 for public administrators in Poland to 1.0 (i.e. 100%) for a few respondents employed as ships’ hands and helpers in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>The second measure we consider is the number of each nation’s <italic>foreign-born in country</italic>, as a percentage of the population, based on data from the OECD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928712440198">OECD, 2009a</xref>). We considered and report results corresponding to each wave of the survey but lagged by one year. This measure is preferable to alternatives such as asylum seekers, immigration flows, non-citizens, or net migration, because it allows us to directly compare the national-level results with those by occupation, and because it has better country coverage and is less sensitive to nationally varying differences in measurement than other measures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0958928712440198">4</xref></sup> This measure is, of course, much more aggregated than <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic>. It does, however, capture the levels of migration faced by an entire socio-economy and polity, an aspect of immigration that is focused on the mix of residents as opposed to employed workers, and hence captures plausibly different social and distributional consequences to someone’s exposure to foreign-born workers via occupation. This is particularly true to the extent that many foreign-born people in a country do not work or are concentrated in particular occupations or sectors. In any event, the two measures are strongly positively correlated, as can be seen by taking the country averages of <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> and setting this against <italic>foreign-born in nation.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0958928712440198">Figure 2</xref> provides this snapshot, revealing the strong positive correlation (<italic>R</italic>-squared = 0.98), even if the outliers of Luxembourg and Switzerland are excluded from the comparison (<italic>R</italic>-squared = 0.89).</p>

<p>As controls we include a range of individual and (for some models) national parameters that plausibly influence both support for government redistribution and <italic>ex ante</italic> shares of foreign-born people in the population and economy. Most of these controls vary at the level of the individual respondent. <italic>Age</italic> in number of years can be expected to affect economic interests in and values towards government redistribution and work orientation. <italic>Female</italic> gender captures occupational selection and has long been found to spur support for social policy interventions and redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928712440198">Orloff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0958928712440198">Rehm, 2009</xref>). <italic>Education</italic> affects occupational selection and conditions whether respondents are likely to be net beneficiaries or benefactors of redistribution. <italic>Household income</italic> has direct implications for work choices and for redistribution, and as a possible consequence of immigration patterns will tend to lead us to understate implications of such immigration patterns for attitudes on redistribution. <italic>Foreign-born</italic> addresses interests in redistribution and controls for possible composition effects of respondents (where respondents are themselves foreign-born rather than reflecting the economic consequences of being in occupations or nations exposed to higher foreign-born shares). <italic>Married</italic> respondents have income sources and responsibilities that affect work choices and social policy attitudes. <italic>Union member</italic> captures organizational interest that affects redistributive attitudes. We also include a dummy for whether respondents are currently full-time <italic>employed.</italic></p>
<p>In addition to these individual-level controls, we also consider occupation-level controls to address the possibility that occupation-level variation in foreign-born employees might be a function of background occupational characteristics. For instance, foreign-born employees may tend to cluster in less-protected occupations with high rates of non-standard contracts that themselves foster support for redistribution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0958928712440198">5</xref></sup> To address such possibilities we include two control variables that can be constructed from Eurostat’s <italic>Labour Force Survey</italic> data on the proportion of <italic>temporary workers in occupation</italic> and the proportion of <italic>part-time workers in occupation</italic>, respectively, which can be constructed at the one-digit level of ISCO-88 occupational categories for all 17 sample countries and four survey years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712440198">Eurostat, 2011a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928712440198">b</xref>). More importantly, we also consider dummies for all 10 ISCO-88 occupations, capturing the effects of any other unobserved features of occupation that might obscure the influence of occupation-level exposure to immigration.</p>
<p>Finally, for those estimations of the effects of aggregate <italic>foreign-born in nation</italic> we also consider the role of two national-level controls. <italic>Ex ante social spending</italic> (as a percentage of GDP) helps control for the possibility of diminishing marginal returns to redistribution. Similarly, we consider the effects of <italic>ex ante</italic> inequality, measured using pre-tax and transfer <italic>Inequality</italic> via Gini-index scores.</p>

<title>Estimation strategy</title>
<p>We fit two sets of models to consider the three hypotheses. The first focuses on the effects of the number of foreign-born people in occupation, taking full advantage of the substantial within-country variation. These allow us to include country dummies to capture many otherwise unmeasured differences across national settings that might influence immigration patterns and attitudes towards redistribution. For these models, coefficients are estimated using ordered probit and the standard errors are robust-cluster ‘sandwich’, clustered by occupation to account for occupation-specific clustering of errors. The second estimator considers not only the within-country variation across occupations in the share of the foreign-born population but also the share of the foreign-born population at the national level. Ignoring the multilevel nature of the data violates the assumption of independent errors and can lead to an underestimation of the standard errors associated with contextual variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0958928712440198">Steenbergen and Jones, 2002</xref>). To address such problems, we fit random-intercept-random-coefficient models, grouped by nation and with nationally varying and occupation-varying coefficients for the individual-level measure of exposure to immigration. For both sets of estimations, we consider three specifications: one for the 2002 wave of the ESS data (most closely matching the occupation-level immigration data); one for the (most recent) 2008 wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928712440198">ESS, 2008b</xref>); and one pooling all four waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712440198">ESS, 2008a</xref>). In addition to these models, we considered and discuss below a range of sensitivity and robustness tests, as well as tests of possible mechanisms linking immigration to position-taking on redistribution.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928712440198">Table 1</xref> summarizes the main results. The first three models focus only on the effects of <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic>, in three specifications of ordered probit estimation with country dummies. The controls perform broadly in line with expectations. Hence, respondents who are older, female, foreign born and union members tend to be more supportive of government redistribution than their counterparts. Those working in occupations with high proportions of part-time workers and of temporary workers tend also to be more supportive, particularly in models taking account of all four survey waves. More educated, wealthier, married and employed respondents tend to be less supportive of redistribution. Year, country and occupational dummies are very highly jointly significant (results not shown).</p>

<p>The main results involve how respondents in occupations with higher shares of foreign-born workers tend to be more supportive of government redistribution, net of the above controls. The substantive size of this effect is stable across waves of the survey: weakest in the 2002 wave of the survey and strongest in the most recent 2008 survey. In substantive terms, however, the spurring effect remains modest whatever the specification. This can be seen best by counterfactual estimation, such as that summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0958928712440198">Figure 3</xref>. There we show the predicted probabilities of strongly or somewhat supporting government redistribution, based on model 1, as one moves through the sample distribution of <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> but holding other parameters at their means or medians. The full range in <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> predicts a rise from 0.8 to 0.87 in the probability of supporting government redistribution. More concretely, we can compare the effects of moving from the 50th to the 99th percentile in the sample distribution of immigration in one’s occupation. The 50th percentile is a foreign-born share of occupational employment of 0.05, roughly equivalent to Austrian secretaries and keyboard operating clerks. Respondents exposed to this level of immigration are predicted by the model to have an 81% chance of supporting government redistribution. Moving to high exposure at the 99th percentile (0.047 or 47% of occupational employment) – the equivalent of Swiss office and hotel cleaners – should yield an 84% chance of somewhat or strongly supporting redistribution. This is modest, of course, but given the significant majorities across countries and time who support redistribution, the distribution explained by <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> is meaningful.</p>

<p>Models 4–6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928712440198">Table 1</xref> summarize how the effects of <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> compare with those for <italic>foreign-born in nation.</italic> These are random-intercept and random-coefficient ordered-probit models, grouped by country. The results for <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> are similar in terms of substantive size to those for the ordered-probit models with country dummies. Again, we see that increase in occupational exposure to immigrants is statistically significant but modest in spurring support for government redistribution. At the same time, however, the <italic>foreign-born share in nation</italic>, to which this occupational pattern is at least partly related, appears to have no significant effect: higher foreign-born shares of the total national population correlate negatively but not significantly with support for government redistribution. As both <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> and <italic>foreign-born in nation</italic> are in the same units, the coefficients can be directly compared. In these data, hence, it is clear that <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> has a much larger positive effect, substantively, than is true for immigration experienced at the national level.</p>
<p>This paradoxical result for immigrants as workers in occupations, versus immigrants as residents in nations, may be odd. It is, however, broadly consistent with some of the expectations developed above. The evidence is consistent with the view that immigration at the level of the occupation spurs individual economic insecurities, which makes workers more likely at the margin to support some public indemnification of such risks – through government redistribution. This supports Hypothesis 2. Certainly within a country, those in higher-immigration occupations ought to be, all other things being equal, more supportive of government redistribution. At the same time, the evidence is also consistent with the view that foreign-born shares of a nation’s population could affect the sentiments of the same workers in the opposite direction – affecting social attitudes or economic calculations in ways that dampen any spurring effects on support for redistribution. Such national-level patterns, however, support neither Hypothesis 1 nor Hypothesis 2: those in countries with more immigration are neither less nor more likely to support redistribution than those in lower-immigration nations, all other things being equal. Finally, these contrasting patterns between the occupational and the national levels of immigration, involving the same kind of measure (foreign-born workers or citizens), provide a strong version of support for Hypothesis 3.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the occupational and national levels do appear to operate distinctly from one another. We have established this by considering whether foreign-born people as a proportion of the national population interacts with the proportion of foreign-born workers as a share of occupational employment. In all of the reported specifications, the interaction was statistically insignificant. Stated differently, at high or low levels of occupational exposure to immigration, rising national immigration tends to have no significant effect on support for redistribution. At either high or low levels of national immigration, occupational exposure of immigration tends to spur support for redistribution (results not shown but available upon request). For instance, based on model 6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928712440198">Table 1</xref>, we can estimate the effects of moving from occupations with low levels of foreign-born persons to those with high levels of foreign-born workers, such as comparing attitudes of secondary school teachers, an occupation with low levels of immigrant employees, with those of hotel workers, which has high levels of immigrant workers. Within a country like Poland, which has the sample’s lowest foreign-born people as a share of the national population (1.6%), such an increase involves going from occupational exposure of 0.9% of foreign-born employees to 4.1%, and this predicts a modest increase in the chance of strongly supporting government redistribution: from 31.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.7–41.5%) to 34.3 (95% CI: 25.8–43.2%). Within a high-immigration country like Luxembourg, the same shift in occupational immigration would involve moving from 3.4% to 72% foreign-born employees, predicting a slightly stronger increase in strongly supporting redistribution: 15.2% chance (from 7% to 25.2%) among the (relatively) low levels of immigrant-worker occupations, and 16.6% (from 7.2% to 24.7%) chance of strongly supporting redistribution. Hence, immigration experienced in one’s occupations and in one’s nation simply play out differently with respect to support for redistribution.</p>
<p>This means that immigration has complicated implications for social policy and redistribution. For instance, working as a hotel worker in Luxembourg rather than as a public-school teacher in Poland involves exposure to immigration that may have contradictory implications for support for redistribution. On the one hand, one will be more prone to economic risks and favourable to some compensatory redress by virtue of the occupational status, but the implications for solidarity and fiscal burdens might make one more sceptical about such redress. As the effects of national-level immigration are so much more modest substantively than those of immigration experienced at the level of occupations, the net pattern constitutes more support for Hypothesis 2 than Hypothesis 1. In the present data for the countries and years under investigation, occupation-level immigration tends to be more important and to have a more compensatory effect, spurring support for redistribution, than national-level immigration.</p>
<p>These main results, particularly those for <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> withstand a wide range of sensitivity and robustness tests. We get similar results when we consider particular groupings of countries, with (particularly the occupational-level) results being resistant to exclusion of particular countries (e.g. excluding Greece increases the positive effects of <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic>). Fluctuating controls or including a larger sample of countries (beyond those for which <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> can be measured) can alter the results for <italic>foreign-born in nation –</italic> making its effects more negative. The main results for <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic>, however, are not sensitive to such varying mixes of controls or countries – including industry dummies, despite the high collinearity this presents. The same is true for estimations using alternative specifications of support for government redistribution or of exposure to foreign-born workers, such as ratios of foreign to national employees. Constraining the results by excluding outliers in the foreign-born share of employees, or by focusing on only native respondents, also yields very similar results to those reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928712440198">Table 1</xref>. Interestingly, neither <italic>foreign-born in nation</italic> nor <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> appear to have significantly differential effects for support for redistribution depending on skills levels, gender or age; the reported direct effects prevail. Furthermore, alternative estimators (probits or logits of binary measures of support for government redistribution) or multinomial logit, or alternative estimations of standard errors, all yield results very similar to those in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928712440198">Table 1</xref>. Finally, we have reproduced the basic results on ISSP data, which harbour less cross-national variation in many variables of interest and lacks the sampling quality of the ESS, but do have similar measures of support for redistribution. The main analysis, hence, provides liitle support for Hypothesis 1, partial support for Hypothesis 2 and strong support for Hypothesis 3.</p>
<p>It is, in any event, important to explore whether these results corroborate the causal logic underlying the hypotheses above, as well as the basic line of them. As supplements to the above analysis, we investigated how <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> and <italic>foreign-born in nation</italic> might influence a range of intervening attitudes that in turn influence support for government redistribution. The ESS data do not include all measures relevant to the logic of such intervening conditions articulated above; for instance, we have no measures there of general solidarity or trust in societies. The various ESS waves, however, particularly the most recent 2008 wave, include questions on attitudes that constitute intervening links connecting occupation- and national-level immigration to attitudes about redistribution. These provide leverage to better judge the hypotheses above, particularly Hypothesis 3.</p>
<p>We first considered measures of these intervening sentiments in the ESS data, looking particularly for such measures that not only are plausible intervening links, but also, in the data, appear to significantly increase or decrease support for redistribution. The 2008 wave of the survey includes a question about <italic>subjective unemployment risk</italic> (respondent assessment of ‘how likely [he or she] will be unemployed and looking for work in next 12 months’) and a question about <italic>poverty risk</italic> (‘how likely [he or she] will not have enough money for household necessities in the next 12 months’). Both attitudes about unemployment and about poverty risks strongly positively influence support for redistribution (not shown),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0958928712440198">6</xref></sup> and are plausibly influenced by exposure to immigration. The ESS data also gauge subjective sense of how the national economy is doing through a range of questions of whether immigration is good or bad for the nation. Neither of these is directly relevant to the intervening links discussed above, but both capture sentiments of national economic well-being and of effects of immigration that can be expected to influence how immigration plays out for redistribution. Positive judgements of the state of the national economy strongly spur support for redistribution, and judgement that immigration is good for national culture also spurs such support (importantly, this is the only immigration question to have such an effect). Finally, the ESS data measure whether respondents judge social benefits to put an excessive strain on the economy – a condition that, not surprisingly, strongly negatively influences support for redistribution. We do not report these results, though they are available in supplemental Appendix I.</p>
<p>Given that these are the attitudes in both theory and empirics to significantly influence support for government redistribution, we explore how and whether <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> and <italic>foreign-born in nation</italic> influence answers to these same questions. This will help identify the mechanisms underlying the hypotheses. In line with Hypothesis 3, for instance, we expect particularly occupation-level immigration to spark individual-level economic insecurities, and to do so more strongly than national-level immigration. We expect occupation-level immigration to spark <italic>fewer</italic> concerns about broad, national economic conditions, about the effects of immigrants generally and about fiscal costs of redistribution – less than national-level immigration.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0958928712440198">Table 2</xref> below provides an explicit test of these expectations. Each row of the table reports the expected and actual coefficients of the two measures of immigration in random-intercept random-coefficient models of the attitude in question, along with the battery of controls included in estimations of support redistribution above (controls not reported but available upon request). The results provide mixed evidence for the causal dynamics underlying the hypotheses. In the first two rows, we can see that <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> does tend to substantively and statistically significantly increase both subjective unemployment risk (model 1) and subjective poverty risk (model 2), whereas <italic>foreign-born in nation</italic> tends to have little such effect. This is, for work-based measures of immigration, support for Hypothesis 2, and further and strong support for Hypothesis 3. Also consistent with Hypothesis 1, but particularly Hypothesis 3, is that <italic>foreign-born in nation</italic> much more strongly reduces satisfaction with how the economy is doing (model 3) and judgement that immigrants are good (model 5) than <italic>foreign-born in occupation.</italic> On the other hand, we also can see that neither <italic>foreign-born in nation</italic> nor <italic>foreign-born in occupation</italic> significantly increases the sentiment that social benefits put a strain on the economy – something we expected to be the case, particularly for <italic>foreign-born in nation.</italic></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper has explored how immigration can have complicated implications for support for government redistribution in industrialized countries. Against the most common view in scholarship on political economy that immigration tends to be bad news for support for redistribution, we hypothesize and find evidence that occupational rather than national exposure to immigrants can have different, even opposite, implications for such support. Immigration experienced in a worker’s occupation plausibly spurs mainly his or her individual economic insecurities in ways that increase support for government compensation for such risks. Immigration experienced in one’s nation, meanwhile, plausibly speaks more to citizens’ broader sense of social solidarity and calculations about the fiscal burdens of redistribution in ways that may decrease such support. We find modest support for such logic. Mainly, however, we find evidence that occupational exposure to immigration spurs support for redistribution whereas national exposure does not, and that this difference involves how occupational exposure spurs individual unemployment and poverty risks whereas national exposure does not. Such national versus occupation results are important unto themselves, as differences across working experiences in exposure to immigrants and in attitudes to redistribution are of significant interest to political economists, particularly when considering differences within a given polity.</p>
<p>Further research should deepen and extend the analysis. Once we understand the basic, mainly direct, implications of immigration for redistribution attitudes we should explore the more complicated politics qualitative research and intuition support. For instance, we should consider interactions with various other attitudes about immigrants and political economy. We should consider how and whether broad public attitudes putatively shaped by immigration actually influence party and policymaking agendas and ultimate revenue and spending policies of states. In the meantime, this study reminds us that immigration has important but also diverse implications for social policy – posing risks threatening, but also significant leverage to sustain, social protection in industrialized polities.</p>
