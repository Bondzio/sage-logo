<p>I appreciate Heather Ann Thompson’s “The Prison Industrial Complex: A Growth Industry in a Shrinking Economy” in the Fall 2012 issue of <italic>New Labor Forum</italic>. For years, I have admired Dr. Thompson’s award-winning work on the history of the war on drugs and mass incarceration in the United States, and I agree with her when she writes that we need to connect organized labor with the growing movement against mass incarceration in the United States. However, I disagree with the characterization of U.S. prison industries as a substantial competitor to private industry; rather, I would argue that U.S. prisons chiefly manufacture unemployability in an era of deindustrialization.</p>
<p>The fact that “eighteen federal prisons are in the business of making furniture” conjures images of prisons run like furniture factories where prisoners are paid in penny wages. Compared with the $13.04/hour that furniture workers can command outside of prison, this could indeed be a devastating job killer for factory workers outside. In the context of federal prison, however, the chance to produce an industrial product (such as furniture) is a rare and shrinking opportunity.</p>
<p>Federal prison industries’ earnings for furniture sales were $2.8 million, and net sales of all prison industry products combined dropped 13 percent during 2009-2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1095796012471644">1</xref></sup> This contradicts the idea that it has functioned as a “growth industry” and reveals that the profit margin for furniture sales can barely cover the cost of a single cell block in a federal prison. Between 1998 and 2009, federal prison industries employment dropped 6 percent (from 20,213 to 18,972 total inmate workers), while during the same period, the number of federal prisoners increased by 69 percent (from 123,041 to 208,118).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1095796012471644">2</xref></sup> Today, we have more federal prisoners, but fewer industrial jobs in federal prisons.</p>
<p>Dr. Thompson cites a paper that states that “well over six hundred thousand, and probably close to a million inmates are working full-time in jails and prisons throughout the United States.” The paper she is citing focuses on the ambiguity of prison “jobs,” most of which entail prison maintenance: cleaning, mowing lawns, cooking food, and so on. The study refers to these as “nonmarket labor” because in our society, all residential living units except for assisted living tend to cook and clean for themselves; thus, this labor is not usually treated as waged labor. This is a complicated issue: inside U.S. prisons, cleaning duty may be reported as a “full-time job” because it is an assigned activity that occurs outside of a prisoner’s cell, and it is indeed compensated in penny wages. Still, it is misleading to lump all such work with prison industries that entail the export of commodities sold for a profit. Most “prison jobs” are custodial, and the rare exceptions are industrial jobs producing goods for state agencies.</p>
<p>Prison industries are bad news for the American labor movement, but mass incarceration itself is the greater evil. The United States incarcerated millions of Americans during the past three decades while during the same period, millions of industrial jobs were lost overseas. We should see these prisons as part of <italic>deindustrialization</italic>. Millions of working-class people, mainly men of color, have been branded felons, thus losing access to jobs that discriminate against people with past convictions. Dr. Thompson is right to raise the specter of mass incarceration and the exploitation of prisoners as an issue for American labor. But much more damage is being done to the working class via the mass incarceration itself than the competition that prison labor poses to American industry.</p>
