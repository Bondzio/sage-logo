<p>Physiological data show that many cells in macaque extrastriate visual area MT respond best to stimuli with specific speeds. However, many such cells change their speed preferences when the spatial frequency of a simple grating stimulus is altered -- an effect that some researchers claim can accurately predict the known influence of spatial frequency on perceived speed. For more complex or higher contrast stimuli, MT cell speed preferences show less dependence on spatial frequency, allowing us to predict higher accuracy of perceived speed. We investigated this issue in simple sine wave and more complex compound gratings (formed from 2 iso-oriented sine wave components) across various levels of contrast and spatial frequency. In all cases, high contrast stimuli appeared to translate more rapidly. In addition, high spatial frequencies appeared faster - the opposite effect to that predicted by changes in MT cell spatial frequency preferences. Complex gratings were less vulnerable to the effect of spatial frequency, as predicted. However, contrary to predictions, the effect of spatial frequency was larger in high (compared to low) contrast gratings. These data call into question the propriety of labelled-line models of perceived speed from MT cell responses.</p>

<p>Although it has long been known that stimulus contrast affects the perceived speed of sinewave gratings (Thompson, 1982), the relationship between contrast, spatial frequency (SF), temporal frequency (TF) and the misperception of speed remains unclear. Typically, reducing contrast makes stimuli appear artificially slow. However, under some circumstances (e.g. at high TFs or high speed, or both), reducing contrast makes things look faster. We present the first systematic study to concurrently test high and low contrast (70% and 7%) stimuli across many points on the spatiotemporal surface (TFs: 2-16Hz; Speeds: 0.25-64deg/s; SFs: 0.25-8c/deg). In a 2-interval forced-choice paradigm participants indicated whether the standard grating or test dots appeared to translate at a higher speed. To identify the effect of SF, TF and contrast on perceived seed, the same standard dot pattern was used across conditions. This novel design allowed for the comparison of all measurements of the speed at which the standard and test stimuli appeared equivalent. Low contrast stimuli appeared slower than high contrast stimuli, and no clear evidence was found for a reversal effect. Large individual differences were obtained, however, high contrast stimuli appeared faster than low contrast stimuli in the majority of cases.</p>
