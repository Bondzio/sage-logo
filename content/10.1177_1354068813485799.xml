<p>Torbjörn Bergman and Kaare Strøm are fast building up a reputation as a formidable partnership in the production of comparative work. <italic>The Madisonian Turn</italic> is their fourth jointly edited publication (although it is the first where they are the sole editors). A recurring theme throughout the book is a dichotomy between two models of democracy. On the one hand the parliamentary Westminster model, with a dominant parliament and strong political parties; on the other, the presidential Madisonian model, with weaker parties and separation of powers.</p>
<p>This dichotomy is then applied to the five countries in ‘<italic>Norden</italic>’: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The use of the majoritarian and dualist Westminster model as point of departure for the multiparty and allegedly consensual Nordic political systems may not come across as intuitive. Towards the end of the book (p. 384), the editors argue that the Nordic and British models of Westminster democracy have only differed in one main respect – the Nordics have multiparty systems – but that this difference has been offset by the existence of Nordic centre-right ideological blocs, whose British equivalent has been the Conservative Party. This may not convince every reader, but the introductory chapter contains a good conceptual discussion on the Westminster and Madison models, and their subsequent use as ideal typical points of reference works well, once the sceptical reader has got used to the idea.</p>
<p>The editors argue that parliamentary democracies are subject to three key challenges, or transformations. Electorates are less loyal and more demanding, political elites are becoming detached from their ‘supporters and democratic principals’ and the policymaking process has become more complex and constrained (p. 21). The purpose of the book is to investigate how these transformations have affected the Nordic democracies. The bulk of the empirical evidence is provided in five country-specific chapters written by well-established scholars from the respective countries. These chapters follow a similar format and provide large amounts of empirical information about parties and party systems (e.g. the developments of party membership and party identification), cabinets (e.g. their composition and the electoral performances of incumbent governments) and parliaments (e.g. trends in numbers of motions and questions to government). They also deal with developments in areas such as the civil service, international relations (including, of course, the impact of European integration), the judiciary, interest organizations and the media. Much of this information is presented in detailed, often very extensive, tables which take a while to digest, but which are potentially useful for teaching as well as secondary research purposes.</p>
<p>The country chapters are preceded by a broadly comparative background chapter in which the Nordic countries are placed in context. This chapter provides basic demographic and historical facts, as well as extensive overviews on areas such as political economy, political trust and external constraints on parliamentary power. The final section of the book contains comparative chapters on the Nordic party systems, and on the international impact on the Nordic democracies. The threads are then tied together in the concluding chapter, written by the editors.</p>
<p>The main argument is illustrated by the title of the volume: the Nordic democracies have taken a turn away from the Westminster model to a position nearer the Madisonian model of democracy. The basis for this conclusion is summarized in a table on page 383, but two main pieces of evidence are particularly conspicuous. First, the weakened position of the national parliaments due to external constraints on the policymaking process. Primarily, but not exclusively, this can be attributed to the transfer of power to supranational, notably EU, institutions. This also applies to Norway and Iceland, which are not members of the EU but still bound by EU decisions via the EEA treaty. Second, the changing role of political parties, whose links to well-defined interests have eroded, making them ‘looser and more transitory coalitions of voters, more akin to the Madisonian model’ (p. 384).</p>
<p>The picture is not completely uni-dimensional, however. The clearest cases of a turn away from the Westminster towards the Madisonian model are Sweden, Norway and Iceland. Finland is found to have moved in the opposite direction, largely due to the fact that the powers of the president have decreased. Denmark turns out to be the Nordic country that, one decade into the 2000s, best resembles the Westminster model. Like the other studied countries, Denmark has experienced growing external constraints on the policy process, but cabinet stability has increased and electoral losses for incumbent governments diminished. Denmark also displays the highest levels of political trust, the smallest decline in turnout, a comparatively low degree of electoral volatility, the highest level of party identification and a lower rate of party membership decline than Norway and Sweden (p. 384).</p>
<p>The positive trends in Denmark largely coincide with a period when the Danish People’s Party enjoyed a position of policy influence matched by few other populist/extreme right parties in Europe. Indeed, there is much to suggest that the much-debated restrictions on immigration introduced by a Liberal–Conservative minority coalition in office between 2001 and 2011, relying on parliamentary support from the Danish People’s Party, led to increased political trust. The authors make an implicit note of this by suggesting that the Danish party system displays a flexibility which ‘enables new parties representing anti-EU and anti-immigration sentiments to surface without seriously disrupting the party system’ (p. 385). Thus, it could be argued that the most positive findings in the book also give cause for concern. At the same time, they could serve as the starting point for a difficult but important debate about the future of democracy and democratic values.</p>
<p>The latter could, indeed, be said about the whole book. The development trends reported and analysed will have far-reaching consequences, which may not always be immediately apparent to the contemporary observer. Bergman and Strøm have provided much food for thought, and discussion, within as well as outside the political science community.</p>
