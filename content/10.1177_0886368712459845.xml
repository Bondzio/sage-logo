<p>Ever since the financial scandals that rocked the business world and the worldwide financial crisis that followed, the debate on the effects of bonuses on the performance of especially managers and the role of reward systems in organizations has divided academics and practitioners alike. On one side are the proponents of bonuses, who state that use of bonuses and emphasis on monetary rewards increases productivity and organizational performance. On the other side are the opponents of bonuses and monetary rewards, who state that bonuses create higher pay inequality with as result greater manager and employee turnover, and the long-term effects of bonuses do not seem unequivocally positive.</p>
<p>In the polemic between proponents and opponents, a key question regarding bonuses is often overlooked: How important is handing out bonuses for an organization to become and stay successful for a longer period of time? A way to obtain an answer to this question is by studying the results of research into the characteristics of high-performance organizations (HPOs). This research aimed at identifying characteristics that explain the sustainable success of an organization.</p>
<p>An HPO is defined here as an organization that achieves financial and nonfinancial results that are exceedingly better than those of its peer group over a period of time of 5 years or more, by focusing in a disciplined way on that which really matters to the organization.</p>
<p>Based on a review of 290 academic and management publications in the area of high performance and excellence, the characteristics of high performance were identified. These were put in a questionnaire that was distributed worldwide. Approximately 3,200 respondents from 1,475 organizations in 50 countries filled in this questionnaire in which they indicated how their organization scored on these characteristics and performed against their peer groups. Subsequent statistical analysis of the collected data showed that there are 35 characteristics that have a direct positive relation with competitive performance. These characteristics always appear in five groups, the so-called HPO factors. When an organization scores higher on these five HPO factors than its peer group, the organization also surpasses its peers financially and nonfinancially.</p>
<p>The first and foremost HPO factor is the quality of management of the organization. In an HPO, managers at all organizational levels maintain trust relationships with employees. They work with integrity and are a role model to others: They are honest and sincere, show commitment, enthusiasm and respect, have a strong set of ethics and standards, are credible and consistent, maintain a sense of vulnerability and are not self-complacent. They are decisive, action-focused decision makers.</p>
<p>The second HPO factor is openness and action orientation. In an HPO, management demonstrates that it values the opinions of employees by having frequent dialogues with them and involving them in all important business and organizational processes. HPO management allows experiments and mistakes by seeing these as opportunities to learn. In this respect, management welcomes and stimulates change by continuously striving for renewal.</p>
<p>The third HPO factor is long-term orientation. In an HPO, long-term gain is far more important than short-term profit. An HPO continuously strives to enhance customer value creation by learning what customers want, understanding their values and being responsive to them. In addition, an HPO maintains good long-term relationships with all stakeholders by networking broadly, taking an interest in and giving back to society, and creating mutual, beneficial opportunities and win-win relationships.</p>
<p>The fourth HPO factor is continuous improvement and renewal. An HPO adopts a unique strategy that will set the organization apart by developing many new alternatives to compensate for dying strategies. After that, an HPO continuously simplifies, improves and aligns all its processes to improve its ability to respond to events efficiently and effectively and to eliminate unnecessary procedures, work and information overload.</p>
<p>The fifth and final HPO factor is employee quality. An HPO makes sure it assembles a diverse and complementary workforce and recruits people with maximum flexibility to help detect problems in business processes and incite creativity in solving them. An HPO also continuously works on the development of its workforce by training staff to be both resilient and flexible, letting them learn from others by going into partnerships with suppliers and customers, and inspiring them to improve their skills so they can accomplish extraordinary results.</p>
<p>During the literature review, in 55 of the 290 studies reviewed, 12 potential HPO characteristics were identified in respect to bonuses and reward systems:</p>

<p>A British nonprofit organization, while introducing a new reward system, made sure it knew what motivated its employees to excel and discovered that equity was very important to them: to be treated justly in relation to the basic conditions of employment and having a sense of elemental fairness in the way they are treated, which could be achieved by for employees satisfactory compensation and fringe benefits. Thus it made sure that it created “a fair employee deal,” which is important for creating the impression of a fair compensation system among employees.</p>

<p>An American bank, despite using many different types of pay policies, made sure all these policies always were congruent with its strategy. In this way, whatever policy was applied by a manager, it would always benefit the implementation of the strategy and support the core values of the bank.</p>

<p>A Dutch manufacturer created a reward system that contained both short-term performance indicators—rewarding yearly financial performance—and long-term performance indicators—rewarding nonfinancial indicators such as customer loyalty and employee loyalty. In this way, managers paid attention to both the short and long term.</p>

</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A British company used a reward system that rewarded two types of competitive performance. First, results a manager achieved on key financial and nonfinancial indicators were compared with those of the top three of the company’s competitors. Second, the same key indicators were compared among the managers in the company. In this way, managers were incited to not only achieving their budget but to improve beyond the performance levels of both internal and external competitors.</p>

<p>A medical partnership introduced a group performance reward scheme and found that the advantage of medical specialists helping each other with advice and taking over patients offset reductions in output associated with free-riding and efforts devoted to monitoring.</p>

<p>A high-performing construction company applied a wider repertoire of approaches toward reward management, for instance, by tailoring the reward structure to each construction expert’s needs and was therefore a much more attractive employer to those scare and hard to find and attract construction experts than its competitors.</p>

<p>A Korean organization did away with the old incentive system, which rewarded tenure and age, and only granted salary increases on the results employees achieved on preset targets. And because employees were involved in setting these targets, there was high involvement and high commitment to the new scheme.</p>

<p>Atrion Networking Corporation, an IT services company, charted its critical success factors and performance indicators and passed these on to everyone in the organization. Good performances on these indicators were then recognized with small bonuses, honorable mentions and prizes such as a parking space right in front of the entrance for the month’s best employee (who was chosen by fellow employees).</p>

<p>Svenska Handelsbanken uses a profit-sharing system reward. If the bank reaches its targets then part of the profit is set aside for the employees and put into a fund where it stays until the employees retire, which gives them a long-term perspective instead of the short-term focus bonuses create. They are greatly interested in how the bank performs in 5 and 10 years because they will not get the money before they retire, in 20 or 30 years. The money is invested on the market with the biggest investment being in Handelsbanken shares. This keeps the interest of employees in the bank’s performance. And even if they leave Handelsbanken before they are 60 years old, the money will remain in the fund for them until they are of that age.</p>

<p><disp-quote>
<p>Using a gain-sharing program without a cap resulted in considerably increased profitability at the distribution warehouses where this scheme was used. And dealerships that used bonus thresholds experienced reduced sales variance and increased sales performance.</p>

</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A French family business started to put more emphasis on knowledge and skill development, by discussing with its employees what motivated them in their work and what nonfinancial rewards in the form of skill-based training they would like. The result was that employees become much more happy with the tasks they needed to do and with the reward of a job well done.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list12-0886368712459845" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>12. <italic>Rewards for results, not efforts or seniority:</italic> Employers should reward employees for their performance and not automatically for getting a year older or for just doing their best.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A Dutch company introduced a new reward system after it found out that its high-performing employees took special pride in their accomplishments by doing things that matter and doing them well and then receiving the (financial) recognition for these accomplishments.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although most pay-related HPO characteristics may be considered to be fairly independent from each other (e.g., 1, 3, 4 and 5), some may be correlated positively (e.g., 1 and 2) or negatively (e.g., 8 and 9, 7 and 11 or 7 and 12). This suggests that there is not one systematic way to construct a reward system suitable for an HPO but that there could be many different types of reward systems that potentially lead to high performance.</p>
<p>During the statistical part of the HPO research it became apparent that none of the 12 characteristics showed a significant correlation with competitive performance, which means that these characteristics were not related to organizational performance. This leads to the conclusion that having bonuses and reward systems is not a distinguishing factor for creating and sustaining HPOs. Thus, well-performing organizations are just as likely to use bonuses or certain types of reward systems as they are not. Using bonuses will therefore neither help nor hurt organizations in achieving sustained high performance.</p>
<p>To prevent any misunderstanding, the HPO research does not show that bonuses and well thought-out reward systems are not important. However, the HPO research shows that such systems are not distinguishing factors for creating and sustaining HPOs but merely hygiene factors. The organization needs to have an appropriate reward system (whether or not it includes bonuses) that is considered by employees to be fair and equitable. If such a reward system is not in place, the organization will run into trouble and opposition from employees, and becoming an HPO will then be virtually impossible. If such a system is in place—and it does not seem to really matter what type of reward system as long as it is appropriate for the organization in question—employees will consider it normal and will be content, so the organization can start thinking of turning itself into an HPO.</p>
