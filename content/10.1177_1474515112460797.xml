<title>Background:</title>
<p>Nowadays, most adolescents with mild congenital heart disease (CHD) undergo medical or surgical correction in early childhood for their congenital anomalies. There is a need to examine the determinants of exercise behaviour among adolescents (CHD) who are able to exercise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1474515112460797">
<title>Aims:</title>
<p>The aims of this study were to examine determinants of exercise among adolescents with mild CHD, including personal beliefs about exercise, interpersonal influences on exercise, and availability of physical environments for exercise, based on social-cognitive theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1474515112460797">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>A repeated-measures study was conducted at three medical centres in Taiwan. All participants, 126 adolescents with CHD aged 12 to 18 years, had a cardiologist’s recommendation of exercise with no limits or limits only on vigorous exercise. Self-administered questionnaires were completed during a summer vacation and again in the fall semester of school along with a 7-day exercise log. The data were analysed using structured equation modelling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1474515112460797">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The effect of interpersonal influences on total exercise and moderate-to-vigorous exercise was mediated by personal exercise beliefs. Peer influences had significant effects on moderate-to-vigorous exercise through the mediator of perceived exercise self-efficacy. There was no significant difference in the determinants of exercise behaviour during two periods. Personal exercise beliefs, particularly perceived exercise self-efficacy, played the most important role in determining the performance of moderate-to-vigorous exercise.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prevalence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in Taiwan was 13.08 per 1000 live births.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112460797">1</xref></sup> In the past, most affected neonates did not survive beyond childhood. However, recent advances in medical technology, along with the advent of National Health Insurance, have helped patients obtain treatment in the early stages of disease, and now more than 85% of affected neonates survive to adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112460797">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112460797">3</xref></sup> Adolescents with CHD facing the transition from childhood to adulthood require special attention from health professionals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112460797">4</xref></sup> Although they have different degrees of disease severity, the condition can be cured or corrected in about 80% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112460797">5</xref></sup> The transition to adulthood features an increase in independence and autonomy. This developmental change requires health professionals to help the adolescents with CHD from paediatric care to the promotion of self-care. In addition, they need not only support and trust from their friends, but also their peers’ recognition and acceptance, especially regarding health-related behaviours, such as exercise behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112460797">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the literature includes discussions of the determinants of general adolescents’ exercise behaviour, including physical, psychological, behavioural, social and environmental factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112460797">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112460797">8</xref></sup> few studies have focused on adolescents affected by CHD since infancy. Existing studies have emphasized disease severity, with inconsistent effects of disease severity on exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112460797">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112460797"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112460797"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112460797">12</xref></sup> Examination of psychological and social factors, perceived exercise self-efficacy, perceived physical barriers, and parental support and attitudes has shown inconsistent results,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112460797">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112460797">12</xref></sup> and these variables deserve further investigation. Moreover, peer relationships are an important source of adolescents’ sense of belonging, and having friends with common interests such as sporting activities can help make their lives more healthy and interesting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112460797">13</xref></sup> Thus, it is necessary to take into consideration peers’ thoughts on participation in exercise by adolescents with CHD. In addition, previous literature seldom mentioned environmental factors, but for adolescents having adequate space and an appropriate environment for exercise is a significant factor in their ability to participatein exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112460797">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study was intended to take developmental characteristics and the environmental contexts of adolescents with mild CHD into consideration and apply social-cognitive theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112460797">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112460797"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112460797">16</xref></sup> in order to understand the influences on personal beliefs about exercise andthe effects of external environments on their exercise behaviour. Personal beliefs about exercise refer to the cognition of self-evaluation while performing exercise, including the perceived exercise self-efficacy and the perceived benefits and barriers of exercise. In the literature, it was noted that perceived exercise self-efficacy and benefits of and barriers to exercise were the most important factors predicting the exercise or health behaviours of adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112460797">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112460797"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112460797">19</xref></sup> Therefore, in this study, it was hypothesized that the personal beliefs of adolescents with mild CHD had direct effects on their exercise behaviours. External environments in this study include both social and physical environments. For adolescents, the social environment includes family members, friends, teachers, and others who support and model their exercise behaviour. The physical environment refers to the surroundings related to their lives and exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112460797">16</xref></sup> Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine how external environments influence the personal beliefs to perform exercise behaviour among adolescents with mild CHD.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-1474515112460797">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>In order to assess the determinants of exercise behaviour during summer vacation and in fall academic semester, respectively among adolescents with CHD, a study with a repeated-measures design was conducted over a half-year period. Most participants received their annual check-ups at the outpatient departments during summer vacation. Therefore, data were first collected by means of self-completed questionnaires and exercise logs issued during summer vacation in July and August 2008 to adolescents with mild CHD from three medical centres in Taiwan. A follow-up exercise log was mailed during the fall semester in December 2008 to those who had responded to the first survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1474515112460797">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All patients with mild CHD from the paediatric cardiology outpatient departments of three medical centres in northern Taiwan who met the following inclusion criteria were approached to participate in this study: diagnosis of CHD within the first 2 years of life, indicating a context of growing up with CHD; age between 12 and 18 years; exercise with no limits and vigorous exercise limits only, class I and II based on New York Heart Association functional classification, as recommended by cardiologists; no chromosomal aberrations or extra-cardiac malformations; no routine medication use; no pacemaker use; and no examination or surgery involving catheterization within the past year.</p>
<p>This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the three hospitals, and written informed consent was obtained from the participants and their parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474515112460797">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The exercise measure used was the modified version of the Child/Adolescent Activity Log (CAAL),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112460797">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112460797">20</xref></sup> on which was recorded all basic characteristics of physical activity, including frequency, intensity, time, and type. Please refer to the measures in one of our previous articles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112460797">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Personal exercise beliefs involve the perceived exercise self-efficacy and the perceived benefits of and barriers to exercise. Perceived exercise self-efficacy was measured by the questionnaire,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112460797">22</xref></sup> composed of 14 items, such as “I exercise even if I feel tired”. Scores ranged from 0% to 100% and were divided into 10 categories, with 0% indicating “not confident at all”, 50% indicating “somewhat confident” and 100% indicating “very confident”. Each participant could choose his or her own confidence level. This questionnaire had a Cronbach α of 0.90 in the first wave and 0.91 in the second wave for 1 year’s study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112460797">19</xref></sup> The expected validity showed the feasibility of predicting exercise behaviour,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112460797">22</xref></sup> and values of 0.90 and 0.93 were obtained during summer vacation and the fall semester in this study, respectively.</p>
<p>The perceived benefits of and barriers to exercise were measured using the questionnaire developed by Wu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112460797">22</xref></sup> The perceived benefits were appearance, physical health and psychosocial function. The perceived barriers were equipment, time, obstacles and interest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112460797">22</xref></sup> The two questionnaires contained 12 and 14 questions, respectively, such as “Exercise improves my physical appearance” and “I don’t have time”. A four-point Likert scale was used, with responses ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”. These two questionnaires had Cronbach α values as high as 0.82 to 0.89 in a 1-year long-term study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112460797">19</xref></sup> Moreover, after the researchers’ pilot study using qualitative research to evaluate the objective experiences with exercise behaviour of adolescents with CHD, two questions on perceived exercise related to the disease experience were added: “I have CHD” and “I am concerned about my heart function”. The Cronbach α values of the questionnaire on the perceived benefits of exercise were 0.86 to 0.90 for the participants in the two periods, while those of the questionnaire on barriers to exercise were 0.80 to 0.82.</p>
<p>Interpersonal influences on exercise include exercise support from and modelling by significant others. For adolescents with mild CHD, significant others include parents, siblings, teachers and peers. This study adopted the questionnaire on interpersonal influence used by Wu et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112460797">19</xref></sup> as modified by Garcia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112460797">23</xref></sup> The questionnaire addressed social support from (17 questions) and exercise modelling by (3 questions) family, peers and teachers. The test–retest reliability was 0.82 to 0.84, and the Cronbach α was 0.83 to 0.89.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112460797">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112460797">24</xref></sup> Social support meant the degree of support for physical activities received from others, such as “Exercised with me”. The Cronbach α values were 0.95 and 0.94 during summer vacation and the academic semester, respectively. Exercise modelling meant the degree of exercise with others in the past 3 months, such as “Exercise with little effort (bowling, golf, slow walking, etc.)”. Responses were given on a four-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating “never” and 4 indicating “frequently”. Since the modelling subscale needed to reflect the differences in modelling different intensities of exercise, the scores for moderate-level exercise were double-weighted, and those for vigorous exercise were triple-weighted. The mean scores were calculated by obtaining the average of the weights of all items.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112460797">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112460797">23</xref></sup> The value for the section on exercise modelling was 0.87 for both periods.</p>
<p>The availability of physical environments for exercise referred to the area within a perceived 15-minute walk from home, including houses, communities, schools and commuting areas. This questionnaire was based on the Chinese version described in Liou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112460797">25</xref></sup> of the self-administered environmental module developed by the International Physical Activity Prevalence Study. It was scored using a four-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating “strongly disagree” and 4 indicating “agree”. The content validity index (CVI) was 0.99, and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.42.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112460797">25</xref></sup> The core items of this module are required regardless of the country in which the questionnaire is used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112460797">26</xref></sup> Considering the time and burden for adolescents to complete it, this study used all 10 of the core items as well as three recommended items to assess the availability of physical environments for exercise. For this instrument, the Cronbach α values were 0.61 and 0.65 during summer vacation and the academic semester, respectively.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The questionnaires used in the second wave of the study were processed initially, and two patients with more than 5% missing variables were excluded. The other missing variables were estimated by the methods of regression. Data analysis was performed using two software packages, SPSS version 15.0 and LISREL version 8.8. Direct and indirect effects of the variables among adolescents with mild CHD, along with the total effects, were obtained by structured equation modelling (SEM). The parameter estimation provided by LISREL allowed the SEM estimates to be viewed. The goodness-of-fit indices used in this study included the χ<sup>2</sup> test, goodness-of-fit index (GFI), comparative fit index (CFI), standardised root mean square residual (SRMR), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112460797">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112460797">28</xref></sup></p>

<title>Demographic and research variables</title>
<p>During the summer vacation, 158 completed the questionnaires and returned their exercise logs as well. Of these participants, 126 (for a response rate of 80%) returned completed 7-day exercise logs during the fall semester. Among 126 participants, 54 (43%) were male, with an average age of approximately 15 years. More males than females were considered overweight (27.8% and 8.3%, respectively). Classification of the diagnosis referred to cardiac anomalies with haemodynamic alterations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474515112460797">29</xref></sup> In at least 70% of the participants, the diagnosis was acyanotic heart disease with left-to-right shunt. The most common diagnosis in acyanotic heart disease was a ventricular septal defect (<italic>n</italic> = 48; 38.1%), and the most common diagnosis in cyanotic heart disease was tetralogy of Fallot (<italic>n</italic> = 20; 15.9%). Fifty-two (41.3%) of the participants had never undergone any open heart surgery. The heart functional level of most participants (about 70%) was such that a cardiologist had recommended exercise with no limits, compared to 30% of participants from cardiologists’ recommendations of exercise with limits only on vigorous exercise.</p>
<p>The research variables in this study were personal beliefs about exercise, interpersonal influence on exercise, availability of physical environments for exercise, and exercise behaviour.

<title>Social-cognitive determinants of exercise behaviour</title>
<p>In this study, mild exercise was not significantly correlated with other variables. Regular exercise of moderate-to-vigorous intensity can improve heart and lung function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474515112460797">30</xref></sup> Therefore, in further discussion of exercise behaviours, we will focus on exercise of moderate-to-vigorous intensity. In addition, the association (Φ, phi) between exogenous variables, interpersonal influence on exercise, and availability of physical environments for exercise was not significant. This model excluded these insignificant relations in accordance with the principle of parsimony.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474515112460797">31</xref></sup></p>

<p>In the statistical model for the academic semester, similar results were found, with df 11, χ<sup>2</sup> 18.32, and<italic>p</italic> = 0.075. The goodness-of-fit was ideal, with a GFI of 0.960, CFI of 0.958, SRMR of 0.058, and RMSEA of 0.074. Personal beliefs functioned as a mediator (effect = 0.540, <italic>t</italic> = 2.681), significantly influencing the direct effect of interpersonal influence (effect = 0.585, <italic>t</italic> = 4.133) on the amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise (effect = 0.316, <italic>t</italic> = 2.273).</p>
<p>Concerning the mediating effects of personal beliefs on the effect of interpersonal influence on the amount of exercise among adolescents with mild CHD, interpersonal influence was categorised as that of family members (including father, mother, siblings and relatives) and that of peers (including classmates and friends). Social-cognitive theory considered perceived self-efficacy as the central issue of the mediator personal beliefs about exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112460797">16</xref></sup> In the statistical model described above, there was unequal distribution of loading in perceived exercise self-efficacy, perceived benefits of exercise, and perceived barriers to exercise (0.938, 0.428 and −0.421 during summer vacation and 0.768, 0.464 and −0.542 during the academic semester, respectively).

<p>The influence of friends and family members and availability of physical environments for exercise had no direct effect on the amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise. Peers could significantly influence the perceived benefits and the perceived exercise self-efficacy, further affecting the amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise. The indirect effect of peers on the amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise was significant (effect = 0.210, <italic>t</italic> = 2.958). However, the family influence was not significant. In the statistical model, availability of physical environments for exercise was noted to significantly influence the perceived barriers to exercise, showing that higher availability of physical environments for exercise was associated with lower perceived barriers to exercise, and the indirect effect of perceived self-efficacy was significantly affected (effect = 0.104, <italic>t</italic> = 2.405). Further investigation of the indirect effect of availability of physical environments for exercise on the amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise did not show a significant result (effect = 0.089, <italic>t</italic> = 1.931).</p>
<p>The modified model based on the academic semester was similar to that based on the summer vacation. The statistical model had a df of 14, χ<sup>2</sup> of 17.729, and <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.219, with a GFI of 0.970, CFI of 0.985, SRMR of 0.041, and RMSEA of 0.045. The perceived exercise self-efficacy of adolescents with mild CHD functioned as the main mediator (effect = 0.363, <italic>t</italic> = 3.174), significantly influencing the indirect effect of the perceived benefits of exercise (effect = 0.227, <italic>t</italic> = 2.587) on the amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise (effect = 0.082, <italic>t</italic> = 2.018). Meanwhile, the indirect effect of the perceived barriers to exercise (effect = −0.271, <italic>t</italic> = −3.093) on the amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise (effect = −0.098, <italic>t</italic> = −2.218) was also significantly influenced.</p>
<p>Peers could significantly influence the perceived benefits and exercise self-efficacy, further affecting the amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise. An indirect effect of peers on the amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise (effect = 0.165, <italic>t</italic> = 2.103) was noted.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study support the theory of Bandura,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112460797">14</xref></sup> who proposed that behaviours result from interactions between personal cognition and environments. This study also showed how external environments influence personal beliefs to perform exercise behaviour among adolescents with mild CHD. In studies on exercise behaviour or physical activities of elementary schoolchildren, adolescents and college students, the perceived exercise self-efficacy was an important predictor of participation in exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112460797">14</xref></sup> Bar-Mor et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112460797">9</xref></sup> also adopted social-cognitive theory to investigate the relationship between perceived self-efficacy and physical activities of adolescents with trivial, mild or moderate CHD. They also found that perceived self-efficacy could function as a mediator between physician advice and mothers’ attitudes, showing the importance of perceived self-efficacy. Thus, adolescents with mild CHD who have the ability to exercise could be instructed to participate in exercise of adequate intensity through regulation of the basic source of exercise and indirect determinants of perceived self-efficacy. A sports log or journal could be used to help them establish individualised sports contracts. Those finishing the plans could be publicly praised, and those failing to finish should be encouraged to keep working. They could be invited to share what they learned, with emphasis on pleasure and controllable experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112460797">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study took into consideration the developmental characteristics and living environments of adolescents with mild CHD. Peer influence was found to function as a mediator that affected moderate-to-vigorous exercise through perceived exercise self-efficacy. For general adolescents, Wu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1474515112460797">32</xref></sup> used SEM to analyse the influencing factors of Taiwanese adolescent students and found that, for both males and females, peer influence had direct and indirect effects on physical activities, while parental influence had no effect. Thus, even in adolescents diagnosed with mild CHD in infancy, peer influence is an important determinant of exercise. Chiang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1474515112460797">33</xref></sup> used qualitative research to describe the exercise experiences of adolescents with mild CHD and found a process from limitation to mastery over their exercise behaviour. Although CHD caused slight movement limitation among the adolescents, apparent barriers could be controlled with relevant education. In this process, consideration of multiple factors helped improve the level of exercise participation. Feeling similar to their peers facilitated this adjustment. The process of integrating with their peers suggests that CHD did not prevent them from exercising. Finally, they could strengthen their self-identity by trying forms of exercise enjoyed by their peers and by developing their own sports interests.</p>
<p>It has been found that few adolescents with CHD know peers with a similar disease, and they tend to feel isolated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112460797">34</xref></sup> In Taiwan, the Cardiac Children’s Foundation of the Republic of China has been established for nearly 40 years, and there are annual sports games for adolescents with CHD. The participants are categorised according to their age and heart function. There are symposia for parents of children with CHD designed to encourage the children and their parents to perform exercise of adequate intensity and form friendships with one other. In addition, the British Heart Foundation has developed a set of online support sites for adolescents with CHD, called <email>Meet@TeenHeart</email>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112460797">34</xref></sup> These websites facilitate interactive communication about life experiences. It is also possible to ask questions, and professionals are online to provide answers. In this way, an online community was formed. These organisations can serve as references for future educational interventions or strategies involving peer support groups.</p>
<p>Because the internal consistency of the questionnaire on the availability of physical environments in this study was somewhat low, we would recommend more optional items to be adopted, if possible, in any future study. This study also found that higher availability of physical environments for exercise was associated with lower perceived barriers to exercise, further promoting moderate-to-vigorous exercise among adolescents. In 2006, a project called “Hundred miles of bike trail; thousand miles of hiking trail” was proposed in Taiwan, which is still being developed. Besides participating in these activities, adolescents need appropriate environments for exercise in their daily lives. Therefore, accessibility and availability of physical environments for exercise are crucial, and the results of this research may serve as an important reference for future health policy development.</p>
<p>A unique finding was that when the determinants during both two periods were compared in this study, there were no significant differences in the determinants of moderate-to-vigorous exercise behaviour between two periods. The results identified that social-cognitive determinants, including social, physical environment, and personal beliefs, having the effects on moderate-to-vigorous exercise behaviour among adolescents with mild CHD remained stable. Consistent with our findings, one longitudinal study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112460797">19</xref></sup> investigated eighth-grade students (Wave I) in Taiwan and recruited them again during the next year (Wave II), and also found fewer personal factors, and psychosocial variables (i.e. cognitions and interpersonal influences) had direct effects on physical activity in time lag effects than for synchronous effects. Because of the great emphasis on academic performance and the stress related to preparation for admission applications of high schools and universities in this population, lifestyle may converge into similarity between summer vacation and fall academic semester. Furthermore, findings of this study have implications for supporting incorporation of physical fitness performance results into admission applications to schools in Taiwan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112460797">35</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study found that factors including interpersonal influence and availability of physical environments for exercise during summer vacation and the fall semester did not have direct effects on the performance of exercise among adolescents with mild CHD. Interpersonal influence on exercise functioned as a mediator through personal exercise beliefs, significantly affecting participation in moderate-to-vigorous exercise. Peers could significantly influence the perceived benefits and exercise self-efficacy, further affecting participation in moderate-to-vigorous exercise. However, family influence was not significant. Availability of physicalenvironments for exercise significantly influenced theperceived barriers to exercise, and higher availability was associated with lower perceived barriers to exercise, resulting in increased time spent on moderate-to-vigorous exercise. These findings may serve as a reference for developing exercise symposia for adolescents with mild CHD. In addition, these results may help school nurses, tutors, physical education teachers, counsellors and peers to recognise the importance of these adolescents’ exercise and encourage them to actively participate in recommended sports clubs and exercise.</p>
