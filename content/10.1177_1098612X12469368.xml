<abstract>
<p>The occurrence of a high incidence of sperm tail defects in a male domestic cat resembling the known ‘Dag-like’ defect is reported. Sperm analyses were performed in ejaculated samples collected by an artificial vagina and in testicular and epididymal sperm cells after castration. The following alterations were observed using transmission electron microscope: heavily coiled sperm tails containing several axonemal units enclosed in the same common cell membrane; aberrations in the axonemal main structure; and swollen and unevenly distributed mitochondria in the midpiece. Abnormal modifications in the mitochondrial sheath were also found in sperm cells retrieved from testes and epididymides. Considering these findings, we can conclude that this is the Dag-like defect, described previously in other domestic species and a testicular origin may be involved.</p>

<body>
<p>The ‘Dag’ or ‘Dag-like’ defect is a sperm tail defect characterized by multiple fractures of the axonemal fibers, and mitochondrial sheath disruption. This defect was first described in a Jersey bull named Dag.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12469368">1</xref></sup> Since then, this sperm abnormality has been reported the equine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098612X12469368">2</xref></sup> caprine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098612X12469368">3</xref></sup> and canine species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098612X12469368">4</xref></sup> According to Barth and Oko,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12469368">5</xref></sup> the Dag-like defect is found commonly in various bull breeds, affecting &lt;5% of the spermatozoa from an ejaculate, and can lead to subfertility when incidence exceeds 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12469368">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098612X12469368">6</xref></sup> Based on a breeding experiment, Koefoed-Johnsen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098612X12469368">7</xref></sup> confirmed that the Dag defect in the Jersey breed is due to an inherited recessive factor.</p>
<p>A high incidence of morphologically abnormal sperm is commonly found in the domestic cat and when &gt;60% of spermatozoa per ejaculate are affected, the animal is termed teratospermic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098612X12469368">8</xref></sup> Various sperm defects have been found in the cat, comprising head, acrosome and tail abnormalities, detached heads and proximal and distal cytoplasmic droplets; even a low incidence of the Dag-like defect may have been observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098612X12469368">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098612X12469368"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098612X12469368"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098612X12469368">11</xref></sup> To date, no report based on the ultrastructural analysis of the Dag-like defect is available in the domestic cat. Therefore, this report aims to describe a case of a teratospermic cat showing a high incidence of the Dag-like defect, using ultrastructure evaluation. Additionally, testosterone, selenium and zinc concentrations, and sperm quality were also assessed. Results were compared with normospermic males.</p>

<title>Material and methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1098612X12469368">
<title>Animal profile</title>
<p>A mixed-breed long-haired male cat aged 5 years, donated by its owners for personal reasons, was housed in the veterinary school research cattery for approximately 2 years. During this period, the tom cat was used as a teratospermic semen donor for research purposes, as it continuously presented a high incidence of abnormal sperm morphology, especially tail defects. Afterwards, the animal was neutered and adopted by a new family.</p>
<p>In the research cattery the cat was exposed to natural lighting (&gt;12 h of light/day; 22°53’09’’S; 48°26’42’’W), and provided with dry cat food (FIT 32; Royal Canin) and water ad libitum. The male had visual and olfactory contact with intact male and female cats, and direct contact with a trained non-estrus queen during the semen collection procedures. Unfortunately, no reproductive history of the animal was available before it arrived at the research cattery. Physical examination of the tom cat revealed neither alterations in health condition nor abnormalities of the genital system. In addition, the male presented normal libido and was serum negative for both feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus.</p>
<p>In order to compare testosterone, selenium and zinc concentrations, sperm quality and testicular volume, three normospermic cats (more than 60% morphologically normal sperm) aged 4–7 years were used. Collection of blood and semen samples and testicular measurements from these males were performed using similar methodology, frequency and period as described below for the teratospermic cat. Likewise, all normospermic cats were housed in the research cattery and, hence, submitted to equal lighting, social and nutritional conditions as the tom cat of this case report.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1098612X12469368">
<title>Testicular volume, and testosterone, selenium and zinc measurements</title>
<p>For all tom cats, testicular measurements were made using a laboratory caliper (length and width). The total testicular volume was calculated as the sum of the right and left testis volume using a formula described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098612X12469368">8</xref></sup> The total testicular volume obtained for the teratospermic cat (3.61 cm<sup>3</sup>) was slightly higher than the 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated with the results from the normospermic cats (2.21–3.50 cm<sup>3</sup>).</p>
<p>Blood samples from all cats were collected under manual restraint on two different occasions (November and December) and always at the same hour of the day. Total serum testosterone concentration (T level) was measured by a commercial solid-phase radioimmunoassay kit (Coat-A-Count kit; Diagnostics Products Corporation) and the intra-assay coefficient of variation was 4.8%. Interestingly, the cat presenting the Dag-like defect showed a mean T level (178.0 ± 77.9 ng/dl) within the 95% CI obtained from the normospermic animals (115.6 to 240.3 ng/dl).</p>
<p>Sperm samples (10–15 ejaculates/cat) were collected from October to December, with at least a 2-day interval between collections and using an artificial vagina and a non-estrus queen or inanimate object for teasing. These samples were used to assess seminal plasma zinc (SPZn) and selenium (SPSe) concentrations. To achieve this goal, seminal plasma was separated from sperm cells using two consecutive centrifugations (5 mins at 700 × <italic>g</italic> and 15 mins at 1500 × <italic>g</italic>) and stored at −80°C. Before SPSe and SPZn determination, samples from the same tom cat were thawed, pooled and centrifuged at 3000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 mins. Blood selenium (BSe) and zinc (BZn) concentrations were assessed using the same pooled serum samples collected for T level determination. Selenium and zinc concentrations were measured by a Shimadzu AA-6800 atomic absorption spectrometer using the methods described by Neves et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098612X12469368">12</xref></sup> and Silva et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098612X12469368">13</xref></sup> Among the values obtained for selenium and zinc only SPSe for the teratospermic cat (42.0 µg/l) was lower than the 95% CI calculated for the normospermic animals (53.0 to 54.4 µg/l).</p>

<title>Semen evaluation</title>
<p>For sperm analyses, each cat was collected three times with a 2-day interval between collections, and using an artificial vagina as described above (November). After dilution in Talp HEPES 6% bovine serum albumin, total sperm count was determined and sperm motion assessed by computer assisted sperm analysis (HTM – IVOS 12; Hamilton Thorne Research) set up previously for cats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098612X12469368">14</xref></sup> Plasma membrane integrity was evaluated with propidium iodide (5 µg/ml; Sigma Chemical) and carboxyfluorescein diacetate (9.2 µg/ml; Sigma Chemical),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098612X12469368">14</xref></sup> while sperm nuclear chromatin normality was assessed using acridine orange stain (10 mg/ml; Sigma Chemical) by the method modified for cats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098612X12469368">15</xref></sup> A total of 200 cells per sample were analyzed in each test using an epifluorescence microscope [Nikon, Episcopic Fluorescence Attachment (EFA) Halogen Lamp Set]. Additionally, sperm samples were fixed in formol–saline for morphological evaluation and also stained with fast green FCF and rose bengal to assess acrosome integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098612X12469368">16</xref></sup> For both methods, 200 cells per sample were counted using light microscope (1000 × magnification). Morphology of sperm cells retrieved from testes (rete testis and efferent ducts) and epididymides after castration of the teratospermic cat was also assessed in wet preparations with formol–saline.</p>
<p>Data for sperm quality are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098612X12469368">Table 1</xref>. The values of sperm motility, sperm velocity, rapid sperm percentage and DNA integrity found for the cat showing the Dag-like defect were lower when compared with the 95% CI calculated for the normospermic cats.</p>

<p>The most common morphological defects found in the ejaculated sperm from the teratospermic cat were 32.3 ± 1.7% of bent tail with or without cytoplasmatic droplet, 26.8 ± 4.5% of Dag-like defect (strongly coiled, folded or fractured midpiece) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098612X12469368">Figure 1</xref>), 12.5 ± 2.8% of macrocephalia, 11.5 ± 3.4% of abnormal acrosome and 4.8 ± 1.2% of distal cytoplasmic droplet. Furthermore, among the sperm cells displaying the Dag-like defect, 38.1% of them presented a macrocephalic head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098612X12469368">Figure 1</xref>). Sperm cells from testes and epididymides also presented a high percentage of macrocephalic spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098612X12469368">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, epididymal sperm cells exhibited a higher incidence of the Dag-like defect when compared with the cells retrieved from testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098612X12469368">Figure 2</xref>). Likewise, the percentage of sperm cells affected simultaneously by both the Dag-like and the macrocephalic defects also increased in the epididymides.</p>

<p>Testicular, epididymal and ejaculated spermatozoa from the cat showing a high incidence of the Dag-like defect were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) and then prepared for ultrastructural analysis as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098612X12469368">17</xref></sup> In brief, the material was post-ﬁxed in 1% osmium tetroxide solution for 2 h, dehydrated through a graded series of acetone and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultra-thin sections were double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, then examined under a Philips C100 transmission electron microscope (TEM).</p>
<p>The ultrastructural investigation of the Dag-like defect revealed a flagellar compartment consisting of strong folding, coiling and fracture of the midpiece. Furthermore, coiled tails were encapsulated in a thin membrane, which trapped several membranous organelles, as found in the cytoplasmic droplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1098612X12469368">Figure 3</xref>). Midpieces presented disarranged mitochondrial sheaths with irregularly sized, swollen and unevenly distributed mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1098612X12469368">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1098612X12469368">4</xref>). Transverse sections of the tail revealed changes in the axonemal structure, such as lack of one or more doublets microtubules, often associated with the absence or displacement of the corresponding outer dense fiber. Doublets loss was usually found affecting the half of the axoneme containing fibers 4, 5, 6 and 7 and sometimes even the central microtubule pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1098612X12469368">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1098612X12469368">5</xref>).

<p>Ultrastructural analysis of the epididymal spermatozoa showed similar morphological alterations as described earlier for the ejaculated samples. Furthermore, although the majority of the cells from rete testis and efferent ducts exhibited a normal-appearing axial fiber bundle, some cells presented a swollen and misaligned mitochondrial sheath and the accumulation of a granular material in the residual cytoplasm.</p>

Based on the ultrastructural changes found in the sperm cells from the cat of this case report, we can confirm the occurrence of the Dag-like defect in domestic cats, as reported previously in other species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098612X12469368">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098612X12469368"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098612X12469368"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12469368">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098612X12469368">18</xref></sup> Moreover, this cat also exhibited a high incidence of other sperm abnormalities, such as bent tail with or without cytoplasmic droplet and macrocephalia, which are common findings in teratospermic cats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098612X12469368">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098612X12469368">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding the sperm motion parameters, as expected, the high incidence of sperm tail defects displayed by the teratospermic cat clearly impaired sperm motility and velocity. In addition, the teratospermic cat from this report showed lower DNA integrity when compared with its normospermic counterparts, which is in accordance with the findings of Penfold et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098612X12469368">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a previous study, teratospermic cats demonstrated an increased sperm output, mainly due to a reduced elimination of the defective spermatogenic cells via apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098612X12469368">22</xref></sup> In contrast, in this report, although the testicular volume of the teratospermic cat was slightly higher compared with the normospermic cats, the total sperm quantity was lower. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that retrograde flow of sperm cells into the urinary bladder during natural mating or semen collection by an artificial vagina can occur in the domestic cat,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098612X12469368">23</xref></sup> making it difficult, at times, to evaluate sperm production accurately.</p>
<p>Over the past few years possible causes for the occurrence of the Dag or Dag-like defect have been suggested and include a weakness in the outer dense fibers due to zinc excess,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098612X12469368">24</xref></sup> premature release of hydrolytic enzymes from the distal droplet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098612X12469368">19</xref></sup> or, most likely, a malformation in the mitochondrial sheath during late spermiogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12469368">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098612X12469368">25</xref></sup> In this report, considering the fact that testicular sperm cells from the teratospermic cat already presented some structural changes in the midpiece, perhaps the origin of the Dag-like defect in the domestic cat might be related to a disturbance in mitochondrial sheath formation, as hypothesized previously in other species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098612X12469368">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12469368">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098612X12469368">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098612X12469368">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although abnormal epididymal secretions can lead to bent tail defect, in some cases the underlying cause might be a structural weakness caused by abnormal development in spermiogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12469368">5</xref></sup> The fact that the teratospermic cat from this report showed normal values for BZn, SPZn and serum testosterone, the latter being one of the main regulators of epididymal function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098612X12469368">26</xref></sup> also adds some support to our hypothesis that the Dag-like defect has a testicular origin. Furthermore, once a high percentage of the sperm cells affected by the Dag-like defect also showed macrocephalia, an overall disturbance in the process of spermatogenesis might be involved.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a slight decrease in the percentage of macrocephalic sperm cells with or without the Dag-like defect was found after epididymal transit, perhaps owing to the capacity of the cat epididymides to reduce morphologically abnormal spermatozoa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098612X12469368">10</xref></sup> Moreover, we observed an increase in coiling, folding and fracture of the midpiece after epididymal transit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098612X12469368">18</xref></sup> Epididymal sperm cells were retrieved in a medium that permitted the cells to start their motion and only then fixed in formol–saline for morphology assessment. For this reason, the finding of a similar percentage of the Dag-like defect between epididymal and ejaculated spermatozoa might be a consequence of gaining motility. It’s well-known that a normally developed mitochondrial sheath is essential in providing structural support to the axial fibers in the midpiece region during flagellar motion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098612X12469368">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12469368">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098612X12469368">18</xref></sup> which is not the case for the cells affected by the Dag-like defect.</p>
<p>In this case report, while no difference was observed for the BSe, lower SPSe was found for the cat presenting the Dag-like defect, even though all animals had received the same commercially-produced dry food for &gt;1 year before selenium measurement. Selenium-containing proteins represent a major polypeptide of the mitochondrial capsule, which is a rigid structural complex that, during maturation in the epididymides, becomes stabilized by disulfide bonds and organizes the mitochondrial sheath around the flagellum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098612X12469368">27</xref></sup> Thus, selenium deficiency in males can lead to a reduction or loss of motility and to an increase in spermatozoa abnormalities, localized mainly in the midpiece.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098612X12469368">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098612X12469368"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098612X12469368"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098612X12469368">31</xref></sup> Recently, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), a selenocysteine-containing selenoprotein, has been proposed to play a dual role in spermatozoa, both protecting it against lipid peroxidation and forming the mitochondrial capsule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098612X12469368">32</xref></sup> Taking into account that (i) the negative effect of selenium deficiency upon sperm quality has been proposed to appear only at an extremely low selenium intake in other species,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098612X12469368">29</xref></sup> (ii) the lack of information concerning the optimal selenium status regarding male fertility and (iii) the presence of normal BSe in this report, a correlation between the Dag-like defect occurrence and a low selenium concentration needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Considering that the tom cat of this report constantly displayed a high incidence of sperm tail defects, including the Dag-like defect, and no health or environmental disorders were detected, perhaps a genetic factor might be involved. Unfortunately, because both breeding and bloodline records from this tom cat are unknown, we cannot establish a hereditary basis for the Dag-like defect in cats, as seen in bulls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12469368">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098612X12469368">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098612X12469368">19</xref></sup> However, it is worth mentioning that teratospermia in felids can be linked to a reduction in genetic variability, which contributes to pleiomorphic sperm production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098612X12469368">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of the Dag-like defect in the domestic cat. Furthermore, evidence indicates a testicular origin for this sperm defect, probably during late spermiogenesis, although an epididymal disturbance may be also associated.</p>
