<p>This article explores trade union policies and actions towards migrant and ethnic minority workers in Italy and the Netherlands, drawing on union documents and interviews with trade unionists at different organizational levels. It examines how far the explanatory factors addressed in the migration studies and industrial relations literatures help in explaining the observed differences. The findings suggest an inverse relationship between union institutional embeddedness and the perception of migrant workers as ‘power resource’. Of particular relevance, in comparative perspective, are differences in internal union structures and dynamics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Trade union strategies towards migrant and ethnic minority workers have attracted increasing concern by academics and, more recently, by trade unions themselves. Migration scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680111429755">Castles, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959680111429755">Martens, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959680111429755">Vranken, 1990</xref>) have addressed the role that trade unions might play in promoting the economic, political and social inclusion of migrant and ethnic minority workers. More recently, industrial relations writers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959680111429755">Bronfenbrenner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959680111429755">Gall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959680111429755">Heery et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959680111429755">Milkman, 2006</xref>) have addressed the organizing of such workers as one of the strategies for union revitalization. Hence the literature suggests that their recruitment is in the mutual interest of the migrants and ethnic minorities themselves, the unions and society as a whole. Low union membership amongst these workers could be interpreted in two ways. First, it may result from insufficient effort by unions, either because of a general failure to see membership growth as a union ‘power resource’, or because of a reluctance to organize migrants and minorities specifically. Alternatively, modest or negative outcomes could reflect either external obstacles or internal dynamics hindering union efforts.</p>
<p>Effective investigation requires the combination of migration and employment relations studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959680111429755">McGovern, 2007</xref>). It is also necessary to treat trade unions as key actors: even if subject to external influences, they retain a degree of independence in their choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959680111429755">Frege and Kelly, 2003</xref>). This notion is shared by organizational and labour studies in explaining the behaviour and choices of representative associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959680111429755">Child et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959680111429755">Regini, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959680111429755">Schmitter and Streeck, 1981</xref>). According to these approaches, trade unions devise their (revitalization) strategies on the basis of available (power) resources and existing constraints, their ultimate goal being organizational strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959680111429755">Regini, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959680111429755">Turner, 2005</xref>). In the migration field, this notion implicitly characterizes those analyses that frame union choices in terms of dilemmas involved in representing migrant and ethnic minority workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959680111429755">Castles and Kosack, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959680111429755">Penninx and Roosblad, 2000</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959680111429755">Regini (1981)</xref>, framing union attitudes within dilemmas means rejecting the idea that union action is totally determined by external factors: unions make (temporary) choices between opposing exigencies according to available resources and external circumstances. Within these literatures, comparative studies converge around the identification of some factors as influential for union choices (social and economic change, employer and government strategies and union structure). However, while migration studies place a stronger emphasis on context-embedded factors, industrial relations studies also emphasize the relevance of internal union variables and dynamics (framing processes, union identity, communication processes). Starting from a combined perspective, this article first identifies different union responses to migrant and ethnic minority workers in two European countries, Italy and the Netherlands. Second, it analyses how far explanatory factors underlined by these literatures help in explaining union choices and accounting for differences.</p>

<title>The two national contexts</title>
<p>The Netherlands has a long history of immigration, whereas net immigration to Italy is relatively new. Following EU enlargement in 2004 and 2007, both countries have also become destinations for immigration flows from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The Dutch population of migrant origin derives mainly from former colonial territories (Indonesia, New Guinea, Suriname and Netherlands Antilles) as well as from Mediterranean countries (especially Turkey and Morocco). First generation migrants as well as people who have at least one parent who was born abroad are referred to as <italic>allochtonen</italic> (literally, from another country). The Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS) distinguishes between ‘Western’ and ‘non-Western’ <italic>allochtonen</italic>. The latter are those born, or whose parental origin lies, in Turkey, Africa, Latin America and Asia with the exception of Indonesia (the former Dutch East Indies) and Japan (considered ‘Westernized’). In 2010, <italic>allochtonen</italic> constituted 20.3 percent of the Dutch population (9.1% ‘Western’ and 11.2% ‘non-Western’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959680111429755">CBS, 2010</xref>). The biggest minority groups were Turkish (2.3%) and Moroccan (2.1%), half of whom are second generation, born to parents of foreign background in the Netherlands. Among Eastern European migrants, Poles were the most numerous (0.4% of the total population), followed by Romanians and Bulgarians.</p>
<p>In Italy, 6.5 percent of the population in 2009 was officially recorded as of migrant origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959680111429755">ISTAT, 2009</xref>), although the significant number of undocumented immigrants makes the real figure higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959680111429755">Reyneri, 2003</xref>). The migrant population is mainly first-generation (only 13.3% of those of migrant origin are Italian-born). The most numerous groups are Romanian, Albanian, Moroccan, Chinese and Ukrainian, constituting together the 50 percent of the foreign population. Romanians are the largest group (20% of foreign population).</p>
<p>In the last decade, both countries experienced a worsening social climate towards migrant workers, with more restrictive policies on immigration. In the Netherlands, the mid-1990s marked the shift of the public and political debate on migration towards ‘polarization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959680111429755">Penninx, 2006</xref>). The multiculturalist tradition has been weakened in favour of a more ‘assimilationist’ model: greater adaptation to Dutch norms and values was demanded, especially from Muslim migrants whose integration was considered particularly problematic. The events of 11 September 2001, and domestic events such as the murders of right-wing politician Pim Fortuyn and film-maker Theo van Gogh contributed to the worsening the social climate and affected political discourse. New policies restricted immigration of family members or marriage partners and asylum seekers. A rule was enacted requiring future residents to pass a language and culture test before arriving in the Netherlands. In Italy, immigration law linking legal residence and the exercise of civil rights to the validity of the employment contract contributed to the rise in undocumented migrants, often employed in the underground economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959680111429755">Reyneri, 2003</xref>). Residence rules for family reunification have been tightened and access to public housing by migrants has been limited. Asylum seekers find it particularly difficult to obtain the status of refugees. Anti-immigrant discourse has been directed in particular against Muslims and Roma. Physical violence against migrants has increased.</p>
<p>The two countries have very different employment relations systems: the Dutch model is one of the most corporatist in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959680111429755">Visser, 1998</xref>), while Italy displays more antagonistic industrial relations. Dutch ‘responsive’ corporatism involves high degrees of consensus, cooperation and coordination between the ‘social partners’ and the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959680111429755">Hemerijck, 1995</xref>). The tripartite SER (<italic>Sociaal-Economische Raad</italic>) advises government on wage and welfare policy, while the bi-partite StAr (<italic>Stichting van de Arbeid</italic>) prepares each new collective bargaining round and negotiates central agreements which influence negotiations at industry and enterprise levels. There is a strong legal distinction between collective bargaining, which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of trade unions, and employee participation within the enterprise through the works council (<italic>Ondernemingsraad</italic>, OR), mandatory in all firms with more than 35 employees. The OR is elected by all workers and is intended to promote the interests of the enterprise and its workforce; it has rights of consultation over important economic decisions by the company and codetermination on personnel issues, and monitors the implementation of collective agreements.</p>
<p>In Italy, relations between trade unions and employers’ associations are largely determined by the balance of power, rather than by stable institutional rules. The three major trade union confederations, <italic>Confederazione generale italiana del lavoro</italic> (CGIL), <italic>Confederazione Italiana dei Sindacati Lavoratori</italic> (CISL) and <italic>Unione Italiana del Lavoro</italic> (UIL) and the most important employers association (<italic>Confindustria</italic>) negotiate central agreements on general issues, usually with the active involvement of the government. Beneath this centralized level, the bargaining system is centred on the sectoral and company levels. Shop-floor bargaining is the task of the RSU (<italic>Rappresentanza sindacale unitaria</italic>), elected in firms with more than 15 employees. In the private sector, two-thirds of the representatives are elected by all workers (not just union members) and one-third are nominated by the unions signatory to the national collective agreement applied in the company.</p>
<p>In 2007, union density in the Netherlands was 21.2 percent, while in Italy it was 33.2 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959680111429755">Visser, 2010</xref>). There are no specific data on unionization of migrant and ethnic minority workers in the Netherlands, but the rate is generally assumed to be low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959680111429755">Grünell and van den Berge, 2008</xref>). In Italy, by contrast, in 2001 45 percent of migrant workers were affiliated to one of the main confederations, higher than among Italian nationals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959680111429755">Leonardi and Mottura, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959680111429755" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research design and methods</title>
<p>The research covers the period from the late 1990s to 2008 and focuses on the most representative unions in each country: the Dutch <italic>Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging</italic> FNV, with 63 percent of unionized workers in 2008, and the Italian CGIL with 48 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959680111429755">Carley, 2009</xref>). The FNV is an umbrella organization with 19 affiliated unions. The CGIL consists of two dimensions: the ‘horizontal’ or confederal dimension represented by 134 territorial units (<italic>Camere del lavoro</italic> – CdL) and the ‘vertical’ dimension with 10 affiliated industrial unions together with separate unions for pensioners and ‘atypical’ workers.</p>
<p>The study focuses on the metal-working sector, traditionally one of the best organized in both countries: covered by the multi-sectoral FNV-<italic>Bondgenoten</italic> in the Netherlands and FIOM-CGIL in Italy. The analysis also examines trade union representation at local level. In the Netherlands, the CORUS steel plant in Ijmuiden is chosen as an example of ‘best practice’ in terms of both union resilience and race relations. In the Italian case, the analysis focuses on two special structures at local level: the confederal <italic>Ufficio Immigrati</italic> (UI) in Milan and the sectoral <italic>Comitato Migranti</italic> (CM) in Brescia. Both structures constitute best practice in their own specific dimension.</p>
<p>My aim was to investigate unions’ efforts to include migrant and ethnic minority workers, and to analyze the gap between planned policies and their effective implementation (‘speech-action gap’). Inclusion is defined as the full recognition of such workers as union members, with equal social, employment, political and organizational rights and participation in both internal debates and the formation of general union strategies. Although indicators of inclusive outcomes (membership, number of union officials with migrant background, collective agreements including special clauses) are considered whenever possible, they are not treated as a measure of union efforts since they could be the outcome of a wide range of factors.</p>
<p>Data collection involved, first, analysis of 83 documents (37 Dutch, 45 Italian). Congress documents, guidelines for collective agreements, executive meeting reports and press releases are used as evidence of union rhetoric and policies towards the representation, recruitment and participation of migrant and ethnic minority workers. I also examined collective agreements at national and company levels, internal documents such as evaluation reports and secondary sources and official data. Second, I conducted 43 tape-recorded interviews with union officials, representatives and workers. At confederal level, these comprised two officials from FNV and four from CGIL; at sectoral level, 11 officials and representatives from <italic>Bondgenoten</italic> and three FIOM officials; at local level, two <italic>Bondgenoten</italic> officials, seven activists and three non-union workers, and eleven officials and representatives from CGIL and FIOM. Interviewees were mostly chosen on the basis of their role in the policy-making and implementation processes, with a view to reconstructing the speech-action gap and, where possible, the effects of union action.</p>

<title>FNV and FNV-Bondgenoten: Rhetoric and actions</title>
<p>In the early 2000s, both FNV and <italic>Bondgenoten</italic> embraced ‘diversity policy’ (<italic>diversiteitsbeleid</italic>) as the main model of action towards migrant and ethnic minority workers. This replaced special policies oriented to target groups by interventions based on the characteristics of individuals. In the union’s view, this avoided stigmatizing groups and offered greater scope to fight different types of discrimination. Nevertheless, positive policies towards migrants and ethnic minorities as ‘target groups’ were not abandoned. FNV mostly focused on the disadvantageous position of ethnic minority workers on the labour market and promoted central negotiations with counterparts on issues such as employability, vocational training and discrimination. This resulted in several formal and informal agreements that constituted the FNV policy addressed to affiliated unions which were generally responsible for implementation. In order to coordinate the tasks of affiliates, the FNV established a ‘Diversity Task Force’, alongside the existing advisory <italic>Secretariaat Etnische Minderheden</italic> (Secretariat for Ethnic Minorities). FNV also planned specific campaigns (such as the ‘On the way to the top’ campaign) aimed at ‘increasing diversity within the trade unions’ by incorporating target group members into union board structures (FNV policy advisor). An evaluation report for the congress period 2001–05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959680111429755">FNV, 2005</xref>) reported however that most of these policies remained dormant. In 2003, FNV ended the Diversity Task Force and declared that affiliated unions and the federation had to continue working on diversity policy independently. The project aimed at recruiting target group officials was cancelled after a few unsuccessful rounds of interviews.</p>
<p>FNV-<italic>Bondgenoten</italic> included federal policy statements in its congress documents and in guidelines for sectoral bargaining. It also established its own advisory body, the <italic>Kadergroep Kleurrijke Bondgenoten</italic> (KKB), made up of activists appointed by the union. The planning of special policies was delegated to this body, but this proved ineffective and its activities practically terminated by the end of 2003. According to a study commissioned from an external organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680111429755">Buro Cato, 2001</xref>), the KKB lacked both the economic resources and internal links to carry out its task. Federal policies were scarcely translated into collective agreements. Trade unionists interviewed often attributed this failure to the resistance of employers, who cannot be ‘forced or obliged to hire them’ (<italic>Bondgenoten</italic> official). In 2005, both FNV and <italic>Bondgenoten</italic> recognized the weak implementation of ethnic minority policies. FNV attributed this failure to the worsening social climate and increasing conflicts between native and ethnic minority workers. <italic>Bondgenoten</italic> also encountered severe economic and organizational problems in the years immediately following its creation through the merger of four FNV affiliates in 1998. Such problems forced the union to focus on organizational priorities and delaying the debate on innovative strategies.</p>
<p>In April 2005, FNV published a report entitled <italic>The Trade Union Movement of the Future: Lessons from Abroad</italic>. The intention was to provide new inputs for Dutch unions, which were trying to ‘redefine themselves’ in the light of the social and political changes in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680111429755">Kloosterboer, 2007</xref>: 18). In 2004, FNV opposed the policies of the second centre-right Balkenende cabinet whose attitude had provoked a breakdown in the consensual model of social dialogue. Its protests culminated in the second largest demonstration of the post-war period, and forced the government back to the negotiation table. As a result of this mobilization, promoting workers’ participation and representing unrepresented groups became important issues, and organizing migrant and ethnic minority workers was defined as an ‘emergency to survive’ (FNV policy advisor).</p>
<p>After 2005, FNV increased its coordination and monitoring of affiliates’ actions on migrant and ethnic minority issues, by enforcing the <italic>Contact-Commissie Etnische Minderheden</italic> (CCEM). It also established a commission to disseminate good practices on diversity policy in each of the affiliates. Considerable resources were allocated to special measures for ethnic minority workers (€78,000, compared to €66,000 for women’s activities). This programme included initiatives in the fields of labour market entry, language problems, vocational training, inclusion of ethnic minorities within union executive committees and recruitment activities. Another important campaign was organized to reduce the gap affecting pension benefits of people who had worked for a period abroad. <italic>Bondgenoten</italic> followed the common plan of action, allocating its own resources to specific projects. Among these, the ‘Shop-floor Dialogue’ project involved workplace meetings to facilitate relations between native and ethnic minority workers and ‘rebuild solidarity’. In 2007, the union launched a campaign in the cleaning sector (which employed primarily migrant workers) modelled on the US ‘Justice for Janitors’ movement. After protracted strike action, the union won an agreement on higher wages, vocational training, language courses and a more transparent collective agreement.</p>
<p>Specific concerns about new labour immigration (‘the Polish worker issue’) resulted in the ‘Equal work, equal pay’ campaign, which aimed at securing legal improvements for wages and working conditions for foreign workers. Even if framed within the ‘social dumping’ debate (FNV policy advisor), this campaign envisaged the introduction of special clauses in collective agreements on housing and living conditions for new migrants. Despite the increased formal concern for migrant and ethnic minority workers, the special measures envisaged were in reality scarcely implemented. The collective agreements analysed (Metaal en Techniek 2005–2008; Metalektro 2004–2008) did not include special clauses for ethnic minority workers, with the exception of the right to exchange Christian for non-Christian holidays. Furthermore, ‘if special measures were included in collective agreements, they were not implemented on the shop floor’ (anti-discrimination representative). Migrant and ethnic minority members were estimated to account for between 2 and 5 percent of the overall membership and no significant increase was reported in the period considered (CCEM member). All interviewees, with few exceptions, declared that language problems and/or cultural obstacles made the unionization of both migrant and ethnic minority workers very difficult: ‘Dutch Caribbeans don’t trust unions as institutions’ (anti-discrimination representative); ‘Moroccans . . . come here from an agricultural society and have no experience of unions’ (CCEM member); ‘we really try everything but some people have real language problems’ (KKB member).</p>
<p>The incorporation of migrants was also low, both within executive structures where ‘you see some women in important positions . . . but no ethnic minorities’ (FNV policy advisor) and as officials: ‘out of 200 people in this building, I have a colleague who is Moroccan, a Turk and two or three with Surinamese backgrounds. It is not the diversity, frankly speaking, we want in this building’ (FNV policy advisor). Within Corus, migrants were estimated to represent just five out of 150 union activists, and two out of 60 works councillors (workplace representative). To explain the implementation gap, one of the points most often mentioned by high-level trade unionists is resistance by employers. However, other issues also came up during interviews with trade unionists at lower levels. Some special programmes simply did not reach workplaces, as in the case of the ‘Shop-floor Dialogue’:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I really wanted this dialogue inside Corus, it was autumn 2006; he [regional trade union official] was very busy with collective negotiations. After that there was the takeover by Tata Steel. But besides this very busy period, he also had doubts about these dialogues. He wondered if it was wise to talk so explicitly about indigenous and immigrant workers. He thought it was better not to talk about that, because maybe you create problems that are not there (workplace representative).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Three of the <italic>Bondgenoten</italic> officials interviewed mentioned problems such as the limited amount of time remaining after the preparation of company agreements, or the size of the territorial area they had to cover. Such problems made their regular presence at workplaces very difficult. Special programmes often consisted of one-off initiatives carried out by external union officials and did not envisage any long-term implementation. An external evaluation of the ‘Shop-floor Dialogue’ programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959680111429755">TNO, 2006</xref>) concluded that one of the weaknesses of that project, besides resistance by employers, was poor cooperation between low-level officials and union activists. Comments such as ‘it is not an issue in our organization’, ‘it hasn’t got priority, I don’t have time for this’ and ‘it is only useful if there is a follow-up’ were common. Two union activists within Corus affirmed that they considered recruiting and organizing campaigns as ‘too much talking without any real action’. One of them, in particular, considered that such initiatives undermined their own position: ‘they come from outside . . . people feel, let’s say, attacked by it: there is somebody from the central office coming to tell us how we should work in our own company’. Only on one occasion were discrimination and racism mentioned to explain the low level of participation of migrant workers within workplaces.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959680111429755">
<title>CGIL and FIOM: Rhetoric and actions</title>
<p>In CGIL, the formal debate on migrant representation developed along two lines: ‘individual protection’ and ‘collective representation’. The first position explicitly focused on the defence of migrants’ citizenship rights, emphasizing ‘the importance of the person’ rather than the worker. At national level, this approach resulted in attempts to influence legislation on immigration by promoting negotiations with counterparts and resorting to political demonstrations. At decentralized level, the CGIL provided free services to migrants in several fields such as assistance with applications for work permits and entry visas, renewal and duplication of residence permits, family reunification, asylum applications and mediation with local authorities and the police. Following the 2002 amnesty for irregular migrants, CGIL worked on the regularization of foreigners, handling bureaucratic requirements and offering legal services to migrants when employers refused to regularize them. Special bodies with advisory and coordinating functions were established at national, regional and municipal levels.</p>
<p>The emphasis on the citizenship rights of migrants became more central in the 2000s when the centre-right government (which included the <italic>Lega Nord</italic>) implemented more restrictive immigration policies and reduced the room for social dialogue. In a period characterized by the growth of social hostility and institutional racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959680111429755">Grillo and Pratt, 2002</xref>) and by increasing social conflict, CGIL strengthened the defence of the social rights of migrants and organized several anti-discrimination campaigns. The development of service activities provided a counterbalance to the deficiencies of public administration, which ‘neglects the fact that foreigners have needs and problems . . . We are forced to take care of this work because if we don’t do it, who will?’ (UI member). In 2006, 27,200 legal procedures were initiated by the <italic>Camera del lavoro metropolitana</italic> (CdLM) in Milan (where there are 170,000 foreign residents); 37 percent concerned work permits; 22 percent residence permit renewals, family reunification and asylum applications; 6 percent concerned individual problems and were resolved with the help of a lawyer; 15 percent involved mediation with municipal offices; and 20 percent the provision of general information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959680111429755">CGIL-CdLM, 2006</xref>). Although service provision was free and did not require membership, territorial structures became an important channel for migrant unionization. The number of migrants joining the CGIL in Milan through the CdLM increased from 1776 in 2000 to 10,234 in 2006. CGIL data for 2007 estimated that migrants represented 10 percent of the total active membership, and that numbers were increasing by about 20 percent a year. Attempts to influence national immigration policies and negotiate with local authorities were less successful, however. When asked about this issue, all interviewees mentioned the difficult relationship with the centre-right government and local councils.</p>
<p>A second approach focused on the representation of migrants’ labour rights and their status as workers. This line of action developed strongly within FIOM during the 2000s, alongside the growth in numbers of migrant metalworkers and members. Bargaining was defined as the main instrument for the elimination of disparities in migrant workers’ conditions, and at the same time promoted effective equality and worker unity (FIOM general secretary Lombardia). Bargaining concerned wages, vocational training, the recognition of qualifications, social benefits, health and housing. At its 2004 Congress, FIOM called for the inclusion of migrants on union executive bodies in proportion to their membership, as an indicator of union democracy and a measure of <italic>representativity</italic>. Strong importance was placed on migrant workers’ participation in union debates and actions. With this in mind, FIOM promoted the formation of specific groups at the territorial level (<italic>Comitati migranti</italic>, CMs) consisting of migrant workers, workplace representatives and officials. These groups were ‘to prepare proposals for national and company bargaining and to prepare the discussion for the board committees and the higher levels’ (CM member). Representatives of municipal groups were part of the national <italic>Coordinamento Migranti</italic> which was involved in national policy-making.</p>
<p>At its 2006 Congress, FIOM strengthened its commitment towards migrant workers. Congress documents incorporated advice from the national meetings of migrant metalworkers with respect to union actions on legislation, negotiating activities and organizational practices. The inclusion of migrant workers was defined as one of the main means to increase the bargaining power of all workers and the FIOM at workplace level. FIOM emphasized the increasing unionization of migrant workers as a fundamental resource:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Industrial restructuring . . . requires a yearly membership growth of 20 percent to maintain the same level of representation. Since we are an organization that founds its resources on association quotas and its negotiating capacity on workers’ consent, we have to consider this aspect as a priority . . . we need the organized strength of migrants, and for this reason we must change how the organization works.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A new statute established that 8 percent of executive board members at all levels had to be migrants. No recruitment campaigns were mentioned however. When asked about this deficiency, the general secretary of FIOM Lombardia replied:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Since the presence of migrant workers is high, we think that it is a priority to represent them. If this corresponds to a further membership increase, it means that our responses to their problems have been good. It can’t be like in other places: ‘if you want us to defend you, you must first become a member’. This method is not part of our identity . . . we claim to be the union of all workers, not only of our members.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Wide scope was given to the inclusion of bargaining policies for migrant workers in both national and company agreements. In 2008, specific clauses for migrant workers were included in the national collective agreement. At regional and municipal levels, CMs autonomously implemented several initiatives and worked in close collaboration with the union for the definition of special union measures: ‘none of us speaks as a member of the Committee but always as a member of FIOM. The Committee is not made up of puppets but of people with political abilities who can make proposals to the union, and the union recognizes this’ (CM member).</p>
<p>By the mid-2000s, specific ameliorative clauses in company agreements became very frequent in the northern regions of Italy. Examples include cumulating holidays or their prolongation, specific food or places for prayer in workplaces during the most important religious festivities, and leaves of absence with one day’s notice to deal with administrative procedures connected with residence permits. While trying to secure ameliorative clauses for migrant workers, the migrant representatives interviewed declared that they were aware of the importance of maintaining workers’ unity:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>While for migrant workers second-level bargaining means access to basic rights, for Italian workers it means gaining something more, because they already had full access to the rights established by national agreements. If you are good at explaining, Italians understand and agree with you. The biggest mistake is failing to explain that we are doing all this for workers, all workers, and that there are no more important or less important workers. If we fail, our workers will vote for <italic>Lega Nord</italic>. The skill is merging different identities into one that is the workers’ identity. (CM member)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In 2007, migrants constituted 8.05 percent of total FIOM membership. However, the percentage varied strongly across regions and cities according to the presence of migrant workers in the metal sector. In Lombardia the rate was 8.56 percent of the total (with Brescia reaching 13.3%); in Emilia Romagna, 16.5 percent; in Treviso (Veneto), 22.9 percent. On the basis of an internal FIOM survey in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959680111429755">Como, 2008</xref>), 57.7 percent of 3000 migrant metalworkers interviewed were unionized, and one third were FIOM members. The same research reported that 3.4 percent of the 3000 migrant metalworkers interviewed were workplace delegates.</p>
<p>In 2007, migrants included in executive board structures in Lombardy numbered 77 (three of whom were women), constituting 1.3 percent of total board members. At national level, five of the 181 members of FIOM’s highest executive body (<italic>Comitato Direttivo</italic>) were migrants (none of them were women). In 2008, for the first time, the FIOM elected a migrant unionist as one of its presidents. Even when taking into account the fact that quota policies were only established in 2006, the migrant presence in board structures is rather low when compared with membership. When asked about this, both migrant and Italian interviewees mentioned the shortage of migrant members with the necessary skills.</p>

<title>Explaining union choices in comparative perspective</title>
<p>Differences between the two cases are evident in both union rhetoric and union action. Dutch special policies mainly concerned employment issues. Special measures were most often provided in the form of short-term campaigns and initiatives. The content of negotiations within bipartite and tripartite bodies and internal policy declarations were established at central level. In the Italian case, debate was much more embedded in traditional union discourse, addressing both the social and industrial rights of migrants. Special measures were integrated into existing practices. Most initiatives were planned at decentralized level, and unions’ central policies also integrated bottom-up initiatives. These two models have different impacts on migrant workers’ inclusion. Although the quantitative data do not allow for systematic comparison, the qualitative data highlight the stronger power of attraction and a higher level of participation in the Italian case. Furthermore, the speech-action gap, taken as an indicator of union efforts, was wider in the Dutch case than the Italian one. It is therefore important to consider to what extent the causal factors emphasized by the migration and industrial relations literatures can help in understanding these differences.</p>
<p>Both literatures highlight social and economic factors. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959680111429755">Penninx and Roosblad (2000)</xref> hypothesize an inverse relationship between economic and labour market problems and inclusive union policies towards migrant and ethnic minority workers. They also stress the influence of factors such as national identity and ideology, public discourse, legislation, political structure and orientations. From 2000 to 2008, the Netherlands and Italy experienced similar contextual changes, with economic recession causing increased unemployment. National politics were dominated by centre-right governments and the increasing electoral success of xenophobic parties. Furthermore, both countries saw a rapid worsening in the social climate and an increase of discrimination. The political discourse, more so in Italy than in the Netherlands, was dominated by debates on security and irregular migrants. Such developments did not, however, have the same effects in the two countries. Although it is difficult to evaluate precisely the extent to which these changes were influential, in 2005 the FNV acknowledged the weakness of its efforts over the previous five years regarding migrant and ethnic minority workers, and explained the ending of special programmes by the presence of ‘more urgent priorities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959680111429755">FNV, 2005</xref>: 4). While facing similar economic and social challenges, CGIL and FIOM instead strengthened their formal commitment to the defence of migrant rights and responded to the ‘increasing uninterest’ of public authorities by strengthening their service activities. Hence social and economic forces can only partially explain different union attitudes in the two cases.</p>
<p>A second influential variable is the union’s institutional embeddedness, that is its position within, and influence on, the socio-economic policy making process. On the one hand, institutional embeddedness is the result of several institutional factors that may facilitate or hinder union involvement in national policy making. On the other, it is the result of state and employer strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959680111429755">Geary, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959680111429755">Poole, 1986</xref>) which can either guarantee or deny ‘institutional recognition’ to trade unions. Migration scholars regard the position occupied in the national decision-making process as a key variable in explaining union actions towards migrant workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959680111429755">Penninx and Roosblad, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959680111429755">Vranken, 1990</xref>). In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959680111429755">Penninx and Roosblad (2000</xref>: 14) state that ‘the more powerful a trade union is, the more effectively it will be able to steer government policy related to immigration in a direction favourable to the union’. However, the two scholars do not find any causal relation between a stronger or weaker ‘power position’ and the ‘direction’ of union action towards migrant workers. Yet research findings suggest an inverse relationship between union institutional embeddedness and union efforts to include migrant and ethnic minority workers. The institutionally embedded FNV increased its efforts to organize migrant and ethnic minority workers soon after the deadlock in social dialogue in 2004. In the Italian case, the anti-union attitudes of the centre-right administration and the rupture of inter-union unity strengthened the existing actions of CGIL to include migrant workers. The stable engagement in corporatist processes may also explain the stronger influence of external changes on Dutch union attitudes and the limitation of union initiatives to employment issues. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959680111429755">Penninx and Roosblad (2000</xref>: 196) explain, ‘those unions which are strongly committed to common socio-economic decision-making have tied their hands much more, and tend to stick more closely to the core activity of trade unions’. However, institutional embeddedness only partially accounts for the different extent of the speech-action gap. In the Dutch case, for instance, the implementation gap persisted even after 2005, when FNV increased its attention to migrant issues. In this respect, differences are better explained by internal union variables and dynamics.</p>
<p>Union structure is a particularly relevant factor. FNV does not have decentralized structures and relies mostly on affiliated unions for the implementation of its policies. Furthermore, <italic>Bondgenoten</italic> has less of a presence in workplaces than in the Italian case. This negatively influenced union representative action on the shop floor, weakened the implementation of special measures and the ability to build stable contacts with migrant and ethnic minority workers: ‘if the union does things, then it gets more members. But I only see the union every two years, during the collective agreement negotiations’ (Corus migrant worker). The top-down character of internal communication accounts for the low level of discussion and informal exchanges among trade unionists at different levels. In the case of Corus, where the unionization rate (about 34%) was relatively high by national standards, the link between activists and the union organization was rather weak. Their ‘political’ participation in unions was limited to workplace actions and reflected a ‘company-based’ union identity. Corus unionists declared that they ‘feel more locally involved’ and ‘do more by ourselves than in contact with the union’ (union activist and works councillor). This hinders the implementation of union policies, especially when these are regarded as extraneous to the workplace situation or interpreted as an encroachment on their work.</p>
<p>In the Italian case, the capillary structure of unions guarantees both the federation and affiliated unions the structural requisites for the implementation of their own specific initiatives. Decentralized confederal and sectoral structures and the strong presence of trade unions in workplaces turned out to be important in acquiring awareness of migrant workers’ needs ‘because it is necessary to know the people you are representing before negotiating for them and this is especially true for migrants’ (FIOM official). Decentralized structures have greater autonomy of action both in planning and implementing special policies suited to local circumstances. Often, local measures and initiatives generate a bottom-up decision-making process and become included in union guidelines. In this respect, the FIOM secretary in Brescia declared: ‘in our opinion, bargaining has to be carried out with close relations among national, territorial and workplace levels. Decision-making procedures, the way we formulate demands . . . we are not institutionalized.’ At the same time, however, central structures have an important role in coordinating the activity of lower levels. ‘Coordination is carried out by Sveva [head of the FIOM migrant office] at national level. She keeps all of us united and organizes everything at national level’ (CM member). Furthermore, the FIOM workplace representatives constituted a good communication link between the organization and (migrant) workers: ‘if there are problems within a firm, the <italic>delegati</italic> contact FIOM, which has the task of solving them. <italic>Delegati</italic> ask for information and they come here with workers’ (local official). Hence in the Italian case, ‘vertical interlinkages’ facilitated the diffusion of organizational policies to the workplaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959680111429755">Waddington, 2000</xref>) and implementation was aided by a more balanced consolidation of central and decentralized levels and effective communication among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959680111429755">Hyman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680111429755">Kjellberg, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The stronger union involvement of migrant workers in the Italian case is also explained by union ideologies. Solidarity, ranging from employment conditions to broader issues in the social and political sphere, and also encompassing justice in the workplace, was an essential element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959680111429755">Brown and Jarley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959680111429755">Phizacklea and Miles, 1980</xref>).</p>

<p>In workplaces, when migrants understand that the trade unions are there for them . . . when representatives are able not only to give them collective responses but also to help them with their individual problems . . . they are with the union from all points of view. (FIOM general secretary Lombardia)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The <italic>Uffici Immigrati</italic> became important contact points for migrants, and ‘migrants saw that the union was ready to help them’ (UI member). Their perception of the value of this work constituted the key step leading from passive adhesion to a union to effective involvement in the organization. The increasing number of migrant workplace representatives, elected by all workers (in cities with strong electoral support for <italic>Lega Nord</italic>), was possibly the most important inclusive outcome promoted by FIOM and constituted an important means for social integration.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When a Senegalese representative is elected in the RSU by all workers because he is a very good trade unionist . . . it is not important if he is Italian or foreign, Senegalese, Chinese, Albanian . . . Do you understand the explosive effect from a cultural point of view? . . . This is the only way towards real integration. (UI member)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The last influential variable resulting from the analysis is trade union identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959680111429755">Hyman, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959680111429755">2001</xref>), in the Italian case evidently linked to the differences between CGIL and FIOM strategies and actions. CGIL’s attention to the social rights of migrants reflects its identity, lying ‘between class and society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959680111429755">Hyman, 2001</xref>). The defence of the social rights of ‘disadvantaged groups’ and engagement with problems not strictly related to employment issues have always been considered confederal tasks. While sectoral unions mainly defend the particular labour interests of workers belonging to a specific occupation, CGIL is the locus where these different interests are brought together to achieve general solidarity among all workers in the interests of social unity and the country as a whole. These drives have pushed CGIL to intervene in the social and political sphere, acting as a ‘political subject’ and using different means to influence national and local policy-making. FIOM’s identity between ‘market and class’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959680111429755">Hyman, 2001</xref>) explains its focus on employment rights and collective bargaining. The emphasis on internal democracy, an inherited union tradition, made the inclusion of migrant workers within the organization a sign of internal coherence. The strong call for class identity required union (migrant) workplace representatives to be impartial representatives of all workers independently of their cultural background or membership. In the Dutch case, despite the formal emphasis on organizing, institutional influence based on the ‘political dimension’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959680111429755">Behrens et al., 2004</xref>) constituted the main factor shaping general union action. The definition of migrant worker inclusion as a union ‘power resource’ in 2005 did not result, at least over the following three years, in any attempt to achieve relevant organizational changes. Union culture and traditional practices reflect a union identity between ‘society and market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959680111429755">Hyman, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Both Dutch and Italian unions have declared that they include migrant and ethnic minority workers and consider them a ‘strategic’ opportunity. However, analysis has revealed a wider speech-action gap in the Dutch case than the Italian. Even if the Italian union is far from achieving its declared goals, it shows a much higher power of attraction for migrant workers, a stronger commitment to organizational change and a wider consideration of migrants’ specific problems related to their condition as <italic>migrants</italic> and as <italic>workers</italic>.</p>
<p>Variables addressed by both migration and industrial relations studies have been shown to influence union responses; but in the main they cannot account for the differences between the two countries, nor explain the speech-action gap. The worsening economic and social conditions, including the spread of xenophobic political discourse and increasing social discrimination, resulted in a decrease in Dutch union attention to migrant worker issues, but this did not occur in Italy. In a comparative perspective, then, this variable has not displayed the relevance found in other recent comparative analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959680111429755">Krings, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959680111429755">Wrench, 2004</xref>). Instead, our findings suggest a relationship between the degree of institutional embeddedness and union perception of migrant and ethnic minority inclusion as either ‘threat’ or ‘opportunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959680111429755">Frege and Kelly, 2003</xref>). More inclusive stances coincide either with the rupture of social dialogue, as in the Dutch case, or with periods of more antagonistic relations with government, employers and other unions, as in Italy. Institutionally embedded trade unions thus perceive migrant worker unionization and participation as less relevant for organizational strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959680111429755">Baccaro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959680111429755">Regalia, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959680111429755">Visser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959680111429755">Wrench, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>However, union commitment to inclusion of migrant and ethnic minority workers, shared by unions in both countries in the second half of the 2000s, only partially accounts for inclusive <italic>action</italic>. Different degrees of speech-action gap are very much dependent on internal union variables and dynamics. Decentralized structures, union presence in the workplace, a balance between top-down and bottom-up processes and mechanisms promoting migrants’ participation are central to explaining the narrow speech-action gap in the Italian cases. Finally, union identity has been influential in explaining the quality and content of union policies. In the Italian case, the defence of social rights based on the idea of ‘universal solidarity’, the focus on the ‘equality of all workers’ and ‘internal democracy’ have resulted in actions aimed at promoting an ‘identity-based’ participation of migrant unionists.</p>
<p>Our findings thus indicate that despite similar contextual challenges and sectoral contexts, trade unions can opt for very different strategic choices. Such strategies, as well as the extent to which they are implemented and, to a large extent, their outcomes strongly depend on internal union variables and dynamics.</p>
