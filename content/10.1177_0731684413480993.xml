<abstract>
<p>Natural fibre-reinforced polymer composites are nowadays receiving considerable attention, especially in the automobile and civil engineering industries. Reduction in flammability characteristics besides retention of their excellent mechanical properties will ensure wider market for these composites. Polypropylene matrix was reinforced with 30 and 50 wt% of flax fibres. Magnesium hydroxide was added at different levels of 0, 20 and 30 wt% in order to investigate the flammability resistance behaviour. Thermal and thermomechanical tests were carried out in order to evaluate new and recycled composites. Limited oxygen index was improved to more than 27 with 50 wt% flax/30% magnesium hydroxide, although very slow burning rate in the horizontal test condition was achieved with 30/30, 50/20 and 50/30 wt% for flax/magnesium hydroxides. Regarding the UL94 test, no sample passed vertical burn test. Recycling of these composites was investigated and showed 4 and 10% decrease in strength and stiffness, respectively. Recycling experiments on 50/30 system showed an effect of 5% limited oxygen index decrease after reprocessing for two cycles.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684413480993" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Finding new applications for natural fibres-reinforced polymers (NFRP) in the international market is increasingly becoming attractive due to the following factors: fibre price, availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413480993">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413480993">2</xref></sup> and high strength to weight ratios.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413480993">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413480993">4</xref></sup> Besides, the current polymer production machines such as the extruder and the injection moulding machine are capable of handling these composites. The negative impact on the environment diminishes when compared with products made of glass and carbon fibres. The application of NFRP composites is mostly concentrated in the automobile industry and the civil engineering sectors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413480993">2</xref></sup> However, NFRP composites will still look for technical solutions to problems that hinder the growth of their markets, namely, the limited window of the processing temperature for natural fibres, inconsistent mechanical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413480993">5</xref></sup> and hydrophilic nature of the fibre, which prevents perfect adhesion with the polymer matrix on one side<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413480993">6</xref></sup> and from the other side, increases its affinity to water absorption that results in dimensional instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413480993">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413480993"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413480993">7</xref></sup> Bacterial degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413480993">4</xref></sup> also presents a threatening problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0731684413480993"><title>Motivation and literature review</title>
<p>One of the most urgent problems, especially for the construction industry, is the insufficient data about the sensitivity of these composites to flame.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413480993">8</xref></sup> Even Brosius<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413480993">9</xref></sup> reported that the use of NFRP has been excluded from most aircraft, rail and subway markets until the issues of flame, smoke and toxicity are resolved. The use of these composites requires that they should pass regulatory safety tests such as IEC regulations for electrical appliances, ASTM E 108, UL 1256, ASTM D635-98 [UL94], EN 1187 for building, roofing and decorative materials as well as DIN 5510 for low toxic material in the confined areas, especially in transport applications.</p>
<p>The flammability behaviour of NFRP is governed by the polymeric matrix and the fibre type. This study deals with the degradation of thermoplastics, especially polypropylene (PP). PP with its aliphatic structure degrades normally by random scission due to the presence of hydrogen atoms on all carbon atoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413480993">10</xref></sup> hence resulting in flammability. Compatibilsers, known as maleic anhydride-grafted-polypropylene (MAPP), are normally used for linking PP and the natural fibres. MAPP affects the flame resistance positively, where the cyclic anhydride structures are prone to slow down the hydrolysis and thus result in intramolecular cross-linking of the polymer chains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684413480993">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the flammability of natural fibre is governed by a number of factors, namely fibre constituents (lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, waxes, etc), the combustion characterisctics of the released organic volatiles during decomposition, degree of cellulose polymerisation and fibre orientation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413480993">12</xref></sup> Lignin releases less volatiles and thermally decomposes at a temperature greater than those of hemicellulose and cellulose but it starts to decompose normally at earlier temperatures (i.e. 160℃ for flax).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413480993">12</xref></sup> Higher amount of lignin lowers fibre decomposition temperature, as this is attributed to the decomposition of relatively weak bonds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413480993">13</xref></sup> According to Manfredi et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684413480993">14</xref></sup> lower content of lignin is desirable in order to delay the ignition start time. However, the aromatic rings present in lignin resist fibre oxidation. Cellulose is also considered to be more flammable because it produces volatile flammables ‘Levoglucosan,’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413480993">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413480993">15</xref></sup> which consequently yield flammable and non-flammable volatiles and gases, tar and char. An increase in crystallinity results in more levoglucosan during pyrolysis, which requires more activation energy to imitate pyrolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684413480993">16</xref></sup> Finally, more fibre orientation results, assumedly, in less oxygen permeability in fibres and hence flammability resistance is improved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413480993">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, flame retardant (FR) materials are necessary in order for them to be suitable for a wider range of applications. However, it should be considered that the implementation of such retardants might result in negative aspects that might compromise the mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413480993">8</xref></sup> Flame retardance and mechanical behaviour are necessary for composites. Flame retardance is revealed to be more effective if it can stop the ignition process during one of its steps, namely heating, decomposition, ignition, combustion and propagation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413480993">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413480993">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413480993">18</xref></sup> Kozlowski and Wladyka-Przybylak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684413480993">19</xref></sup> reported that this objective can be achieved by impregnation of the fibres with FR before compounding, or by implementation of FR during manufacturing processes or by insulation of the composite product in the finishing stages with intumescent materials in order to prevent the penetration of heat.</p>
<p>Flame retardance, in general, can be employed either by chemical or physical mode of actions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413480993">20</xref></sup> Physical mode flame retardation mechanism takes place by cooling resulting from the endothermic reactions accompanying the degradation of metallic hydroxides such as aluminium trihydrate or magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>) due to its relatively higher thermal stability. The physical mode of action can also take place by the formation of a protective layer when the additive FR forms a shield with low thermal conductivity upon exposure to heat flux, i.e. phosphorous additive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413480993">20</xref></sup> It is reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413480993">20</xref></sup> that almost 75% of the flame retardancy industry for polyolefins uses the metallic hydroxide technique. This is attributed to the possibility of reaching the V-0 rating in UL94V test. Not only this, the smoke emission during burning is also reduced. Interestingly, it is reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413480993">8</xref></sup> that the use of boric acid or zinc borate will have a synergetic effect with Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> that can result in an excellent behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413480993">8</xref></sup> However, lower limited oxygen index (LOI) and horizontal flame speed are obtained in comparison with the Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>-treated composite without any other additives. Also, the tensile and the flexural properties attained by the fibres treated with Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> are reduced by almost 15%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413480993">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the recycling of these novel brands of composites presents a great question. Thus, will they retain their mechanical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413480993">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413480993">22</xref></sup> and their flame resistance? Moran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413480993">22</xref></sup> pointed out that the stiffness as well as the strength are increased. This was attributed to better dispersion of fibres after multi extrusion cycles despite the chain scission (melt flow, apparent viscosity). Hence, the impact toughness deteriorates. Moran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413480993">22</xref></sup> concluded that more than three cycles could have remarkably negative effects on the overall performance of PP loaded with 20% flax. On the contrary, Duigou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413480993">21</xref></sup> found that repeated injection moulding caused only a slight improvement of stiffness and about 30% drop in strength for the 30% flax was obtained. It was concluded that deteriorating behaviour was not noticed with regard to the rheology and glass transition temperature of the composites. However, few studies such as those of Duigou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413480993">21</xref></sup> and Moran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413480993">22</xref></sup> have been published regarding the effect of recycling on flame resistance.</p>
<p>This study aims to investigate the application of FR in one of the most widely produced natural fibre thermoplastic composite systems, which is flax/PP. Flax is known for its high cellulosic content, high strength, low cost, low density and recyclability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413480993">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413480993"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413480993">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413480993">23</xref></sup> For flame retardance, only Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> is considered in this study. Other types of FR are not considered, as published in previous literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684413480993">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684413480993">25</xref></sup> The following points, namely the fibre content, FR content and number of injection cycles are considered in this study.</p>

<p>Flax fibres were treated, as shown in the study of El-sabbagh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684413480993">26</xref></sup> by 5% NaOH solution for 1 h, then washed and dried overnight at 100℃ in an oven. This alkalinisation process aims to remove possible impurities and increase the available area for coupling with the PP matrix. Fibres were manually cut to short fibres of on average 40 mm, then dried at 80℃ for 2 h. Kneading takes place in a Haake kneader or roller mixer in a small mixing chamber of 50 cm<sup>3</sup>. Kneading proceeds as follows: PP was mixed with MAPP, Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> and short flax fibres. To determine the appropriate kneading temperature and speed, preliminary experiments were performed in order to obtain homogeneous distribution of fibres within the matrix. Kneading speed was 50 rpm and was maintained for 15 min at 170℃. Then the speed was increased to 100 rpm for another 10 min. The stepped up speed was intended to help in breaking up the agglomerated fibres. The compound was cooled down in air and visually checked for any agglomerate formed during processing. The compound was shredded and dried overnight at 80℃ before injection moulding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413480993">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows how the compound looks after kneading and whether it is homogeneous, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413480993">Figure 1(b)</xref>, or inhomogeneous, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413480993">Figure 1(c)</xref>. Different parameters, namely the fibre content at 30 and 50 wt% and the FR content at 0, 20 and 30 wt% were investigated in this study. Only six samples were compounded. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684413480993">Table 2</xref> provides the data of the six experiments that were conducted and the composition corresponding to each one. Each sample is denoted with the governing percentages of fibre and FR. After shredding of the compound, the resulting granulates were injection-moulded at a temperature profile of 185–190–195–200℃ using Allrounder 220C, Arburg, Lossburg, Germany. The injection-moulded samples were partially divided, where some of the samples were shredded, dried and re-injected once and twice, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684413480993">Table 2</xref>. Therefore, each sample is denoted by 0, 1 and 2 after the sample name to describe the number of cycles carried on the composites under study.

<p>Samples of mechanical testing were conditioned at 23℃ and 50% relative humidity for at least 88 h, according to ISO 291. Tension tests were made using Zwick 0.25 t tensile machine, according to DIN EN ISO 527-1. Test sample was injection-molded according to ISO 527-2. Test was conducted and evaluated according to ISO 527-1. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), using Q 800 was done by TA instruments, was carried out on 17.5 × 10 × 3 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413480993">3</xref></sup> samples in order to determine the change in the composite characteristics (storage modulus and damping factor) at different fibre loadings and FR content. The cantliver loading was set at 1, 10 and 100 Hz frequency and 0.1% strain in temperature range of 40–160℃ and heating rate of 2℃/min. Storage modulus (E′), loss modulus (E″) and mechanical loss factor (tan δ) were measured during the test and plotted as functions of temperature. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried up to 500℃ at 10℃/min heating rate in non-inert gas atmosphere in order to monitor the decomposition of the prepared composites and the effect of the recycling.</p>
<p>Flammability tests were carried out as follows. Test of UL94 (Flame Chamber made by Atlas Material Testing Solutions), 130 × 13 × 4 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413480993">3</xref></sup> specimens, was according to ASTM D 635. LOI (Stanton Redcroft) test was carried out according to ASTM D 2863 with specimen dimensions of 120 × 10 × 4 mm<sup>3</sup>. The specimen, in horizontal position UL94 test (which is always considered the lowest class of flame resistance in the UL94 test), was held at one end in a horizontal position with marks at 25 mm and 125 mm apart from the free end. Flame was applied to the free end and duration of combustion was timed between the two marks. Thus, the horizontal burning speed can be calculated.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684413480993">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the stiffness results of the compounded samples. The two groups of 30 and 50% flax are presented in the same graph for comparison purpose. The addition of the FR powder shows a positive side effect of 45% stiffness rise, from 4766 to 6914 MPa at 0 and 30 wt% Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, respectively, for the 30% flax group. On the other hand, in the 50% flax group, the stiffness of the 50/0 increased to 7755 MPa (65% compared with the 30/0 case); the stiffness then continued to improve to 14,448 Mpa, with the addition of 30% FR of Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> (86% rise). It was previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684413480993">26</xref></sup> that 40% improvement in the stiffness of PP/Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> (almost 30 wt% FR and without natural fibres) can be achieved. This stiffness improvement was because the fillers, FR particles, are stiffer than in the host polymer PP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684413480993">27</xref></sup> The effect of injection moulding cycles is also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684413480993">Figure 2</xref>. A slight improvement took place in the 50/20 system. But in the case of the 30/0 composite, it was observed that stiffness decreased by 8%, whereas that of the 30/30 composite decreased by 15%. The stiffness of 50/0 and 50/30 systems decreased by 14% and 18%, respectively. The current findings are different from those discussed in the study of Duigou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413480993">21</xref></sup> but similar to the observations of Moran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413480993">22</xref></sup> As reported in the literature findings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413480993">21</xref></sup> the stiffness of the biopolymer polylactic acid with 30 wt% flax decreased slightly from the first cycle. This can be attributed to the fact that non-polar polyolefin PP used in this study does not combine successfully with the flax fibres even in the presence of MAPP compatibiliser. Thus the mechanical recycling induces more sites for coupling between PP and the fibre and hence the mechanical stiffness is enhanced. Additionally, as in the study of Duigou et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413480993">21</xref></sup> additives such as FR are not included in the composite. Therefore, the polymer ensured wettability and impregnation through the flax fibres. On the other hand, the experiments of Moran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413480993">22</xref></sup> is similar to this study, where flax fibres are compounded with PP (non-polar) and the stiffness of the composite also increased up to the fourth cycle. The difference is mainly influenced by the compounding process, where extrusion is adopted to produce the composite in the work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684413480993">26</xref></sup> No compatibiliser was used to link the polymer and the fibres and thus the evolving bonding was mainly a mechanical one.

<p>Similar trends for the stiffness results were found in the storage modulus using DMA. Temperature range of 40–160℃ was investigated (i.e. around α-zone, where molecular motions in the crystalline phase are affected by the increasing flax content), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413480993">Figure 3</xref>. The effect of fibre and the FR contents were studied and thus the glass transition and β-zone was not covered in this study. At high fibre contents, higher storage and loss moduli were observed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413480993">Figure 3(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413480993">b</xref>). This is attributed to the increasing frictional energy between the matrix and the filler fibres due to the increasing fibre content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684413480993">28</xref></sup> The addition of Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> resulted in an increase in the stiffness of the composite, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413480993">Figure 3(a)</xref>. This matches with the results of the study by Velasco<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684413480993">29</xref></sup> upon the addition of untreated Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> to PP. The loss modulus showed a maximum value around 60℃, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413480993">Figure 3(b)</xref>. The damping factor (tan δ) developed prominently at 40–80℃, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413480993">Figure 3(c)</xref>. This is explained by the presence of rigid amorphous molecular segments in the crystals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684413480993">28</xref></sup> After the α-zone peak, the damping factor (tan δ) developed strongly due to the sustaining elasticity of cellulose fibres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731684413480993">30</xref></sup> The damping factor has greater values at low fibre content, indicating more damping. The effect of Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> was more pronounced at 50% flax content but shows less damping at higher Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> content. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684413480993">Figure 4</xref>, for the 30/0 system and the highly filled system 50/30, the effect of recycling is not significant at second recycle in this study (only the results of 0 cycle and 2 cycles are shown). But what is interesting is the effect of the forced oscillating frequency, where the induced input energy increases with an increase in the frequency. The position of the relaxation α-zone shifted to a higher temperature and the corresponding intensity decreases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731684413480993">31</xref></sup> The damping factor develops in a positive trend at high temperature, regardless of the applied frequency, except for the 30/0 at 100 Hz. This indicates that the induced high frequency results in higher elastic energy with respect to the loss energy at a temperature range of 120–150°.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413480993">Figure 5</xref> shows the tensile strength results. The ultimate tensile strength decreased in 30 and 50 wt% flax groups and also decreased after the addition of 30 wt% Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> from 42.8 to 38.2 MPa and 51 to 35.1 MPa, respectively, (10.7% and 31.1% decrease). Comparing these results with data from the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413480993">8</xref></sup> 15–17% drop in strength is found for 25% FR.

<p>The recycling effect appeared to have a no significant effect on the strength of 30/0 system, while in the case of FR systems, a slight decrease in strength was observed. The 50/30 system showed an 8% improvement after two cycles. This might be due to the low PP content (which requires the session of the molecular chains into smaller ones after severe shearing). The several cycles ensure that the required shearing and impregnation of PP between the fibres is attained.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684413480993">Figure 8</xref> presents the elongation behaviour of the compounded samples under tension. A decrease in the elongation at breaking was evident with the addition of FR. This corresponds with the results of Yin et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684413480993">27</xref></sup> who reported that elongation decreases with the implementation of Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The recycling effect on elongation is positive. This finding was because the elongation value represents the summation of elastic and plastic zones. The elastic zone in these composites is not trivial but it represents a significant share of the whole elongation, depending on the amount of fibres and fillers. Therefore, the elastic elongation, which is presented by the quotient of strength to stiffness, is important in the analysis of these filled composites. So when the stiffness decreased and the strength showed less response to the cycles’ repitions, the elongation improved by 12–40%.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684413480993">Figure 10</xref> shows the TGA data of the compounds investigated (the effect of recycling is not shown). It is clear from the figure that the addition of MAPP as a compatibiliser was not very effective since all the 50% flax samples (50/0, 50/20 and 50/30) displayed two onset standard temperatures. The FR Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> has a positive effect by increasing the thermal stability. For instance, at 30/0 the onset temperature changes from 348℃ to 383℃ to 393℃ for the 30/0, 30/20 and 30/30 composites, respectively. The onset decomposition temperature changes in a narrower range of 360–371℃ in the case of the 50% flax composites. It is obvious that the weight derivative curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684413480993">Figure 10</xref> shows a negligible change in the horizontal decomposition rate in the range of 365–375℃, which is attributed to the decomposition of Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>. This horizontal trend is greater in the case of 30/30 and 50/30 due to the greater amount of the FR, whereas the 30/20 and 50/20 have shorter horizontal trends.

<p>The effect of recycling on the corresponding TGA is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684413480993">Figure 11</xref>. High number of recycling does result in a better compatibilisation between the composite constituents, where the two peaks of the composite (0 cycles) in the range of 360–390℃ come close to each other after two cycles. This is due to the increasing number of sites ready for linking between PP and flax upon increasing injection cycles.

At 20% level of FR in the 30 and 50% flax groups, LOI increases to 21.1 and 23.3, respectively. Although these values are higher than 21, they are not high enough to extinguish the active fire.

<p>LOI test is an important quantitative test but UL94 test (specially the vertical test) is more relevant in practice. Results of UL94V are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413480993">Table 3</xref>. None of the compounded samples has succeeded to satisfy the required rating conditions of the least class V2, as mentioned in ASTM D 635 (briefly, self-extinguishing within 60 s after exposure to the direct burner twice). However, the observation of the test highlighted some important indications. Samples 30/30, 50/20 and 50/30 show glow combustion features. Sample 50/30 burns at a slow rate as it prolonged for 4–5 min.

<list-item><p>– The 30 wt% flax/PP composite filled with 30 wt% Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> is a promising system where a combination of slow combustion characteristics and good mechanical properties is attained. Horizontal burning speed is reduced by 52%, whereas the stiffness value is improved by 45% and the strength decreases by 10%.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– The group of 50 wt% flax/PP composites shows promising results concerning two systems, namely 50/20 and 50/30. Horizontal burning speeds are reduced by 71% and 93%, whereas the stiffness values are improved by 16% and 88% and the strength decreases by 20% and 31%, respectively. The group of 50% flax/PP composites suffers principally from low impact strength. However, better mechanical performance can be attained by the control of fibre size to finer dimensions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Thermal and thermomechanical characterisation of the composite systems (new/recycled) show that the FR increases the thermal stability and the storage modulus but decreases the damping factor. Recycling affects the stiffness and strength only slightly, as they decrease by 18% and 8%, respectively. Flammability also decreases tolerably, whereas LOI decreases by 4.5% for the best 50/30 system.</p></list-item>
