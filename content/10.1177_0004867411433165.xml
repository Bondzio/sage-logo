<p>It’s official – we’ve moved to SAGE Publications and with this shift their wisdom is ours! At least as regards publishing the <italic>Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry</italic> (ANZJP).</p>
<p>Akin to an Indian marriage, the process of switching publishers has involved numerous meetings, negotiations, and ultimately the exchange of ‘gifts’, and as such, the arduous and intrinsically unseemly matter has consumed most of 2011. Thankfully, after signing prenuptial agreements 6 months ago we have been getting to know each other, and it would appear, on the basis of what can be perhaps best described as ‘Skype-facilitated speed dating’, that we are textually compatible and reasonably well suited, with common interests and goals. Importantly, SAGE (and here I refer to its wise but not wizened staff) is supportive of our vision for the Journal and no doubt those of you with keen powers of observation will have noted, as you made your way to this page, a number of changes that have already been implemented.</p>
<p>The cover of the Journal remains predominantly white, representing its lucid and organized approach to promoting clinical psychiatry. In blue, the main feature on the cover is the acronym ANZJP with the full (and proper) title of the Journal immediately below. As emphasized to me repeatedly last year at the College Congress in Darwin, the term ANZJP is the one most of us use when referring to the Journal in our day-to-day vernacular, ‘because its full title is simply too long’. From a publishing perspective, adopting the acronym allows the Journal to be marketed anew, even though for the purposes of indexing and citation it retains its full name. The acronym also serves as a logo and as such is displayed boldly on the front page of each article. The new cover also features an artistic rendition of the brain and many of the interesting neural processes that occur naturally within neural networks of this most marvellous of organs. Depicting the brain in this manner underscores the importance of integrating neurobiology and clinical psychiatry. At the same time, the large red nuclei that bear resemblance to a human iris can perhaps be thought of as the mind’s eye that in turn underpins the axiomatic but enigmatic link between the mind and the brain. By contextualizing the ‘inner workings’ of the mind within brain structures, the figure aims to convey a key aspect of the Journal, namely, the clinical science of psychiatry. Further, its complexity connotes the many additional facets of the specialty that are often difficult to illustrate but are equally important and will continue to feature within the Journal.</p>
<p>The breadth of ANZJP is reflected in the diversity of its content. The Journal will publish seven kinds of manuscripts (<italic>Editorial, Debate, Viewpoint, Review, Research, Commentary and Letter)</italic> within three categories <italic>(Perspectives, Articles and Correspondence)</italic>.</p>
<p>The Perspectives category has been expanded beyond editorials so as to allow broader discussion of important topics. For instance this month, <italic>Debate</italic> features the clinically salient but potentially divisive issue of early intervention in psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004867411433165">Castle, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004867411433165">Yung, 2012</xref>). Both Professors Alison Yung and David Castle, recognized leaders in the field, provide coruscating insights into the issues relevant to this debate. Readers are encouraged to join in the discussion by writing to the Journal and expressing their views.</p>
<p>Another novel perspective article is the <italic>Viewpoint</italic>. This allows individuals to posit ideas, expound hypotheses, and to some extent incorporate personal opinion. Like <italic>Debate, Viewpoint</italic> articles may occasionally tackle contentious issues and raise controversy but on the whole they are intended to provide a forum for careful deliberation and should aim to provoke thoughtful discussion of interesting topics in psychiatry. This month’s <italic>Viewpoint</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004867411433165">Lawn, 2012</xref>) addresses the critical issue of physical health and wellbeing of people with mental illness.</p>
<p>The <italic>Articles</italic> category contains <italic>Review</italic> and <italic>Research</italic> manuscripts. These have undergone redesign and extensive reformatting to facilitate assimilation and understanding. Important information is now more accessible and the use of colour, especially in the figures and tables, further aids clarity. In this vein the Journal has adopted the Harvard style of referencing in which the author of a reference is cited by name alongside the relevant text and the complete list of authors are listed alphabetically in the bibliography. For authors, this means that adjusting the references at any stage in production is much easier and identifying the articles that they have cited in the bibliography is simple. For readers, it is more meaningful to have the name of the citation appear in the text as it links directly the results of research and the authors to whom it is attributed.</p>
<p>The <italic>Correspondence</italic> category is last but certainly not least. It is situated at the end of the Journal and includes both <italic>Commentaries</italic> and <italic>Letters</italic>. The latter are addressed to the Journal but not necessarily related to its content, and provide a forum for describing interesting observations, reporting tentative findings, and making brief comments on topical issues. These are extremely important and I have emphasized this in previous editorials in the Journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004867411433165">Malhi, 2011</xref>); I strongly encourage readers to submit their thoughts and communicate their ideas to their colleagues through the pages of ANZJP. In addition, another new type of manuscript, termed <italic>Commentary</italic>, will be published when the communication is related specifically to an article in the Journal. This creates dialogue and connects the various ideas and views being expounded by those contributing to the Journal. Again I urge everyone to consider contributing to the Journal in this manner.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal of the Journal is to convey ideas and knowledge efficiently, whilst retaining interest in the mystique of psychiatry. Quoting Einstein: <italic>‘The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0004867411433165">1</xref></sup>’</p>
<p>Finally, for making the above transformation possible I am grateful to the SAGE team (in particular Sara Purdy and Joanne Duggan) and my own assistant (Leigh-Anne Funnell) for their expertise, commitment and assiduousness, and on behalf of all us, I thank the College for this wonderful opportunity to reinvent the Journal. It is already proving to be a <italic>sage</italic> decision.</p>
