<p>It is reasonable to assume that the phenomenon of British New Labour will take up a good deal of academic research time over the next five years. Whatever the fate of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government and whatever the outcome of the 2015 general election, political scientists will wish to examine the New Labour ‘project’ both as a case study of success for ‘Third Way’ governments and a case study in failure in terms of its 2010 election defeat. Diamond and Kenny will likely gain some entrepreneurial advantage by being early entrants in the field.</p>
<p>From a publishing point of view, their book is an interesting hybrid. It has the look and feel of a journal special edition (it is published by Wiley in association with <italic>Political Quarterly</italic>); it is priced to attract a general readership; most of the contributions are from political practitioners; but its terms of reference are framed by a scholarly contribution from the academic editors. Because of all of this it does pose more questions than it answers, but at this early stage in New Labour’s post-mortem that is to be expected.</p>
<p>Diamond and Kenny draw their terms of reference tightly. They are explicit in seeking contributions from the centre–left rather than from more diverse perspectives. They look for judgements about New Labour’s loss of support between 1997 and 2010 rather than examining the longer-term structural issues facing centre–left parties. They limit their scope to domestic policies. Each of these is a potential weakness: it is not entirely clear why only broadly sympathetic analysts were employed; the question of New Labour’s long-term legacy is likely to be of considerable interest to practitioners and academics; and the role that the Iraq War played in exposing New Labour's left flank seems a curious omission.</p>
<p>So we are left with a consciously partial account. Former minister James Purnell provides a short preface (or is it a eulogy?). The contributions are drawn up into five sections: three addressing key policy areas; one examining political strategy; and a fifth taking a cursory glance at possible futures for Labour.</p>
<p>The first section deals with what John Denham MP calls in his own contribution, ‘New Labour’s Political Economy’. This is perhaps the richest section for the dispassionate observer with its very construction reflecting the way in which New Labour approached the central question for social democratic parties: how to reduce inequality. Denham explores how New Labour managed to lose touch with its electoral heartland despite, on the face of it, delivering on many of the key pledges targeted at just those voters. The contribution from Paul Gregg of Bristol University is a useful reminder of how New Labour adopted a coherent and distinctive approach to this area of policy. The Fabian Society’s Tim Horton opts to set his own frame for analysis of New Labour’s welfare policies: how far New Labour succeeded in building wider support for welfare policies among middle-class voters.</p>
<p>The second section deals with New Labour’s impressive record on constitutional reform. Chapters from Vernon Bogdanor, John Curtice, Francesca Klug and a joint effort from Guy Lodge and Rick Muir deal comprehensively with the various elements of New Labour’s reform package. It is one of the curiosities of the Blair governments that so much was achieved in the field of constitutional reform when the Prime Minister himself was so disinterested in the topic. Orphan policy area it may be, but it may prove to be New Labour’s most enduring legacy.</p>
<p>The third section, with chapters from Kitty Ussher, Dan Corry and Stuart White, is perhaps the most disappointing in the collection. Not because of the quality of the chapters themselves – Ussher and Corry in particular do a good job of setting out a fuller picture of New Labour’s economic record than is allowed in the current climate of national self-flagellation over the state of the economy. It is here that the outsider perspective is most obviously missed. The authors provide a rich seam of material for future academic debate about New Labour’s performance. But since, as Ussher states, the economy was at the heart of what the government was about, the reader is left with a real yearning for a wider perspective on what went wrong and how the party might get it right in the future.</p>
<p>The final two sections in the book attempt to place New Labour’s electoral fate on to a longer-term continuum. Peter Kellner’s contribution in particular is a useful examination of how voters perceived the performance of the party in office. Another important contribution here comes from Jessica Asato, Labour councillor and senior figure in the Fabian Society. She examines New Labour’s record on public services reform. There seems little doubt that Tony Blair considered this to be the area with the greatest amount of unfinished business when he left office. The increase in spending on schools and healthcare and the continued expansion of the University sector were striking. Reforms in the shape of academies, NHS reforms and the introduction of co-payment in Higher Education were major steps towards new means of delivery. Many of New Labour’s senior thinkers – including James Purnell and Alan Milburn – continued to devote considerable energy to thinking about public service reform after Tony Blair had left office. After further radical reforms were initiated by the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government it seemed likely that both the popular narrative and the detailed policies relating to public services would remain central to Labour’s future prospects.</p>
<p>All told, this slim volume is a valuable early contribution to the assessment of New Labour’s legacy. The cover carries pictures of Keir Hardy and Clement Atlee along with Blair and Brown (perhaps Wilson and Callaghan would have been a more analogous choice of images). With (at the time of writing) less than two years having passed since Gordon Brown’s election defeat, New Labour does seem as much a part of the movement’s distant history as Hardy and Attlee. Nevertheless, the project will be the reference point for analysis of the party’s achievements and its future direction. This volume will similarly provide a jumping-off point for much further commentary.</p>
