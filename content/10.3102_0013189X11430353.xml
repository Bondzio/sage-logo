<p>Timothy Bartik’s timely book contributes to an important conversation about the role of government in promoting investments in children in the years before traditional public schooling typically begins. Until recently, public funding of preschool programs appeared to be the fastest growing category of education spending, but recent economic woes have caused some of the 38 U.S. states that offer state-funded preschool to reexamine their commitments to early education for 3- to 5-year-olds.</p>
<p>Preschool as an important human capital investment has caught the attention of policy makers for two main reasons. First, recent research from the field of neuroscience has highlighted the vulnerabilities, as well as the opportunities for intervention, associated with the ongoing development of the young child’s brain. Second, researchers in recent years have assembled a credible set of findings reporting significant long-term effects into mid-adulthood from early interventions among groups of economically disadvantaged children who participated in high-quality early education programs. Economists have amplified the importance of this second strand of the literature by evaluating in dollar terms the identified benefits of early education programs for their participants and for society. Findings that high-quality, targeted early childhood interventions may generate social rates of return ranging from 8% to 16% or higher suggest that these early human capital investments should be a priority in the allocation of scarce public resources.</p>
<p>This evidence of the possible high rates of return from human capital investments in early education comes from a research approach that directly estimates the effect of preschool participation on important outcomes, including high school graduation, arrests for juvenile and adult crime, and reduction in remedial schooling costs. In the three main longitudinal studies of targeted early education interventions (the Perry Preschool program, the Chicago Child Parent Centers, and the Abecedarian program), researchers have estimated these effects directly by long-term follow-up of program participants. Economists then translate the monetizable benefits into dollar terms using standard methods for conducting cost–benefit analyses of educational interventions and crime prevention programs.</p>
<p>Bartik’s book adds to this literature by viewing the benefits of early childhood education in a very different analytical framework. Building on his career of research on the effects of business incentives and, in particular, their effects on local labor markets, Bartik incorporates early childhood education into a model of local economic development. Recognizing that many readers of the book are not regional economists, Bartik makes the discussion generally accessible to education policy makers and researchers.</p>
<p>In contrast to the public-goods/positive- externality approach that uses the estimated social benefits of early education arising from improvements in educational attainment and reductions in crime (and other outcomes) to motivate government involvement in early human capital investments, Bartik’s approach relies on a Keynesian-type simulation model of a state’s economy to show how statewide employment and earnings would be affected by state-financed early education programs. The simulation-based approach to estimating policy impacts has been used by others in the early childhood area. Some discussion of other related studies can be found in a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X11430353">2008</xref> article by Reynolds and Temple.</p>
<p>Bartik’s model allows for three types of benefits that arise from the state funding of early education programs. One benefit is the effect of state spending on early education itself. Although some funds will be spent on supplies, the majority of funds will be spent to hire the employees for the early education programs. These government spending effects are estimated by use of spending multipliers that are familiar to macroeconomists and regional economic analysts. A second benefit is the increase in labor supply, as the parents of children in some early education programs can participate in the labor force. The main benefit, however, is the estimated growth of employment and earnings arising from increases in the quantity and quality of the labor supply as program participants grow up and join the labor force. The regional economic simulation model is used to analyze state-funded programs that are intended to represent scaled-up versions of programs resembling the Perry Preschool program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013189X11430353">Belfield, Nores, Barnett, &amp; Schweinhart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X11430353">Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, &amp; Yavitz, 2010</xref>) and the Chicago Child Parent Centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013189X11430353">Reynolds, Temple, White, Ou, &amp; Robertson, 2011</xref>). Such programs are assumed in various analyses to be offered universally to all preschool children or targeted to children from low-income families. Bartik also analyzes scaled-up programs resembling the Abecedarian program, which offered high-quality child care to children from birth to age 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X11430353">Campbell &amp; Ramey, 2010</xref>). The final intervention that Bartik examines is a statewide nurse home-visiting program that resembles the Nurse–Family Partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X11430353">Olds et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Bartik’s book contains a large number of findings regarding the effects on employment and earnings of state implementation of various full-scale permanent programs. We briefly discuss several of the more interesting analyses. In Chapter 4, Bartik reports in Table 4.3 (p. 88) the long-term effects of state implementation of various programs. Results from his model indicate that universal pre-K, for example, will produce a 1% increase in the number of jobs in the state. Notably, this increase in jobs resulting from state investment in a human capital program is approximately twice the increase that would occur if the state offered business incentives of the same cost. Universal pre-K also is estimated to produce a 1% increase in earnings. Although these effects seem small, Bartik points out that they represent sizeable increases in earnings and numbers of jobs. The earnings gains are twice as high as the costs of the program. A second highly interesting set of analyses shows the distributional effect of various early education programs on the ratio of earnings benefits to the costs in terms of higher taxes by income quintile. Table 8.5, for example, contrasts targeted pre-K to universal pre-K and finds clear evidence that the benefits of both interventions are largest in the lowest income quintiles. Bartik concludes that state-funded early childhood investments can increase jobs and the earnings of state residents and that the benefits of even universal preschool are distributed in a way that benefits state residents with lower incomes.</p>
<p>The accuracy of Bartik’s predictions for the effects of these programs on state employment and earnings clearly rests on the appropriateness of the many assumptions used to estimate the labor market effects. His book provides readers with some information on the nature of the required assumptions and his rationale for making various parameter choices, but in general the assumptions behind the model are not as visible to readers as they are in the studies using the public good/externality approach. Early in the book, Bartik indicates that a key motivation for government involvement in local labor markets is the possibility of especially high benefits to residents in areas where unemployment is especially high; however, the simulation model of the state economy is based on a labor market in which these specific within-state regional benefits are not explicitly considered. Although increases in employment and earnings are the focus of Bartik’s approach, in later chapters he usefully considers additional benefits such as reductions in special education spending and reductions in crime. (His estimated benefits to state residents resulting from reduced crime, however, are understated because he doesn’t include the reductions in justice system costs and victim costs.) Like the experimental or quasi-experimental studies that followed children enrolled in early interventions into adulthood and then estimated the benefits to participants and to other members of society, Bartik’s alternative approach using regional economic models also concludes that publicly funded human capital interventions for young children can be an effective use of scarce public resources.</p>
<p>However, common criticisms of Keynesian macroeconomic models, which apply as well to regional models, can raise doubts about the reliability of Bartik’s conclusions. In macroeconomic studies, Keynesian-type models do not predict well out of sample; they generate results that are not as robust to small changes in assumptions as one might hope; they may not fully consider relevant opportunity costs; and they are generally acknowledged to be not invariant to policy interventions. Although Bartik does a good job of explaining to readers how it is possible to view early childhood investments as state-funded economic development incentives, he offers relatively little discussion of the sensitivity of his results to various model assumptions.</p>
<p>In summary, this is an important book for both academics and policy makers to consider, but more work is required to turn Bartik’s approach to economic development and early childhood education into reliable policy recommendations.</p>
