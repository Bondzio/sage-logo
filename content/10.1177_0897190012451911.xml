<abstract>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate pharmacist use of a Regional Poison Information Center (RPIC), identify potential barriers to utilization, and provide strategies to overcome these barriers. All calls placed to a RPIC by a pharmacist, physician, or nurse over a 5-year period were retrieved. These data were analyzed to assess the pharmacist utilization of the RPIC and the variation of call types. Additionally, a survey, designed to assess the past and future use of the RPIC by pharmacists, was distributed to pharmacists in the region. Of the 37 799 calls made to the RPIC, 26 367 (69.8%) were from nurses, 8096 (21.4%) were from physicians, and 3336 (8.8%) were from pharmacists. Among calls initiated by pharmacists, the majority involved medication identification (n = 2391, 71.7%). The survey had a 38.9% response rate (n = 715) and revealed a trend toward less RPIC utilization by pharmacists with more formal training but less practice experience. The utilization of the RPIC was lowest among pharmacists as compared to other health care professionals. This may be due to pharmacists’ unfamiliarity with the poison center’s scope of services and resources. Therefore, it is important that pharmacists are educated on the benefit of utilizing poison centers in clinical situations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2010, the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCCs) reported 2 384 825 calls involving human exposures to potentially toxic agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012451911">1</xref></sup> Analgesics, sedatives/hypnotics/antipsychotics, antidepressants, cardiovascular medications, and antihistamines were cited as the top 5 medication-related causes of human exposures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012451911">1</xref></sup> Medication identification requests comprised 64.3% of all information requests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012451911">1</xref></sup> With the accessibility of pharmacies to the general public and the high utilization of these medications in the community, it would be expected that pharmacists may act as prime resources for information and management in the event of medication-related poison exposures.</p>
<p>To date, there are no published data regarding pharmacist utilization of poison centers; however, anecdotally, the volume of pharmacist calls to poison centers appears to be low in comparison to other health care practitioners. The objective of this study was to evaluate pharmacist use of a poison center, identify potential barriers to use, and provide strategies to overcome these barriers to contacting poison centers. This is a first step in designing interventions to improve the care that pharmacists provide to patients who are involved in poisonings and toxic exposures.</p>

<title>Retrospective Chart Review of Pharmacist Calls</title>
<p>A retrospective chart review of pharmacist calls to an AAPCC Certified Regional Poison Information Center (RPIC) was conducted. The study was reviewed and approved by the university institutional review board. All data were obtained using the center’s electronic medical record system, Visual DotLab© (WBM Software, Inc, Sacramento, California).</p>
<p>The records of all calls placed to the poison center between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2009 were retrieved from Visual DotLab and de-identified before being provided to the investigators for analysis. Only those calls made by a pharmacist, nurse, or physician were included in the final analysis. Calls made by any other health care provider or the general public were excluded, unless that individual was directed to call the poison center by a pharmacist, nurse, or physician, in which case the call was attributed to that designated health care professional. All call records without a caller identity were reviewed by a licensed pharmacist who read the call summary and included the call only if there was documentation that the call was initiated by or directed by a pharmacist, nurse, or physician. Emergency department calls were attributed to nurses unless documented otherwise.</p>
<p>The following data were collected and analyzed: the caller’s relationship to the patient, the nature of the call (eg, call type, call type category, reason for exposure, and caller site), substances involved, and the written summary of the call.</p>
<p>The analysis of retrospective data from the RPIC was used to determine the annual rate of pharmacist utilization of the center and the variation of calls posed by pharmacists.</p>

<sec id="section4-0897190012451911">
<title>Pharmacist Survey of Calls Placed to a Poison Center</title>
<p>A prospective survey (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0897190012451911">Appendix A</xref>) was created using SurveyMonkey<sup>TM</sup> to identify the demographics and barriers of pharmacists as related to their use of a local poison center. The survey consisted of 18 questions that were designed to assess the past use of the poison center by pharmacists in the RPIC service region and the potential motivations for future use by these pharmacists. Demographic information such as education, practice experience, location of practice, self-perceived workload, and accessibility to poison information resources was collected. Additionally, the frequency of calls to the poison center, previously asked question type, knowledge of poison center contact information, and the reasons for future calls to the poison center were recorded. The survey was distributed between October 1, 2009 and September 30, 2010 to hospital-, academia-, and community-based pharmacists who practiced within the geographical territory of the RPIC. To obtain a high response rate, the survey was distributed electronically on 2 separate occasions separated by 6 months.</p>

<title>Retrospective Chart Review of Pharmacist Calls</title>
<p>A total of 37 799 Visual DotLab records were included in the final data analysis. Of these calls, 26 367 (69.8%) were from nurses, 8096 (21.4%) were from physicians, and 3336 (8.8%) were from pharmacists. The majority of the calls placed were by pharmacists in community pharmacies (n = 3073, 92.1%), while 263 calls (7.9%) were placed by pharmacists who practiced in an inpatient or institutional setting.</p>
<p>Of the calls initiated by pharmacists, the majority involved medication identification (n = 2391, 71.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190012451911">Figure 1</xref>). In comparison, most calls placed by nurses and physicians were in relation to exposures (92.3% and 97.1%, respectively). Other pharmacist calls involved exposures (n = 458, 13.7%), medication information (n = 225, 6.7%), poison prevention and safety information (n = 156, 4.7%), and poison information (n = 40, 1.2%), among other less frequently cited call reasons (n = 66, 2.0%). Most calls placed by pharmacists involved analgesics (n = 604, 18.1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0897190012451911">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Among calls coded as medication identification (n = 2391), the most frequently involved therapeutic classes included analgesics (n = 553, 23.1%), cardiovascular medications (n = 261, 10.9%), sedative/hypnotic/antipsychotic agents (n = 146, 6.1%), antidepressants (n = 110, 4.6%), and hormones/hormone antagonists (n = 100, 4.2%). The majority of the medication identification calls were classified based on abuse potential with 1113 (46.6%) involving medications not believed to be involved in abuse, 601 (25.1%) involving medications with abuse potential, and the remainder (n = 677, 28.3%) involving medications not identified or of unknown abuse potential.</p>
<p>Of the calls coded as exposures (n = 458), the most commonly involved therapeutic classes included anticholinergics (n = 38, 8.3%), antimicrobials (n = 37, 8.1%), analgesics (n = 27, 5.9%), antihistamines (n = 27, 5.9%), antidepressants (n = 22, 4.8%), and cardiovascular drugs (n = 22, 4.8%). The top 2 reasons for exposure calls included unintentional therapeutic error (n = 228, 49.8%) and unintentional general error (n = 132, 28.8%).</p>
<p>Among the calls coded as medication information (n = 225), the most commonly involved therapeutic classes included antimicrobials (n = 31, 13.8%), analgesics (n = 17, 7.6%), cardiovascular medications (n = 13, 5.8%), gastrointestinal preparations (n = 11, 4.9%), sedative/hypnotic/antipsychotic medications (n = 8, 3.6%), and serums, toxoids, or vaccines (n = 7, 3.1%). Additionally, the top 3 categories of medication information calls were dosage (n = 29, 12.9%), stability and storage (n = 17, 7.6%), and medication administration (n = 14, 6.2%).</p>
<p>Calls coded as poison information comprised only 1.2% (n = 40) of pharmacist calls to the RPIC, with a majority related to general toxicity (n = 27, 67.5%). Among these calls, 4 (10%) involved chemicals/cleaning substances, 3 (7.5%) involved analgesics, 3 (7.5%) involved antimicrobials, 2 (5%) involved heavy metals, and 2 (5%) involved pesticides.</p>

<title>Pharmacist Survey of Calls Placed to a Poison Center</title>
<p>Between October 1, 2009 and September 30, 2010, an 18 question survey was sent to 289 pharmacists practicing in the health system, 76 pharmacists practicing in academia, and 350 pharmacists practicing in the community within the RPIC service region. Responses were received from 278 pharmacists, resulting in a 38.9% response rate. Of the pharmacists responding, 274 were licensed with 24.5% having completed a residency (n = 67; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012451911">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Many of the surveyed pharmacists had more than 20 years of practice experience (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012451911">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, hospital pharmacists comprised nearly one half of the respondents. A number of respondents reported working within multiple practice settings and 50% of pharmacists reported a heavy work load. The level of access to poison or toxicology information among respondents was high, with 91.2% having print and/or electronic resources.</p>
<p>Among respondents, 56.2% (n = 154) reported having called a poison center regarding a patient or practice-related question at some point in their career; with more than half (n = 80, 51.9%) reporting contact with a poison center in the past 12 months. Of pharmacists who did call the poison center in the previous year, 43.8% (n = 35) called ≥3 times and 12.5% (n = 10) called ≥6 times.</p>
<p>Of those pharmacists who had contacted the poison center (n = 154), most of the inquiries involved either antidotes (n = 49, 31.8%), medication identification (n = 48, 31.2%), adverse effects (n = 42, 27.3%), or overdose (n = 27, 17.5%) information. When asked what the poison center phone number was, only 157 respondents answered the question. In all, 93.6% (n = 147) of respondents to this question reported that they did not know the number but could find it if necessary. Ten respondents to this question stated that they did not know the number and could not find it. Among the 81 pharmacists who had never called the poison center and responded to this question, 74 (91.4%) reported that they did not know the number to the poison center but could find it and 7 (8.6%) stated that they did not know the number and could not find it.</p>
<p>Among those pharmacists with greater than 20 years of practice experience (n = 97), 74 (76.3%) reported calling a poison center. Forty-five of 60 respondents (75%) with 11 to 20 years of experience had called a poison center, in comparison to the 25 of 60 (41.7%) respondents with 4 to 10 years of experience and 10 of 57 (17.5%) respondents with less than 4 years of experience who had ever called the poison center.</p>
<p>Of those who possessed a PharmD degree (n = 139), 35.3% (n = 49) reported calling the RPIC regarding a patient or practice-related question. Of these respondents, 78% (n = 38) had contacted the poison center one or more times in the past 12 months with 47.3% (n = 18) having contacted the center ≥3 times and 13.2% (n = 5) having contacted the center ≥6 times. Additionally, among all PharmD respondents who reported calling the RPIC, &gt;25% called regarding adverse event, antidote, medication identification, or overdose information. Of the pharmacists with a PharmD who did not contact the center (n = 90), 56.7% stated they had never received a poison or toxicology question and 46.7% (n = 42) stated they had adequate resources to answer the question themselves, with respondents.</p>
<p>When comparing pharmacists with a BS in pharmacy (n = 149), 66.4% (n = 99) reported having called the poison center regarding a patient or practice-related question. Overall, pharmacists with a BS tended to have more experience, with 70.5% (n = 105) having ≥16 years of experience. Among those pharmacists with a BS who had contacted the poison center, 83.8% (n = 83) had ≥16 years of experience. Moreover, 39.4% (n = 39) contacted the poison center one or more times within the past 12 months, with 64.1% (n = 25) having called ≥3 times and 23.1% (n = 9) having called ≥6 times. More than 25% of all calls from pharmacists with a BS degree related to antidote information or medication identification. Of those pharmacists who did not contact the center and responded to this question regarding the reason why (n = 28), 64.3% (n = 18) stated that they had adequate resources to answer the question themselves and 35.7% (n = 10) stated they had never received a poison or toxicology question.</p>
<p>Of pharmacists with residency training (n = 67), 34.3% (n = 23) had contacted the poison center. A majority of the pharmacists with residency training (n = 40, 59.7%) had been practicing for 5 years or less. However, among residency-trained pharmacists who had called the poison center, only 5 (21.7%) had ≤5 years of practice experience. Ten (43.5%) of the residency trained pharmacists called the poison center one or more times in the past 12 months with 50% (n = 5) having called ≥3 times and none having called ≥6 times. More than 25% of all calls made by residency-trained pharmacists related to adverse effects or antidote information. Additionally, when asked why they have never contacted a poison center, among respondents (n = 41), 51.2% (n = 21) felt that they possessed adequate resources to answer the questions themselves and 48.7% (n = 20) reported never receiving a poison or toxicology question. When comparing these results to pharmacists without residency training (n = 207), 63.3% (n = 131) reported calling a poison center.</p>
<p>Pharmacists were also asked to rate their workload. Among those pharmacists who responded as being very busy at their practice site (n = 137), 59.1% (n = 81) had reported calling the poison center. Of those respondents who stated they were moderately busy (n = 100) and minimally busy to busy (n = 37), 55% (n = 55) and 48.6% (n = 18) reported to have ever called a poison center, respectively.</p>
<p>Analysis of responses to the survey revealed that among pharmacists with no access to poison information at their practice site (n = 24), 66.7% reported to have had contact with the RPIC regarding a patient or practice-related question. In all, 66.7% (n = 16) stated they were community pharmacists and 25.9% (n = 7) stated they were hospital pharmacists. A majority of the pharmacists (n = 9, 56.3%) reported calling during the previous 12 months. In all, 31% (n = 5) of the respondents without poison information resources had called the poison center regarding antidote or drug indentification information. Moreover, 55.2% (n = 138) of pharmacists with access to poison information reported calling the RPIC. These pharmacists worked primarily in the hospital setting (n = 62, 44.9%) and community setting (n = 57, 41.3%) and called regarding antidote information (n = 42, 30.4%), drug identification (n = 39, 28.3%), adverse effects (n = 38, 27.5%), and overdose information (n = 34, 24.6%) most commonly.</p>
<p>Among all pharmacists who had never contacted the poison center for a practice- or patient-related question (n = 120), 50% (n = 60) stated that they had never received a poison or toxicology question, 48.3% (n = 58) stated that they had adequate resources to answer the question themselves, 7.5% (n = 9) stated they did not have contact information for the poison center and 6.7% (n = 8) stated that they did not know the poison center accepted calls from pharmacists. A number of pharmacists responded to this question with multiple answers.</p>
<p>When asked what circumstance would be a prompt to contact the poison center, greater than 20% of respondents reported a broad list of topics, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012451911">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Retrospective Chart Review of Pharmacist Calls</title>
<p>Upon analysis of the calls placed to the poison center, pharmacists contacted the RPIC less frequently (8.8%) as compared to nurses (69.8%) and physicians (21.4%). This retrospective review was unable to determine the motives for calls; however, the fact that all pharmacists receive training to manage drug information and toxicology questions may have contributed to this decreased frequency. A majority of calls to the poison center involved medication-related events; therefore, pharmacists may have been able to respond to these situations without the assistance of a poison center. Moreover, most of the calls made by pharmacists were in regard to medication identification and not directly related to poisoning events. Finally, physicians and nurses are more likely than pharmacists to be involved in the direct management of emergent poisoning exposures.</p>
<p>Among calls attributed to pharmacists, the context of calls mirrored those reported in the 2009 AAPCC report. These data prove to be a local snapshot of national data regarding poison exposures in humans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0897190012451911">
<title>Pharmacist Survey of Calls Placed to a Poison Center</title>
<p>In the prospective survey administered to pharmacists within the RPIC area, a majority (56.2%) reported having contacted a poison center regarding a patient- or practice-related question. When asked whether recent contact had been made to the poison center, 51.9% of all respondents reported calling within the past 12 months. There are no previous studies to indicate whether our observations related to pharmacist utilization of poison centers are in line with national trends.</p>
<p>The survey gave insight into the demographics of pharmacists who call the poison center and their reasons for calling. A larger percentage of pharmacists with no access to poison information resources reported contacting the poison center compared to those who had access to these resources. This may indicate that pharmacists are using tertiary poison information or personal knowledge as a substitute for the services offered by the poison center, as 48% of respondents stated that they had not contacted the poison center due to the possession of adequate resources to answer poison exposure questions. This indicates that many pharmacist are confident in their ability to manage poison senarios. Pharmacists, however, did report an expansive list of topics which would prompt them to contact the poison center for information (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012451911">Table 2</xref>). However, there may be a disconnect between poison situations that pharmacists believe they can manage independently and those that should include consultation with the poison center. An analysis of the outcomes of those situations is necessary to determine whether the pharmacists were able to manage the scenarios as competently as the poison center.</p>
<p>A trend toward increased utilization of the poison center was observed with increased practice experience. One reason for this trend may be that these pharmacists have encountered more poison-exposure scenarios than their less-experienced counterparts. Conversely, pharmacists who have been in practice longer, therefore more removed from their formal education, may have less comfort in handling these situations.</p>
<p>Differences in contact frequency with poison centers were observed between pharmacists with BS or PharmD degrees. Among those pharmacists who possessed a PharmD (n = 139), only 35.3% had contacted a poison center. However, among pharmacists who possessed a BS degree (n = 149), 66.4% reported contacting a poison center. PharmD training programs are structured to provide more extensive clinical training to their graduates compared to the former BS curricula. Therefore, PharmD graduates may be better prepared to manage clinical situations involving poison exposures. However, these data may be confounded by the fact that the PharmD degree has only recently become a terminal pharmacy degree and many PharmD graduates have been practicing for fewer years. Therefore, these pharmacists may have been presented with fewer poison exposures than their BS graduate counterparts who have been practicing longer. Indeed, more pharmacists with PharmD degrees stated they had never received a poison or toxicology question.</p>
<p>The number of residency-trained pharmacists has also recently grown. Residency and fellowship graduates may be better suited to manage poison exposures due to their advanced training. Sixty-seven respondents had completed postgraduate training. Among those pharmacists, only a third had ever called the poison center. However, a majority of the residency-trained pharmacists (n = 40, 59.7%) had been practicing for 5 years or less and, therefore, may have encountered fewer situations involving poison exposures. Thirty-seven (55.2%) of the residency-trained pharmacists worked within a hospital setting as compared to only 4 (6.0%) who worked within a community pharmacy setting.</p>
<p>With regard to the practice setting, differences were noted between pharmacists practicing within the community, inpatient, and academic settings. Pharmacists practicing within the community setting were more likely to contact the poison center, despite having almost equal access to poison information at their practice site. This is likely due to the fact that community pharmacists are contacted regarding poison exposures more frequently than their counterparts practicing within the inpatient or academic venues of pharmacy.</p>
<p>Finally, almost 15% of responding pharmacists reported that they had not contacted the poison center because they did not know the number or did not know that the poison center took calls from pharmacists. Notably, of pharmacists who reported to not know the contact information to the poison center, over 90% reported that they would be able to find the number if necessary. Moreover, although a minority of pharmacists have the impression that the poison center does not take calls from pharmacists, respondents listed an array of topics which would prompt them to call the poison center (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012451911">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Although much insight into the barriers and motives that pharmacists have for contacting the poison center were elucidated in this study, several limitations must be noted. First, the retrospective chart review did not allow for the pharmacist to be questioned about additional information that may have impacted their utilization of the poison center. Second, all calls from emergency departments that were not attributed to a health care professional in the record were classified as nurse calls. This may have resulted in a larger proportion of calls from nurses than were truly nursing contacts. However, with a relative paucity of pharmacists practicing in emergency departments within the poison center’s area, it is unlikely that a large number of these calls were placed by pharmacists. Finally, a majority of pharmacists surveyed in the study practiced in the hospital compared to the community setting. This characteristic may lead to an underestimation of calls made, as the institutional resources available to inpatient pharmacists are likely more comprehensive than those available to pharmacists in the community setting (eg, specialty clinical and consult services related to toxicology and poisoning). Moreover, the survey was distributed via the Internet, necessitating full Internet access. Unfortunately, few community-based pharmacies allow unrestricted Internet access, which may have limited the survey response rate from community pharmacists. These individuals may, therefore, have limited access to poison information resources and could be more likely to call. This was reflected in our data as a majority of the community pharmacists reported having access to poison information resources and a large portion of them also reported having called the poison center.</p>
<p>No published data currently exist regarding pharmacist utilization of poison centers. This study offers support for the potential utilization of pharmacists as liaisons to poison centers in the management of poison-related issues in the community. However, based on this study, it appears that pharmacists and poison centers are most likely underutilized. Several strategies should be implemented as a result of this study. The RPIC should provide education to pharmacists regarding the types of services they offer and the types of questions that can be answered. These topics include, but are not limited to compounding, drug use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, drug–drug and drug–food interactions, drug screening information, foreign medications, medication disposal, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) information, rabies information, safe disposal and handling of chemicals, and withdrawal from illicit substances. RPICs should attempt to engage pharmacists who are practicing within their jurisdiction to help bolster their services and increase the pharmacists’ knowledge of what questions can and should be fielded by the RPIC. Poison centers should reach out to pharmacists by sending poison prevention materials and poison center service information to hospital pharmacy departments and community pharmacies and clinics. It is important to emphasize the many areas of practice in which expert information regarding poisoning and toxicology can aid in the improvement of patient care.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As the number of PharmD and residency-/fellowship-trained pharmacists increases, it is foreseeable that utilization of poison centers by pharmacists, although relatively low, may further decrease. This is likely due to the advanced training received by these pharmacists. This population of pharmacists should be targeted by poison centers, during pharmacy school, postgraduate training and beyond, in order to reinforce the role of poison centers and the importance of collaboration with experts to improve patient care.</p>
<p>Pharmacists are the most accessible health care professionals and may be relied upon by the general public for information and guidance related to poisons and poisoning. It is, therefore, critical that pharmacists utilize poison centers as a means of assisting in clinical decisions. With the dramatic increase in PharmD and residency-trained pharmacists, it is important that they are educated on the benefit of utilizing poison centers in these clinical situations. Future research should focus on identifying effective methods of educating pharmacists on the role that poison centers can play in their practice and determining the outcomes of patients who are treated in collaboration with poison centers.</p>
