<abstract>
<p>Little is known about how exclusionary practices (i.e., ignored, ostracized) by managers differ across demographics and influence nursing outcomes. This study examines whether managerial exclusion varies by generation, race, and gender, and the extent to which these variables, in turn, relate to turnover intention and perceived patient care among a sample of 747 nurses working in hospitals in a midwestern health system. Exclusion did not differ across most demographic groups, though men reported less exclusion than women. Younger nurses of the Millennial generation, those feeling excluded, and those with fewer years of experience reported lower quality patient care. Managerial exclusion, being a nurse of color, and less experience were associated with stronger intentions to leave. Nursing leaders should attend to factors that may contribute to racial minorities seeking other jobs, diminish younger nurses’ ability to provide high-quality care, and minimize practices that might lead nurses to feel excluded.</p>

<p>Anticipating the health care needs of an aging and increasingly diverse population, the Institute of Medicine’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945913483880">IOM, 2011</xref>) report on “The Future of Nursing” encouraged nursing leaders to attend to conditions that contribute to high turnover rates among newly graduated nurses and that have the potential to improve workforce diversity and culturally competent care (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945913483880">American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 2012</xref>). Meeting these challenges requires an understanding of how unit culture, and particularly managerial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945913483880">Huseman, 2009</xref>), may facilitate (or impede) the ability of acute care hospitals to meet patient needs amid increasing demands for high-quality bedside care. With 75% of today’s nursing leaders expected to leave the profession by the year 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945913483880">Hodes Aging Workforce Study, 2009</xref>), the need for evidence-based knowledge about managerial behavior related to retention and patient care quality has never been greater. The current study focuses on the extent to which experiencing managerial exclusion—managerial practices that exclude, ostracize, or ignore—relates to perceived patient care quality and turnover intent, as well as how these outcomes may differ across demographic groups.</p>
<p>As others have shown, the culture of a nursing unit is an important contextual factor for understanding nurse retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0193945913483880">Shermont &amp; Krepcio, 2006</xref>) and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945913483880">Gifford, Zammuto, &amp; Goodman, 2002</xref>), as well as patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913483880">Blouin &amp; McDonagh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945913483880">Hamrin, Iennaco, &amp; Olsen, 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913483880">Ancarani, Di Mauro, and Giammanco (2011)</xref> noted, the complex and interdependent nature of health care practice demands coordination and effective communication among team members. For example, a collectively oriented unit culture has been shown to promote more effective nursing practice and increased patient satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945913483880">Gregory, Harris, Armenakis, &amp; Shook, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193945913483880">Meterko, Mohr, &amp; Young, 2004</xref>). An inclusive unit culture is one in which all nurses, regardless of factors such as generational cohort, gender, racial-ethnic background, or years of experience, feel included in the everyday interactions and communication patterns taking place on the unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945913483880">Hitlan, Cliffton, &amp; DeSoto, 2006</xref>). With the changing demographics of the U.S. population and continuing calls to increase the retention of a diverse nursing workforce, ensuring that inclusive practices are in place and examining how this aspect of the nursing experience may differ across demographic groups takes on new urgency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945913483880">Gilliss, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945913483880">IOM, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0193945913483880">Outten, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913483880">Leininger’s (1995)</xref> culture care theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945913483880">Jeffreys (2008)</xref> described the ways that ignoring diversity can jeopardize patient safety as well as negatively affect occupational well-being and productivity (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945913483880">American Organization of Nurse Executives [AONE], 2007</xref>). Illustrating the latter point, in a national study of the factors affecting registered nurse (RN) job satisfaction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945913483880">Kovner, Brewer, Wu, Cheng, and Suzuki (2006)</xref> reported that White nurses were significantly more satisfied than non-Hispanic Black nurses. Based on their findings, the authors conclude that managers, in particular, should be sensitive to the concerns of minority nurses and how to increase their satisfaction. They go on to note that supervisory support is one of the areas over which organizations have substantial control and that can also influence a range of nursing outcomes such as job satisfaction and retention. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945913483880">Beheri’s (2009)</xref> examination of workplace interactions, job satisfaction, and turnover, she finds that trusting relationships among a diverse nursing staff was correlated with higher job satisfaction. Although it was beyond the scope of her study, Beheri also suggests that good communication among nurses may underlie positive interactions and outcomes among nurses who vary by race–ethnic background, age, experience, and education. In sum, these studies are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945913483880">AONE’s (2007)</xref> policy position that “healthful practice/work environments” are enabled by having a demographically diverse nursing workforce. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945913483880">Kovner et al.’s (2006)</xref> research suggested, workplace interactions and outcomes may not be the same across all demographic groups. Although research on the topic is virtually nonexistent, feeling excluded or having a lack of cohesion with one’s unit colleagues may be one of the interactional processes through which demographics come to influence nurse outcomes and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945913483880">Beheri, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Exclusion in the workplace occurs when individuals perceive that they are being rejected, ignored, or avoided by another individual or group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945913483880">Hitlan &amp; Noel, 2009</xref>). Exclusion focuses on a subset of behaviors that have also been associated with lateral or horizontal violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945913483880">Farrell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945913483880">Johnson &amp; Rea, 2009</xref>) and bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945913483880">Fajana, Owoyemi, Shadare, Elegbede, &amp; Gbajumo-Sheriff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945913483880">Kivimäki, Elovainio, &amp; Vahtera, 2000</xref>). Horizontal violence and exclusionary processes can include behaviors such as talking behind people’s backs, blocking information, and isolating or “freezing out” a colleague from interactions and activities on the unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945913483880">Longo &amp; Sherman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193945913483880">Quine, 2001</xref>). In addition, these types of interactional behaviors operate (consciously or unconsciously) as a form of social closure that tends to maintain existing status-based and positional hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0193945913483880">Roscigno, Byron, &amp; Tester, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The idea that the workplace can be a hostile environment for nurses is neither new nor is it confined to particular geographic or national boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945913483880">Jackson, Clare, &amp; Mannix, 2002</xref>). And while exclusionary practices are most often discussed as taking place among nurse colleagues, it can also be perpetrated by supervisory personnel. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913483880">Dellasega (2011)</xref> suggested that this type of “relational aggression” is particularly harmful when modeled by managers because it can infect the culture and behavior of the entire unit.</p>
<p>Although few nurse researchers have specifically examined managerial exclusion processes, studies outside of nursing have shown that women and racial-ethnic minorities are especially vulnerable to being excluded in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945913483880">Elliot &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945913483880">Findler, Wind, &amp; Mor Barak, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913483880">McGuire, 2002</xref>). In disciplines other than the nursing profession, the negative effects of exclusion in the workplace have been well-documented; these include anxiety, depression, and counterproductive work behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945913483880">Hitlan &amp; Noel, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945913483880">Hitlan, Kelly, Schepman, Schneider, and Zarate (2006)</xref> found perceived ostracism to decrease commitment to the organization. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945913483880">Findler et al. (2007)</xref> found that an inclusive organizational culture that welcomes rather than excludes can serve as a significant intervening variable between the effects of gender, age, and immigration status on employee outcomes. Employees who felt more included in the workplace reported higher levels of well-being, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945913483880">Findler et al., 2007</xref>). Further research has noted the distinctly negative implications of exclusionary practices for social behavior and emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945913483880">Baumeister, Brewer, Tice, &amp; Twenge, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In one of the few studies examining the correlates of being bullied among RNs, demographic characteristics were not associated with reports of bullying, but those who experienced bullying were twice as likely to report intentions to leave their current position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945913483880">Johnson &amp; Rea, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193945913483880">Quine, 2001</xref>). As conclusions about the experience of exclusion across demographic groups cannot yet be drawn, and given that research specific to managerial exclusion among nurses is also lacking, examining how these relationships operate across demographic groups is merited.</p>
<p>As key determinants of a unit’s culture, the actions of managers through “supervisory practices,” play an important role in unit functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0193945913483880">Zohar, 2010</xref>). One of these roles is for managers to model inclusivity and acceptance through consistent, effective communication with all nurses and the inclusion of all nurses in relevant unit events and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913483880">Andrews &amp; Dziegielewski, 2005</xref>). Although exclusionary processes per se have not been studied among nurses, the impact of exclusion within other occupational contexts is strikingly similar to those found in studies of nurse bullying. For example, researchers have demonstrated that relational aggression is associated with negative health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193945913483880">Murray, 2009</xref>), absenteeism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193945913483880">Quine, 2001</xref>), patient care quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945913483880">Jackson &amp; Raftos, 1997</xref>), lower job satisfaction and work productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945913483880">Jackson et al., 2002</xref>), and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945913483880">Longo &amp; Sherman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193945913483880">Quine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0193945913483880">Stevens, 2002</xref>). Importantly for the current study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945913483880">Farrell (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193945913483880">Quine (2001)</xref> reported that in their studies, the perpetrators of relational aggression were most likely to be nurse managers.</p>
<p>As a complement to the research indicating the negative effects of manager incivility, other research has shown nurses’ perceptions of manager support to have a positive influence on patient satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945913483880">Drach-Zahavy, 2004</xref>) and decreasing turnover intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945913483880">Galletta, Portoghese, Penna, Battistelli, &amp; Saiani, 2011</xref>). In a Taiwanese study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913483880">Chen, Fu, Li, Lou, and Yu (2012)</xref> found that social support, including support from managers, was positively correlated with career development for male nurses. Within the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945913483880">Hall (2007)</xref> reported that increased managerial support decreased job stress and somatic complaints as well as improved job satisfaction among nurses.</p>
<p>Although past research has documented the importance of horizontal violence and, conversely, manager support for key nursing outcomes, the extent to which exclusionary behavior by a manager may itself influence turnover intention and perceived patient care quality remains relatively unexamined. In addition, the distribution of perceived managerial exclusion across nurse demographics is largely unexamined despite its potential significance for the retention of nurses of color as well as nurses who are new, young, and male. As the racial and gender makeup of the nursing workforce continues to be discrepant with populations served (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945913483880">Doolen &amp; York, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193945913483880">Loucel, 2012</xref>), understanding how features of the work environment such as managerial exclusion might differentially influence the retention of the newest generation of nurses, nurses of color, and male nurses is particularly consequential. Moreover, the relationships between managerial exclusion and patient care and turnover intent may also vary across demographic characteristics.</p>
<sec id="section1-0193945913483880">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The current study addresses these issues by examining whether gender, years of RN experience, race, and generational cohort were differentially associated with nurses’ reported experience of managerial exclusion. To investigate the extent to which distinct generational experiences/values may relate to experiences of managerial exclusion, the study focuses on generational cohorts rather than biological age as one demographic characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945913483880">Blythe et al., 2008</xref>). Examining the differences across generations has become increasingly important as each generation has been found to have its own distinct attitudes toward work, communication style, and expectations of leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0193945913483880">Stanley, 2010</xref>). Based on the historic image of nurses as older, White, women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945913483880">Darbyshire &amp; Gordon, 2005</xref>), it was expected that men, nurses of color, and younger nurses would experience higher levels of managerial exclusion. Controlling for the potential effects of demographics, models were run to examine the extent to which managerial exclusion was associated with nurses’ perceived patient care quality and turnover intent. In terms of specific hypotheses, it was expected that managerial exclusion would be positively associated with nurses’ turnover intention and negatively associated with reported patient care quality.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0193945913483880">
<title>Sample and Data Collection</title>
<p>During the spring of 2011, data were collected from full-time RNs employed in a midwestern hospital system as part of a larger study funded by the National Science Foundation (SES-1024271). After receiving approval from university (#20100506) and hospital Institutional Review Boards (#07-10-16), written questionnaires were distributed to 1,702 nurses through the hospital mailing system. Reminders were sent 4 weeks after the initial mailing with a second survey sent 8 weeks after the initial mailing for nurses who had not returned a completed questionnaire. To help maintain respondent confidentiality, written consent was not obtained from participants. Instead, voluntarily returning a completed survey was defined on the survey as an indication of a respondent’s consent. All completed surveys were returned to an independent research firm via stamped, preaddressed envelopes. Using numerical codes to identify the completed questionnaires further protected participant confidentiality.</p>
<p>Forty-four percent of those surveyed returned a completed questionnaire (<italic>n</italic> = 762). This response rate is consistent with other studies of this type among RNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193945913483880">Lucero, Lake, &amp; Aiken, 2010</xref>). Fifteen questionnaires were not included in the analyses due to their missing more than half of the data from key variables or missing responses to demographic questions. The resulting sample size was 747 respondents. Mean substitution was used on the few remaining cases of missing data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0193945913483880">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Manager exclusion was operationalized by averaging scores from five supervisor-related items in the Revised Workplace Exclusion Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945913483880">Hitlan &amp; Noel, 2009</xref>). Respondents were asked to indicate on a 5-point scale how often in the past 12 months (1 = <italic>never</italic>, 2 = <italic>rarely</italic>, 3 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 4 = <italic>frequently</italic>, and 5 = <italic>most of the time</italic>) they experienced the following behaviors: supervisors keeping important work-related information from you (e.g., meeting time, deadlines), supervisors not replying to your requests/questions within a reasonable period of time, supervisors inviting you to participate in work-related activities (reverse coded), supervisors interacting with you at work (reverse coded), and your manager or supervisor complimenting you on a job well done (reverse coded). All items were coded so that higher scores indicated more frequent manager exclusion (Cronbach’s α = .72).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0193945913483880">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perceived patient care quality was measured using eight summed items adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945913483880">Dingman, Williams, Fosbinder, and Warnick (1999)</xref> in which respondents evaluated the nursing care they provided on their last shift. Using a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>very poor</italic>, 2 = <italic>poor</italic>, 3 = <italic>fair</italic>, 4 = <italic>good</italic>, 5 = <italic>excellent</italic>), respondents indicated the quality of care provided in such areas as “showing concern for patients,” “demonstrating skills in providing care,” and “helping calm patient fears.” Higher scores indicated higher levels of perceived patient care quality (Cronbach’s α = .88).</p>
<p>Turnover intentions were measured using a summed scale adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945913483880">Hom, Griffeth, and Sellaro (1984)</xref> and comprised the following three items: “I intend to leave [study hospital] within the next 12 months”; “I intend to remain with [study hospital] for a long time” (reverse coded); and “I would leave my job if a position were available in another organization.” Respondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement with each item using a 4-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 2 = <italic>disagree</italic>, 3 = <italic>agree</italic>, 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Higher scores indicated stronger turnover intentions (Cronbach’s α = .79).</p>
<p>Using year of birth, memberships in the Millennial generation were categorized as those having birth years after 1980 (coded as 1; all others coded as 0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0193945913483880">Outten, 2012</xref>). Members of all other generational cohorts were coded as 0. Placing an emphasis on the experiences of the youngest generation of nurses stems from concerns associated with reported higher turnover rates among this generation of nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945913483880">Lavoie-Tremblay, O’Brien-Pallas, Gelinas, Desforges, &amp; Marchionni, 2008</xref>). Years of RN experience was measured with the question, “How long have you been a registered nurse?” Open-ended responses were categorized into 3 years or less (coded as 1), 3.01 to 6 years (coded as 2), 6.01 to 14 years (coded as 3), 14.01 to 26 years (coded as 4), and 26 years or more (coded as 5). Each respondent reported his or her gender (<italic>male</italic> = 1, <italic>female</italic> = 0) and race was dichotomized into <italic>nurses of color</italic> (coded as 1) and <italic>Whites</italic> (coded as 0) due to the small number of racial minority nurses in the sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0193945913483880">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 18.0 (2009). Items were summarized using descriptive statistics. To compare the experience of manager exclusion by years of RN experience, ANOVA was used, whereas for gender, race, and generational cohort, <italic>t</italic> tests were used. Standard ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was then used to estimate the relationships between manager exclusion and turnover intentions and manager exclusion and perceived patient care quality, controlling for demographic variables in both models.</p>

<sec id="section6-0193945913483880" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The average age of nurses in the sample was 43 years old, with 33% of the respondents born after 1980, and thus members of the Millennial generation. Concerning years of RN experience, the sample was fairly evenly spread across categories. Twenty-three percent of the sample had 3 years of experience or less, 16% had 3 to 6 years of experience, 24% had 6 to 14 years, 19% had 14 to 26 years, and 19% had 26 years of experience or more as a nurse. Nurses of color made up 11% of the sample and male nurses comprised about 8%.</p>
<p>The managerial exclusion score had a mean value of 2.44 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.71, range = 1.00-4.60). Only 2% of the sample had a managerial exclusion score of 1, meaning that they had never experienced the types of exclusive practices described in the measures in the last 12 months. About 31% of the sample reported a score between 1.20 and 2.00, meaning they experienced managerial exclusion rarely, if at all. Another 50% reported an average score between 2.00 and 3.00, having experienced some managerial exclusion practices. The remaining 17% reported a score above 3.00, implying they experienced manager exclusion frequently or most of the time. Mean differences in managerial exclusion based on generational cohort (<italic>t</italic> = 0.653, <italic>p</italic> = .514) and race (<italic>t</italic> = 0.554, <italic>p</italic> = .580) were not significant. However, differences in managerial exclusion based on gender (<italic>t</italic> = 2.136, <italic>p</italic> = .036) were significant, with men reporting less exclusion than women (<italic>M</italic> difference = .168). Results for the ANOVA using years of experience were not significant. Thus, the hypothesis that the experience of manager exclusion would be more pronounced among those in the Millennial generation, male nurses, and nurses of color was not supported. It also should be noted that the results of the <italic>t</italic> test for male nurses was opposite from that expected in that they reported experiencing significantly less exclusion than female nurses. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913483880">Table 1</xref> presents the results of the <italic>t</italic> tests examining the relationship between demographic characteristics and the experience of manager exclusion.</p>

<p>Results of the regression analysis predicting manager exclusion were generally consistent with the <italic>t</italic> test results. None of the results reached the <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05 level of significance (results not presented). In this case, the results for male nurses only reached the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10 level of significance. Thus, once other demographics were controlled, male nurses reported experiencing only marginally less exclusion than female nurses (<italic>b</italic> = −.169, β = −.066, <italic>p</italic> = .08).</p>
<p>Turning to the regression models predicting turnover intentions and perceived quality of patient care (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945913483880">Table 2</xref>), the findings indicate that individual demographics and managerial exclusion are associated with these two key nursing outcomes. For example, generational cohort, race, and the experience of manager exclusion were significantly related to turnover intentions. Millennials and nurses of color were more likely to report an intention to leave their present positions than were members of other generations and Whites. As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945913483880">Table 2</xref>, however, managerial exclusion was a substantially more powerful predictor of turnover intentions than these individual characteristics (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change = .094). In regard to nurses’ reports of patient care quality, years of RN experience was positively related to higher perceived quality of care, whereas being a member of the Millennial generation and experiencing managerial exclusion were significantly associated with lower levels of perceived patient care quality.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The individual characteristics of generational cohort, years of experience, and racial background were not significantly related to the experience of managerial exclusion. Male nurses did report significantly less exclusion from managers than female nurses, though this significance diminished when controlling for other demographics. Although the experience of exclusion was widespread, these findings suggest that the managers in the study’s acute care hospitals may have been engaging in mild forms of exclusion based on gender, but that race, generation, and years of experience were not influential factors in systematic exclusionary practices. This finding echoes other work on men in female-dominated professions, where their token status leads to increased visibility and often increased advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945913483880">Floge &amp; Merrill, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>To be sure, these results are fairly good news for researchers and practitioners invested in reducing discriminatory behaviors, including exclusion, in the workplace. At the same time, the results suggest that experiencing managerial exclusion is detrimental for patient care quality and for nurses’ intention to remain in their current positions. As one aspect of the unit culture, the exclusive practices of managers play an important role in how likely nurses are to look for another position as well as for the perceived care they provide to patients. Turnover intentions were also found to be higher among nurses of color and among those in the youngest generational cohort. In addition to reporting managerial exclusion, being a Millennial nurse and having fewer years of nursing experience were also related to perceptions of providing lower quality patient care. Future research should further explore the relationship between race, generation, and turnover intent as well as other factors that may influence managerial exclusion.</p>
<p>Efforts to lessen the exclusion of new nurses through orientation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945913483880">Cockerham, Figueroa-Altmann, &amp; Eyster, 2011</xref>) have been shown to improve patient care and may be an effective way to address the relationship between years of experience and perceived care quality. Because of their relationship with perceived patient care quality, the results also suggest the importance of minimizing managerial exclusion experienced by female nurses and addressing the unique issues that Millennial nurses face. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945913483880">Bedward and Daniels (2006)</xref>, for example, suggested “formal training in the skills of clinical supervision, both for managers and supervisees; and ongoing facilitation and management support” as part of administrative efforts to reduce professional isolation (p. 61). Prior work on generational cohorts in nursing has also suggested that Millennials tend to receive less mentoring and suggest increased staffing to free up older nurses to serve as mentors for younger generational cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945913483880">Blythe et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>With nurses of color reporting significantly higher intention to leave their positions, future research should explore the relationship between race and turnover intentions. Because <italic>t</italic> tests comparing the mean differences in managerial exclusion across race were not significant, this does not appear to be an explanation of the link between race and turnover intention. Other factors, such as coworker exclusion or interactions with patient and support staff, might offer more insight into this relationship. Managers themselves should be aware of this link and be mindful of the ways in which the experiences of nurses of color might be encouraging them to look for another job, either within the hospital or outside acute care bedside nursing.</p>
<p>With a 44% response rate from a sample drawn from only one health care system, caution should be exercised in generalizing the findings reported here. The initial sample frame of 1,702 nurses suggests that there was adequate statistical power to detect very small effects, but this capability was reduced by the actual response rate. Although substantial effort was made to increase the response rate through follow-up reminders and a second mailing of surveys, the resulting response rate decreased our ability to detect significant results. This issue was further compounded for the demographic groups of race and gender, which was not precisely known a priori (i.e., before choosing the sample frame). As a result, the lack of statistically significant differences in the experience of managerial exclusion across demographic characteristics may be a product of low statistical power (though the observed differences for generation and race were quite small and would require very large sample sizes to become significant). Another issue intertwined with the topic of investigation is that potential respondents who are experiencing frequent managerial exclusion, or social exclusion more generally, might be less likely to have completed the survey instrument. Nurses who feel excluded may not be willing or feel welcome to complete a survey suggested by management. As a result, the data may not reflect the input of nurses who have been ostracized the most. Future studies should make every effort to replicate the design and measures with a larger, representative sample before firm conclusions are reached regarding the issues examined here.</p>
<p>Managers are just one set of actors involved in the nursing unit and any efforts to change a unit’s culture must involve the participation of all members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945913483880">Mulcahy &amp; Betts, 2005</xref>). Although previous studies have demonstrated the importance of an inclusive unit culture for nurses’ quality-of-work life measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945913483880">Gifford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0193945913483880">Shermont &amp; Krepcio, 2006</xref>), this study illustrates the importance of one aspect of unit culture—perceived managerial exclusion—as predictive of the self-reported quality of care that nurses provide and their intention to leave their current position. In assessing inclusivity in the workplace, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945913483880">Findler et al. (2007)</xref> noted that “the concept of inclusion offers a useful construct that can contribute to development of organizational interventions to improve employee well-being, job satisfaction, and retention among diverse employees” (p. 86). With the nursing profession in the United States needing to retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, addressing the effects of managerial exclusion now rather than later is imperative. The more information gained about the link between characteristics of the nursing context and patient care, the more effective researchers and practitioners can be in improving outcomes for nurses and the patients for whom they care.</p>
