<abstract>
<p>The concept of hegemonic masculinity has had a profound impact on gender activism and has been taken up particularly in health interventions. The concept was part of a conceptual gendered vocabulary about men which opened up analytical space for research on masculinity and prompted a generation of gender interventions with men. Academic work focused primarily on relations between men, to the neglect of relations with women, while paradoxically acknowledging the power that men had over women. Interventions that drew on theories of masculinities focused on the content of hegemonic masculinity, identifying hegemony with oppressive attitudes and practices. Hegemonic masculinity was considered singular and universal, with little acknowledgment given to research-based work that argued for a model of multiple hegemonic masculinities. An unintended consequence of efforts to promote gender equity through a focus on men and hegemony has been a recent popular discursive backlash. In this, Jacob Zuma and Julius Malema, presidents of the African National Congress (ANC) and the ANC youth league respectively, have sought to valorize an African masculinity that is race-specific, backward-looking, and predicated on the notion of male superiority. In this article, the authors argue that the concept of hegemonic masculinities retains a utility in both scholarship and activism but that its use needs to be located within a broader gendered understanding of society which in turn needs to confront race and class-based national realities. </p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Currently, the concept “hegemonic masculinity” is widely used in South African gender research. It made its appearance in this work in the early 1990s as a result of the uptake of Raewyn Connell’s theoretical work (1987, 1995) generally on masculinities but specifically on hegemonic masculinity and was consolidated in the period thereafter by Connell’s visits to South Africa. In two edited volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1097184X12438001">Morrell 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1097184X12438001">2001</xref>), the concept is used by many of the contributors and used as an organizing concept for the periodization and analysis of men and masculinity in South African society. Subsequent works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1097184X12438001">Gibson and Hardon 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1097184X12438001">Reid and Walker 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1097184X12438001">Shefer et al. 2007</xref>) have all utilized the concept to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
<p>The adoption of the concept occurred in specific political and intellectual circumstances. In this article, we describe the gendered context in which the term was adopted and utilized paying particular attention to the links between academic work and various forms of activism as well as to the way in which gender power was (and is) organized along racial, class, and other lines. We argue that the power of the concept to make sense of the gendered landscape (and the position of men upon it) was complemented by a shift in gender politics in the post-1994 period during which gender activism was broadened and mainstreamed and began to involve men.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons why, intellectually, the concept was so enthusiastically taken up was that it sought to analyze gender <italic>power</italic> in conjunction with issues of male hierarchy, allowing for differentiation between groups of men who had different relations to one another and more or less power in relation to a dominant group. This was particularly useful in an historical context in which colonialism and apartheid had so clearly divided the political and economic landscape along lines of race and social class.</p>
<p>In the first application of the concept to the South African context, Morrell (especially 1994, 1998, 2001) used “hegemonic masculinity” to explain the nature, form, and dynamics of male power. He proposed not just one masculinity that was hegemonic, but at least three—a “white” masculinity (represented in the political and economic dominance of the white ruling class); an “African,” rurally based masculinity that resided in and was perpetuated through indigenous institutions (such as chiefship, communal land tenure, and customary law) and finally a “black” masculinity that had emerged in the context of urbanization and the development of geographically separate and culturally distinct African townships. In this historical and sociological application of the concept, Morrell was deviating from the usage of the concept which associates hegemonic masculinity with the dominance of one masculine ideal associated with the gender order that arranged male power in a society.</p>
<p>Although the concept was not explicitly used among gender activists, the <italic>idea</italic> of one dominant (and oppressive) masculinity took hold through the 1990s. We will explore below the connections between academic work and gender activism but for now it should be noted that many academics were themselves involved not only in antiapartheid work (academic, intellectual, and organizational) but also in forms of feminism and that the crossover of concepts like hegemonic masculinity into the worlds of nongovernmental and governmental gender work was thereby facilitated.</p>
<p>The move to involve men in gender work was predicated on a number of simple but generally unstated assumptions. These were that hegemonic masculinity was synonymous with problematic male attitudes and behavior, such as violence and abuse of women and children, substance abuse, and risky sexual behaviors. Males were also regarded as victims of the gendered order of society on, for example, grounds of race, sexual orientation, and poverty. Interventions with boys and men, it was assumed, could help men to change their attitudes and behaviors, and even renegotiate their social position and identity. A final assumption was that via a discursive challenge to values that underpinned men’s violence, hegemonic masculinity could itself be challenged and changed. In this approach, South Africa was following a global movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1097184X12438001">Cleaver 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1097184X12438001">Ruxton 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>South Africa in a Gendered Nutshell</title>
<p>South Africa is a country of 49 million people. When described in terms of the apartheid-era racial groups, 79 percent of people are Africans, 9 percent whites, 9 percent coloreds, and 3 percent Indians. The population is predominantly female (52 percent) and youthful, with one-third aged below fifteen years. It is a middle-income country, with enormous mineral and agricultural wealth, but has a very high unemployment rate, disproportionately affecting black youth, and extreme wealth inequalities. In essence, it remains extremely divided, conspicuously between the haves and have-nots. The official unemployment rate is 24 percent but when a broader definition is used (including all who are not employed and are seeking work, as well as those who have become discouraged from seeking work), it is 37 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1097184X12438001">The RSA Presidency 2008</xref>). Officially, 28 percent of Africans are unemployed, compared to 5 percent of whites. The Gini coefficient is a measure of income inequality, where a rating of zero represents absolute equity. In 2005 it was 0.73, and had actually increased since the end of apartheid, as in 1995 it was 0.56, despite a widespread program of social grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1097184X12438001">Statistics South Africa 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1097184X12438001">2008</xref>). In 2008, 1.4 percent of the population lived on less than US$1 per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1097184X12438001">SAIRR 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Apartheid left South Africa with an unusual pattern of family structure. Forty percent of households are female headed. While traditional marriage is part of socially negotiated relationship between families, formalized through payment by men of <italic>lobola</italic> [the bridewealth], many South Africans never marry. Part of the reason for this lies in the inability of many men to ever afford the <italic>lobola</italic> payment. The mean age of marriage for women is twenty-eight years, whereas the majority of women have their first child before the age of twenty-one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X12438001">Jewkes, Morrell et al. 2009</xref>). Fathers often have little or no role in the upbringing of their children. In 1993, some 36 percent of children had absent (living) fathers and 57 percent had fathers who were present. By 2002, the proportion of children with absent (living) fathers had jumped to 46 percent, while the proportion of present fathers dropped to 39 percent. This has major implications for poverty, as the poorest families are those with one adult in the home and which are headed by women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X12438001">Barbarin and Richter 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Relatedly, South Africa has very high levels of violence. Although the murder rate has dropped by 42 percent since 1994, its current level of 38.6 per 100,000 population is more than four times the global average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1097184X12438001">SAPS 2008</xref>). The overwhelming majority of victims are men, killed by other men. The female homicide rate is also highly elevated, at six times higher than the rate worldwide, and at least half of female victims are killed by their male intimate partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1097184X12438001">Abrahams et al. 2009</xref>). The country also has an alarmingly high level of rate of rape. Fifty-five thousand rapes of women and girls are reported to the police every year, which is estimated to be at least nine times lower than the actual number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1097184X12438001">SAPS 2005</xref>/06; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1097184X12438001">Jewkes and Abrahams 2002</xref>). In a population-based survey, 28 percent of men interviewed disclosed having raped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X12438001">Jewkes, Sikweyiya et al. 2009</xref>). Between 1995 and 2009, the total prison population increased by 33 percent. Ninety-eight percent of prisoners are male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1097184X12438001">SAIRR 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The country is also the one with the highest number of people living with HIV, 5.2 million people. Among adults aged fifteen to forty-nine, an estimated 17 percent are HIV positive. The epidemic is highly gendered, with the majority of people with HIV being African women, and women carry a disproportionate burden of the illness and HIV care. Research shows that women who have experienced intimate partner violence and have greater power in equalities in their relationships are at greater risk of acquiring HIV (Jewkes et al. 2010), and indeed men who perpetrate partner violence are more likely to be HIV infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X12438001">Jewkes, Sikweyiya et al. 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>South Africa’s Gendered History</title>
<p>The present day sociopolitical landscape of the country is a clear product of its colonial and apartheid past. From the start of European settlement in 1652, the country’s history has been marked by a brutal, violent, struggle over land, with forcible dispossession of the indigenous population. Then after 1806, when Britain took control of the Cape, there followed a century of military expansion, inland migration, the start of exploitation of mineral resources, and armed conflict between the settler groups which notably culminated in the South African War (1899–1902). In 1910, South Africa came into being as a country, a British colony until 1961. This heralded nearly a century of racial domination by the white minority, bolstered by disenfranchisement and discriminatory laws, and, particularly, after the introduction of apartheid in 1948, an increasingly well-developed state security apparatus (both police and army).</p>
<p>Driven by a thirst for the country’s mineral wealth, the gold and mining industry was heavily reliant on the superexploitation of African male migrant laborers. Wealth was concentrated in the hands of white (initially largely English speaking) industrialists. A series of taxes, as well as in the early period a desire to raise <italic>lobola</italic> for marriage, ensured a steady supply of black labor for the mines. Until the middle of the century, the population of Africans in urban areas was relatively small, not least because legislation, known as the Pass Laws, prohibited free movement and residence of African men. In rural areas, African social relations were marked by the institution of chiefship and communal land tenure, supporting subsistence agriculture.</p>
<p>At the same time, white Afrikaners who were in large numbers impoverished by capitalist developments in the early twentieth century, were incorporated in the economy and in the state bureaucracy. In 1948, Afrikaner nationalists took power at the polls and over the next decade developed the policy of apartheid which separated African, white, Indian, and colored in ever more rigid ways, leading to great hardship, particularly among Africans who were forcibly moved off the land and into geographical areas specifically created and set aside for exclusive occupation on the basis of ethnicity for South Africa’s diverse black African population. These were called Bantustans and in some cases were given political independence, the first being Transkei in 1976. This produced a situation in which poverty and wealth were in broad terms patterned by race. In gender terms, this produced a very complex situation which Belinda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12438001">Bozzoli (1983)</xref> memorably described as “a patchwork of patriarchies.” This patchwork featured traditional authority in rural areas exercised by chiefs as well as patriarchal authority exercised through extended and nuclear families in urban areas. Patterns of accumulation were also highly gendered with the paid workforce dominated by men.</p>
<p>With the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, neither women nor Africans had a vote. The struggle for women’s rights, inspired by women like the feminist novelist, Olive Schreiner (1855–1920), succeeded in 1930 in getting the vote for white women, but it failed to campaign across race lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1097184X12438001">Walker 1991</xref>). The struggle among Africans was led by the African National Congress (ANC), formed in 1912, which organized protest action against the pass laws and other unjust laws. Initially it was a party of African men, and only in 1943 were women granted full membership and voting rights (Walker 1995, 315). From the 1940s, the ANC became more militant, with notable action by women in the 1950s campaigning against the extension of the Pass Laws to them. Initially drawing on tactics inspired by Gandhian nonviolent resistance, the ANC adopted armed struggle in 1961 after police killed sixty-nine peaceful protesters in Sharpeville and the ANC and other organizations were banned. Over the next three decades, thousands were forced into exile. Antiapartheid organizations within the country became widespread and militant from the mid-1970s, and much of the 1980s were characterized by state violence and extreme repression in the townships, but also by increasing mobilization of civil society in opposition to apartheid.</p>
<p>In 1990, after a decade and a half of intense turmoil marked by worker militancy, the emergence of a united front against apartheid and the struggle waged by the ANC (and Pan African Congress [PAC]), the stage was set for elections with the freeing of Nelson Mandela and the unbanning of opposition movements. The ANC swept to power in the elections of 1994 and inaugurated a sweeping set of legislative reforms designed to remove all vestiges of racism and to redress inequalities. This legislative initiative also included a specific commitment to gender equality.</p>
<p>The new constitution, recognized as one of the most liberal in the world, was adopted in 1996 and enshrined the principle of equality for all people in the country. The new Constitution foregrounded women’s rights and recognized the right to sexual orientation. After 1990, the ANC Women’s League led the women’s movement to champion women’s rights. This was an important stimulus for government to take gender seriously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1097184X12438001">Hassim and Gouws 1998</xref>). New laws were introduced outlawing discrimination. Marital rape was recognized and made illegal in 1993 and the first legal protections against domestic violence introduced. To strengthen sexual and reproductive health and rights, a very liberal abortion act was passed, contraception was free, user fees were removed from maternity services, sexual harassment outlawed, and rights to maternity leave mandated. International commitments on gender equity were both ratified and later championed by the Government, and a quota system ensured 30 percent of seats in parliament were reserved for women. Various offices were created to mainstream gender equality and create the bureaucratic machinery to convert law into policy and policy into law.</p>
<p>Yet, as the statistics on violence in South Africa show, the new dispensation was very far from a gender-equal paradise. Many of the structures introduced to promote gender equity and protect women’s rights were very weak. Most notably the Gender Commission has been wracked by infighting since its inception. The Gender Focal Points established in all Government Department usually had very junior staff, little budget, and no direct influence on services. Commitment of government to redressing racial inequalities has been far more prominent and unswerving than to addressing gender inequalities. As a result, many of the achievements have been a culmination of concerted work by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and feminist activists in civil society working in partnership with a few Government champions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1097184X12438001">Chisholm and September 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1097184X12438001">Geisler 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1097184X12438001">Gouws 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Contested Political Dominance and Shifting Hegemonic Masculinity</title>
<p>During the apartheid era, at the national level, Afrikaner nationalist governments used their political power to popularize new conceptions of masculinity which superseded or at least challenged English-capitalist versions which had hitherto dominated. It was presented as a cultural ideal and (especially initially) was strongly associated with a set of puritan values—“rigid austerity and strictness in conduct and morals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X12438001">Du Pisani 2001</xref>, 158), a rigidly hierarchical social order, and glorified militarism and the Afrikaner frontier history. It was maintained by a “synergy between religious, political and cultural leadership in Afrikanerdom,” that is a set of political processes and alliances which defend and reproduce hegemony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X12438001">Du Pisani 2001</xref>, 158).</p>
<p>After the democratic elections in 1994, the nation was borne on a tide of reconciliation and an explicit commitment to human rights and, more generally, to an agenda of redressing the inequalities generated by colonialism and apartheid. President Mandela represented a “new” masculinity, described by Unterhalter as “heroic.” His public representation challenged much of the violent and authoritarian behaviors and attitudes associated with apartheid’s white male politicians, some elements within the liberation movement and the patriarchal, traditional African masculinities of Bantustan leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1097184X12438001">Unterhalter 2000</xref>). An example of the latter was an occasion after his installation as President when he returned to his home village, and in his public address said that the time had come for men to do cooking and look after children. Mandela was in terms of status and power, very much a member of the elite but this did not prevent him from presenting a new, more egalitarian masculinity to South Africa. He was by training a lawyer, by birth a member of the royal family of the amaThembu, and leader of a national government, yet he used his position as a platform for new gender equitable ideas. His status as a leader of the ANC who had served over twenty years in jail, whose commitment to the cause of liberation could not be questioned and who was the recipient of the Nobel prize for Peace (in 1993) shielded him from being branded as “un-African,” elite or middle class.</p>
<p>When Mandela retired in 1999, the new President Thabo Mbeki carried forward part of Mandela’s gender equality program. Mbeki, however, was viewed as aloof, dictatorial, and bullying and this, together with a resistance to the program of gender equality itself, eroded support not only for him as president but also for the new masculinity that Mandela had attempted to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1097184X12438001">Gevisser 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1097184X12438001">Pucherova 2009</xref>). A gap opened up between the masculine ideals reflected in and through the highest political office and by the rank and file membership of the ANC. By this time apartheid era wealth inequalities had grown, there was little extension of employment, and there was a growing demand for leadership that could reflect the aspirations of the “ordinary man.”</p>
<p>This paved the way for a further dramatic realignment of masculinities when a ground-swell of popular opinion among the ANC and its alliance partners brought Jacob Zuma to the office of President (2009). Zuma’s origins were not educated or elite, indeed he was illiterate until he went to prison in his twenties. He epitomized a rejection of more thoughtful, egalitarian masculinities, rather asserting in the name of “tradition,” a masculinity that was heterosexist, patriarchal, implicitly violent and that glorified ideas of male sexual entitlement, notably polygamy, and conspicuous sexual success with women. On the other hand, Zuma’s personal style is warm, uninhibited, and respectful and for many black South Africans he is “a man of the people.” In a true expression of hegemony, Zuma has substantial support from women, partly because he represents the possibility of the ordinary man rising above poverty, illiteracy, and failure, but also because he reflects a familiar masculinity in a social order that African women and men understand and own as “theirs” (Hunter 2011). Mandela remains a national icon, beloved throughout the country, and yet the masculinity that he projected in a divided country in the years in which he enjoyed power and popularity notably failed to gain popular support.</p>
<p>In tandem with Zuma, a new youth masculinity has been promoted by the ANC Youth League’s President, Julius Malema, which conspicuously celebrates assertions of power and wealth, with acquisition predicated on entitlement, use of violence and brute strength, rather than personal achievement or respect for the legitimate use of power (Malema favors land seizures, forced nationalization, and celebrates attacks on white farmers). While alliance dynamics still require gestures of support for gender equity, Zuma and Malema have succeeded in presenting it as anti-African, implicitly equating it with modernity, (white) middle-class aspirations, and widespread lack of (male) economic advancement. Thus, they have collectively launched what amounts to backlash against gender equality in the course of building a movement that enabled contestation of hegemony at the highest levels of national power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1097184X12438001">Ratele 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1097184X12438001">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The struggle over hegemony within the ANC since 1994, when viewed with a masculinities lens, reflects a multiplicity of masculinities in South Africa, structured at least along race and class lines, and a pronounced contestation of hegemony among groups of men. It also shows a disjunction between a masculinity which dominates at a national level, the repository of greatest power, and masculinities that enjoy popular support in communities at the grass roots. This demands a recognition of multiple levels (or contexts) on which masculinities can be hegemonic, in terms of expressing cultural ideals, as well as disjunction between these and the exercise of particular types of power.</p>
<p>National leadership in South Africa has been hotly and publicly contested and the process has opened up space for debate on gender relations. This debate has been steered, particularly by Zuma and Malema, in the direction of the content of masculinity (e.g., support for polygamy) and has thereby avoided calls for a broader engagement with the issue of gender inequality.</p>

<p>Global developments in feminism fed into South African gender politics though it was the issue of race and class that dominated debate. Positions shifted during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. From hostility and outright rejection of (western) feminism from among some black women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1097184X12438001">Qunta 1987</xref>) to engagements around (racial and class) differences the debate slowly evolved to grapple with the nonracial country that South Africa was trying to become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1097184X12438001">Fouche 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X12438001">Hassim and Walker 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1097184X12438001">Letlaka-Rennert 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1097184X12438001">Lewis and Hendricks 1994</xref>). Third-world feminists have argued that African feminism has sought to support more benign patriarchy that builds on existing family and community rather than seeking a more radical reconfiguration of domestic forms of social organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1097184X12438001">Mikell 1997</xref>). The focus however was firmly on women and sisterhood and there was little analysis of men either as oppressors or as allies. Populist theories offered the view that gender was relatively unimportant in the context of race oppression and therefore that Africans were united across gender lines. The politics that flows from this has tended to down-scale interest in gender generally and in masculinities specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1097184X12438001">Morrell 2005</xref>). In these feminist origins, the South African case differs markedly from the Swedish one discussed in the next essay.</p>
<p>The gendered study of men developed in the early 1990s with the prompting of political and intellectual developments, chiefly within the academic disciplines which had presented radical social commentary during the apartheid era, notably sociology and history. Among the earliest gendered studies was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1097184X12438001">Campbell (1992)</xref> who explained the (political) violence in KwaZulu-Natal in terms of constructions of generational masculinities. Looking back on the mid to late 1990s it seems clear that in Southern African studies, from a gender perspective, there was what some have called in the context of education research, “the boy turn” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1097184X12438001">Weaver-Hightower 2003</xref>). The political context of this development was important. As described earlier, the ANC’s election victory in 1994 ended apartheid and the new Constitution created a platform from which race and class inequalities could be addressed. At the same time, however, it was manifestly clear that South Africa remained a very violent country and that the history of colonialism and apartheid could not be discounted in explaining these gendered phenomena.</p>
<p>It was the introduction of Connell’s theories of masculinity/masculinities that dramatically expanded the reach of gender research and led to the inclusion of men and masculinity as new foci. Connell’s theory of gender, power, and masculinities (1987, 1995) with its sensitivity to context and history was ideal for broadening the academic scope of gender studies and for theorizing the role of men. These theories included, centrally, the concept of hegemonic masculinity. This helped South African researchers, who had hitherto regarded gender research as being “about women,” to begin to engender their own work, to talk about the differences between black and white men and to begin to theorize violence without reducing it to issues of race and/or history. Relatedly, the emerging focus in feminist activism and public health research on ending violence against women as well as understanding women’s sexual agency as it related to HIV risk, led public health researchers (e.g., Abrahams, Jewkes, and Wood) interested in the question of prevention, to turn their attention to men who perpetrate violence and constrain women’s agency.</p>
<p>In July 1997, a Colloquium on Masculinities in Southern Africa was held at the University of Natal, in Durban. The conference led to the production of the first two publications to foreground men and masculinities in a South African (and African) context. The first was a special issue of the <italic>Journal of Southern African Studies</italic> (1998) and the second, an edited collection, <italic>Changing Men in Southern Africa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1097184X12438001">Morrell 2001</xref>). Up until this time men had largely been treated as a conceptually unproblematic (but in another sense highly problematic), gender-neutral category, partly an effect of gender studies being regarded as synonymous with a focus on women. The fact that these two publications laid the foundation for future masculinities work in Southern Africa makes their treatment of “hegemonic masculinity” important.</p>
<p>The Introductory essay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1097184X12438001">Morrell 1998</xref>) gave major emphasis to hegemonic masculinity, using it nearly forty times. It located it explicitly within the Connell framework offering the uncontroversial definition that <italic>hegemonic masculinity</italic> “is the form of masculinity which is dominant in society. This is not a question of head counts, but a ‘question of relations of cultural domination’” (p. 607–8). Following what had by then already become an established use of the concept (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1097184X12438001">Mac an Ghaill 1994</xref>) it continued: “In addition to oppressing women, hegemonic masculinity silences or subordinates other masculinities, positioning these in relation to itself such that the values expressed by these other masculinities are not those that have currency or legitimacy. In turn, it presents its own version of masculinity, of how men should behave and how putative ‘real men’ do behave, as the cultural ideal. The concept of hegemonic masculinity provides a way of explaining that though a number of masculinities coexist, a particular version of masculinity holds sway, bestowing power and privilege on men who espouse it and claim it as their own” (p. 608).</p>
<p>The politics of Morrell’s contribution was feminist in the sense that it sought to identify the forms of power that men had (over women, but also over other men), analyze how this power operated and attempted to map out fault lines in the gender landscape which offered the possibility of gender alliances (between men and women) and argued for the importance of men undertaking introspective gender work as well as more public organizational work with women. He was largely following an international trend already entrenched in numerous scholarly works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1097184X12438001">Brod 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1097184X12438001">Kaufman 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1097184X12438001">Kimmel 1987</xref>) and in the organizational endeavors of NOMAS (National Organization of Men against Sexism) and IASOM (International Association for the Study of Men).</p>
<p>Where South African work on masculinity has a different emphasis compared to the international literature has been with its preoccupation with race and violence. This is explained by the etiological place of “race” as concept in the country and its ongoing political currency. “Race” still operates today as a proxy for culture and relative advantage, despite attempts to move to a nonracial vocabulary. The Gramscian concept of hegemony specifically places emphasis on power without violence whereas in Southern Africa this is much less so. Indeed, many authors have used the concept as a way of explaining why there was so much violence. They have done this by demonstrating that, historically and institutionally, the ideal forms of masculinity for black and white men had included an acceptance (cultural legitimacy) of the use of violence as well as the widespread use of violence (as gendered practices) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1097184X12438001">Campbell 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1097184X12438001">Glaser 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1097184X12438001">Mager 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1097184X12438001">Wood and Jewkes 2001</xref>). Much work on masculinity in Southern Africa has continued to focus on male violence and the link between hegemonic masculinity and violence has largely been unchallenged in this literature. In one of the most acute contributions to the literature, Keith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1097184X12438001">Breckenridge (1998)</xref> argued that the key to hegemony is the “centrality of controlled violence in the upbringing of both white and black men” (p. 669).</p>
<p>Morrell’s concern with the different positions and experiences of men on grounds of race and social class was unsurprising since Southern African studies has been preoccupied with contemplating the importance of race and class from a revisionist (materialist) perspective since the late 1960s. The stark racial hierarchies of South Africa allied to the survival of indigenous cultural forms and institutions (albeit in contested and mutated form) led to a model of multiple hegemonies of masculinity, which reflected this racialized history. He proposed a black urban, rural African, and white hegemony, representing three different ideals of male behavior, three different groups of men, and three different sets of gendered practice. While he conceded that this schema was too stark, he was insistent in foregrounding history in the shaping of masculinity and in creating a national framework to allow discussion of what Connell in an earlier work had called “the big picture.” There were two necessary qualifications: the first was that “white” and “black” cultures did not emerge in isolation of one another and that urban and rural lives were not separate from one another. There is a great deal of internal migration in the country.</p>
<p>Interpretations of hegemonic masculinity varied among contributors to the two collections under discussion. Katie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1097184X12438001">Mooney (1998)</xref>, for example, regarded hegemonic masculinity primarily as a set of (oppressive, ruling class) ideals that served to control (young white people, women, black people) and was thus resisted and contested. She notes that ducktails (members of 1950s and 1960s white urban, countercultural, youth gangs) endorsed “pugnacity” (violence) as a way of asserting a counterhegemonic ideal. She did not answer the question of whether violence is to be associated primarily or exclusively with hegemony or whether it is to be regarded as something that men collectively can share or whether it is a device or form of collective behavior available to challenge hegemony. This remains a key debate in the field of Critical Men’s Studies.</p>
<p>Sandra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1097184X12438001">Swart (1998)</xref> examined marginalized Afrikaans speakers who rebelled in 1914 against the newly installed, capitalist-friendly government. She argued that they expressed elements of the masculinity that was hegemonic in the formerly independent Boer republics of the nineteenth century. Constructions of the rebel masculinity notably idealized the commando (as a form of homosocial organization) and “the gun.” Swart showed how the content of hegemony can shift over time and enter, in this case, what Connell might have called a “protest masculinity.” Those who formerly had gender power were toppled in the Anglo Boer war and resisted this disempowerment by using military means, mobilizing according to ideals drawn from an earlier historical epoch. In her treatment, she implicitly treats hegemonic masculinity as an ideal, as a position of power and as being held by particular men.</p>
<p>The 1998 collection of articles showcased the Connell approach to masculinities and demonstrated its value in analyzing South African society from an historical but also contemporary perspective. To the standard revisionist concern about understanding racial and class inequality, Connell’s theory allowed for the analysis of the collective, but fractured and contested, gender power of men. This capacity was seized by the contributors to the special issue as they sought to understand how race, class, and gender power intersected. One notable omission in this collection is the lack of theoretical critique of the concept of hegemonic masculinity. By and large, the concept was adopted, and to some extent adapted, but not subjected to the kinds of interrogation that emerged in the field of psychology (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1097184X12438001">Wetherell and Edley 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X12438001">Hall 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1097184X12438001">Jefferson 2002</xref>) and later among gender theorists in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>The edited volume <italic>Changing Men in Southern Africa</italic> (2001) contained eighteen chapters as well as an extended introduction by Morrell himself. “Hegemonic masculinity” occurs twenty-nine times in the index though some of these are multiple references. Not all chapters referred to hegemonic masculinity though all were located broadly within the Connell framework. Some of the contributions gave hegemonic a fixed content. Jackie Cock argued that “Guns are a key feature of hegemonic masculinity” (2001, 43) and ensure the “the maintenance of a violent hegemonic masculinity” (p. 47). In this usage, hegemonic masculinity is taken as synonymous with control (over women, over other men) and violence. The concept is given a specific, fixed content, and purpose, which is in turn used to explain prominent features of South African society. Hegemonic masculinity has lost its fluidity, and it is no longer conceived as representing a set of cultural ideals that are constructed, defended, and contested.</p>
<p>The contribution by Kobus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X12438001">Du Pisani (2001)</xref> on white Afrikaner masculinity, mentioned above, discussed how hegemonic masculinity, was itself contested and how its content shifted even as it remained hegemonic. By examining challenges from within the alliance of Afrikaners, for example, by a collection of intellectuals, poets, and writers (the sestigers) he shows how the content of hegemony could shift even as those in power remained, in terms of ethnicity, race, class, and gender, the same.</p>
<p>The studies of hegemonic, white masculinity largely or exclusively confine their understanding of hegemony to relations between and among men. Given the political history of the country and the disciplinary background of the authors, this is perhaps less surprising. As Holter (2009) argues, this is a weakness not of the concept of hegemonic masculinity itself, but of the way in which it has been deployed—focusing on power relations between men rather than in a more openly gendered (nonandrocentric) way that sees hegemony established between men and women.</p>

<title>Hegemonic Masculinity in Academic Research after 2000</title>
<p>Toward the end of Morrell’s edited volume (2001) is a chapter written by Kate Wood and Rachel Jewkes, which deviated from the predominant focus on relations between men. This chapter in many respects was a front runner of a body of literature on hegemonic masculinity that emerged in the 2000s. Entitled <italic>Dangerous love,</italic> this showed the centrality of control of women in young men’s evaluations of their “success,” in a context of poverty and limited resources from which to construct it otherwise. With masculinity thus demonstrated heterosexually, violence was used by men against women (when necessary) to achieve control, just as it was at times deployed in competition between men over women. They show how misogyny is linked to male vulnerability which is heightened in the context of limited resources. They also show how men are vulnerable in the context of competing with one another for control over women, which is expressed in violence against women accused of “cheating.” Thus, it is weakness (as much as the need to wield power) that triggers violence against women. In this chapter, Wood and Jewkes link the exemplary man with a desire for control and thus show a connection between the content and purpose of hegemonic masculinity.</p>
<p>This chapter heralded a series of contributions on hegemonic masculinity in the health literature and discourse in South Africa over the following decade, which largely comprised academic publications by Jewkes and colleagues, and contributions from gender activists working on HIV. The latter group were particularly important in popularizing the notion of hegemonic masculinity in health discourse, which extends far (indeed largely exists) beyond peer-reviewed academic literature. The notion captured their imagination because it has been seen to offer a way of understanding why a set of “risky” male behaviors (e.g., noncondom use, having multiple and concurrent heterosexual partners, heavy drinking, violence against women, fighting between men, etc.) could be observed to track together, and as providing a simple way of expressing the essence of what they identify as needing to be changed for HIV and gender-based violence prevention.</p>
<p>There is currently a great deal of interest in masculinity by psychologists in South Africa, and there has been a dramatic increase in the number of publications and research studies on masculinity over the past ten years. There have been two special editions of <italic>Psychology in</italic>
<italic>Society</italic> devoted to masculinity in 2007. The <italic>Journal of Psychology in Africa</italic> is currently producing a special edition on masculinity. However, surprisingly few of the articles (less than 25 percent) on masculinity use hegemonic masculinity as a central theoretical construct. Many articles only mention hegemonic masculinity as one of many concepts or theoretical ideas around masculinity, perhaps because the concept really emerged from the sociological literature, which is infrequently read by local psychologists. Psychologists writing on masculinity are especially interested in the way in which particularly young men establish a viable masculine identity for themselves in relation to other young men and women. In this sense, hegemonic masculinity is seen as beacon by which the socialization of young men takes place (Joseph and Lindegger 2007). These articles suggest that the majority of boys attempt to position themselves relationally, consciously, or unconsciously, in alignment with hegemonic standards as a central mechanism for establishing/maintaining an effective masculine identity. In Connell’s terms, they are complicit with the dominant standards of masculinity. Boys or men are also positioned by other boys or men and women, in relation to this gendered hierarchy, rendering them as powerful, successful, envied, and desirable, or marginalized, stigmatized, and lacking social status. Here, Connell’s concepts of hegemonic masculinity, subordinated masculinity, and marginalized masculinity play a central role, and are often referred to in these articles.</p>
<p>Many of the articles use the concept of hegemonic masculinity to refer to dominant “acceptability norms” (Blackbeard and Lindegger 2007) of gendered behavior for men or boys. In this sense, hegemonic masculinity is used to refer to expected norms of masculine behavior and self-presentation, conventions (Mfecane 2008), or ideal standards of masculinity (Joseph and Lindegger 2007). Hegemonic masculinity refers to that which constitutes a “real man” or forms of “successful masculinity.” These standards or norms of masculinity or masculine behavior are often culturally informed or culturally bound. These expected norms lead to pressure to conform to these standards or ideals by some boys on others (Lindegger and Maxwell 2007), or by boys or young men on themselves. At times, hegemonic masculinity is simply used to describe “conventional and stereotypic” forms of masculinity (Davies and Eagle 2007, 66).</p>
<p>When the literature builds on “ideals” and “gender norms,” there has been a tendency to conceive of men as one category and to impute one (fixed) idea of what it means to “be a man” to South Africans, which further attributes gender inequitable, violent, and sexually risky practices to men who subscribe to hegemonic masculinity. In the health field, hegemonic masculinity is given particular power because there is a large and somewhat diverse research base to support an argument that what is referred to as <italic>the</italic> hegemonic masculinity is a masculinity which is hegemonic among young, <italic>African</italic>, working class men and it is assumed to be expressed in quite similar ways in different parts of the country and among all other men.</p>
<p>The concept of hegemonic masculinity has not been taken up evenly and different emphasis is given to it in different disciplines. In disciplines that closely align with practice (professional or activist), there has been an attempt to use the concept to distinguish men from one another and explain how they come to construct masculine subjectivities. This process has sometimes cut analysis off from examining the relationships that men have with women. In health, the use of the concept has focused on the relationships that men have with women but has tended to generalize these from a particular group of men (young black men) and has focused on violent, disharmonious relationships, and read this as the effect or characteristics of hegemonic masculinity. Both of these uses limit the usefulness of the concept and have indirectly influenced the public debates about masculinity. The assertion of a single, virtuous, independent, heterosexual, anti-Western African masculinity by public figures such as President Zuma and Julius Malema have been a response to the ways in which a dominant, gender inequitable, masculinity has been characterized in gender analysis both in the academy and through gender NGOs. This public representation has shifted public debate from the relationship of men to women and the search for gender equality to one that seeks to recoup the virtue of African men.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>South Africa has a very specific history and politics and this has influenced how hegemonic masculinity has been used in the academic literature and in the realm of practice and activism. The society is highly patriarchal, with exaggerated racialized, gender inequalities, and the normative use of violence. Gender activism has historically focused on women, but in the last decade the inclusion of men has accompanied a governmental legal and policy commitment to gender equality, which is unusual in the African context.</p>
<p>The concept of hegemonic masculinity was part of an academic interest in the gendered role of men and became central to a gendered literature from the mid-1990s onward. This was used to explain male power and weakness, historical shifts in power and ideal, and the fluidity of and contradictions in constructions of masculinity.</p>
<p>The South Africa case has been best analyzed using the concept in the plural. Deeply embedded race and class and urban or rural realities have lent themselves to the identification of hegemonic masculinities rooted in particular concrete social settings. This analytical move, however, has not been without its difficulties. The one danger has been to fix the content of each hegemony. Another difficulty has been to focus on the relationship between men, rather than between men and women. The combination of the two has in some instances allowed for a fixed account of hegemonic masculinity, at odds with Connell’s earliest formulation.</p>
<p>One of the shortcomings of the appropriation of a fixed understanding of hegemonic masculinity by gender equality activists has been that it has produced/reproduced a moralistic binary, which links hegemony with bad men. This has stigmatized certain types of (African) male behavior and attitude as hegemonic. Since the “accused” have often been young, black, unemployed men, it has allowed politicians like Zuma and Malema to mount a response which has focused on the demonizing effects of gender equality discourses. This has resulted in claims for a new masculinity, backward looking and traditionalist, and quite at odds with earlier visions of gender equitable men.</p>
<p>Despite these problems, the concept still retains utility both for academics and activists. For the full value of the concept to be realized, the realms (in relation to race, class, and age) and levels (i.e., global, national, or local) of its use need to be specified and observed.</p>
<p>In recent South African gender politics, we have evidence of shifts toward gender equality in constructions of masculinity that have held the promise of hegemony. This was most noticeable in the presidency of Nelson Mandela, who explicitly embraced a more gender equitable masculinity. This example provides evidence for the possibility for a hegemony without oppression, as envisaged by Connell and Messerschmidt when they wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>the conceptualization of hegemonic masculinity should explicitly acknowledge the possibility of democratizing gender relations, of abolishing power differentials, not just of reproducing hierarchy. A transitional move in this direction requires an attempt to establish as hegemonic among men a version of masculinity open to equality with women. In this sense, it is possible to define a hegemonic masculinity that is thoroughly ‘positive’ (in Collier’s [1998] sense). Recent history has shown the difficulty of doing this in practice. A positive hegemony remains, nevertheless, a key strategy for contemporary efforts at reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1097184X12438001">Connell and Messerschmidt 2005</xref>, 853).</p>
