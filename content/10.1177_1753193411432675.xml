<p>The mechanics of adhesions at a local tissue level have not been extensively studied. This study compared microstrains and macrostrains in adhesions of immobilized and mobilized partially lacerated flexor digitorum profundus tendons in a New Zealand White rabbit model. At 2 weeks, 50 digits were randomized to either gross tensile testing or micromechanical assessment, in which the movement of fluorescently labelled cell nuclei, acting as dynamic markers, was visualized using real-time confocal microscopy. The structural stiffness and load at failure of immobilized adhesions were 140% and 160% of that of mobilized adhesions, respectively, and both differences were statistically significant. Micromechanically, different patterns of loading and failure were observed. Mobilized adhesions exhibited over a three-fold higher local strain, which was less uniformly distributed. Confocal microscopy provided an accurate measure of local strain. For the first time, it has been possible to visualize, define, and quantify local adhesion tissue mechanics. Mobilization appears to favour the formation of sites expressing increased local strain responses or those predisposed to heterogeneity and localized failure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Suboptimal outcomes occur in 11–31% of zone 2 digital flexor tendon repairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411432675">Kitsis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193411432675">Peck et al., 1998</xref>). This is mainly due to adhesions, which form a bridge between tendon and surrounding tissues, restricting glide. Adhesion formation has been investigated using histological assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411432675">Akali et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411432675">Kakar et al., 1998</xref>) and gross mechanical testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411432675">Hanff and Hagberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753193411432675">Woo et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753193411432675">Woo et al., 1982</xref>). Others have incorporated biomechanical and histopathological assessments of adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411432675">Aoki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411432675">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411432675">Gelberman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411432675">Isik et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193411432675">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193411432675">Strick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193411432675">Tang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753193411432675">Thomopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). Few studies have investigated the mechanics of adhesions at a local level, in particular the dynamic nature of tissue strains in adhesions. This has been due to the lack of techniques sensitive to dynamic tissue micromechanics. Tissues that have a hierarchical structure need to be studied at micro- and macrostructural levels in order to understand their intrinsic behaviour under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193411432675">Katz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193411432675">Screen, 2004a</xref>). The degree of structural heterogeneity within tissues may also alter their response to load, leading to mechanical failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753193411432675">Zioupos et al., 2008</xref>). This may be particularly relevant to tendon adhesions. The difficulty lies in how to visualize dynamic structural organization and heterogeneity at a local level and quantify local tissue stress–strain responses to applied loads.</p>
<p>This study tests the hypothesis that adhesions are non-uniform and their behaviour is a function of their local strain responses to applied stress. The aim of this study was to compare macrostrains and microstrains in adhesions of immobilized and mobilized partially lacerated, unrepaired tendons.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1753193411432675">
<title>Tendon injury model</title>
<p>All animal care complied with the guidelines of the authors’ institutions and the <italic>U.K. Home Office Guide for the Care and the Use of Laboratory Animals</italic>, 1996, under licence of the Department of Health. Surgery was conducted under general anaesthesia in a single paw (right forepaw) in each of 26 New Zealand White male rabbits, aged 10–11 weeks (weight 2.4–3.3 kg), according to the method previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411432675">Branford et al., 2008</xref>). The second and fourth digits of the right forepaw were operated on in each animal to reduce the number of animals tested, although paired comparisons were not made. Briefly, the palmar skin was shaved with electric clippers. A V-shaped skin incision was made proximal to the level of the A1 pulley to gain access to the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon, avoiding direct injury to the synovial sheath. Conveniently the dew claw identified the position of the apex of the incision, being just proximal to it. A partial tenotomy injury was made in the FDP with the toe flexed to ensure that the injury was in the intrasynovial region of the tendon: a scalpel was used to remove a longitudinal section of tendon 5 mm in length and one-third of the diameter of the tendon. This approach circumvents the need for suture repair, thereby minimizing the number of injury variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411432675">Chan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193411432675">Kubota et al., 1996</xref>). The flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was then excised, limiting adhesions to those formed between the FDP tendon and the sheath.</p>
<p>Animals were randomized to immobilized or mobilized groups, with 13 animals (<italic>n</italic> = 26 digits) in each group. In those animals where tendons were immobilized, this was achieved by proximal complete transection of the FDP tendon via the same incision, thereby preventing active motion as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411432675">Jones et al., 2002</xref>). In those animals where tendons were mobilized, the FDP tendons were not transected, allowing for normal tendon excursion throughout the period prior to harvest. Animals were euthanized after 14 days of either immobilization or motion and the paws were harvested.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1753193411432675">
<title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>Paws were stored at 4°C and assessed within 48 hours of harvest. Specimens, comprising tendon, peritendinous adhesions, sheath, and subcutaneous tissues, were removed en bloc under loupe magnification. Specimens 25 mm in length were harvested to allow for 15 mm of grip separation with adequate tissue being held in the grips during subsequent testing. Samples were kept moistened with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma, Poole, UK) throughout testing.</p>
<p>Of the original 52 digits, two specimens were discarded prior to assessment (one immobilized and one mobilized) due to the poor quality of those dissected specimens; it was not possible to remove them intact en bloc. Immobilized (<italic>n</italic> = 25) and mobilized (n = 25) specimens were further randomized to either gross tensile testing (<italic>n</italic> = 21) or micromechanical assessment (<italic>n</italic> = 29) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411432675">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Gross adhesion mechanics</title>
<p>Gross mechanical testing, as represented by structural stiffness and peak load at failure, provides an assessment of the overall material properties of a tissue. The 25 mm long mobilized and immobilized tissue samples were secured using a grip at each end separated by a fixed length of 15 mm, with tendon being held at one end and peritendinous (sheath and subcutaneous) tissues at the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411432675">Figure 2</xref>). In this way, each sample was loaded in tension up to failure of the adhesion (connecting the fixed tendon and surrounding tissues) at a constant rate of 2.5 mm/min, using the Bionix<sup>®</sup> 100 mechanical testing system (MTS Systems Limited, Cirencester, UK). The linear proportion of the resulting load-extension data yielded structural stiffness, and peak load represented the load at failure for the adhesion in each sample.</p>

<title>Micromechanical assessment</title>
<p>The micromechanical assessment method was based on visualizing the displacement of fluorescently labelled cell nuclei using real-time 2D confocal microscopy. Defined strain regimens were applied to the adhesions with the nuclei acting as local strain markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411432675">Arnoczky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411432675">Bruehlmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411432675">Cheng, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193411432675">Screen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193411432675">Screen et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193411432675">2004b</xref>).</p>

<title>Straining system</title>
<p>A custom-designed tensile straining rig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411432675">Cheng, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193411432675">Screen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193411432675">Screen et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193411432675">2004b</xref>) was used to apply increments of displacement to the specimens in an identical manner to that during the gross tensile testing. The rig was mounted on the stage of an inverted TCS SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193411432675">Figure 3</xref>). The rig was driven by stepping motors and controlled using LabVIEW™ (National Instruments UK Ltd, Newbury, UK). Tests were conducted under displacement control until a displacement equivalent to 10% was achieved. The initial grip-to-grip distance was 15 mm; the grips were then separated by equal increments of 75 μm (SD 15), equivalent to a strain increment of 0.5% strain at a strain rate of 1.5%/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193411432675">Screen et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Confocal assessment</title>
<p>Samples were incubated in 20 µM ethidium homodimer-1 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) for 1 hour to fluorescently label the cell nuclei. Stainless steel triangular wedges were used to hold the specimens. In this way, the specimens were held flat adjacent to the glass coverslip at the base of the rig, enabling the objective lens to focus internally within the tissue. Specimens were loaded into the straining rig and confocal microscopy (excitation 488 nm; emission &gt; 586 nm) was used to visualize the adhesion cell nuclei, using a Plan Apo 10x objective lens (Nikon, Kingston-Upon-Thames, UK). Increments of displacement were applied and a population of cells was imaged at each strain increment, using the cell nuclei to ensure maintenance of the same focal depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193411432675">Figure 3</xref>). Specimens were held at each increment of displacement for 20 s for images to be captured. The image immediately preceding the first detectable cell movement was defined as 0% strain. Orthogonal directions (x and y) were defined with the Y axis being in the direction of the applied displacement.</p>

<sec id="section9-1753193411432675">
<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>Local strain values were determined by tracking the cell nuclei throughout the entire displacement. Digital confocal images for each sample were centred on a reference nucleus, assigned the position x = 0, y = 0 at all levels of displacement, and uploaded into the image analysis package Imaris<sup>®</sup> 6.1 (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). The software was used to assign exact values of the X and Y axis positions of the cell nuclei in each of the images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193411432675">Figure 4</xref>). The software was then used to track the cell nuclei until displacement corresponding to 10% strain was reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193411432675">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>The confocal images were reconstructed as movies of the cellular displacement over the entire displacement regimen. Different dynamic regional patterns were observed based on their qualitative appearances. Quantitative assessments were then made of the local strains in each of the samples as follows.</p>
<p>Local strain is a measure of deformation and is defined as change in dimension (in this study, along the Y axis) resulting from the applied displacement. Using the Cartesian co-ordinate system, the distance of each peripheral nucleus from the central reference nucleus was measured at each applied strain and subsequently converted to local strain values using the formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411432675">Cheng, 2007</xref>):</p>

The local strain at 10% applied strain for mobilized adhesions was 320% of that of the immobilized adhesions; mean 3.8% (SD 8.9; <italic>n</italic> = 14) and 1.2% (SD 4.3; <italic>n</italic> = 15), respectively. However, due to the variability, these differences were not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.31).</p>

<p>The local strain data were further analyzed into five regional patterns: stretch, compress, shear, random, and tear (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411432675">Table 1</xref>; Videos, Supplemental Digital Content 1 &amp; 2), revealing certain trends. For example, the local strains for mobilized adhesions were considerably higher than their immobilized counterparts, in both stretched and compressed regions, with fold increases of two and five, respectively. The compressing regional pattern, where cells appear to paradoxically come closer together as a tensile force is applied, is due to the nonhomogeneous way in which adhesion tissues are organized. The standard deviation for each sample, calculated from the movement of each of the peripheral nuclei, represented the spread of local strains and, hence, the heterogeneity of the micromechanical response at an intercellular level. The data for all movement patterns suggest a similar magnitude of distribution, with the average standard deviation of the local strains being 7–8%. This suggests that although the mean local strains for each dynamic regional pattern seen were characteristic for that pattern, there was a large spread in the local strains exhibited by the cells in the samples about the mean local strain. In summary, although the adhesions showed structural heterogeneity, different local mechanical patterns were relatively uniform.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A hierarchical, multiscale approach was used in this study to examine the mechanical behaviour of digital flexor tendon adhesions using an established flexor tendon injury model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411432675">Branford et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411432675">Jones et al., 2002</xref>). The novel confocal microscopy assessments described, using fibroblast nuclei as dynamic markers, have provided an accurate measure of local adhesion organization and local strain responses to applied stress. Mobilized adhesions exhibited over a three-fold higher local strain than their immobilized counterparts, which was less uniformly distributed. Different patterns of loading and failure were observed in mobilized and immobilized adhesions, with different local strain values. This study has shown that mobilization appears to favour the formation of sites expressing increased local strain responses or greater heterogeneity of those responses. Both of these micromechanical effects may be responsible for the localized failure and reduced restriction of movement seen in mobilized adhesions.</p>
<p>Screen and colleagues previously reported that local strains within a tendon fascicle were consistently smaller than the applied strain, never exceeding 1.2%, for a maximum applied strain of 8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193411432675">Screen et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193411432675">2004b</xref>). By comparing these results with the data obtained in the present study, it is possible to hypothesize the relative deformation in tendon and adhesion when the whole tendon-adhesion-synovial complex is mobilized. These data suggest that when displacement is applied to immobilized adhesions, which exhibit low local strain, there may be greater deformation of the tendon itself, increasing the risk of tendon rupture. By contrast, when displacement is applied to mobilized adhesions, which exhibit higher local strain values, the adhesions are more likely to deform and fail.</p>
<p>The spread of mean local strain values (as represented by the standard deviation of the data) for mobilized adhesions was twice that of immobilized adhesions, reflecting their greater heterogeneity, which may be associated with the presence of tissue subunits with differing mechanical properties. As the micromechanical environment within each of the subunits is relatively uniform, as demonstrated by the similar range of local strain values, heterogeneity within the mobilized adhesions may be due to a greater variety of different subunit types forming following mobilization, thereby containing points of weakness which are prone to failure.</p>
<p>Tendon fibroblasts are highly sensitive to their mechanical environment, detecting strain during tissue loading and responding through mechanotransduction pathways to remodel the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411432675">Abrahamsson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411432675">Gillard et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411432675">Khan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193411432675">McNeilly et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193411432675">Screen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193411432675">Slack et al., 1984</xref>). This is the first study to describe the micromechanical changes in mobilized and immobilized tendon adhesions following injury, providing insight into the specific influence of in vivo loading on adhesion extracellular matrix remodelling. Tissue engineering is likely to play an ever increasing role in future hand surgery research and is pervaded by the principles of mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411432675">Bouten et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193411432675">Lee and Bader, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193411432675">Screen et al., 2003</xref>). The techniques employed in this study would have broad application to the assessment of the biomechanical properties of healing or fibrotic tissues subject to distortion under strain, as in cutaneous scarring or Dupuytren’s disease.</p>
<p>An understanding of the mechanisms involved in generating nonrestrictive adhesions is essential if treatments are to be rationalized. It has not been previously possible to define adhesions in mechanical terms at a local tissue level. In this study, for the first time, the mechanics of adhesions at a micromechanical level have been visualized, defined, and quantified. In this way, it may be possible to understand how adhesions fail, preventing them from restricting tendon glide. This investigation has demonstrated that immobilized and mobilized adhesions differ at both micro- and macromechanical levels, supporting the need for a hierarchical approach to their evaluation. Although many studies have reported the heterogeneous nature of tendon adhesion tissue, we believe that the present study, using recently available elegant techniques, have revealed these effects at a separate hierarchical level, in particular the local strains examined dynamically. The method used for immobilization of the FDP tendon in this study has been successfully used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411432675">Branford et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411432675">Jones et al., 2002</xref>). As animals were allowed to move freely, it is possible that there may have been some joint motion that would still have allowed tendons to move, and therefore not be completely immobilized. However, the significant differences observed in structural stiffness and load at failure between mobilized and immobilized specimens suggest that this is an acceptable model and, therefore, not a significant limitation of the study design.</p>

<title>Supplemental digital content</title>
<p><bold>Video 1.</bold> Supplemental Digital Content 1, which demonstrates the stretching dynamic pattern for a mobilized adhesion tissue sample, where adhesion cell nuclei become increasingly separated in the axis of the applied strain. The axis of the applied displacement is in the Y axis. The images in the video are centred on the adhesion, and represent the entire imaged region of the specimen (Original magnification, x10).</p>
<p><bold>Video 2.</bold> Supplemental Digital Content 2, which demonstrates the stretching dynamic pattern for an immobilized adhesion tissue sample, where adhesion cell nuclei become increasingly separated, although less than for the mobilized adhesion sample, reflecting lower local strain (Original magnification, x10).</p>
