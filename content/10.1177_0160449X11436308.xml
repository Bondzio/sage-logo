<p>In 1994 the then European Community adopted the Council Directive 94/45/EC that introduces European Works Councils (EWCs) or alternative procedures/structures in order to ensure information and consultation for employees of multinational companies that meet certain criteria. The European Commission considers this a measure to ensure social integration through employee participation, which provides a counterbalance to European economic integration. EWCs are seen as an element of a European-wide social dimension and as a means to engender employee commitment to the European project during the period that corporate restructuring considered necessary for economic and monetary integration was underway. The EU also sees a clear linkage between dialogue and greater productivity, a claim that has been doubted by some.</p>
<p>The EWC Directive reproduced a situation found in a majority of the then Member States, which had a statutory system of indirect employee participation, in which employee interests are voiced through representatives. Commentators are divided as to whether the EWC Directive has been a successful experiment. Some state that EWCs have a symbolic significance for industrial democracy, while others, like Lecher and Rüb, expressed concerns that the lack of real co-determination leads to the danger that EWCs will become a vehicle for “Europeanised human resource management strategy”. Fifteen years after the adoption of the EWC Directive, Jeremy Waddington, professor of industrial relations at the University of Manchester, has written a book on European Works Councils that adds new aspects to the discussion, as his book includes the findings from the largest questionnaire survey of EWC representatives yet conducted.</p>
<p>The book consists of eight main chapters. Chapter 1 sets the scene and provides information on the EU legislation and its background. The second chapter charts the formal developments of EWCs and identifies the variation in policy toward EWCs by three leading European Industry Federations. Chapter 3 covers the numerical development of EWCs, explanations on the relatively low coverage of EWCs (39.1 percent), and the contents of EWC agreements. The following chapter deals with the actual information and consultation taking place, drawing on the mentioned survey of EWC representatives. The survey results conclude that the quality of information and consultation of EWCs is poor but also points out that the performance of EWCs is superior when the representatives are densely unionized.</p>
<p>The infrastructure that supports EWC activities is the subject of chapter 5. Very interesting is the examination in chapter 6 where Waddington looks at the initiatives taken by representatives to move beyond the formal role specified for EWCs in the Directive. There is also evidence that some EWCs have been involved in transnational institution building that extends beyond Europe. Chapter 7 deals with the revision process of the EWC Directive. The author concludes that in the case of EWCs, soft touch regulation did not result in the establishment of robust transnational industrial relations institutions that are seen as required to underpin a resilient European social dimension.</p>
<p>The book is a valuable contribution to the ongoing discussion on the merits and limitations of this innovative institution that some commentators see as a possible basis for an American Works Council Act. This text is a very good up-to-date resource on EWCs from a European industrial relations point of view and will be an excellent resource for teaching this topic to advanced and postgraduate students who have more than a basic knowledge about European Industrial Relations as well as the institutional framework of the EU.</p>
