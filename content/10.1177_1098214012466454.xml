<body>
<p>Making the decision to become an evaluation consultant, or any consultant for that matter, is a challenging enterprise. The decision can be filled with questions and worries, and it demands careful consideration of a number of factors. Do I have the temperament for it? What do I need to prepare for? What do I need to know about the business side of it? Gail Barrington’s book, <italic>Consulting Start-up and Management: A Guide for Evaluators and Applied Researchers</italic>, addresses these questions. The book draws on her extensive experience managing her own firm for 25 years. It reflects her passion for the work of evaluation and her recognition of the practical aspects of running a business. As I stand at the retirement door, looking ahead to a few years of independent practice before I fully retire, the topics covered and the advice are helpful reminders of what I need to know.</p>
<p>The book is geared toward evaluators, but is valuable for anyone considering the consultant life. Those beginning to contemplate the step into consulting may appreciate it most, but it also should be on every evaluation consultant’s bookshelf to remind us of the knowledge and skills required to manage a practice successfully.</p>
<p>The book is structured in three parts. The first is related to the personal aspects of consulting and the orientation, values, and skills that serve consultants well. The second covers entrepreneurial skills that help consultants get started and sustain their practice and the third addresses the business skills that make success possible. The writing is clear and readable. Barrington is always encouraging, with just the right dose of reality, caution, and solid advice. She provides practical tips and examples throughout the book that are helpful and instructive and she shares well-chosen, useful resources. The book also poses questions at the end of every chapter to get the reader thinking.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 provides a particularly valuable discussion about personal characteristics in relation to consulting work. I have seen too many people start out on their own, or join a firm, only to find they do not have the disposition for the vagaries and pressures of consulting. The American Evaluation Association’s <italic>Guiding Principles for Evaluators</italic> and the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation’s <italic>Program Evaluation Standards</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098214012466454">Yarbrough, Shulha, Hopson, &amp; Caruthers, 2011</xref>) are woven into the content throughout the book and are directly addressed in the discussion of values and ethics in Chapter 3. Throughout Part I of the book, the author’s obvious enthusiasm for the work should resonate with many in the field.</p>
<p>Just as ethics is a topic evaluators should revisit regularly, the political aspects of consultants’ work is an area worthy of attention and one that Barrington clearly has examined in her practice. The different perspectives included in this chapter remind us to be thoughtful about our approach to clients and projects and the contexts in which they exist. The tip about developing a template for brief monthly progress reports, as a means to communicate regularly and consistently with clients, is one example of the concrete nature of the book.</p>
<p>The final chapter in this section, Survival Skills, is a wonderful addition to the book’s generally “nuts and bolts” emphasis. The discussions of reflection as a critical element in a consulting practice and the benefits of community involvement—both local geographic community and one’s professional community—were much appreciated by this reader.</p>
<p>Part II focuses on specifics and practical advice about start-up tasks for entrepreneurs. Science and art are woven into many of the decisions discussed, and gave me more than one perspective to consider. Both science and art could be found, for example, in seemingly small details like “read up on color theory” when choosing your business colors.</p>
<p>Chapter 7, on business planning, gives the reader a good understanding of the topic, without overwhelming detail but with plenty of references and some tools for those who want to go deeper. Anyone seriously launching a consulting business should make use of those resources, as thorough attention to initial planning will be of benefit. Chapter 8, on fee setting, is also straightforward, providing specifics on billable time versus overhead, start-up costs and monthly expenses, salary, profit, and price-setting methods. The exhibits in the chapter are particularly helpful, as are the accompanying worksheets in the appendices for calculating time, costs and expenses, and daily and hourly fees.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 provides a thoughtful discussion on obtaining work, laying out some of the less obvious routes to marketing. The value of asking clients for referrals and the pros and cons of partnering in strategic alliances are both worthwhile reads. The considerations related to collaboration are particularly important, as this can be a risky undertaking. Chapter 11, on writing proposals, is clear and detailed about the content and steps required, but I found it to be more pro forma. It is our firm’s experience, particularly in the current competitive marketplace, that it is critical to find a way to make your company and your intended approach to a project stand out. We learned a great deal from <italic>Made to Stick</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098214012466454">Heath and Heath (2007</xref>), which urges its readers to identify and highlight key messages up front that compel people to read on. This concept would have been valuable to include in this chapter. Preparing exciting proposals is difficult. As Barrington points out, you must follow the format and guidance provided in the Request For Proposal (RFP), which often makes you feel as if you are parroting back the client’s words and ideas. However, prefacing this structured response with powerful opening messages about who you are, why you are the right choice, and how your approach is going to help the clients reach their goal can make the difference between getting and not getting a project.</p>
<p>Although simple, the examples and tools in Part II illustrate the true fundamentals of the independent consulting universe: locating and naming the business, undertaking the planning necessary, setting fees, managing time, and getting work. Without attention to each of these basic entrepreneurial skills, a consulting firm likely would not survive. The author’s willingness to draw from her own experience and the details of her business anchor the content in a way that provides a sense of how things truly play out in the real world.</p>
<p>The ABCs of managing a business are included in Part III, along with down-to-earth advice that will be valuable to those new to the consulting world. For example, Barrington provides pointed advice in several places in the form of “don’t take on a project if … ” Novice consultants are generally hungry and take on things they would not if they had more experience. Tough lessons learned will change that, but it is valuable to be told by a more seasoned individual that there are valid reasons to turn down work.</p>
<p>The discussion about money in Chapter 12 is a slimmed down version of the basics a business owner needs to understand about finances. It highlights the pitfalls consultants too often run into: getting in over your head, having unrealistic expectations about timelines or the real costs of a project, or bidding on projects that you do not actually have the knowledge or skill to undertake. The chapter also provides specific suggestions for managing and saving money.</p>
<p>Chapter 15 outlines key elements of contracting. Barrington provides well-founded advice on the importance of careful attention to the steps in the process and specifics about contract language. She also points out a few things that a novice might not think to pursue, such as obtaining a sample contract ahead of time for review and requesting changes in boilerplate contracts. The discussion of “scope creep” is welcome, as it is an issue consultants often run into. Changes in focus, unplanned additions, and new stakeholders to include are all typical causes for a project to drift from its original purpose, resulting in cost overruns and deadline problems. I might have given the topic more space and detail, as it can occur for many reasons and there are a number of potential solutions.</p>
<p>Barrington offers a nice set of questions at the beginning of Chapter 16 on managing people, which can be invaluable in making decisions about the type of new hire that is appropriate for different situations. Is a full-time or part-time employee necessary, as opposed to temporary or student workers or subcontractors? She clearly lays out the key points in hiring and making the best use of subcontractors. The chapter provides a comprehensive table describing the elements of a formal contract. I especially liked the discussion of “red flags” to note in the interview process and the interview tools found in the appendices.</p>
<p>I found the final chapter on managing knowledge to be an excellent addition to the book. The reasons Barrington outlines about why consultants can't manage knowledge well and why we need to manage it better, all rang true for me. Some of the ideas for knowledge generation are great. I particularly liked the list of topics for generating process knowledge and the author’s sharing of her personal motivation for capturing knowledge. The sections on filing and retrieving knowledge, knowledge transfer, and reflection are all on target. Her example about preparing materials, refining them, and using them in different venues reinforces the message. The final paragraph in the chapter makes for a positive close to the book—a note of encouragement for both new and continuing consultants.</p>
<p><italic>Consulting Start-up and Management</italic>, while basic in the information it imparts, is a treasure, covering the many aspects of consulting that should be explored by anyone who is contemplating the leap. More detail in a few places would have strengthened the content, but this is a thoughtful book that discusses the topics that readers entering consulting need to think about, pointing them in the right directions to investigate essential subjects in greater depth.</p>
