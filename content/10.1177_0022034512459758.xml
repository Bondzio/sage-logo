<abstract>
<p>This cluster-randomized pragmatic (effectiveness) trial tested maternal counseling based on Motivational Interviewing (MI) as an approach to control caries in indigenous children. Nine Cree communities in Quebec, Canada were randomly allocated to test or control. MI-style counseling was delivered in test communities to mothers during pregnancy and at well-baby visits. Data on outcomes were collected when children were 30 months old. Two hundred seventy-two mothers were recruited from the 5 test and 4 control communities. Baseline characteristics were comparable but not equivalent for both groups. At trial’s end, 241 children had follow-up. The primary analysis outcome was enamel caries with substance loss (d2); no statistically significant treatment effect was detected. Prevalence of treated and untreated caries at the d2 level was 76% in controls <italic>vs</italic>. 65% in test (p = 0.17). Exploratory analyses suggested a substantial preventive effect for untreated decay at or beyond the level of the dentin, d3 (prevalences: 60% controls <italic>vs</italic>. 35% test), and a particularly large treatment effect when mothers had 4 or more MI-style sessions. Overall, these results provide preliminary evidence that, for these young, indigenous children, an MI-style intervention has an impact on severity of caries (clinical trial registration ISRCTN41467632).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A need exists for population-based approaches to control dental caries in young indigenous children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512459758">Harrison and Davis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512459758">Jamieson <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), but the multiple factors that influence dental health complicate the development of successful interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512459758">Fisher-Owens <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Certainly, a trial focused on changing maternal behaviors will address only “downstream” factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512459758">Watt, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, the determination of a culturally competent, effective mode of counseling is a reasonable goal of any prevention trial.</p>
<p>Variable success has been demonstrated in previous trials based on Motivational Interviewing (MI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512459758">Weinstein <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512459758">Harrison <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512459758">Ismail <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In MI, the motivation for change comes from the client, with the counselor creating the expectation of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512459758">Miller, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512459758">DiClemente, 1991</xref>). This strategy works well for Cree women who are more comfortable if someone “suggests” rather than “tells” them directly how to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512459758">Gray-Donald <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Family and community conditions also have a major impact on caries in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512459758">Reisine and Douglass, 1998</xref>). Therefore, trials involving indigenous communities must be planned with community collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512459758">Potvin <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512459758">Minkler, 2005</xref>). In this project, a randomized controlled trial was extensively debated to ensure community agreement with the study design. The resulting trial, more pragmatic than explanatory in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512459758">Zwarenstein <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512459758">Treweek and Zwarenstein, 2009</xref>), was a single-blind study with cluster randomization and two treatment groups. A comprehensive account of study design and implementation has been previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512459758">Harrison <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0022034512459758">
<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>The Cree, the largest First Nations group in Canada, have traditional territory on James Bay at the southern end of Hudson Bay. The Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay (CBHSSJB), our research partner, is responsible for delivery of services and programs to the Cree. The Behavioural Ethics Review Board of the University of British Columbia and of CBHSSJB approved the study. All participating mothers signed plain-language consent forms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034512459758">
<title>Eligibility Criteria</title>
<p>Cree women who recently had given birth or were between the 12<sup>th</sup> and 34<sup>th</sup> weeks of pregnancy were recruited. Participant recruitment and collection of data took place at community clinics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034512459758">
<title>Objectives and Hypotheses</title>
<p>The goal of this counseling intervention was to reduce the prevalence of dental caries in young Cree children. This report will present the findings related to the primary research question, which compared the dental health status of young Cree children whose mothers participated in the intervention with that of children whose mothers only received educational pamphlets. The hypothesis was that the prevalence of caries in 30-month-old children would be lower in test than in control communities. Comparisons of differences in mothers’ dental health knowledge, personal dental practices, and child-rearing practices answered our secondary research question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034512459758">
<title>Interventions</title>
<p>Thorough detail on the interventions is provided in the Appendix. Test group mothers were to attend one counseling session during pregnancy and up to 6 more sessions post-natally until their child’s second birthday. Each test mother received appropriate supplies at each visit to facilitate adoption of selected behaviors. The two MI-style “scripts” were based on scripts from a previous trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512459758">Weinstein <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512459758">2006</xref>): one script for pregnant and new mothers and another for those whose child had experienced the first tooth eruption. Mothers from test communities also received a “Privilege Card” to expedite dental care.</p>
<p>It was the request of the CBHSSJB that existing health workers, called “community health representatives” (CHRs), be enlisted as recruiters and interveners. However, some communities had no CHR; therefore, local women were hired. All staff received necessary training and support (Appendix).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022034512459758">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>At baseline, all participants completed instruments on demographics, oral self-care practices, and dental knowledge. When each child was at least 30 mos old, clinical data were collected by calibrated examiners, masked to the community’s assignment (Appendix). Criteria for caries detection were similar to those described by Pitts and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512459758">Pitts <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Enamel caries (d<sub>2</sub> = substance loss), dentinal caries (d<sub>3</sub>), pulpal caries (d<sub>4</sub>), restorations (f), and absence due to caries (e) were recorded. Information about each mother’s dental health knowledge, home-care behaviors, and caries-related child quality of life was also recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512459758">Véronneau, 2002</xref>). For children examined in a day-care setting without a parent, questionnaires were completed at home or by telephone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022034512459758">
<title>Sample Size</title>
<p>The power was calculated by the method of adjustment for intra-class correlation by the variance inflation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512459758">Murray, 1998</xref>) applied to the standard formula for calculating power for comparison of proportions from independent samples. The control-group caries prevalence was estimated to be 0.86 based on preliminary data on caries prevalence from all communities. A total sample size of 265 mother-and-child pairs was estimated to yield a power of 82% to detect a 20% reduction in caries prevalence from 0.86 to 0.69. This calculation accounted for a variance inflation factor (VIF) estimated at 1.35 according to the formula VIF = 1 + (SS/S − 1) ICC, where S was the sum of cluster sizes, SS the sum of squares of cluster sizes, and ICC the intra-class correlation coefficient. The distribution of cluster sizes was estimated based on birth-rate data from each village. The ICC was estimated at 0.0090 by application of the analysis-of-variance method to preliminary caries data. Note that use of the average sample size (265/9 = 29) in place of SS/S would underestimate the VIF (1.26 <italic>vs</italic>. 1.35) and the sample size required. Overall loss to follow-up, including infant mortality, was estimated to be 5% <italic>per</italic> yr for the 3 yrs of the study. Thus, the target number of mother-and-child pairs was 309, to have 265 with outcomes data.</p>
<p>No interim analyses were performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022034512459758">
<title>Randomization</title>
<p>Randomization was done over community radio with two “rounds” of a constrained randomization process. Two baskets contained envelopes marked “test” or “control”: one basket for large communities (2 envelopes: 1 test, 1 control) and another for smaller communities (7 envelopes: 4 test, 3 control). Communities were randomized in each round by alphabetical ordering of the communities’ names. For example, for each round, the first name on the alphabetical list of communities was announced, followed by the drawing of an envelope from the basket; the next name was announced, followed by another draw until all envelopes were allocated. Of the 9 communities, 5 were allocated to test and 4 to control conditions. Communities were unaware of their allocation until their name was drawn. No concerns about the randomization process have been expressed. Randomization occurred prior to participant recruitment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022034512459758">
<title>Blinding to Interventions</title>
<p>Mothers and interveners were aware of their community’s allocation. The examiners were blinded to allocation and were unfamiliar with the intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022034512459758">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>The primary statistical analysis was a comparison of caries prevalence in intervention and control groups, by a permutation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512459758">Gail <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512459758">Braun and Feng, 2001</xref>) with test statistic equal to the difference between caries prevalences in the two groups. The observed significance level was determined by the exact permutation distribution of the test statistic, which was computed by enumeration of all possible random assignments of communities to intervention or control conditions according to the randomization scheme (accounting for stratification by larger or smaller community size). We consider this to be a test of the strong null hypothesis of no treatment effect on any community. It has been shown that, with unequal numbers of communities <italic>per</italic> group, the permutation test may have an inflated type I error rate as a test of the weak null hypothesis of no treatment effect on the average response across communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512459758">Gail <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). The error rate inflation in our case would be expected to be very slight, because there was only a slight imbalance between groups (4 <italic>vs</italic>. 5 communities). In addition, we reported two-sided p values, whereas type I error inflation pertains mainly to one-sided tests.</p>
<p>For the primary analysis, caries was defined as the presence of decay (d2 or higher), filling, or extraction due to caries. Additional analyses were performed for various levels of disease and for numbers of diseased surfaces with log-linear models with Generalized Estimating Equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512459758">Liang and Zeger, 1986</xref>) and an exchangeable correlation structure. Because of the small sample size, the score test was used, because it tends to be conservative, whereas the Wald test is anti-conservative in small samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512459758">Mancl and DeRouen, 2001</xref>). These models were fit with and without adjustment for covariates (maternal age, maternal dental check-up within 2 yrs, infant born just before enrollment, and child’s age at outcome assessment). Descriptive analyses examined associations between caries outcomes and the number of sessions attended: dichotomized as “0-3” or “4 or more” based on a median value of 3 sessions for test children with caries data. Oral health behaviors and child oral-health quality of life were also compared between groups.</p>

<title>Periods of Recruitment and Follow-up</title>
<p>From January 2005 to October 2007, 272 mothers (131 test, 141 control) were recruited. At follow-up, 241 children were examined for caries (110 test, 131 control). Because of the cluster design, the power of the trial was determined not only by total sample size but also by number of communities and by sufficient numbers of participants recruited in each community. Whereas the original projected sample size of 309 women enrolled (and 265 children with outcomes data) would have yielded 82% power to detect a 20% reduction in caries prevalence from 0.86 to 0.69, power calculations with the actual sample sizes showed that the estimated power was 79% to detect an assumed treatment effect, with 241 children having follow-up caries data.</p>
<p>Six months after the follow-up assessments began in April 2008, a hiatus in data-gathering occurred because of territorial issues. Assessments resumed in July 2009 and were completed in November 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022034512459758">
<title>Baseline Data</title>
<p>We compared demographic and behavioral characteristics at baseline to assess the success of randomization. The distributions of most variables were very similar for the two randomized groups of mothers specifically, for age, dental knowledge score, other children, toothbrushing, and recent dental visit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512459758">Harrison <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). However, despite the random assignment of communities, fewer test mothers had already delivered at time of enrollment (19.2% <italic>vs</italic>. 40.0%), had visited a dentist for toothache (35.5% <italic>vs</italic>. 50.0%), and had other children with a previous tooth extraction (34.1% <italic>vs</italic>. 48.9%). Therefore, secondary analyses of outcomes were done with regression adjustment to control for baseline differences. We compared the results of the adjusted and unadjusted analyses to determine the impact of these differences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512459758">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Caries prevalences were 76% (100/131) in the control group <italic>vs</italic>. 65% (72/110) in the treatment group. The group difference was not statistically significant based on the permutation test (2-sided p value, 0.17). The absolute risk difference was 11% (95% CI: -3 to 30%), whereas the relative risk was 65/76 = 0.86 (95% CI: 0.66 to 1.07). The intra-class correlation estimate was 0.006. Prevalences were slightly smaller than those observed in previous research in this population, and the observed treatment effect was slightly smaller than that used for the power calculation (17% absolute risk difference, relative risk 0.80). Exploratory analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512459758">Table 1</xref>) suggested a substantial benefit of the intervention in controlling for a higher severity of disease, <italic>i.e</italic>., decay into dentin or pulp, d<sub>3-4</sub>.</p>
<p>Additional exploratory analyses suggested that the treatment effect might be very large for participants who attended 4 or more MI-style sessions <italic>vs</italic>. 3 or fewer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022034512459758">Table 2</xref>). However, no significant effect of the intervention on self-reported maternal oral health behaviors was demonstrated. Dental-health-related child quality of life was slightly different between groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022034512459758">Table 3</xref>). No adverse events were reported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This trial evaluated the effectiveness of maternal MI-style counseling to reduce caries in young Cree children. Overall, the results support an effect on extent and severity of caries and, possibly, an enhanced treatment effect associated with increased numbers of interventions. The effects of clustering of the children within communities, the small number of communities, the high prevalence of disease, and the unremitting logistical challenges validated our pragmatic rather than explanatory approach to this trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512459758">Zwarenstein <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section18-0022034512459758">
<title>Challenges and Limitations</title>
<p>Administrators often request that existing local personnel be employed in a research project. Such was the case in this trial. However, these individuals may not have the time, the personal resources, or the interest to do so. Therefore, any trial implemented within an existing organization must have the appropriate human and financial resources to ensure completion of the trial. In our situation, the Project Manager frequently was called up to complete project tasks. Recruitment was curtailed after 2½ yrs as interest in the project waned, but fortunately, enough participants had been recruited to maintain adequate power. Certainly, challenges related to treatment fidelity are acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512459758">Borrelli, 2011</xref>). This limitation is further addressed in the Appendix.</p>
<p>“Test” mothers were given “Privilege Cards” to allow for priority access to dental services; about one-third of these mothers recalled using the cards. Unfortunately, because of the turnover of dental staff, not all clinics honored the cards. In response, the Project Manager developed a series of newsletters to keep communities up-to-date about the trial’s activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022034512459758">
<title>Interpretation of Outcomes</title>
<p>Given the small number of communities and the challenges of fidelity in the delivery and enactment of the counseling “messages” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512459758">Borrelli, 2011</xref>), it is not surprising that results do not overwhelmingly support the effectiveness of interventions based on MI. However, the generally positive nature of the results in children from the test communities, <italic>i.e</italic>., less severity and extent of caries, suggests that counseling with the spirit of MI should be considered in the planning of interventions to control caries in indigenous children. Slowing the development of severe caries is, indeed, a positive outcome. Counseling including fluoride varnish, together with community-wide health promotion, is likely a “best-practice” model for caries management initiatives in indigenous communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512459758">Lawrence <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512459758">Slade <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Control children had evidence of more dental treatment than test children. All communities have a dental clinic; whether ease of access to treatment for a young child differs among communities is not known but will be explored further. The increased amount of treatment observed in control children likely reflects their greater need of treatment.</p>
<p>The discomfort experienced by a child when caries extends into the dental pulp may affect his/her quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512459758">Schroth <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Overall, fewer test than control children were reported by their parents to have lost sleep, cried, missed preschool, or seen a dentist because of pain. However, these differences were not significant. Thus, the effect of the intervention on childhood quality of life, while in a positive direction, was inconclusive.</p>
<p>Our results will be useful for generating specific hypotheses that can be further tested and for informing protocols, approaches, and methods in on-going research with high-risk communities. Despite the extensive amount of pre-trial community collaboration, significant day-to-day challenges arose in the course of this trial. However, these challenges are no different from those faced by program planners and interveners working day-to-day with remote, indigenous communities.</p>
