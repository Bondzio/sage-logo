<abstract>
<p>The Zapatistas’ Other Campaign was important in producing a notion of politics in which persons with experiences of exploitation and subjugation emerged as subjects renaming themselves in history. The dialogue generated by the campaign demystified the liberal idea of citizenship, confined to voting, and opened the way for a broader definition of politics and the construction of a defiant collective and autonomous subjectivity. Its influence is apparent today in collective actions such as the Peace with Justice and Dignity movement and the #Yo Soy 132 movement, both of which focus on dialogue as the key for opposing authoritarianism and manipulation by dominant powers.</p>

<p>When the Other Campaign of the Zapatistas began in January of 2006 as a result of the Sixth Declaration from the Lacandón Jungle, which inaugurated an anticapitalist struggle “from below and to the left,” it promised to disrupt the interrelationship between knowledge, power, and subjectivity articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X13492127">Foucault (1999</xref>: 172; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X13492127">2002</xref>: 34–37; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X13492127">2008</xref>: 117). In Mexico’s modern history, this relationship has created ideological categories based on a notion of citizenship without links to complex political or historical accounts. In this article I argue that the Zapatistas’ stress on dialogue—“We question as we walk”—contains a political lesson: that knowledge production must follow the tracks of the collective actions being reconstituted.</p>
<p>The objective of this article is to show the importance of the Other Campaign in developing nonstate subjectivities by generating knowledge contrary to conceptions that standardize, deny, and erase people’s histories. The influence of the Other Campaign is reflected in collective actions in which people have raised their voices in opposition to various forms of control. In recent months this has included the emergence of the Peace with Justice and Dignity Movement, which has questioned the management of the pain caused by the state’s war against narcotraffickers, and the birth of the student movement #Yo Soy 132 (# I Am 132). Both movements focus on dialogue as the key for opposing authoritarianism and manipulation by dominant powers.</p>
<p>The Other Campaign emerged in what seemed to be a postauthoritarian and democratic Mexico. This context was, however, characterized by a crisis of its formal institutions and the stigmatization of social discontent. The dialogue that the Other Campaign generated gave shape to a different concept of the subject, one that produced organized efforts to imagine and create, with dignity, more just worlds. This dialogue was based on denial; in the meetings conducted by the Other Campaign, the stories of people who refused to be seen as victims were key in the re-creation of community.</p>
<p>The Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (Zapatista National Liberation Army—EZLN) emerged into the spotlight on January 1, 1994, the day that the North American Free Trade Agreement between Mexico, the United States, and Canada went into effect. After several days of fighting against the military and the death of guerrillas and civilians, it returned to the jungles and canyons of Chiapas, and since then it has not fired a single shot. Its actions have been aimed at constructing a different kind of autonomy based on the principle of “leading by obeying.” However, this has been a winding course. The Zapatistas have had several experiences of failure in their relations with the state. The most important of these was the institutional political class’s rejection, in 2001, of the San Andrés Accords, which in 1996 had given indigenous groups de facto territorial autonomy by recognizing them as “peoples” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X13492127">Hernández and Vera, 2004</xref>: 9). Faced with this disappointment, the Zapatistas began reflecting about their future. The Sixth Declaration from the Lacandón Jungle, which was issued in 2005 and gave rise to the Other Campaign, was the product of this assessment.</p>
<p>In that declaration the Zapatistas established that they were not “pure subjects,” not heroes of resistance who should be idealized—that, like the rest of us, they were affected by power, that they had a military structure that ought not overshadow the civil one, and that men mistreated women in their communities (although they were trying to overcome that). These statements indicate the self-criticism and learning that underlay the novel proposal of the Other Campaign and its articulation with the rest of society. In the social sciences we generally have a mythologized view of where contradictions do not or should not exist (for example, in community life). The determination to seek other experiences rather than remaining enclosed in their own was fundamental to the dialogical act of “questioning as we walk.”</p>
<p>Writing about this is important in today’s Mexico. Its main characteristic is violence, sometimes presented as institutional policy of dubious morality and sometimes as the exercise of the shadowy inherent powers of a state whose spokespersons hide behind the claim that these are simply the difficulties of constructing a full democracy. The most recent examples of this are the media’s creation of a presidential candidacy in 2012 and the disproportionate use of money to buy votes, legal or illegal, for the candidate of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (Institutional Revolutionary Party—PRI). This resulted in a dubious winner and the establishment of a citizen body to organize and oversee elections in the ideological interests of the dominant political parties.</p>
<p>In this article I use articles, blogs, and the notes of the journalist Hermann Bellinghausen (who has covered the Zapatistas since the 1994 uprising) containing testimony relevant to the Other Campaign. The point of view I highlight is the one that was generally observable in the meetings between the so-called Delegate Zero, Subcomandante Marcos, and the other participants in the events of the campaign. I draw on this record to reveal the arguments and ideas for creating a new politics and imagining a different world that emerged from the campaign, which can be seen as the staging of acts of defiance and dignity.</p>
<p>I question notions of citizenship that not only support expressions charged with racism and classism against the anti-institutional or rebellious political “other” but also justify the use of physical violence in the re-creation of an authoritarian state. I hope that knowledge of the subject constructed from people’s own experience has sufficient epistemological status to assume a place in history. I recognize that this proposal must be part of a wider debate involving the perspectives of critics of Zapatismo (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X13492127">Estrada, 2007</xref>: 22)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X13492127">1</xref></sup> who question the supposed idealization of its policies. These critical views, however, deny or silence the Zapatistas’ voices by reducing them either to victims or to people who fail to fulfill their civic obligations.</p>
<p>Confronted with the choice between idealizing Zapatismo and minimizing its achievements in the construction of autonomy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0094582X13492127">Tischler (2008</xref>: 58–65) proposes to view it as an antistate subject, understanding it in terms of a particular history of struggle within a collective, polymorphic and polyphonic history in which the imperative of “taking power” dissolves. Tischler’s approach is similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0094582X13492127">Eric Selbin (2010</xref>: 3), who is concerned with revalorizing what people say about their lives—their thoughts and feelings—in order to reexamine the idea of revolution. For him revolution is an unfinished puzzle whose pieces belong to different places that have in common imagination and people’s desire to change their lives and the world. My analytical and political intentions here are inspired by both these proposals.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X13492127">
<title>The Citizen and the Political “Other”</title>
<p>From the perspective of the theory of democracy, the Other Campaign disrupted Mexico’s democractic cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X13492127">2</xref></sup> When it emerged, the main political parties were involved in disseminating their ideas in the framework of elections to designate a new president and new members of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Other Campaign declared itself antisystemic and proposed to restructure the social world through an anticapitalist struggle from below. Subcomandante Marcos said, “It is impossible to construct autonomy for indigenous peoples beyond what they have now if the system is not radically transformed. . . . If we leave things as they are up there, we will all be destroyed, individually or as a group, while remaining separated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492127">Bellinghausen, 2006a</xref>).</p>
<p>The struggle proposed by the Other Campaign contrasted with the current experiences of the socialist turn in Latin America. Its ideas of democracy and justice meant harsh questioning of Mexico’s parties and political classes, and this position was in itself a challenge that was the object of criticism. In an emerging reality characterized by enthusiastic predictions of the end of history, economic globalization, the restructuring of social forces in the direction of transnationalism, and the celebration of multiculturalism in support of civic and political projects, the Zapatistas’ proposal was judged from various perspectives as anachronistic and counter to the institutionalization of democracy.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the Other Campaign as nonsense not only reflected the fear that the Zapatistas’ activities would hinder or cloud the practices of citizenship but had deeper undertones. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X13492127">Trouillot (2003</xref>: 23), interpretations of this kind are part of the Western construction of an “us and them” binary as a comfortable way to treat “people without history.” Following this idea, the “savage” (as a generic term for “others”) has been the argument for creating a kind of utopia, presented as either a promise or a dangerous illusion. The savage may be noble, wise, barbaric, or the victim of aggression depending on the debate and the interlocutors’ proposals. Avoiding these discursive inventions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X13492127">Trouillot (2003</xref>: 27) holds that otherness is always specific and historical; the “other” cannot be reduced to a residual category that expresses an ideological construction. There is no “other” but only multitudes of others who, despite totalizing narratives (including those of capital), are all “others” for different reasons.</p>
<p>The principles advanced by the Other Campaign were the object of a number of qualifiers associated with an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the democratic process. Why travel around the country when the political agenda is a matter of electoral cycles and party positions? How do we deal with the fact that attracting people to the EZLN will be taken as an attack on the left as an electoral force? The image of a centralized and vertical state that emerged from the Mexican Revolution left room for the opposing idea of a freer society or at least one in transition to democracy, with the result that in the re-creation of the distinction between the state and civil society a conception of institutional power emerged that offered little opportunity for resistance by subordinate groups and classes. Thus the political was limited to citizen participation, and subjectivity (citizenship) was conceived as consisting only of formal politics.</p>
<p>The tours of the Other Campaign produced a notion of politics in which persons with multiple experiences of exploitation and subjugation emerged as subjects renaming themselves in history. With this contribution the campaign went beyond the conjunctural limits of the liberal democratic cycle to reveal different perspectives on the construction of subjectivities out of daily struggles for dignity, autonomy, and survival. The subjectivity I am referring to is rooted in conception of class as struggle. Struggle is the denial of the reduction of persons to things, objects of knowledge and control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492127">Holloway (2009</xref>: 72) holds that one of the most important contributions of the Zapatistas to the social sciences is their refusal to be an object of study. The source of their struggle is this refusal to be classified, standardized, and universalized. The struggle is against the capitalistic logic that reduces everything to a commodity and against the rational domination of human beings, their cultures, territories, and lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0094582X13492127">Scott, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>It is instructive that, when the institutional politicians rejected the San Andrés Accords, the Zapatistas refused to limit their struggle to an “indigenous movement.” For them, accepting a constitutional reform that asserted the right to be identified as Indian would have limited their expectations to those of a multicultural world marked by the hegemony of the globalized market. Their fate would have been sealed; they would have been converted into exotic objects to be preserved through ecotourism and folk craft production while transnational corporations exploited their lands’ resources. Therefore the struggle promoted by the Other Campaign was antagonistic, and all of us fit into it. Its concern with recognizing global capitalism’s effects and the struggles that ordinary people deploy against them is justified in these terms. Its rebellious subjectivity is a challenge to various social forces. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X13492127">Scott (2009</xref>: 125) speaks of subjects in the highlands of Southeast Asia who, labeled “barbaric” by administrators, occupied a nonstate area of life that offered “the choice and the temptation” to create nonhierarchical organizations.</p>
<p>The Other Campaign began in the city of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, and made direct reference to the indigenous people of La Hormiga, who were expelled from their communities of origin by religious conflict. San Cristóbal’s lordly presence masks the labor of the thousands of exploited indigenous people required to erect it. The Other Campaign proposed to listen to the people who generate the country’s wealth “and in the end are left with nothing.” With this the EZLN defined itself as the spokesperson in the dialogues to come and at the same time expressed its commitment to constructing a new regime. With respect to this, the good-governance board of the Tzeltal region said (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13492127">Bellinghausen, 2006b</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>The true peoples have cultivated different projects with autonomy, and they work like the first peoples: It’s the new moon, so now we sow to have a good harvest to feed us in the future. Autonomy has served for the peoples themselves to construct their normative, political, economic, social, and cultural system. We want autonomy so that all of us will come out all right in all times, so that the leader leads by obeying.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Other Campaign toured much of Mexico, visiting ranches, ejidos, indigenous communities, urban neighborhoods, university auditoriums, and union halls. In the process the terms that operated to justify persecution, the use of police force, and the imprisonment of people whose acts of resistance were deemed dangerous and anti-institutional were also crystallized. In fact, in May 2006 police repressed and jailed residents of San Salvador Atenco and sympathizers of the movement. Faced with this violence, the Other Campaign was temporarily suspended and reoriented its activities to supporting the people affected. A short time later, on June 14, in the city of Oaxaca, police tried to disperse the teachers of the union’s Section 22 who were holding a sit-in in the city’s main square and central streets to demand a raise in salary. The police’s use of excessive force provoked immediate solidarity from various social sectors and gave rise to the Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de Oaxaca (Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca—APPO), which was also stigmatized.The deployment of state violence against the residents of Atenco and the members of the APPO was a perverse demonstration of the articulation of knowledge, politics, and technology toward the constitution of subjectivities in line with the precepts of liberal democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X13492127">Dean, 2007</xref>: 14), which focused on the creation of a citizenry that is responsible for itself. In other words, when the authorities acted against those people, they were governing in a way suited to people who did not fulfill their civic obligations.</p>
<p>The dominant concept of citizenship does not allow for any means of participation outside of formal institutions and practices. Is this conception of the “good citizen” enough to contain indignation? In the following pages, I propose to show that it is not—that the knowledge of simple people, based on their refusal to be reduced to classifiable things, demolishes the fictions with which bourgeois democratic theory attempts to justify and naturalize an order of exploitation and pain.</p>

<sec id="section2-0094582X13492127">
<title>Citizenship and Subject in the Authoritarian and Postauthoritarian Eras</title>
<p>The narrative of the citizen is a creation of academics and intellectuals. It has been popularized by the mass media; for example, a private open television channel broadcasts a series of documentaries called <italic>Mexico: The Story of Its Democracy</italic>. It has a strong basis in the conformation of the centrist state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X13492127">Rubin, 2003</xref>: 144), with its false dichotomy between state and society. Given the argument of the absence or weakness of civil society and the strong presence of a centrist state projecting a vertical image of power, opportunities for the emergence of citizenship are practically nonexistent.</p>
<p>A focus on the centrist state provides the basis for a periodization of modern liberal democratic history in terms of two epochs. The first is the authoritarian period, characterized by the centralized processes involved in the creation of the Mexican national state, basically through emphasis on grassroots political loyalty to a social pact involving agrarian reform, public education, and the recognition of minimal labor rights. Certain categories emerged in the formation of this state (among them campesino, indigenous person, and marginalized person) as a product of political essentialization, basically referring to their condition as victims, on the part of the state and elites.</p>
<p>The postauthoritarian period is characterized primarily by the emergence and consolidation of the structural reforms imposed on the Mexican state by international finance institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank after the Mexican economic and debt crisis. This period saw not only these economic and social reforms but political ones including the creation of independent institutions for the administration of elections. In that context, the rise to the presidency in 2000 of an opposition candidate, the center-rightist Vicente Fox, was considered a corollary of the public will in its trajectory toward a democratic society.</p>
<p>In both periods, the prevailing definition of politics involved the existence of institutional frameworks that guaranteed formal democracy and citizen participation. Thus those who did not fully exercise their citizenship by voting were excluded. In particular, the postauthoritarian period contained in its elections the ritual expression of an order in which the poor, the dispossessed, and other kinds of subordinates had the opportunity to feel included in a society, however classist, that represented them. Not participating in the ritual of voting politically marginalized those subjects and left them powerless (or depoliticized them).</p>
<p>The principles advanced by the Zapatistas in their idea of autonomy put in check the liberal autonomy of self-governing societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X13492127">Dean, 2007</xref>: 8–9). Democratic theory in Mexico has not managed to understand the interrelationship between men and women’s individual experiences in the reconstitution of community through self-determination. While the jargon of structured public opinion promotes harmony, tolerance, and respect, at the same time it prescribes the existence of forms of life based on exploitation and subjugation through an individual who governs himself but hands over his mandate to other citizens. The Other Campaign permitted the recognition of practices that sought to establish collective and horizontal agreements, generally in assemblies, based on respect for individual rights, including women’s rights. Many of the communities that the Other Campaign reached were mainly made up of women because many men had had to leave in search of work. It is no coincidence, therefore, that in exploring the contradictions that the Zapatistas seek to overcome, reconfiguring the position of women in the reconstitution of the community is key. It is part of a process in which the power to legitimize and naturalize the structures of inequality based on the idea of liberal citizenship is demystified, opening the way for a broader definition of politics and the construction of a defiant collective and autonomous subjectivity.</p>

<title>Dialogue as Ethical Premise</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X13492127">Trouillot (2003</xref>: 132) laments the fact that anthropologists, in particular, have turned their backs on the “others” by denying their active presence and silencing their voices. In a sense, this is what has happened with subordinate groups in Mexico. When speaking about democracy, the specialists in the social sciences and political history who alone are considered capable of offering commentaries on democracy create a metadiscourse. The Other Campaign restored to the subjects the role of spokesperson with regard to their suffering and hopes.</p>
<p>During the campaign, hundreds of people, organizations, and collectives had the opportunity to offer their points of view. One declaration, from Comandante David, appealed directly to indigenous people and particularly to those who had had to leave in search of work as illustrative of the exclusion and exploitation experienced daily by thousands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X13492127">Bellinghausen, 2006c</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X13492127">Bellinghausen (2006d)</xref> writes of a meeting in Campeche as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Delegate Zero warned that, in Campecheans’ account of environmental deterioration, dispossession of land, and contempt for women, they conclude that it is because of “bad luck or because God wanted it so, this is not his place.” However, if the account mentions a name of a powerful rich person, and he is the one responsible for the campesinos’ misery or the destruction of nature, then “we do not have any reason to struggle separately.” He explained that the Other Campaign is not inviting everyone who attends, only men and women who see that this is their space and can bring meaning to the work of struggle that they make from their place.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In an event that took place somewhere in Querétaro, a person linked to an indigenous group holding a sit-in against the local government said, “We women know that they screw us as poor and as indigenous people. They throw water on us because that is how they shoo animals away” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X13492127">Bellinghausen, 2006e</xref>). At this meeting speakers highlighted Zapatista lessons for constructing a new world through organizing based on mutual aid. Someone else, appealing to the necessity to find a more effective way to communicate, established the imperative of speaking in their indigenous language as a way of stressing their common condition.</p>
<p>Where elections are seen as the consequence of the expression of multiple voices and wills through the constitution of citizenship, public speaking about sorrows and desires and remaining silent were aspects of the construction of knowledge for another type of subject. Taking the opportunity to speak, listen, and learn was a powerful process of generating self-knowledge in the context of struggle. The historian Andrés Aubry has said of the Zapatistas’ role in the transformation of society, “Knowledge production is not only born from analysis and wisdom, but also from action, from struggle. The street, jail, an assembly, a strike, the barricades of all times, resistance and rebellion in a repressive context, are also cognitive” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X13492127">Bellinghausen, 2006f</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0094582X13492127">
<title>Long and Short Stories</title>
<p>The acts of the Other Campaign were sites of history production. This was not history as recorded and narrated by the dominant but histories in which a rebellious subjectivity constructed through experience was part of the description of the events. The historicity of the subjects was interwoven with and made possible an antagonistic narrative revealing not only the conditions of inequality from which views of history emerged but also the differential exercise of power that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0094582X13492127">Trouillot (1995</xref>: 25) notes, makes some narratives possible and silences others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X13492127">Grosfoguel and Cervantes-Rodríguez, 2002</xref>, for a different focus). The Other Campaign’s meetings could produce stories because they provoked both memories of struggles and organizational forms of previous decades and the long-term memories that every human community has been accumulating for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X13492127">Gilly, 2006</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>Shortly after the Other Campaign began, in an ejido in Chiapas campesinos expressed their concerns about “the high cost of electricity, the exploitation of resources by Petróleos Mexicanos, the lack of land, and the imprisonment of some of their companions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X13492127">Henríquez, 2006</xref>). This complaint was the preamble for a series of stories of dispossession and oppression—about the consequences of government programs, lack of employment, and inequality, about the construction in recent years of a neoliberal capitalist landscape characterized by the use of agricultural land for commercial cultivation and opencast mining or the installation of infrastructure for airports, highways, residential zones, and golf courses for the rich, the expropriation of springs by transnational water bottling companies, the creation of “tourist developments,” and the emergence of industrial maquiladoras.</p>
<p>If one reviews Mexican newspapers of the time or was fortunate enough to witness some of these events, one will recognize that the stories raised issues of subjugation and exploitation. One example is the case of a woman from Querétaro who testified, “At 35 I am already considered too old for any job” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X13492127">Bellinghausen, 2006g</xref>). Similarly, the elderly, the young, transsexuals, lesbians, and gays, among others, spoke about their own dramas. Daily violence was a significant topic. At one stop on the road to Morelos, defenders of human rights reported that “between 2002 and 2005, 49 women were murdered. In the first months of 2006, 11 more women were murdered, the last 8 in only 15 days.” They added, however, “We came here to speak about resistance, not to passively accept this terrible reality that women of Morelos live—women like compañera Otilia, who died in Tepoztlán and they concluded that it was suicide, or compañera Veronica, a well-known ecologist who turned up murdered in her home in Ahuatepec, just a kilometer from where we are attending this forum” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X13492127">Bellinghausen, 2006h</xref>). Similarly, an indigenous representative of a self-governing community with a community police force told about his experiences with the dangerous conditions under which people of his region lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X13492127">Bellinghausen, 2006i</xref>). A common feature of these stories was the organizational experiences with which people daily resisted tragedy and hopelessness.</p>

<title>Another Epistemology, Another Subject</title>
<p>The participants in the Other Campaign were fully conscious of who they were. When they spoke, they referred to their experiences of struggle and organization; when they listened or remained silent, they did it as subjects aware of their own voices. Breaking the power of labels imposed from above was crucial. The rupture took place on three interrelated levels: the declaration of an anticapitalist struggle, fierce criticism of elections, parties, and the political class, and “leading while obeying”—in essence, opposition to vertical forms of power and the disposition to generate a subject free of the authority of the state (or any other form of authority) and of unequal relations based on capitalist accumulation. An indigenous university student said that the 1994 uprising had created an epistemology that could today serve to transform “the sadness of always being subordinate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X13492127">Bellinghausen, 2006j</xref>). When Marcos referred to the Other Campaign as a “roll call” of resistance from which to begin to construct a network of brotherhood to confront the “government,” he provided a glimpse of the campaign’s potential for creating self-consciousness in its subject.</p>
<p>To this profile of the Other Campaign’s subject I can only add Subcomandante Marcos’s emphasis on learning to look at the heart, much like Comandante Ramona’s emphasis on perceiving people’s particular pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X13492127">Enlace Zapatista, 2006a</xref>). Noticing what distressed individuals, peoples, and sectors meant recognizing, in the first place, that until that moment we had all been struggling alone. As Marcos put it, at one meeting a man said, “I didn’t know that all of you also thought that way.” In his view, it was necessary to know who we are and construct a collective voice from our experiences—the voice of the “fearless women” of San Salvador de Atenco after the government forces brutally attacked them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492127">Enlace Zapatista, 2006b</xref>).</p>
<p>The Other Campaign also gave importance to those who, despite their disadvantaged condition, organized against extractive industries such as mining or against delinquency. Among these were the volunteer police of the mountains of Guerrero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X13492127">Enlace Zapatista, 2006c</xref>) and the people of Santa María Ostula, Michoacán, who confronted the entrepreneurs, corrupt bureaucrats, narcotraffickers, and military men who saw the community’s lands as ideal places to establish their businesses and whose defense of their territory caused 28 murders in a matter of two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X13492127">Enlace Zapatista, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Early Echoes of the Other Campaign</title>
<p>The 2006 electoral defeat of the Mexican left was accompanied by suspicions of fraud and led to strong social protest. Sympathizers of the electoral left marched and occupied the streets, even staging a sit-in for several weeks on one of the principal avenues of Mexico City. Academics and liberal intellectuals dismissed these events and attributed them to the movement’s leadership, which they considered messianic and populist. The most significant of these events was a change in the categorization of subjects. Strong contingents rejected the electoral results and launched what they called “civil resistance,” occupying public spaces and creating the National Democratic Convention as the foundation for a new sovereign power that would emanate from the people’s will. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the candidate of the left, was even called the “legitimate president.”</p>
<p>The radicalism of this movement, with its agenda of defense of the nation’s resources and the popular economy as a commitment for reestablishing the republic, reflected the strong participation of subjects whose stories, vicissitudes, despairs, and desires went beyond simply legitimating the reproduction of power through the ritual of elections. The movement proved that it could not be reduced to its leadership and showed that it was supported by social sectors with histories of exploitation and exclusion. The great merit of the Other Campaign—pointing to opportunities for the formation of a rebellious subjectivity—was also apparent in the subjects emerging from the postelection movement. The political “other,” reduced by the liberal rhetoric to a dangerous, anti-institutional renegade or simply a “bad citizen,” was an ideological construction held together by safety pins. In different places, the Other Campaign allowed us to see people taking steps toward the disruption of these categorizations.</p>
<p>The success of the Other Campaign cannot be measured in terms of political calculations, which considered the numbers of people it brought together trivial. Conservatives dismissed it as a failure and pointed to its potential to cause social instability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X13492127">Escalante, 2006</xref>: 5), while progressives argued that the Zapatistas’ presence damaged the left’s electoral prospects. Unfavorable comparisons with the Color of the Earth March for Indigenous Autonomy in 2001 were inevitable. The march had been judged necessary, politically meaningful, and unlikely to obstruct the electoral cycle. When its proposal ran into the impossibility of constitutional recognition of indigenous autonomy, the Zapatistas learned that change could scarcely be achieved through institutions and rituals that supported class inequality. After the 2006 elections, the movement that produced the National Democratic Convention awakened from its dream when its actions were judged as insurgent as those of the Zapatistas. The Movement of National Regeneration, a citizen-created mobilization for institutional political change, emerged from the electoral defeat of the left. Its members dissociated themselves from the vertical and territorial structures typical of leftist parties, in most cases organizing among neighbors, friends, and networks with horizontal and dense, face-to-face interactions that were important in shoring up López Obrador’s presidential candidacy in 2012.</p>

<title>Final Words: Knowledge, Experiences, and Change</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13492127">Beverley (2011</xref>: 118) calmly notes that the Other Campaign was part of a “theoretical error” in that it hindered the course of an electoral cycle that would have strengthened the weak political actions of Mexican subalterns. In conclusion I want to emphasize that my modest contribution here points to a contrary understanding.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of an epistemological inversion to achieve an insurgent prose in which the “written world” is reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13492127">Guha, 1999</xref>) or generating a narrative in which the critical writer gives voice to subalterns who cannot speak (Spivak, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13492127">Beverley, 2011</xref>: 119). The Other Campaign was significant in generating knowledge about self-managed organizational projects that contributed to our thinking about their struggle by connecting it to a historical and concrete totality.</p>
<p>In recent months we have been amazed by the appearance of movements that are spontaneous, antiauthoritarian, and critical of the vertical structures characteristic of the state. In public spaces in Egypt, Greece, and Spain and even in Wall Street, these practices continue. Agreements are generally established by consensus in assemblies, problematic agendas do not exist, and there is no direction to take because the direction is irrelevant—walking will establish routes that do not reproduce contradictions between individuals and collectives. In the Occupy Wall Street gatherings in New York there was constant reference to Zapatismo. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492127">Marina Sitrin (2011</xref>: 9) points out that the Occupy movement was without precedent and argues that the Zapatista saying “One no, many yeses” is pertinent to the construction of substantive democracy.</p>
<p>A movement against the innocent victims (“collateral damage”) of the Mexican state’s war against narcotraffickers (which is estimated to have cost 60,000 lives) has adopted the Other Campaign’s stress on assembling the voices and experiences of pain of people who have lost a loved one. This movement has led to the discovery of the clandestine graves of Mexican and Central American migrants on their way to the United States, victims of organized crime and showing signs of torture. The Peace with Justice and Dignity movement mentioned earlier is headed—and not led—by the poet Javier Sicilia, who is mired in the drama of the murder of his son.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0094582X13492127">3</xref></sup> Similarly, women from the south of Central America have traveled through Mexico in search of their offspring, supported only by the will derived from their suffering. The mothers of Ciudad Juárez whose daughters were humiliated, murdered, and left in the desert persist in seeking justice, carrying their anguish on their backs. All this, the subject of dialogue between victims and supportive spokespersons, has generated critical knowledge that lays bare the institutional crisis in Mexico and the degree of corruption of its political class.</p>
<p>Finally, I return to an experience of Mexico in 2012—the movement called #Yo Soy 132 (#I Am 132) started by students at the Universidad Iberoamericana. They were accused by the leadership of the PRI of being intolerant of democracy and being not students but individuals trained and counseled by the candidate of the left (López Obrador). In response, they posted a video on You Tube in which they gave their names and their student credentials as a simple illustration of the refusal to be categorized as dangerous subjects. These students insisted on their right to be indignant about the suffering of others. In the event at which they were stigmatized, held at their university, they silenced the PRI presidential candidate when he boasted about the use of force against the people of Atenco in 2006, when he was governor of that area. In stating their names and where they came from and showing what they could do without orders or vertical leadership, meeting in assemblies with students from other universities, both public and private, and other people with experiences of struggle, these young men and women appear to be following the tracks of the Zapatistas.</p>
<p>The #Yo Soy 132 movement has managed to break with the usual characterization of young people as apolitical beings who at most seek refuge in the articulation of an identity. Tragedy and pain, unemployment, violence, poorly paid jobs, and scarce opportunities to study are what generally await young people in this moment of crisis. The banal and normalized categorizations of those who are neither studying nor working (the “Ni-Ni”) are about to be disrupted. University students in this movement are now sending others a message to refuse to be objectified.</p>
<p>All these examples underscore the importance of noticing the dialogue people establish among themselves, with its enormous differences and contradictions. The Other Campaign showed that another consciousness is possible. It is a subjectivity that challenges the positivist standardization generally pursued in the social sciences, the updated narratives of progress, and the recurring fiction of the state’s creation of “citizens” as submissive and exploitable beings through liberalism.</p>

<title>Postscript</title>
<p>As readers can corroborate by reading Mexican newspapers from the beginning of 2013 and various web sites, on December 21, 2012, thousands of Zapatistas arrived in various municipalities of Chiapas to commemorate with a silent march the murder of children, women, and elders of Acteal perpetrated by a group of paramilitaries in 1997. This act, showing deniers of the massacre who the Zapatistas are, was followed by a series of communiqués from the Revolutionary Clandestine Indigenous Committee’s general command pointing to the breakdown of the political class and its institutions. A transcendent element of these messages was the wealth of experiences gathered by the Zapatistas from others who struggle with dignity elsewhere in the world. The demonstration of simple people marching in silence through streets dominated by those who control institutional politics and the call for dialogue about how to pursue an emancipated future should lead us to believe that the revolution’s history is being rewritten. This is a history that learns from defeats and betrayals, a history that constructs ordinary people here and there as inspired by their rebellious subjectivity to say no.</p>
