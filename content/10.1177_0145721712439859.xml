<title>AADE’s DEAP Offers Accreditation for Your DSME/T Program</title>
<p>AADE provides accreditation for Diabetes Self-Management Education programs through DEAP (Diabetes Education Accreditation Program). Accrediting your program brings quality, trust, confidence, and the additional benefit of reimbursement eligibility by Medicare and other insurance providers.</p>
<p>Only AADE is solely dedicated to supporting educators who provide diabetes self-management training. The AADE DEAP team provides excellent customer support throughout the application process. Applicants do not need to be CDE certified, but teaching in your accredited program does count toward CDE and BC-ADM practice hours. Our online application process allows you to stop and start your application as needed. All required documents can be uploaded at your convenience. You only need to fill out one application for your program, even if you have multiple sites.</p>
<p>AADE’s simple fee structure includes up to 10 sites for only $800 and 11 to 20 sites for only $1200. If you have more than 20 locations, contact the DEAP program at 800.338.3633 for more information and pricing.</p>

<title>BC-ADM Exam Now Available</title>
<p>AADE is accepting applications to sit for the Board Certified-Advanced Diabetes Management (BC-ADM) Exam. Becoming a BC-ADM is a great achievement for diabetes educators with an advanced degree in their field and a professional license. The scope of advanced diabetes practice includes patient management skills such as medication adjustment, medical nutrition therapy, exercise planning, and counseling for behavior management and psychosocial issues. Attaining optimal metabolic control in the diabetic client may include treatment and monitoring of acute and chronic complications. The depth of knowledge and competence in advanced clinical practice and diabetes skills affords an increased complexity of decision making that expands the traditional disciplines’ specific practice. Research, mentoring, and continuing professional development are expected skill sets.</p>
<p>Applications are accepted on a continual basis. In 2011 over 100 new candidates sat for the exam. The examination is offered during 1-month windows following the application’s approval.</p>
<p>Candidates are strongly encouraged to complete their applications at least 60 days prior to their desired testing date. There are two testing windows per year—June and December:</p>

<title>CORE Concepts Now Available Live and Online</title>
<p>AADE is pleased to offer this valuable resource in two formats, so you can choose the learning method that is best for you.</p>
<sec id="section11-0145721712439859">
<title>New 8-week online course</title>
<p>AADE’s popular CORE Concepts Course is now available as an 8-week online course. You will be able to earn more than 20 hours of CE credit at times that fit your schedule.</p>
<p>An instructor will post lessons and required readings once per week during the course. <italic>The Art and Science of Diabetes Self-Management Education Desk Reference: 2nd Edition</italic> is the required text for the class. After completing the readings, students will answer instructor questions in the discussion forum and take an online test about the week’s lesson. At the end of the 8-week course, students will be tested on their knowledge of the overall course. Grades will be based on the final test as well as participation in the discussion forums.</p>
<p>The courses will be available two more times in 2012:</p>
