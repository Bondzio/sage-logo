<abstract>
<p>The application of a previously developed computational method to the prediction of high-lift performance for multi-element aerofoil sections operating at transonic flow conditions is described. The flows are computed by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, using a full differential Reynolds-stress turbulence model to evaluate the various Reynolds-stress components appearing in the governing mean-flow equations. Algebraic wall functions are used to bridge the molecular viscosity-dominated region immediately adjacent to the aerofoil surfaces. An unstructured grid-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology is used to deal with the geometric complexity of the multi-element aerofoil configurations. Initial results are presented for the viscous, transonic flow development around the SKF 1.1 supercritical aerofoil section, equipped with either a trailing-edge flap or a leading-edge slat. Predicted surface pressure distributions generally compare well with experimental data for the two high-lift aerofoil geometries considered, at a free-stream Mach number of 0.6 and over a range of incidence angles. There are some discrepancies in the regions immediately downstream of shock wave/boundary layer interactions, possibly resulting from the use of wall-function boundary conditions in the computations. Predicted Mach number contours indicate the complexity of the transonic flow fields for high-lift configurations, with the slat wake passing through an extensive supersonic-flow region, terminated by a normal shock wave, on the main aerofoil upper surface, for example.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954410011417541"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Mechanical high-lift systems, comprising trailing-edge flaps and possibly leading-edge slats, are used by most aircraft during the take-off and landing phases of flight. Flaps provide additional lift at low speed beyond that provided by the clean wing configuration of the aircraft, and slats enable higher incidence angles to be attained before significant upper surface flow separation takes place. The high-lift system can have a significant impact on the overall aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft, with small improvements in the high-lift efficiency of the wing leading to significant gains in payload, field length, and climb-out performance [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011417541">1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011417541">2</xref></bold>]. For combat aircraft, there is an additional requirement that the wing must be able to generate high lift at transonic flight conditions, in order to enhance manoeuvring performance, without incurring an excessive drag penalty or promoting the onset of shock-induced flow separation or buffet. The use of supercritical aerofoil sections on the clean wing planform can help in this regard by allowing rearward movement of upper-surface shock waves without an increase in shock-wave strength. Flight tests of an F-4 E Phantom II aircraft equipped with leading-edge slats [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011417541">3</xref></bold>] have demonstrated significantly improved climb and turn manoeuvrability, even without complete optimization of the slat configuration. Whitford [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011417541">4</xref></bold>] provides a quantitative example of such an improvement with the F-4 E aircraft in a steady-state turn at a flight Mach number of 0.6 and an altitude of 10 000 ft. The aircraft can execute a 180° turn in 14.2 s at a load factor of 4.5 <italic>g</italic> when equipped with slats, compared with 19.0 s at a load factor of 3.5 <italic>g</italic> without slats. However, the aerodynamic benefits of high-lift systems need to be balanced against the weight penalty and additional system complexity.</p>
<p>The additional lift generated by deployment of a high-lift system is achieved by the increased effective camber and chord-wise extent of the multi-element wing planform. Such a wing is generally able to operate at higher incidence angles since the upper surface pressure rise to the trailing edge is split over a number of wing elements. The multi-element nature of the geometry leads to the presence of more complex flow phenomena such as turbulent wake/boundary layer mixing and closed re-circulation bubbles in flap and slat cove regions. Also, the wakes of upstream geometry elements develop in the stream-wise adverse pressure gradients of the downstream geometry elements which can result in off-the-surface flow-reversal in the wake. Finally, at transonic manoeuvring conditions, there are likely to be shock waves present on the main wing element and possibly also on the flaps and/or slats. The viscous flow development through the gap regions between the main wing and the flap and slat elements means that optimization of the high-lift geometry, in terms of gaps, overlaps and angles, is significantly dependent on Reynolds number. Thus, the results of optimization studies using wind tunnel testing of sub-scale models at lower Reynolds numbers can be difficult to extrapolate to flight conditions. It is in this area, particularly, that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods can give some insight and so complement wind tunnel test programmes.</p>
<p>Nield [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011417541">5</xref></bold>] considers the high-lift design process for low-speed applications, highlighting the importance of modern CFD methods which are able to provide predictions of aerodynamic performance at flight Reynolds numbers. The quantitative accuracy of these CFD methods is very dependent upon the validity of the engineering turbulence models used to approximate the physics in the governing mean-flow equations. The development and application of CFD methods to transonic, high-lift flow conditions has received much less attention than the low-speed, take-off, and landing flight regime. Inviscid-flow methods for two-element aerofoil configurations were developed in the mid-1970s, with Caughey [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011417541">6</xref></bold>] using the transonic small-disturbance equation for example. Grossman and Melnik [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011417541">7</xref></bold>] and Arlinger [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011417541">8</xref></bold>] solved the full-potential equation, using conformal mapping techniques to transform the flow around a two-element aerofoil into the annular region between two concentric circles. Rosch and Klevenhusen [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410011417541">9</xref></bold>] developed a method applicable to more general multi-element aerofoil geometries using computational grids consisting of the streamlines and equi-potential lines of the incompressible flow-field around the geometry. Initial attempts to develop viscous flow methods involved the coupling of boundary-layer methods to the inviscid flow solvers; see Grossman and Volpe [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954410011417541">10</xref></bold>], Leicher [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011417541">11</xref></bold>], and Rosch and Klevenhusen [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410011417541">9</xref></bold>]. Such viscous/inviscid coupled methods tend to break down with the onset of flow separation, limiting their practical use in the design process. The use of modern CFD methods, based around solutions of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, provide a more practical basis for a high-lift analysis method. Rumsey and Ying [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954410011417541">12</xref></bold>] review methods developed for application to low-speed, high-lift flows, the majority of the methods being based onstructured-grid formulations and employing the turbulent-viscosity approach to model the Reynolds stresses appearing in the mean-flow equations.</p>
<p>The objective of this study is to extend the application of a modern Navier–Stokes based CFD method to high-lift aerodynamic flows at transonic flight conditions. An existing CFD method is used for this initial investigation and so this article concentrates on discussing the resulting computations rather than on the CFD methodology itself. It can be noted here that the CFD method employed has been used extensively to predict high-lift flow development at low-speed flight conditions for multi-element aerofoil sections. It has also been used in the analysis of transonic flow development around single-aerofoil sections. Salient features of the CFD methodology are presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-0954410011417541">section 2</xref>, and the method is applied to two transonic high-lift configurations in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6-0954410011417541">section 3</xref>. Finally, some initial conclusions are drawn from this study in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec9-0954410011417541">section 4</xref>.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0954410011417541"><title>2 COMPUTATIONAL METHOD</title>
<p>A practical computational method to predict the aerodynamic performance of two-dimensional, high-lift aerofoil configurations involves three main components: a procedure for generating suitable computational grids around the multi-element aerofoil section, the implementation of a turbulence model to predict the flow physics, and an efficient solution algorithm for the mean-flow and turbulence-transport equations. Using structured grids, it is relatively straightforward to generate the highly stretched computational cells immediately adjacent to the aerofoil surfaces which are required to resolve the boundary-layer regions in these high-Reynolds number flows. However, the turbulent boundary-layer and wake regions developing around a high-lift system can change significantly in position and thickness as the aerofoil section is pitched from small incidence angles up to and beyond the stall condition. In this situation, an unstructured-grid approach, together with flow-adaptation, may be a more efficient approach [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011417541">13</xref></bold>]. Also, around maximum-lift conditions, there is significant stream-wise curvature of the turbulent wakes flowing from upstream aerofoil elements over the upper surfaces of the downstream elements. The various Reynolds normal- and shear-stress components appearing in the mean-flow equations respond in different ways to the influence of flow curvature. This vector-like behaviour cannot be simulated using a scalar turbulent-viscosity coefficient to model the Reynolds stresses, as in the <italic>k–ε</italic> turbulence model. It is for this reason that a differential Reynolds-stress transport equation model (DRSM) is adopted in this computational work.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954410011417541"><title>2.1 Grid generation</title>
<p>The unstructured grid-generation procedure used is described in detail by Marques and Johnston [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011417541">14</xref></bold>] and consists of three distinct stages. First, structured-like grids, consisting of directly triangulated quadrilateral cells, are wrapped locally around the various aerofoil elements and extended downstream of the trailing edges. These anisotropic-grid regions encompass all the anticipated boundary-layer and wakes regions of the flow domain. Any overlapping cells in these regions are deleted. Next, an initial triangulation is constructed, using the Delaunay algorithm, to discretize the remaining parts of the flow domain. The final stage of the grid-generation process involves refinement of this initial Delaunay triangulation using thecell sub-division technique of Jahangirian and Johnston [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011417541">13</xref></bold>]. A Laplacian smoother is also applied in this region and to the outer layers of the anisotropic-grid regions, with an edge-swapping operation being used to further enhance the grid quality. The desired grid density and quality is generally achieved after 20 iterations of the cell sub-division procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011417541">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011417541">2</xref>). The outer boundary to the computational domain is placed at 25 chords away from the aerofoil section geometry in all directions. Note that flow conditions at the outer boundary are corrected for the influence of the circulation around the aerofoil section, resulting from the lift force generated.

<sec id="sec4-0954410011417541"><title>2.2 Governing flow equations</title>
<p>The computational method employed here is based on solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations applicable to two-dimensional, compressible, turbulent flow. The time-dependent, integral form of the equations is used, with steady-state solutions being obtained by time-marching procedures. The Reynolds-stress terms appearing in the governing mean-flow equations are modelled using the simplified version of the differential Reynolds-stress model of Launder <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011417541">15</xref></bold>]. This turbulence model solves modelled transport equations for the three Reynolds normal-stress components, the Reynolds shear stress, and the rate-of-dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. Further details concerning the mean-flow equations can be found in Johnston and Stolcis [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410011417541">16</xref></bold>]. Cantariti and Johnston [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954410011417541">17</xref></bold>] discuss implementation of the DRSM turbulence model which can employ either wall-function boundary conditions or a one-equation, low-Reynolds number formulation for the near-wall regions of the flow.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0954410011417541"><title>2.3 Solution algorithm</title>
<p>The mean-flow and turbulence-transport equations are discretized in space using the cell-centred, finite volume formulation of Jameson <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954410011417541">18</xref></bold>], which employs additional numerical dissipation terms in order to facilitate smooth solutions. The resulting set of semi-discrete equations can be written as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0954410011417541"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011417541-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>q<sub>i</sub></italic> is the vector of dependent variables, <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic> the residual containing the convective, diffusive and source terms, <italic>D<sub>i</sub></italic> contains the numerical dissipation terms, and <italic>h<sub>i</sub></italic> the area of computational cell <italic>i</italic>. The dual-time, implicit method of Jameson [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954410011417541">19</xref></bold>] is used to time-march the semi-discrete equations to a steady-state solution. The time-derivative in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954410011417541">1</xref>) is approximated by a second-order accurate, implicit, finite difference operator
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0954410011417541"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011417541-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>n</italic> denotes a time level. It is convenient at this stage to define a new residual <italic>R</italic>*
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0954410011417541"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011417541-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
The solution of the steady-state problem
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0954410011417541"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011417541-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>
is also a solution of the original set of discretized mean-flow and modelled turbulence-transport equations. Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0954410011417541">4</xref>) is solved by introducing a fictitious pseudo-time <italic>τ</italic>, and setting-up a new time-dependent problem
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-0954410011417541"><label>(5)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011417541-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>An explicit, four-stage scheme is used to time-march this equation to a steady-state solution, with local time-stepping and implicit residual smoothing techniques being employed to enhance the convergence rate. Note that convergence of the pseudo time-dependent problem, equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0954410011417541">5</xref>), results also in convergence of the original time-dependent problem, equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954410011417541">1</xref>), in real time. The dual-time, implicit approach is computationally much more efficient than a purely explicit solution procedure.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0954410011417541"><title>3 RESULTS</title>
<p>The computational method used in this study has been applied previously to the prediction of high-lift aerodynamic flows, at the low-speed conditions associated with take-off and landing. The objective here is to extend evaluation of the method to the transonic flow conditions encountered by a combat aircraft in manoeuvring flight, when deploying leading- or trailing-edge high-lift devices. In particular, two high-lift configurations are considered, both derived from the SKF 1.1 supercritical aerofoil section. Experimental data, comprising surface static pressure distributions, are taken from tests performed in the DFVLR 1 × 1 m<sup>2</sup> transonic wind tunnel. Stanewsky and Thibert [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954410011417541">20</xref></bold>] describe the wind tunnel and tabulate experimental results for the clean SKF 1.1 aerofoil section and for this aerofoil section equipped with a trailing-edge manoeuvre flap. Cases involving the SKF 1.1 aerofoil section equipped with a leading-edge manoeuvre slat are also considered in this study. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954410011417541">Table 1</xref> lists conditions for the eight transonic-flow cases investigated here, all are at a nominal free-stream Mach number <italic>M</italic> of 0.6 and a Reynolds number <italic>R</italic> of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup>, based on the clean aerofoil chord. The experimental data involve free transition on all aerofoil surfaces.

<p>Fixed transition points are used for all the present calculations and are measured relative to the leading edge of the clean aerofoil section. Transition is enforced by setting the source terms to zero in the turbulence-transport equations in the computationalcells immediately adjacent to the aerofoil surfaces, upstream of the fixed transition positions. Preliminary computations indicate the need for a −2¼° correction to all the nominal experimental incidence angles, in order to account for wind-tunnel wall interference effects, and this correction is included in the values given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954410011417541">Table 1</xref>. The DRSM turbulence model, with wall-function near-wall boundary conditions, has been employed in all the computations. A study of the flow solution sensitivity to computational grid density has been undertaken. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410011417541">Table 2</xref> indicates the three levels of grid density evaluated for the slat/aerofoil configuration of Run 310, and these are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011417541">Figs 2</xref>(a) to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011417541"/>(c).

<sec id="sec7-0954410011417541"><title>3.1 SKF 1.1 aerofoil section with trailing-edge flap</title>
<p>The computational grid for the SKF 1.1 aerofoil section with a manoeuvre flap deflected 15° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011417541">Fig. 1</xref>) consists of 93 485 cells, 140 597 cell-edges, and 47 878 vertices. There are 371 and 252 cell-edges on the surfaces of the main-aerofoil and flap elements, respectively. Transition is fixed at 0.05 and 0.4 chord lengths on the upper and lower surfaces of the main aerofoil, respectively. Similarly, transition is fixed close to the leading edge of the flap element, at 0.85 and 0.90 chord lengths, respectively, on the upper and lower surfaces. Four experimental cases are considered, with flow conditions ranging from essentially fully subsonic, Run 252, to a case involving shock-induced flow separation on the main aerofoil upper surface, Run 255.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011417541">Figure 5</xref> indicates a generally satisfactory level of agreement between predictions and experiment for the surface pressure distributions on the main aerofoil element and the trailing-edge flap, over the range of incidence angles considered. Note that, as is generally the case for high-lift configurations at low-speed flow conditions, the flap surface pressure distribution is insensitive to changes in incidence angle, and the flap flow remains essentially subsonic. There are some differences between predicted and experimental surface pressures in the region of the shock wave for Runs 254 and 255 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011417541">Figs 5</xref>(c) and (d)), with an under-prediction of pressure levels immediately downstream of the shock wave. The use of wall-function boundary conditions is likely to influence results in this region of shock wave/boundary layer interaction, particularly for Run 255 which involves shock-induced flow separation. The Mach number contours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410011417541">Fig. 6</xref>) show the increasing size of the supersonic region on the upper surface of the main aerofoil as the incidence angle is increased, together with an associated thickening of the main aerofoil wake above the flap upper surface. Also, to be seen is the closed re-circulation bubble sitting in the flap cove region. For Run 255 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410011417541">Fig. 6</xref>(d)), a small region of shock-induced flow separation is predicted between 32 per cent and 35 per cent chord on the upper surface of the main aerofoil element. The boundary layer re-attaches but thickens rapidly as the trailing edge is approached. Looking more closely in the region above the trailing-edge flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011417541">Fig. 7</xref>), the Mach number contours show a rapid thickening of the main aerofoil wake beyond the flap mid-chord position. The velocity deficit in the wake deepens significantly as the incidence angle is increased. This may indicate the possible development of an off-the-surface, reverse-flow region in the main aerofoil wake at more extreme incidence angles. Experience with low-speed, high-lift configurations suggests that such a phenomenon can trigger a large-scale flow separation in the trailing-edge region of the main aerofoil, leading to the final stall. This is an area which requires further investigation.

<p>The computational grid for the SKF 1.1 aerofoil section equipped with a leading-edge slat deflected at an angle of 8° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011417541">Figs 2</xref>(c) and (d)), contains a total of 90 481 cells, 136 065 cell-edges and 46 009 vertices, with 342 cell-edges on the main aerofoil surface and 169 cell-edges on the slat element. Transition is fixed at 0.06 and 0.4 chord lengths downstream on the upper and lower surfaces of the main aerofoil, respectively. For the slat, transition is fixed at −0.06 and −0.034 chord lengths, respectively, on the upper and lower surfaces, the latter value being chosen to ensure a turbulent boundary layer separation at the slat hook. Four experimental cases are considered, Runs 307–310, covering an incidence angle range between about 3° and 10°.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011417541">Figure 8</xref> compares the predicted and experimental surface pressure distributions for the four cases. There is generally a very good level of agreement for the main aerofoil element surface pressures, apart from an under-prediction of the pressure levels in the gap region between the main aerofoil leading edge and the slat lower surface. The flow development here is sensitive to the size and shape of the closed re-circulation bubble present in the slat cove region. Unlike the trailing-edge flap, the slat surface pressure distribution is a strong function of the incidence angle, and the build-up of the slat loading with increasing incidence angle is quite well predicted. There is a significant supersonic-flow region on the upper surface of the slat at the higher incidence angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011417541">Figs 8</xref>(c) and (d)). The Mach number contours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011417541">Fig. 9</xref>) show the development of the supersonic-flow regions on the slat and main aerofoil upper surfaces with increasing incidence angle. Theslat wake can be clearly seen flowing over the upper surface of the main aerofoil, passing through thesupersonic-flow region, which is terminated by a normal shock wave. For the two highest incidence angle cases, Runs 309 and 310, there is a shock wave sitting at the upper surface trailing edge of the slat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011417541">Figs 9</xref>(c) and (d)). The main aerofoil upper surface boundary layer is predicted to separate at 95 per cent chord for Run 310. Mach number contours in the leading-edge region of the configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011417541">Fig. 10</xref>) show changes in the shape and extent of the closed re-circulation bubble sitting in the slat cove. There is also a small supersonic-flow region present on the main aerofoil leading edge in the gap region at the smaller incidence angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011417541">Figs 10</xref>(a) and (b)). Therefore, the predicted flow development in the gap region will be very sensitive to the details of both the closed re-circulation bubble and the supersonic-flow region.

<sec id="sec9-0954410011417541"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The application of an existing computational method for predicting multi-element aerofoil, high-lift aerodynamics has been extended to cover the transonic-flow development around a supercritical aerofoil section equipped with leading- or trailing-edge manoeuvre devices. Compared to low-speed, high-lift flow conditions, the initial results presented here indicate the influence of the supersonic-flow regions on the overall flow development. The trailing-edge flap loading is found to be insensitive to changes in incidence angle, as is the case for low-speed flows. Velocity deficits in the main aerofoil wake deepen in the adverse stream-wise pressure gradient above the flap upper surface, leading to the possibility of off-the-surface flow reversal in the wake at more extreme incidence angles than those considered here. The wake from a leading-edge slat may pass through an extensive supersonic-flow region, terminated by a normal shock wave, on the upper surface of the main aerofoil element at high incidence angles. In general, the computational results, using a differential Reynolds-stress turbulence model with wall-function boundary conditions, show a reasonably satisfactory level of agreement with experimental surface pressure distributions. Future work will involve the use of more refined near-wall computational grids, to enable the use of no-slip boundary conditions on the aerofoil surfaces rather than the semi-empirical wall-function approach adopted here. The relative utility of the two near-wall treatments can then be assessed, particularly in relation to predicting details of the shock wave/boundary layer interactions present on the upper surfaces of some aerofoil elements at these transonic-flow conditions. A further area of possible investigation is transition modelling. These initial computations involve the use of fixed boundary-layer transition positions, and it would be beneficial to have a transition prediction capability within the computational method. It is known that the predicted final stall characteristics of high-lift systems, at low-speed flight conditions, are very sensitive to the modelling of the boundary-layer transition process.</p>
