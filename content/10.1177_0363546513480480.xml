<p>Three things are to be looked to in a building: that it stand on the right spot; that it be securely founded; that it be successfully executed.</p>
<attrib>—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; <italic>Elective Affinities</italic>, 1808 (trans)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
<p>It can be hard to appreciate the benefit of some of life’s experiences when you’re mired in the midst of them. Have you ever accepted a responsibility that seemed pointless or even painful? You set your jaw, put your head down, and plow forward, just trying to get through the situation and move on to something more pleasant or pertinent to your personal goals. It may be years before you fully appreciate how valuable the undertaking really was.</p>
<p>I had such an episode following my surgical internship in 1976. I was thrilled to be offered the possibility of spending the year in a research and clinical fellowship with John Marshall, an important thinker and innovator in orthopaedic sports medicine. The catch? In return for hospital funding of the fellowship, Dr Marshall had agreed to loan the fellow’s services to the foot and ankle clinic 1 full day each week. There was a chronic manpower shortage on this rotation, which was generally unpopular with the residents.</p>
<p>Every Friday, I dutifully reported for work at the foot and ankle clinic, knowing that such was the price of getting to spend the other working days doing something I really enjoyed. For 8 or 10 hours, I lent a sympathetic ear to the complaints of the clientele, typically elderly women with hideous bunions, gnarled toes that deviated toward all points of the compass, and paper-thin layers of plantar fat that had long-since abandoned their mission of cushioning the burgeoning body weight of their owners. While I could sympathize with the patients’ distress, I did not see how caring for them would prove useful in my future sports medicine career.</p>
<p>When I became a team physician, however, I recognized the value of that year in the foot and ankle clinic. I had learned to look at the foot and ankle as a functioning organ, a complex structure to be evaluated both statically and dynamically. I realized that lamb’s wool, adhesive foam, metatarsal pads, and artfully posted orthotics could be just as helpful to a competitive athlete as they were to an octogenarian. I appreciated the wisdom of the chief of service, who never missed an opportunity to point out that the foot is the indispensable foundation of the human body.</p>
<p>Although foot and ankle problems are common in most sports, they are often overshadowed in the orthopaedic sports medicine literature by the attention paid to other body parts. Serendipity, with a gentle nudge from your editor-in-chief, has produced a confluence of articles in this issue of <italic>The American Journal of Sports Medicine</italic> focused on one specific ankle disorder that can seriously affect an athlete’s performance: osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT). This subject has been the object of considerable attention in the pages of <italic>AJSM</italic> in the last few years.</p>
<p>Hannon and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513480480">14</xref></sup> set the stage for the topic with a systematic review of the literature on microfracture for OLT. Rather than synthesizing the evidence for the efficacy of this treatment, the authors focus on the consistency of reporting of important demographic, clinical, and outcome parameters among published studies. They may have originally intended to perform a meta-analysis of the existing literature, but were stymied by the inconsistency of reporting that they encountered. As they note, knowledge of these variables is vital for comparing treatment results among studies as well as identifying factors that may affect prognosis.</p>
<p>A search of 2 electronic databases from 1966 to 2011 yielded 24 articles that met the authors’ inclusion criteria, which required a follow-up of 6 months in studies that unambiguously identified OLT as the diagnosis and microfracture as the treatment. Among those papers, basic information such as study design, age and sex of patients, lesion location, surgical approach, and rehabilitation techniques were almost always disclosed. Encouragingly, the vast majority reported outcomes using patient-oriented pain, function, and activity scales. Unfortunately, the 24 studies utilized a total of 23 different scoring systems, making it difficult to synthesize their results. Details that might be useful in determining prognosis such as lesion size, associated injuries, body mass index (BMI), and athletic participation were only revealed in a minority of the studies. The ability of the procedure to restore a normal articular surface was evaluated by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a mere 25% of the papers.</p>
<p>Despite this general weakness in the literature, a number of studies, particularly recent ones, have sought to identify variables that might help predict the prognosis in OLT. Lesion size has often been recognized as an important parameter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480480">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480480"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480480"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480480">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480480">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513480480">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480480">15</xref></sup> with 150 mm<sup>2</sup> cited by several authors as a useful cut-off for determining prognosis and choosing among treatment options.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480480">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480480">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480480">11</xref></sup> In this issue of <italic>AJSM</italic>, Yoshimura and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513480480">26</xref></sup> have chosen to concentrate exclusively on the prognostic factors in 50 cases of OLT that were smaller than this. All were treated with bone marrow stimulation, achieved either by drilling or microfracture. The overall results at an average of 36 months after surgery showed an improvement in the mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot scale from 74 (range, 18-90) to 90 (range, 67-100). Lesion depth, location, and patient age were all associated with outcome, although the differences were fairly small in magnitude. Keeping in mind that only smaller lesions were included, they found no association between lesion size and outcome.</p>
<p>Other factors that have been shown by at least one group of authors to correlate with treatment outcome in OLT include arthroscopic appearance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513480480">8</xref></sup> the presence of associated lesions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480480">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480480">5</xref></sup> whether the OLT were contained within peripheral cartilage borders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480480">2</xref></sup> patient BMI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480480">5</xref></sup> symptom duration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513480480">21</xref></sup> and history of trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480480">5</xref></sup> Although patient age has been identified by some to have a negative effect on prognosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480480">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480480">12</xref></sup> Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480480">3</xref></sup> recently concluded that it did not, once confounding factors such as duration of symptoms and history of trauma had been taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Another study in this month’s <italic>AJSM</italic> investigates the prognostic implications of yet another parameter: whether lesions are purely chondral or have both osseous and cartilaginous components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480480">1</xref></sup> To answer this question, Choi et al retrospectively reviewed 298 ankles, 210 with chondral lesions and 88 with osteochondral ones, an average of 52 months following treatment with marrow stimulation by microfracture or abrasion. Although the treatment outcomes were similar in both groups, the authors did find some other interesting differences. The occurrence of osteochondral lesions peaked in the third decade of life and then dropped precipitously, whereas the chondral lesions were distributed across all age groups, with the largest number of patients being in their sixth decade. The chondral lesions were more often associated with cysts and longer duration of symptoms, suggesting a more indolent and possibly degenerative evolution.</p>
<p>Although microfracture or other forms of bone marrow stimulation have generally been favored for the primary treatment of OLT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513480480">27</xref></sup> a number of additional surgical techniques have been described, especially for larger lesions or those that have failed a primary stimulation procedure. Osteochondral autograft implantation, osteochondral allograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) are some of the options that have been proposed for such cases.</p>
<p>Osteochondral autograft and allograft techniques have the potential to reconstitute simultaneously the osseous and cartilaginous portions of the lesion with bone and hyaline cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480480">24</xref></sup> However, they require precise graft positioning to achieve optimal efficacy. Even perfect graft positioning may not completely restore normal contact mechanics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513480480">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513480480">20</xref></sup> and relatively small deviations from anatomic placement can result in more marked abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513480480">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480480">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513480480">20</xref></sup> Osteotomy may be needed to access some lesions properly, but it has been associated with lower outcome scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480480">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480480">19</xref></sup> In the case of autografts, it has been hypothesized that structural differences between the host and donor sites may potentially affect the outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513480480">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In another original article in this month’s <italic>AJSM</italic>, Giannini and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480480">10</xref></sup> report the results of yet another method of repairing OLT that is applicable to larger lesions. This group has previously reported 3- and 10-year results in OLT treated with ACI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480480">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480480">12</xref></sup> Although the patients they treated with ACI achieved substantial, durable improvement in their mean AOFAS scores, the authors note the commonly cited drawback of ACI: the technique requires 2 procedures. Motivated by this concern, the group has developed and reported on a 1-step procedure that they hoped would lead to the regeneration of an articular surface with characteristics close to those of hyaline cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480480">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current paper, Giannini et al followed up 41 of 49 patients with lesions larger than 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> at 48 months postoperatively. Some of these were included in their earlier study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480480">11</xref></sup> and the authors were able to compare the 24- and 48-month results. In this procedure, they harvested 60 mL of iliac crest bone marrow, reduced it to 6 mL of a concentrate, and implanted it combined with collagen powder and platelet gel as a paste in the first 23 cases and combined with platelet gel on a hyaluronic acid membrane in the next 26. The patients were evaluated both clinically and with MRI, including MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) scores and T2 mapping.</p>
<p>The results of this study demonstrate the importance of continuing follow-up beyond the first 2 years after surgical treatment. The patients’ mean AOFAS scores improved from 63.73 ± 14.13 preoperatively to 91.76 ± 7.76 at 24 months, then declined to a still considerably improved 82.19 ± 17.04 at 48 months. While larger lesions were associated with a lower AOFAS score at earlier time points, this relationship was not seen at 48 months. Among 20 patients who underwent follow-up MRI 4 years after surgery, 9 had complete filling of the defect, 9 had hypertrophic filling, and 2 had less than 50% fill. T2 mapping appeared to be more clinically relevant than the MOCART score. Whereas none of the elements of the MOCART score showed a relationship to the AOFAS score, patients in whom more than 80% of the regenerated tissue had T2 values similar to hyaline cartilage had a mean AOFAS score of 89 compared with a mean score of 76 in patients with less than 80% of such tissue.</p>
<p>Another 1-step procedure for difficult OLT is reported in this issue of <italic>AJSM</italic> by Valderrabano and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513480480">25</xref></sup> After debriding and drilling the lesions, these authors used cancellous bone from the iliac crest to reconstruct the bone defect, and then sealed it with an acellular collagen matrix. Follow-up at a minimum of 2 years after surgery documented a 29-point improvement in the mean AOFAS scores. MRI demonstrated complete defect filling in 85%, of which 50% were hypertrophic.</p>
<p>While the results of the available treatments are encouraging, more work is needed before we can declare the mission of treating OLT in the athlete fully accomplished. Although surgery helps many patients to increase their activity level, higher levels of function may still be limited. For example, a 2012 study of sports activity after osteochondral transplantation for OLT found that patients modified their sports participation after treatment, and 29% were only partially satisfied or frankly dissatisfied with their results 5 years afterward.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480480">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Optimal reporting of treatment results, as called for by Hannon and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513480480">14</xref></sup> will allow us to determine with greater precision the efficacy of current methods. Studies that compare different treatment options will provide more powerful information than case series of a single technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513480480">23</xref></sup> Whenever possible, reporting should include all parameters suspected of influencing prognosis, especially lesion size, which should be measured as accurately as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480480">4</xref></sup> Since prognostic factors may be interrelated, multivariate analysis should be carried out whenever case numbers permit. We also need to recognize that factors found to have prognostic significance may vary from one population to another, especially if a particular parameter has little variance in a given cohort. Hannon et al noted that the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot score was the outcome measure most frequently reported for OLT, so it seems prudent to include it when planning clinical studies of this condition.</p>
<p>Because early results may later decline,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480480">10</xref></sup> we must continue to follow and report on our patients beyond the initial stages. As with many conditions that we treat, short-term results may appear favorable despite the failure to re-establish normal anatomy, but it seems likely that restoration of hyaline cartilage will prove more durable in the long run. Advanced MRI techniques seem to have the greatest potential for documenting the nature of the reconstituted articular surface, as direct arthroscopic evaluation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480480">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513480480">22</xref></sup> is often impractical, and plain radiographs, computed tomography,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513480480">8</xref></sup> and even conventional MRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513480480">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513480480">16</xref></sup> are limited in their abilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513480480">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513480480">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the foot is the indispensable foundation of the body, the talus is both the capstone of that foundation and the cornerstone for the human temple that it supports. When the talus is damaged, we must strive to restore it as anatomically as possible. If we can improve our treatments for athletes with OLT, those advancements should also prove beneficial for many nonathletes who frequent the foot and ankle clinics of the world.</p>
