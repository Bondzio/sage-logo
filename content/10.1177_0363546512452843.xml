<p>He who has courage and faith will never perish in misery.</p>
<attrib>—Anne Frank;</attrib>
<attrib><italic>The Diary of a Young Girl</italic> (March 7, 1944)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
<p>Long after you visit Rocky’s Web site, it’s his smile that stays with you. That irresistible, youthful smile that simply radiates happiness and love. The creases at the corners of his mouth and eyes, carved deep by countless hours of joyful expression. Those perfect, gleaming teeth, which even outshine the pristine white coverlet carefully draped over his body. That overwhelming, incongruous smile on the face of a young man who is paralyzed from the neck downward.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512452843">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512452843">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512452843">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rasul “Rocky” Clark, a back-up sophomore running back for Dwight D. Eisenhower High School in Blue Island, Illinois, got his big opportunity on September 15, 2000 when the starter went down with a separated shoulder. Four plays later, Rocky’s head hit the ground as he was being tackled. “When I started coming around, I heard a bunch of ringing,” he said. “My whole body was vibrating, like a spring. I felt cold air. I tried to get up, but I couldn’t.” Rocky spent the next 9 months in a rehabilitation hospital. At first, he wondered if his paralysis was punishment for something that he might have done. “Then, I realized things happen. Life doesn’t always give us what we expect. I’ve got a spinal cord injury, but there’s nothing wrong with my brain. I’ve got a strong spirit and courage. You’ve got to learn to deal with it.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512452843">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rocky dealt with his fate in remarkable fashion. He graduated from high school and became a part-time football coach at his alma mater.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512452843">6</xref></sup> Fortuitously, his school district had a catastrophic insurance policy that allowed his mother to care for him at home with the expert assistance of round-the-clock nursing. Perhaps the care was too good or Rocky’s will to persevere was too strong, for he survived much longer than the norm for a person with tetraplegia. In August 2010, Rocky received the following terse note from his insurer:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This is to acknowledge receipt of your claim. Please be advised that the maximum medical benefit under this policy has been processed and no further benefits are available.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>CLAIMS OFFICE</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rocky had outlived his insurance policy. Going forward, he would have to make do with the less generous benefits of public assistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512452843">20</xref></sup> Like the fictional boxer of the same name, however, Rocky parried this blow and continued to fight on.</p>
<p>Injuries that result in death or severe disability are thankfully uncommon in sports. Although we know that such events can occur in any human activity and will never be completely eliminated, our goal as a profession has always been to reduce their occurrence to the bare minimum. Early issues of <italic>The American Journal of Sports Medicine</italic> included articles focusing on the prevention and treatment of life-threatening conditions such as heat illness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512452843">13</xref></sup> head trauma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512452843">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512452843">18</xref></sup> and cervical spine injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512452843">1</xref></sup> Topics ranged widely from more traditional competitive sports to include accidental drowning,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512452843">7</xref></sup> scuba deaths,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512452843">11</xref></sup> hang gliding fatalities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512452843">8</xref></sup> and quadriplegia from trampoline accidents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512452843">16</xref></sup> Identifying injury patterns with an eye to prevention was always a point of emphasis. Continuing this tradition, articles in the current issue of <italic>AJSM</italic> report studies of severe pole vaulting injuries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512452843">3</xref></sup> and marathon-related deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512452843">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>“Catastrophic Injuries in Pole Vaulters,” by Boden et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512452843">3</xref></sup> builds on a similar study published in 2001 by many of the same authors. The National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research (NCCSIR) defines a catastrophic sports injury as one that results in damage to the brain or spinal cord or a fracture of the spinal column or skull.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512452843">14</xref></sup> Pole vaulting is a very specialized event, passionately pursued by an estimated 90,000 scholastic and 4300 collegiate athletes in the US each year, yet dubiously distinguished by one of the highest rates of catastrophic injury among all sports tracked by the NCCSIR.</p>
<p>In their 2001 publication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512452843">4</xref></sup> which covered the period 1982-1998, the authors found that most of these tragic injuries occurred when the athlete’s head or entire body struck the hard ground adjacent to the landing pad. They concluded that increasing the minimum size of the landing pad and enforcing the rule requiring soft surfaces surrounding it might diminish the risk of injury by this mechanism. Another common injury scenario was landing in the vault box, the socket where the pole is planted, the result of releasing the pole prematurely or failing to generate sufficient momentum to progress over the bar. They felt that this mechanism would need to be addressed with appropriate coaching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512452843">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following the 2001 report, a number of changes were instituted at the high school and university levels that increased the padded landing area and marked the runway to make it easier for the vaulter to judge the takeoff. To gauge the efficacy of these measures, the current authors gathered information on catastrophic vaulting injuries in the United States from 2003 to 2011 from the NCCSIR, 2 pole vaulting safety organizations, and an Internet search. To determine whether landing in the vault box was still a substantial problem, they also surveyed 3335 vaulters at various camps and clinics from 2007 through 2011.</p>
<p>The estimated overall incidence of catastrophic injury during the period of the study was 2.0 per 100,000 vaulters per year. This was virtually identical to the previous study period, although it is possible that a decline in incidence was masked by a concomitant improvement in the power of Internet search engines. In any case, the number of fatalities dropped from 1.0 to 0.22 per year. Male vaulters had a higher catastrophic rate than female vaulters, and university athletes had a higher rate than high school participants. Although the absolute numbers in the elite echelon are small, the relative rate in this select group was thought to be even higher.</p>
<p>When the mechanisms of injury were examined, a marked change from the prior study was noted. The number of cases associated with landing off the sides or back of the landing pad declined from 1.38 to 0.44 annually. Unfortunately, this was offset by an increase in the number of injuries resulting from landing in the vault box from 0.5 to 1.55 per year. The results of the survey suggest that landing in the vault box is not a rare occurrence; about 84% of respondents had landed there at least once during their vaulting career.</p>
<p>The authors mention a number of possible strategies aimed at further reducing the risk of catastrophic injury in pole vaulting, including the use of helmets, further modifications to the vault box and its surrounding collar, and potential adjustments in the guidelines for pole stiffness and grip height. Injury prevention is a complex undertaking, however, and any change may have unintended consequences. Because greater bending of the pole may increase the possibility of the vaulter losing control and overshooting the landing pad, scholastic rules encourage a lower hand hold to increase pole stiffness. However, the authors theorize, greater pole resistance might increase the risk of the vaulter becoming stranded at the apex of the trajectory and falling into the vault box.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512452843">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512452843">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pole vaulting may have the highest catastrophic injury rate of all sports monitored by the NCCSIR; it is difficult to be certain because the number of participants is only an estimate. It is hardly the only sport associated with catastrophic injuries, however. Between 1982 and 2010, the NCCSIR reported 1284 catastrophic injuries, 190 of them fatal, among high school and university athletes in the United States alone. Owing to the popularity of football in the United States, the largest number of these tragic events is associated with that sport.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512452843">12</xref></sup> On the other hand, the injury rate per 100,000 participants is estimated to be greater in gymnastics and ice hockey. By a large margin, the largest number of catastrophic injuries in females was reported from cheerleading. Among high school and college female athletes, 66.5% of all catastrophic injuries from 1982-2010 were associated with that pursuit.</p>
<p>Each activity presents a unique set of circumstances. In football, striking the crown of the head and heat stroke are common life-threatening scenarios.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512452843">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512452843">22</xref></sup> Defensive players are most often involved in fatal injuries, although running backs like Rocky Clark play the single most vulnerable position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512452843">21</xref></sup> In competitive swimming, diving into the shallow end of the pool has been identified as the most common mechanism of catastrophic injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512452843">12</xref></sup> In cheerleading, the stunts most frequently associated with catastrophic injury are pyramids and the basket toss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512452843">5</xref></sup> Clearly, detailed information is needed for each sport before injury reduction strategies can be proposed.</p>
<p>On January 5, 2012, Rocky Clark finally succumbed to the sequelae of his injury at the age of 27. Thankfully, fatal injuries such as Rocky’s are uncommon. Many of us will complete an entire career in sports medicine and never personally encounter such a situation. Among 1827 deaths of athletes aged 21 or younger recorded in the US National Registry of Sudden Death in Young Athletes between 1980 and 2009, only 261 or 14% were related to trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512452843">21</xref></sup> In contrast, 1139 were attributable to cardiovascular causes.</p>
<p>One death every 5 years in a sport like pole vaulting may not seem like a major public health problem, until a face is put on it, like that of Robert Zhongjie Yin. An accomplished musician, Robert began his career at the age of 2½ in the “Cherub Choir” at St. Luke Lutheran Church in Silver Spring, Maryland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512452843">19</xref></sup> At Wootton High School, he was captain of the track team and principal violist in the Peabody Sinfonietta. Robert continued to pursue both musical and athletic passions at Iowa’s Grinnell College, declaring his intention to major in music on May 13, 2010. The next day, Robert struck his head during the landing of a vault attempt at the Midwest Conference championship meet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512452843">15</xref></sup> Robert was declared brain dead 3 days later and his organs transplanted into 5 needy recipients.</p>
<p>Although Rocky’s and Robert’s stories are both poignant and inspirational, they are narratives that we would like to hear as rarely as possible. Continued detailed analysis of catastrophic injury patterns, such as offered by Boden and colleagues, will hopefully point the way toward making these tragic events even more uncommon.</p>
