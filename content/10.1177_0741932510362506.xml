<abstract>
<p>Children in foster care compose a population of students very vulnerable to school failure. Placement and school instability and lack of collaboration between the school and child welfare agency are some of the barriers that impede their school performance. This study focused on the classroom context and questioned beginning general and special education teachers in urban schools about their experiences instructing students living in foster care. Findings revealed that foster youth present serious challenges to <italic>beginning</italic> teachers that go largely unaddressed because of lack of information about the child, lack of teacher preparedness for such challenges, and lack of supports by the school and collaboration with the child welfare system.</p>

<body>
<p>Each year in the United States, at least 800,000 children are under the care of child protective services. In California, on any given day, there are approximately 131,000 children and youth involved in the child welfare system. Of these, 92,000 reside in out-of-home placements in foster homes, relative homes, and residential care facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510362506">Reed &amp; Karpilow, 2002</xref>). These children have been removed from their parents’ custody by the juvenile court system because of abuse or neglect. The majority of children in foster care come from poor families and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510362506">Bass, Shields, &amp; Behrman, 2004</xref>). Children of color, particularly African American children, are disproportionally represented in foster care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741932510362506">Smith &amp; Devore, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932510362506">Stukes Chipungu &amp; Bent-Goodley, 2004</xref>). Their schools of origin and many of the schools they attend after placement are located in urban neighborhoods in which the academic quality of the education offered is of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510362506">Smithgall, Gladden, Howard, Goerge, &amp; Courtney, 2004</xref>). Compounding matters is that too often these low-performing schools are staffed with inexperienced and not-yet-certified teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510362506">Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has confirmed that foster youth compose a population of students extremely vulnerable to school failure and early school leaving. When compared to students in the general population, they experience such difficulties as weaker cognitive abilities and higher rates of absenteeism and tardiness, midyear school changes, and grade repetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510362506">Altshuler, 2003</xref>). Many fall below grade level in reading and/or math and have scores that are significantly lower than those of their classmates on statewide achievement tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510362506">Smithgall et al., 2004</xref>). A third to half the population receives special education services, and they are more likely than nonfoster youth to be disciplined or suspended from school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510362506">Emerson &amp; Lovitt, 2003</xref>). The future outlook of children and youth in foster care causes concern. Researchers have found that nearly half of foster youth fail to complete high school, approximately one fourth of these individuals end up homeless in the 12 to 18 months after being legally emancipated, and 34% end up in public welfare programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741932510362506">Casey Family Programs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510362506">Vacca, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0741932510362506">
<title>Barriers to Educational Achievement</title>
<p>Many barriers have been identified that impede the school performance of foster youth. These include placement and school instability, problems transferring school records as the foster youth change schools, and the school and/or child welfare agency’s failure to take responsibility for monitoring school outcomes and for sharing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510362506">Zetlin, Weinberg, &amp; Shea, 2006</xref>). A major difficulty appears to be the multiple disruptions in their schooling because of frequent changes in home and school placements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510362506">Trout, Hagaman, Casey, Reid, &amp; Epstein, 2008</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510362506">Emerson and Lovitt (2003)</xref>, about 50% of foster youth change schools at least four times after beginning their formal education. Students fall behind academically because they miss important concepts taught and are unfamiliar with the new curriculum, teachers, and other students. School personnel find it difficult to track down prior school records. The delay in receiving proper school documentation results in students not receiving credits for classes they have taken, repetition of classes because there is no record of requirements having been met, failure to identify a student’s eligibility for special education, and inappropriate placements and services. In a study that determined the magnitude and severity of the problem of retrieving school records for youth in foster care, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510362506">Zetlin, Weinberg, and Luderer (2004)</xref> found that the length of time needed to track down records ranged from 3 weeks to 8 months, and on the average, it took 2 months to retrieve.</p>
<p>Recently enacted state and federal laws were designed to correct the impact that school instability has on the educational progress of children in foster care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510362506">AB 490, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932510362506">Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoption Act, 2008</xref>). A provision in both acts requires the state or local agency to ensure that children placed in foster care stay in the same school, if possible, or, if they must be moved, are transferred to a new school promptly. The federal act even provides federal support for school-related transportation costs. To ensure effective implementation, the schools must be made aware of which of their students are in foster care, and both the schools and child welfare agency must work together to serve the educational needs of children in foster care.</p>

<sec id="section2-0741932510362506">
<title>Disproportionate Placement in Special Education</title>
<p>Several studies have documented that a large and disproportionate number of children in foster care are placed in special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932510362506">Geenen &amp; Powers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510362506">Smithgall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932510362506">Zima, Bussing, Yang, &amp; Belin, 2000</xref>). Between 30% and 50% of children in foster care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741932510362506">Sawyer &amp; Dubowitz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932510362506">Zima, Bussing, Freeman, et al., 2000</xref>), compared to 11.5% of the general school population, are eligible for individualized education programs (IEPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741932510362506">Office of Special Education Programs, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510362506">Weinberg, Zetlin, and Shea (2001)</xref> also found that many children in foster care do not receive the special education services that they need. When school records are delayed, the new school may be unaware that the student should be placed in special education. Too many times, schools learn that students need special education services only when they do their own assessment. The opposite occurs as well. Because of frequent school changes, some needy foster children do not remain in school long enough to be assessed for and start receiving special education services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510362506">Zetlin et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Many foster children who are placed in special education are found eligible because of a learning disability or emotional disturbance. About 50% of foster children in special education have been identified as having emotional or behavioral disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510362506">Emerson &amp; Lovitt, 2003</xref>). In addition to helping a special education student in foster care work through their disability, many teachers of foster youth must attend to the students’ emotional and behavioral challenges that are related to their histories of trauma, abuse, and neglect. This combination of foster care and emotional disturbance puts these children at highest risk for school-related problems such as academic deficiency, higher retention rates, being negatively perceived by school staff, and movement from school to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510362506">Smucket &amp; Kauffman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510362506">Trout et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0741932510362506">
<title>Enrollment in Disadvantaged Schools</title>
<p>Foster youth have been found to be concentrated in communities and schools in impoverished inner-city neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510362506">Smithgall et al., 2004</xref>). Many of the urban schools the foster youth attend are characterized as low performing and difficult to staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510362506">Education Coordinating Council, 2006</xref>). In California, the severe teacher shortage has led to few certified teachers being available for employment in difficult-to-staff schools. As a result, many such schools by necessity hire not fully certified, underprepared teachers to assume full teaching responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510362506">Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning, 2005</xref>). Research has shown that novice teachers are less effective, especially in their first year of teaching, than more experienced teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510362506">Hanushek, Kain, O’Brien, &amp; Rivkin, 2005</xref>). Yet new teachers are often given the most difficult assignments, including large numbers of students with significant academic challenges and behavioral problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510362506">Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning, 2005</xref>). For the student in foster care with academic and behavioral challenges, the assignment of an inexperienced and underprepared teacher is especially problematic.</p>
<p>To address the teacher shortage in California, universities have responded by establishing alternative route or university intern programs for noncertified individuals who are hired by school districts and given full responsibility for instructing students in a classroom. These alternative route programs provide on-the-job teacher training coupled with intensive professional development to accelerate teacher certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932510362506">Karge &amp; McCabe, 2006</xref>). The intern–beginning teachers receive support for their day-to-day teaching while they attend evening and weekend classes and/or summer sessions to complete state-mandated certification requirements. Unknown is whether such sponsorship is enough to support the intern–beginning teachers when confronted by the intensive academic and behavioral needs of students in foster care.</p>
<p>A number of studies have investigated the educational performance of the children and youth in foster care; however, little research has focused on the classroom context, specifically, the needs and coping strategies of their teachers in addressing the serious challenges that these students may present. Teachers’ needs must be addressed because schools are one of the primary institutions shaping the development of children, and teachers play a critical role in helping students connect to a successful school experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510362506">Smithgall et al., 2004</xref>). Given the intense demands presented by this population, the perceptions of how beginning teachers cope and which supports they judge as helpful constitute much needed information. Moreover, because such a large proportion of these youth receive special education services, more information is needed on the differences between the experiences of beginning general and special education teachers and what atypical educational or behavioral patterns are displayed by students in foster care in their classrooms. This study sought to answer the following questions: How are teachers informed that a student is in out-of-home placement? What are the particular challenges that foster students exhibit? What are the supports and services available to teachers and foster students? How does the IEP process unfold for students in foster care? And what future supports and training do teachers feel are needed to increase their effectiveness in providing appropriate education to students in foster care?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0741932510362506">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 215 questionnaires were sent to the entire population of first- and second-year interns enrolled in the general and special education–alternative route programs at one of the largest teacher preparation universities in California. Of these, 140 were special education interns and 75 were multiple-subject or single-subject interns. A letter accompanied the questionnaire explaining the purpose of the research, requesting the intern’s participation in the study, and assuring the intern of the confidentiality of his or her responses. A second mailing was done 4 weeks later, again requesting that completed surveys be returned. Study procedures were approved by the university institutional review board before questionnaires were mailed.</p>
<p>In all, 91 anonymously completed questionnaires were returned, yielding a return rate of 42%. Of the 91 returned questionnaires, 68 (75%) were from special education teachers and 23 (25%) were from general education teachers. The general education intern program is a 1-year program, and nine of the interns were in their first year of teaching. Sixteen had served as substitute teachers or taught on an emergency permit for a mean of 3 years before joining the intern program. The special education program is a 2-year program, and 25 were first-year interns and 40 were second-year interns. Seven held a multiple- or single-subject credential, and 27 had taught on substitute or emergency permits. These 32 interns taught for a mean of 3.9 years. All 91 respondents were currently employed as special or general education teachers in urban schools throughout the greater Los Angeles area and assigned full responsibility by the employing school district for a classroom of students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0741932510362506">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>A two-part questionnaire was developed to assess participants’ experiences related to the education of foster youth. The questionnaire was piloted on five recently credentialed teachers before finalizing the wording of the questions and structure of the survey to ensure comprehensibility. Part 1 featured 12 questions to identify the kinds of students (general or special education) and grade level that respondents taught as well as questions related to whether they had reported a child abuse incident, if they received training as a mandated reporter, and if they currently or had ever had a student who was in foster care as part of their teaching responsibility. Part 2 was composed of nine open-ended questions for only those teachers who had experience teaching students in foster care. They were asked how they learned of the students’ foster care status, what kinds of relevant information was provided to them as the students’ teacher, what unique learning, emotional, or behavioral challenges the students in foster care presented, and what school supports were made available. The general education teachers were asked if they had made a special education referral for a child in foster care and whether the parent, caregiver, or social worker was involved in the IEP process. The special education teachers were asked how the IEP process was managed for the students in foster care and whether a parent, caregiver, or social worker was involved. A final open-ended question asked both sets of teachers to describe what supports, services, or training should be made available so that they could be more effective with students in foster care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0741932510362506">
<title>Data Coding</title>
<p>Responses to the nine open-ended questions were submitted to content analysis. First, a coding scheme was developed for each question through an analytic and iterative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510362506">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). The first two authors independently read the responses to a question and assigned preliminary codes so that patterns explaining regularities between comments became apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510362506">Roper &amp; Shapira, 2000</xref>). The authors then discussed the evolving coding scheme and continued to refine and revise the scheme until a list of agreed on categories was finalized for each question. The data were then fully analyzed by each author for general and special education teachers separately using the coding schemes. The coded data were examined for accuracy and completeness. Interrater agreement, determined by calculating the percentage of codes with exact agreement, was 89%. Any differences that occurred between authors in the coding of responses were discussed until all disagreements were reconciled.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section9-0741932510362506">
<title>Part 1</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to examine demographic information of the respondents. Responses to questions about the teaching context revealed that 13% of the 23 general education teachers taught at the elementary level, 43% taught in middle schools, and 43% taught in secondary schools. Of the 68 special education teachers who responded, 51% taught students with mild to moderate disabilities, 28% taught students with moderate to severe disabilities, and 21% taught students with visual or physical impairments. Of the 91 respondents, 53 (58%) indicated that they currently or in the past had a student in their class who was in foster care (41 special education teachers, 12 general education teachers). With regard to their experiences with reporting a child abuse incident, 33% of the 91 respondents indicated that they had alerted authorities about a suspected child abuse case and 80% responded that they had received some training from their school or district about mandatory reporting for suspected child abuse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0741932510362506">
<title>Part 2</title>
<p>Two types of analyses were conducted on the data from the 53 teachers who indicated that they had or were currently teaching foster youth. First, responses to the open-ended questions that could be tallied were submitted to a series of independent samples analyses to examine patterns in the experiences of general and special education teachers, specifically differences in the amount and kinds of information given to general and special education teachers as well as variations within each group. Special education teachers received significantly more background information about the child than did general education teachers (<italic>t</italic> = −2.08, <italic>df</italic> = 28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and were more likely to have the names of the caregiver (<italic>t</italic> = −4.36, <italic>df</italic> = 44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00) and social worker (<italic>t</italic> = −2.03, <italic>df</italic> = 44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Middle and high school general education teachers were more likely than elementary teachers to report that they had a student currently in foster care in their classroom (<italic>t</italic> = 3.3, <italic>df</italic> = 36, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.003), and elementary teachers were slightly more likely than middle and secondary teachers to have the name of the caregiver (<italic>t</italic> = 1.93, <italic>df</italic> = 28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06). Among the special education teachers, there were no differences in the amount of background or contact information provided to those who taught students with mild to moderate disabilities and those who taught students with moderate to severe or low-incidence disabilities.</p>
<p>Second, content analysis revealed seven themes that were framed by the questions. They are presented below.</p>
<sec id="section11-0741932510362506">
<title>Theme 1: How Teachers Were Informed of Foster Care Status</title>
<p>Of the 53 respondents who had taught foster children, only 4 teachers reported that they learned from the child’s social worker that their student was a foster child (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932510362506">Table 1</xref>). More often than not, both special and general education teachers learned of the child’s home situation from the foster child divulging the information or from the child’s caregiver. Some teachers reported that students wrote about living in a foster home in a first day “student survey” they had all their students complete. Sometimes, the teachers came on the information less directly. One teacher responded, “He wrote in his daily journal that his mom was going to visit but didn’t show. I then investigated further and found out he was in foster care living with a number of other students at the school.” Another teacher wrote, “He seemed extremely belligerent and angry. I asked him privately what was going on. He told me his mom went to Mexico and left him in foster care.” Guardians, foster parents, and relative caregivers also informed teachers of the child’s home situation. Some teachers made “orientation” phone calls home at the start of the school year and learned during those calls that the child was in foster care. Others were contacted by the caregiver or were told during parent–teacher conferences. To a lesser extent, fellow teachers, support staff (counselors, psychologists, therapists), administrators, other students, and bus drivers informed teachers that a student in their class was a foster child. In a few cases, teachers recognized the student’s group home address. One teacher revealed that she had reported suspected child abuse to the authorities. In two cases, the teachers learned that their student was in foster care only after the student moved abruptly to another school in another district. For special education teachers, it was during the IEP process that they typically learned the child was in foster care, either when they checked the cumulative file to prepare the IEP or in planning for the IEP evaluation and/or meeting.</p>

<title>Theme 2: When Foster Students Entered Classroom and for How Long</title>
<p>Teachers reported that approximately two thirds of the foster youth entered the classroom at the start of the school year and stayed for the entire year (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0741932510362506">Table 2</xref>). A few of the special education teachers indicated that some foster youth were in their classrooms for 2 or more years. The remaining third of foster youth experienced greater school mobility. Some were present when the school year began but left 2 to 4 months later, others entered midyear and left after a short period, still others entered at different times during the school year but stayed until the end. Special education teachers reported that those who entered midyear were more likely to stay until the end, whereas general education teachers indicated that those foster youth who entered in September or midyear stayed for only a few months.</p>

<title>Theme 3: Information Made Available to Teachers</title>
<p>Almost no information as to why the student was in foster care was given to general education teachers, whereas special education teachers had background information for almost half the foster youth in their classes. In terms of what contact information was shared with teachers, 40% of general education teachers received no information, compared to only 6% of special education teachers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0741932510362506">Table 3</xref>). Mostly, when contact information was provided, it was the name of the caregiver (foster parent, legal guardian, group home parent) and, to a lesser extent, the name of the child’s social worker. Overall, very few teachers were told the name of the child’s attorney, the name of the court-appointed special advocate (CASA) if there was one, and the identity of the holder of education rights. However, when such contacts were made known, special education teachers, more so than general education teachers, had such information.</p>

<title>Theme 4: Challenges That Set Foster Youth Apart From Peers</title>
<sec id="section15-0741932510362506">
<title>Learning challenges</title>
<p>A few general education teachers emphasized that the foster youth in their classes were exceptional students and extremely motivated and engaged in learning. Most general and special education teachers, however, described learning and emotional challenges that set their foster youth apart from the nonfoster children in their classes. The general education teachers were concerned that the academic backgrounds of the students were markedly weak, that they were behind grade level in all academic areas, that they had difficulty keeping up with the other students, and that they generally had a hard time settling into classroom routines. The foster children were more hyperactive than their other students and frequently displayed anger, tempers, aggression, and problems getting along with peers. Too often, foster parents were not readily available when behavior or failure to complete assignments or homework was a problem. Some students missed school because of court dates or visits with birth parents, which was disruptive to their learning and frustrating to teachers.</p>
<p>Special education teachers, too, were concerned with severe gaps in the basic skills of their students in foster care. One teacher noted, “One girl who was in high school could barely read at a first grade level.” Another stated that her student was unable to write legibly. Students in foster care more so than their peers were also described as lacking motivation to do school work, easily distracted, and displaying severe attention problems. The special education teachers attributed their students’ academic problems to frequent school changes and unsupportive foster homes. Students sometimes shared with teachers that they had no place to do homework in the home and no one to help them with their homework. Tardiness and poor attendance were also problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0741932510362506">
<title>Behavior challenges</title>
<p>Behavior was the greatest challenge noted by both groups of teachers. Many of the foster children exhibited “roller coaster” emotions, which ranged from explosive and unpredictable aggressive behaviors (tantrums, hitting, screaming, kicking) to shutting down, withdrawal, depression, and clinging behaviors. Mondays were often the biggest challenge, especially if the student spent the weekend with the birth parent or anticipated a visit and was disappointed. One teacher noted that she felt sometimes like she was “walking on eggshells. Some days are good, some are bad especially when he had had contact with his mother.” Another teacher described that after contact with the birth parent, “students became defiant, unwilling to work, and became more physical toward me and other children.” Some foster children were very needy and displayed feelings of abandonment and sadness. They “would come to school depressed or crying, sometimes pulled [into class] by other siblings not in the same foster home.” They were untrusting of teachers and other adults and found it hard to transition from one adult to another. One teacher expressed that “these students are looking for parental figures whenever possible, however, they have difficulty sorting out their feelings of abandonment.” Teachers were sensitive to their students’ situations and regretted that they could not get close to or do more for them. One described, “Their lives can change radically without their consent. Homes close, students are shuffled around. I had one [foster] home ‘fire’ a student for misbehaving just when we [the school] were making progress with her.”</p>
<p>Not unexpected but very worrisome to teachers was that their foster children had serious problems getting along with classmates. One teacher provided a list of what she witnessed: “Either shyness and trouble making friends or acting out anger by hitting; also difficulty sharing and getting along with peers.” Some teachers felt they had to be watchful that their foster children did not get into physical fights with other students. One foster youth became interested in gangs and intimidated other students to do things for him. Another was so medicated that “he couldn’t reason things out logically with students and teachers. . . . He had an explosive temper with one student, in particular, and would argue at the drop of a hat.” A few foster youth “shared too much information with classmates [‘his mom and elder brother who still lived with him were on drugs,’ ‘his brother was in jail once because he was selling drugs at the high school’],” some were “very promiscuous,” and one isolated himself from other students by telling them he was “not going to be there in this place [this school] very long.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0741932510362506">
<title>Caregiver challenges</title>
<p>Teachers in both groups identified challenges they had because of specific homes in which foster children were placed. Some students had no money to buy lunch or school supplies and/or came to school with poor hygiene and inadequate clothing. These caregivers did not attend parent–teacher or IEP conferences, sign paperwork that was sent home, or provide support when contacted by the teacher who was dealing with out-of-control behavior in the classroom. One teacher expressed frustration that “nobody wants to take responsibility for the child. They say to call caregivers or call his real [birth] parents.”</p>
<p>Special education teachers especially felt that some caregivers were unconcerned about “the student’s progress and special needs” and had no interest in working on IEP goals. They felt that “foster caregivers don’t have the same level of interest in students’ academic troubles or successes. They are more concerned with at-home behavior. They always agree with school representatives [at IEP meetings].” Some special education teachers believed that “foster parents did not fully understand the IEP process so it was difficult to get them on board in giving the children appropriate services; they were hesitant to take action.” One teacher blamed the foster parents for encouraging the student’s “dependence on his disability rather than on his more positive abilities [he was confined to a wheelchair because of cerebral palsy].” Another special education teacher reported having had difficulty obtaining needed equipment and adaptive devices for students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0741932510362506">
<title>Teaching accommodations</title>
<p>Many teachers described having to make accommodations to lessons and assignments when they realized there were children in foster care in their classes. Writing assignments were adjusted so foster children could write more about themselves than their family, and holiday reminisces were replaced with less painful topics to write about. They also used a neutral word such as <italic>adults</italic> when referring to parents and talked about “nontraditional households to let the student know that it was OK being in a foster home and that lots of people are different.” Last, teachers wrote about the challenge of finding time to provide extra attention to the foster child:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Each [foster] child is different. Each deserves more support that I am actually able to give. They all need intensive one on one therapy. Each week I spend about 3 hours working through concerns/issues that arise with each foster child. I have 4 foster children on my caseload. This adds up to 3 hours times 4 children translating to 12 hours per week just on these students.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0741932510362506">
<title>Theme 5: Available School Support to Help Teachers With Challenges</title>
<p>Only two general education teachers reported having supports or services (psychological services) made available to help manage the challenges that foster children presented in class (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0741932510362506">Table 4</xref>). The other general education teachers and most of the special education teachers (60%) indicated that there was no special assistance to deal with the challenges or address the unique needs of their foster children, although some schools had services that were available for all students including foster youth (i.e., specialized reading intervention program). The special education teachers (40%) who were able to access supports identified helpful on-site counselors, school psychologists, and administrators who intervened directly with their students or provided advice on what needed to be done. Two of the teachers described teams of teachers and clinicians who met in the mornings to review cases and provide advice on how to deal with students’ academic and behavioral problems. One teacher was able to arrange for multiple services for a high-risk special education student including counseling by both the school psychologist and an outside agency, enrollment in an anger management program, and enrollment in a gang-prevention and early intervention program. Another teacher reported that the school paid for specialized training that she attended. And one teacher was given the opportunity to participate in monthly group meetings for foster and relative caregivers with students in special education as well as attend the annual relative caregiver conference. Just one special education teacher reported working with a CASA who served as case manager for the child and arranged for services and handled communication with his foster and birth parents.</p>

<title>Theme 6: IEP Process</title>
<p>Only 1 of the 12 general education teachers referred a foster child for special education evaluation. The school took no action, and so she had no further experience with the IEP process. The special education teachers described both positive and negative experiences with the IEP process when a foster child was involved. A number of teachers indicated that, in their experiences, the foster parents were more responsive than the biological parents of students on their caseloads. They showed up at meetings when notified by phone or mail, participated in the discussions, and signed the IEP if they were the holder of education rights. In a few instances, foster parents invited the birth parent or parents to attend and appeared to be working as a team with the birth parent or parents. The opposite was true as well. Two teachers reported that although their students’ foster parents attended the IEP meetings, they appeared to do so “pro forma” and made no contributions to the discussion.</p>
<sec id="section21-0741932510362506">
<title>Holder of education rights</title>
<p>Problems arose when foster parents did not have education rights and a signature from a nonpresent birth parent was needed. The school or foster parent had to involve the social worker to get the parent’s signature, which delayed the signing of the IEP and often left the school out of compliance. Sometimes school personnel were unaware that the IEP could be signed only by the holder of education rights. One teacher wrote,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>No one seems to care that the guardian may not have educational rights. Most people assume that because they have parental rights it automatically includes ed rights. Therefore we have always had the foster parent sign the IEP. Only one time have I had the social worker say that we needed to have the actual parent sign the IEP because the foster parent did not have ed rights and the social worker took it upon herself to both alert the school of this and get the parent’s signature. I always have the guardian sign the IEP even though they may not be the person with ed rights. I don’t know who has ed rights; no one ever tells me this or discusses this. I have high school students and many times the foster parent has been signing the IEP for years so I just go with it. Basically, I have become jaded by all of the bureaucratic hurdles and I just want to help the child and get them services.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0741932510362506">
<title>IEP meetings</title>
<p>Some teachers reported that it was hard to reach the foster parent and sometimes difficult getting the foster parent to attend the IEP. When foster parents were a “no show,” the IEP meeting had to be rescheduled or held without them. In those cases, teachers reported having sent the IEP forms to the child’s residence to obtain a signature. When the school was aware that caregiver participation was a problem, notification about the meeting was always sent certified mail. At one school, “in extreme cases, the PSA counselor [district attendance liaison] was sent with the meeting notification to the homes.” One teacher described a difficult IEP meeting in which the foster parent brought an advocate and the child’s attorney. The caregiver blamed the school for not offering all the services they could to help the child. A few teachers noted that some foster children on their rosters left their classrooms before the annual IEP meetings were held. Approximately a third of the time, social workers attended the IEP meetings. They were invited by the school or the foster parents. The majority of teachers, however, had never met their students’ social worker. One teacher commented,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The few social workers I’ve met are overworked and ineffective. They have never come to IEP meetings. They know less about the student than we do. In my experience, they are not capable of a long term trust-inspiring connection with my students.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0741932510362506">
<title>Theme 7: Needed Supports, Services, Training</title>
<p>Teachers from both groups wanted an in-service training or workshop to learn how best to support students in foster care, especially to address their emotional and behavioral needs. They wanted strategies to help the foster children “succeed and feel comfortable in class.” One teacher suggested that “teachers need to know to make adjustments and not force academics the minute they enter your classroom, how to understand that children in foster care are not the same as other students in their classroom.” Many identified specific problems that their foster children exhibited and wanted strategies for dealing with those problems (i.e., emotional outbursts, students using drugs, runaways). They wanted more help from their colleagues (experienced teachers, counselor, principal) as well as more communication and more opportunity to work with foster parents and social workers. They felt that it would be helpful to know more about the child welfare system: Why are students placed in foster care? How long do they remain in foster care? What are the laws regarding education rights? What is the role of the social worker? How can we contact the social worker? They had other questions they wanted answered as well: What to do if the birth parent shows up at school? Should they ask the student about foster care? What information should they relate to the social worker? Are foster parents monitored by the state? Some teachers wanted formal notification when they have a foster child on their roster. Some thought it would be helpful to have more background information about the child. One teacher wrote, “Knowing more changes your perspective and awareness of the issues. If you don’t know what to look for, you may lump their problems into ‘typical’ growing pain behaviors.” Another suggested having available information on what kind of student the child is, for example, “Do they excel in certain subjects? This way, you have ways to open up to the student and, can perhaps gain their trust more easily.”</p>

<sec id="section24-0741932510362506" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is clear from the responses to the questions asked that beginning teachers are assigned students in foster care without adequate support or training to address the serious needs that these students present. Especially striking was the lack of information that teachers had about the foster care status of students in their classes even though state and federal legislation exists that requires schools and the child welfare agency to work together to better serve the educational needs of students in foster care. There were no formal means to inform teachers that a student in their class was in foster care. They mostly learned inadvertently from the students themselves or caregivers. In only four cases did teachers learn from a child’s social worker that the child was in out-of-home care. General education teachers knew much less about their students’ home and background situation than special education teachers. In terms of contact information, only half the teachers (both general and special education) had such essential information as the name of the caregiver; only a fourth knew the name of the social worker. To an even lesser extent, teachers were informed of the holder of education rights and the child’s attorney, which is especially worrisome for special education teachers who must include the holder of education rights in the IEP process.</p>
<p>Special education teachers were more likely to have a foster child in their classes than general education teachers, and because of the IEP process, they were more informed about their students’ backgrounds. Of the general education teachers who had foster youth enrolled in their classes, 83% had been unaware of the background history of their students (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0741932510362506">Table 3</xref>). Given this high percentage, it is likely that there were other children in their classes in foster care whose home situations were unknown to school staff. Without someone closely monitoring these students throughout the school year, it is unlikely that they will receive the services and interventions needed for the learning and behavioral problems they exhibit.</p>
<p>The many challenges that foster youth present in the classroom go largely unaddressed because of lack of (a) information about the child, (b) teacher preparedness for such challenges, (c) school supports to the child and teacher, and (d) collaboration with the child welfare system. More services and accommodations appear to be available to special education than general education teachers. Both groups of teachers especially need to learn strategies for how to deal with the intense emotions exhibited by some foster youth. Teachers and schools need to handle these atypical behaviors within the context and understanding of the child’s background situation.</p>
<p>Teachers are empathetic but frustrated by the lack of responsiveness of the school and child welfare systems. A third of the foster youth were highly mobile, moving in and out of their classes after a brief stay. One teacher summed it up:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The movement of kids in and out of school is hard. We bond and then they leave. We are never sure when they will be placed elsewhere. This is really bad for everyone. The kids have difficulty trusting people and forming positive relationships with staff and peers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teachers are caring yet remain largely untapped resources for these youth.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think we spend enough time thinking about what it feels like to move homes regularly and hope/pray/expect to be reunited with a parent ‘soon’ only to be disappointed when it just doesn’t happen. I see that in the works and it is devastating. These kids are on an emotional roller coaster ride. It certainly keeps them from being free to be educated.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An obvious limitation in the interpretation of the study’s results is the 42% return rate of surveys even after a second mailing to request that completed surveys be returned. Given that these are beginning teachers feeling overwhelmed by the double challenge of meeting teaching responsibilities while at the same time attending teacher preparation classes and working hard to complete certification requirements, the low return rate is most likely the consequence of lack of time and the voluntary nature of the survey. A second limitation is that, of the returned questionnaires, 75% were from special education teachers whereas only 25% were from general education teachers. As evidenced by the responses from these two sets of teachers, general education teachers were less likely to know about the foster care status of their students and so may have been less inclined to respond to a questionnaire soliciting their comments about such students. Thus, the generalizability of findings regarding beginning teachers’ experiences with foster youth is limited; however, the themes revealed by this small sample of novice general and special education teachers alert us to the substantial challenges faced and deficiencies that exist in the support of new teachers and foster youth at the school level. Further research is needed to determine how widespread these problems are and what else schools and teacher preparation programs can do to better support beginning teachers to work with this most vulnerable population of students. Research is also needed on the experiences of more seasoned general and special education teachers to identify the strategies they implement to handle the needs and challenges of these students.</p>
<p>Based on the study’s findings, we can determine that more collaboration is urgently needed among the school, the teacher, the caregiver, and representatives of the child welfare system if foster youth are to receive the supports and services they need to perform on grade level at school. Overall, there was very little communication between teachers and the formal child welfare system. Teachers were not notified of the foster care status of a child enrolled in class, and there was minimal contact with social workers, attorneys, and/or CASAs even though teachers could have been tapped as a resource for the child or provider of pertinent information for the social worker. Beginning teachers are being assigned students in foster care who they see as having challenges that are markedly different from their classmates. These students exhibit demanding emotional and behavioral problems, but their teachers are given minimal supports and information to appropriately manage the situation. They feel unsupported and challenged beyond their skill, which threatens their confidence and sense of efficacy as a teacher. The heartfelt frustration of one teacher can be heard in her statement: “As a first year teacher, I don’t wish it on anyone unless they’ve had previous experience working with this population.”</p>
<p>The findings of this study have important implications if we are serious about (a) improving the educational opportunities of children in foster care so they will have a better chance for a rewarding life and (b) ensuring that beginning teachers assigned to these students are prepared and supported by policies and practices that involve working in partnership with school support staff, caregivers, and agents of the child welfare system. Given the dismal outcomes of former foster youth that are currently being documented, the urgency of addressing the needs of these students and their teachers can hardly be overemphasized.</p>
