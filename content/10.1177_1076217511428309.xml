<p>“When we tell ourselves that our brightest students would not benefit from acceleration, we deceive ourselves, our students, and the nation.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Happy Anniversary! Ten years ago, in 2001, the U.S. Congress enacted the “No Child Left behind Act” (NCLB). This landmark act focused on standards-based education with the goal of raising challenges and improving student achievement. It undoubtedly changed and is changing the educational landscape in the United States for better and for worse. Its long-term effect on gifted education has yet to be analyzed, but we do know that the pressure on schools is to meet minimum standards with few if any incentives for schools to focus on students who can go beyond. Nevertheless, the intent of the law was to raise the bar and to promote excellence in America’s much-maligned public schools.</p>
<p>Somehow, however, the drive for excellence has lost steam in many schools that are bogged down in efforts to promote “adequate yearly progress.” Advocates for gifted children have been concerned over the law’s silence regarding talented and high-achieving children. In the first 5 years of NCLB, 2001-2006, federal funds for gifted education—already at a minimal level—decreased by one third.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in this same period, the gifted community has continued to press for services at the national, state, and local levels. In spite of funding cuts and tough economic times, individual campuses and parents have worked to leverage services for talented children. At the national level, the Belin-Blank International Center at the University of Iowa published an important report on academic acceleration and an appeal to implement various forms of acceleration for gifted students. Authors Nicholas Colangelo, Susan G. Assouline, and Miraca U. M. Gross outlined the research on acceleration in <italic>A Nation Deceived: How Schools Hold Back America’s Brightest Students</italic> (Volume I) and supported their position with a collection of research articles supporting their thesis (Volume II). (Readers who do not have this report in their personal libraries can view the 2004 publication at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nationdeceived.org">http://www.nationdeceived.org</ext-link> and download a copy.) The report received strong reviews in the media, including <italic>TIME</italic> magazine and newspapers such as the <italic>New York Times</italic>, the <italic>Washington Post</italic>, and the <italic>Boston Globe</italic> as well as many other smaller media outlets. Every advocate for gifted children needs this resource! Volume I is reader friendly (perfect to use with principals and other school leaders), and Volume II provides the research that supports the report’s assertions.</p>
<p>This advocacy is particularly important in the NCLB climate. Understandably, principals and superintendents and school boards are concerned that their schools “look good” on the tests of basic skills. In my state, school marquees proudly publish in big letters that their campus is “Exemplary” or “Recognized.” It is much less likely that they publicize lower ratings! And in the drive to bring all students to a level of mediocrity, gifted students are often neglected. What this means is that they are all too often frustrated and bored, constantly reviewing what they already know. “America’s school system keeps bright students in line by forcing them to learn in a lock-step manner with their classmates. Teachers and principals disregard students’ desires to learn more—much more—than they are being taught” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511428309">Colangelo, Assouline, &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>, p. 1). This does not mean that teachers and principals are uncaring or even unconcerned. It does mean that their focus is on general education and, in particular, on that group of children who are struggling to meet minimum standards. Add to this fact the pervasiveness of the unfortunate myth that acceleration is a poor choice for gifted children. Ask almost any teacher you know what he or she thinks of such strategies as grade skipping, early admission to kindergarten or college, credit by examination, or any of the other types of acceleration that <italic>A Nation Deceived</italic> describes. In many—if not most—cases, the response will be negative. Age rules in America’s schools. First graders are supposed to be 6 years old and fifth graders 10 years old. Besides, they will say, “What about social adjustment?” “What will the other kids think?” “It’s bad to push kids.” This is in spite of the fact that many gifted students in early American history could accelerate as far as they could if their parents could afford tutors. They could often be found in colleges and universities. And the traditional “little red schoolhouse” let children learn at their own pace. As education became more standardized, these approaches changed. For organizational convenience, children were grouped by age rather than by ability and motivation. Acceleration went out of style except for the few who could afford expensive and academically challenging private schools or public magnet schools that focused on high-achieving students. Add to these realities the extra work involved in determining when and in what areas a child might need to be accelerated and the extra help a child may need in adjusting to acceleration, and there is just too much pushback. So, in spite of the research, we go on as we almost always have, depending on teachers who are willing to individualize instruction for gifted students in a hodge-podge response to their learning needs.</p>
<p>And make no mistake, teachers and principals and superintendents are not the only ones who will resist. Parents themselves have bought into the myths of acceleration and often focus on the possible negative effects rather than working to make various strategies workable. There are some “socially acceptable” ways of providing acceleration, such as enrolling students in charter schools that promise—and sometimes provide—excellence or in choosing a private school that may or may not be a more challenging experience. But these choices may not be available to everyone.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to work in a school district that allowed acceleration by subject, even for elementary school students. Adrian was a fourth grader who was very interested in mathematics. He convinced his principal and the mathematics coordinator that he wasn’t joking when he said he was studying calculus. He was successfully integrated into an AP calculus class at the high school. After a few days, the other students forgot that he was young and accepted him as a member of the class. Beyond Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate—the default “gifted programs” in many secondary schools—there is considerable resistance. A university faculty member has a gifted ninth grader with lots of problems, including serious underachievement and perfectionism. Rob works with a counselor for help with these issues, and his parents have tried several public schools and now a private school to help him reach his potential. Rob might be a good candidate for early admission, and in fact, one of the choices in his school district is an early college high school on a community college campus. But his parents will not consider this. They refuse to reconsider some of the myths about acceleration.</p>
<p>Recently they heard about an eighth-grade girl from a small town whose school district and parents have cobbled together a unique program for Cheryl. She attends community college 2 days a week, taking three courses: Spanish, rhetoric I, and biology for science majors. In addition, she is taking an online algebra course through Stanford University (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://epgy.stanford.edu/courses/math/">http://epgy.stanford.edu/courses/math/</ext-link>). She is “officially” enrolled in her district’s alternative school, which allows her to participate in her local campus drama, music, and competitive athletic programs. But instead of applauding the cooperation of the school district and the parents for making these arrangements, Rob’s parents are focusing on what might go wrong instead of what is going right.</p>
<p>In spite of the research supporting acceleration, there is still considerable resistance. “When we tell ourselves that our brightest students would not benefit from acceleration, we deceive ourselves, our students, and the nation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511428309">Colangelo et al., 2004</xref>, p. 1). Ten years into NCLB, there has never been more need for creative responses to the search for excellence for gifted students. Every gifted advocate should strive to use every means possible to promote challenge and a high level of learning for gifted students.</p>
