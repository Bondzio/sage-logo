<abstract>
<p>Thymic depletion, presence of viral antigen, and changes in distribution and cytokine production of thymic macrophages were investigated in calves experimentally infected with a noncytopathogenic bovine viral diarrhea virus type (BVDV) 1 strain. Ten clinically healthy colostrum-deprived calves were used. Eight calves were inoculated with the virus and two were used as uninfected controls. Calves were sedated and euthanized in batches between 3 and 14 days postinoculation. At necropsy, thymus samples were collected for structural, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural study and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling). From 6 days postinoculation, the thymic cortex was multifocally depleted with increased frequency of pyknosis and karyorrhexis, suggestive of apoptosis and confirmed by the TUNEL technique. Although the onset of lymphoid depletion was coincident with the detection of viral antigen by immunohistochemistry, the number of infected lymphocytes was very low through the experiment. There was an increase in number of macrophages in cortex and medulla, accompanied by ultrastructural changes indicative of phagocyte activation, and a decrease in cells expressing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and IL-1α. These results suggest that the increase in number of these cells could be related to phagocytosis of cell debris and apoptotic lymphocytes. Furthermore, the results imply that, in contrast to the situation with classical swine fever virus, the lymphocyte apoptosis resulting from bovine viral diarrhea virus infection is not mediated by TNF-α or interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) production by virus-infected macrophages. This is the first study that describes this decrease in the number of thymic cells expressing TNF-α and IL-1α in cattle experimentally infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1.</p>

<body>
<p>Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a <italic>Pestivirus</italic> in the family Flaviviridae,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300985811414031">25</xref>
</sup> which infects a large proportion of cattle worldwide and causes a number of clinical forms of the disease, including subclinical infection, reproductive failure, severe acute disease, and mucosal disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985811414031">2</xref>

</sup> The two genotypes are called BVDV1 and BVDV2 and are now recognized as distinct species within the <italic>Pestivirus</italic> genus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300985811414031">25</xref>
</sup> The two biotypes, cytopathic and noncytopathic, are based on the activity of the BVDV strain in cultured epithelial cell.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985811414031">7</xref>
</sup> Recently, a third lymphocytopathic biotype, which correlates with high virulence strains in acute infections, has been proposed.<sup>

</sup> Atrophy of the thymic cortex due to lymphocyte apoptosis has been related to cytokine expression by monocyte–macrophages during experimental classical swine fever virus infection, another member of the genus <italic>Pestivirus </italic>closely related to BVDV.<sup>

<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate, in experimental animals, the relationship among thymic depletion, presence of viral antigen, and changes in distribution and cytokine production by thymic macrophages from colostrum-deprived calves experimentally infected with the low-virulence noncytopathogenic BVDV1 strain 7443.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Ten clinically healthy male Friesian calves, 8 to 12 weeks old, were obtained immediately after birth from a herd free of tuberculosis, brucellosis, bovine leucosis virus, and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. Calves did not receive colostrum and were confirmed to be free of BVDV by antigen and antibody ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).</p>
<p>Calves were housed individually in the Animal Experimental Center of Cordoba under strict sterile conditions. Control calves were housed individually in another barn with the same conditions, so there was no contact between infected and uninfected animals. No other calves were housed in the center during the experiment.</p>
<p>Eight calves were inoculated (day 0) by intranasal instillation with 10 ml (5 ml per nostril) containing 10<sup>5</sup> median tissue culture infective dose per milliliter of noncytopathic BVDV1 7443 (courtesy of the Institute für Virologie, TIHO, Hannover, Germany). Two control calves were inoculated by intranasal instillation of tissue culture fluid and used as uninfected controls.</p>
<p>Clinical signs and rectal temperature were monitored twice daily. Blood samples were taken from all calves before virus inoculation and at several days postinoculation (dpi). In these samples, the total leukocyte count and percentage of lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils were determined. BVDV antigen was detected in theses samples by ELISA (HerdChek BVDV Ag/Serum Plus, IDEXX Laboratories, Österbybruk, Sweden). Samples with corrected optical density &gt; 0.300 were considered positive.</p>
<p>Animals were sedated with xylazine (Rompun 2% solution, Bayer Healthcare, Kiel, Germany) and killed in batches of two at 3, 6, 9, and 14 dpi by overdosing with thiopental sodium (Thiovet, Vet Limited, Leyland, Lancashire, United Kingdom). Control calves were killed at the end of the experiment. The experimental procedure was carried out in accordance with the <italic>Code of Practice for Housing and Care of Animals Used in Scientific Procedures</italic>, approved by the European Economic Community in 1986 (86/609/EEC amended by directive 2003/65/EC).</p>

<title>Histology and Immunohistochemical Study</title>
<p>At necropsy, tissue samples were collected from thymus and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Formalin-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for structural study. For immunohistochemistry by the avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex method, tissue sections were dewaxed and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase activity was exhausted by incubation of the sections with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 minutes at room temperature. Sections were subjected to one of the following methods for retrieving antigen or increasing permeability: protease type XIV (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Steinheim, Germany) 0.1% in 0.01M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2 (8 minutes at room temperature); microwave heating in 0.01M citrate buffer, pH 3.2 (5 minutes from the beginning of boiling); Tween 20 (Merck, München, Germany) 0.1% in 0.01M PBS, pH 7.2 (10 minutes at room temperature). After pretreatment, sections were rinsed 3 times in PBS, pH 7.2, for 10 minutes and then covered with 1% normal horse serum (Pierce-Endogen, Woburn, MA) in 0.05M Tris buffer, pH 7.6, for 30 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies at 4°C overnight. Details of primary antibodies used in this study, including dilutions and pretreatments, are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0300985811414031">Table 1</xref>. After primary incubation, the slides were washed in PBS (3 times for 5 minutes each) and incubated with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Pierce-Endogen), diluted 1:200 in 0.05M Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1% normal horse serum for 30 minutes at room temperature. After 3 further 5-minute washes in PBS, samples were incubated with the avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex method (Vectastain ABC Elite Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hour at room temperature. All tissue sections were finally rinsed in PBS, incubated for 1 minute with chromogen solution (NovaRed Substrate Kit, Vector Laboratories), and counterstained with hematoxylin.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Positively labeled cells were counted in 20 randomly chosen areas of 0.20 mm<sup>2 </sup>of cortex and medulla. Cellular identification was based on morphologic features and size of cells. The numbers of positive cells were expressed as a mean ± SD. These values were evaluated for approximate normality of distribution by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Differences between the means of control and inoculated animals were assessed by the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> nonparametric test (GraphPad Instat 3.05, San Diego, CA). <italic>P </italic>&lt; .05 represented a statistically significant difference between inoculated and control animals.</p>

<sec id="section5-0300985811414031">
<title>Ultrastructural Study</title>
<p>For ultrastructural study, samples were postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Epon 812 (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland). Sections (50 nm) for ultrastructural examination were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philip CM-10 transmission electron microscope.</p>

From 6 dpi until the end of the experiment, the number of cells immunolabeled for both mediators was significantly lower than in control animals necropsied at day 14 and in infected animals necropsied at 3 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0300985811414031">Figs. 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0300985811414031">10</xref>).</p>

<title>Ultrastructural Findings</title>
<p>Ultrastructural examination revealed changes consistent with lymphocyte apoptosis in the thymus of infected animals and control calves. Apoptotic cells exhibited condensation and margination of chromatin as well as fragmentation of the nucleus and cytoplasm. These changes became more marked from 6 dpi, with the appearance of condensed nuclear chromatin and highly electron-dense membrane-bound cell fragments (apoptotic bodies) either free or phagocytized by macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0300985811414031">Fig. 11</xref>). From 6 dpi, macrophages displayed other ultrastructural changes indicative of phagocyte activation, such as an increase in cell size and an increase in cytoplasmic lysosomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first sequential study of the histopathologic changes produced in thymus during an experimental infection with noncytopathogenic BVDV1 and their relationship with virus distribution and cytokine production by macrophages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0300985811414031">Figs. 12</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0300985811414031"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0300985811414031"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0300985811414031"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0300985811414031">16</xref>). Our results suggest that BVDV1-induced thymic lymphoid depletion has a different mechanism than that in classical swine fever<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0300985811414031">24</xref>
</sup> and is not the consequence of an increase of TNF-α and IL-1α production by thymic macrophages. By contrast, this study showed reduced frequency of cells expressing these cytokines coincident with the onset of lymphoid depletion.</p>
<p>Colostrum-deprived calves inoculated with the noncytopathogenic BVDV1 strain 7443 developed lymphoid depletion of thymus from 6 dpi, when viral antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry, similar to that reported for other BVDV1 and low-virulence BVDV2 strains.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985811414031">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300985811414031">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985811414031">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300985811414031">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300985811414031">26</xref>
</sup> This lymphoid depletion has been associated with lymphocyte apoptosis,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300985811414031">13</xref>
</sup> which was evidenced in this experiment by the TUNEL technique.</p>
<p>The onset of thymic depletion was coincident with the detection of viral antigen by immunohistochemistry, but viral antigen was present mainly in macrophages and thymic epithelial cells. The number of infected lymphocytes was very low through the experiment. These results agree with previous reports about high-virulence BVDV2 that detected thymic depletion but very low infection of lymphocytes by immunohistochemistry.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985811414031">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300985811414031">17</xref>
</sup> These results suggest that viral infection of lymphocytes plays no more than a minor role in the lymphoid depletion. More studies, focusing on viral detection in early phases in the disease, are necessary to confirm that infected lymphocytes are not dying soon after they begin to express detectable viral antigen.</p>
<p>BVDV antigen has been found in monocyte–macrophages during BVDV infection by immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985811414031">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300985811414031">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300985811414031">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985811414031">18</xref>
</sup> and some authors have suggested that virus was replicating in these cells and not merely being processed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300985811414031">16</xref>
</sup> In our work, BVDV antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry in thymic macrophages, which could represent infection of these cells and/or phagocytosis of other infected cells. The increase in number of macrophages in cortex and medulla was coincident with the onset of lymphoid depletion, which was accompanied by an increase of tingible body macrophages in histologic study. Ultrastructural study showed changes in the macrophage population indicative of phagocyte activation. These results suggest that, although active viral replication could be present in macrophages, the increase in number of these cells could be related with phagocytosis of cell debris and apoptotic lymphocytes.</p>
<p>The increase in number of macrophages was not accompanied by ultrastructural changes in macrophages indicative of secretory activity or by an increase in the number of cells expressing TNF-α or IL-1α. Expression of both cytokines was decreased from 6 dpi until the end of the experiment. These results agree with previous studies regarding cytokine production during BVDV infection. Jensen and Schultz in 1991 suggested that BVDV infection of bovine monocytes could result in the production of an inhibitor of IL-1 activity that inhibits thymocyte proliferation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985811414031">10</xref>
</sup> In 1996, Adler et al showed that TNF-α production in bovine bone marrow macrophages is decreased at 24 hours after BVDV infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985811414031">1</xref>
</sup> Lee et al in 2008 demonstrated that in vitro infection with cytopathic and noncytopathic BVDV strains decreases TNF-α and IL-1β gene and protein expression in bovine peripheral blood monocytes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300985811414031">12</xref>
</sup> TNF-α production has also been investigated in primary bovine fetal muscle cells, showing a transcription of TNF-α mRNA 82% lower in cells infected with noncytopathogenic BVDV strains as compared to the mock-infected cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300985811414031">27</xref>
</sup> According to these studies, the decrease of cytokine expression by thymic macrophages could be a direct effect of the virus.</p>
<p>All these data regarding the effects of BVDV infection on cytokine production have been obtained from in vitro studies. This is the first study that describes this decrease in the number of thymic cells expressing TNF-α and IL-1α in cattle experimentally infected with BVDV1. This decrease was coincident with the presence of viral antigen in thymic monocytes from 6 dpi and with the onset of the lymphoid depletion. Both cytokines are secreted constitutively in thymus, and in this organ, they are known to be involved in the differentiation and proliferation of thymocytes, playing a crucial role in T-cell production.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985811414031">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300985811414031">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985811414031">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300985811414031">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0300985811414031">28</xref>
</sup> So, a downregulation of these cytokines could contribute to the BVDV-induced immunosuppression by interference with the mechanisms of thymocyte differentiation and proliferation. Our methods do not quantify total cytokine production and cannot exclude that few cytokine-producing cells are producing large amounts of cytokines in these animals, so more studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. This decrease on cytokine production would not explain lymphocyte apoptosis, which could be related to the presence of viral antigen observed in other thymic populations, such as thymic epithelial cells, which play a crucial role in thymocyte selection mechanisms in the thymic cortex.</p>
<p>In summary, thymic lymphoid depletion following inoculation of colostrum-deprived calves with BVDV1 has a different mechanism than that observed in classical swine fever and is not likely a consequence of an increase of TNF-α and IL-1α production by thymic macrophages. We hypothesize that the decreased expression of these cytokines could be one of the mechanisms contributing to BVDV-induced immunosuppression, due to the important function of these cytokines in T-lymphocyte maturation and activation of the immune response. However, the downregulation of cytokines would not alone explain the increase in apoptosis observed during the experiment. The apoptosis may elicit an increase in number of macrophages with a phagocytic function. More studies are necessary to clarify the pathogenesis of thymic lymphoid depletion, the cause of lymphocyte apoptosis, and the role of other thymic populations infected with the virus, such as thymic epithelial cells.</p>
