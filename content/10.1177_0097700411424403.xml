<p>In the past thirty years, increased flows of capital, trade, and ideas, usually referred to as “globalization,” coupled with neoliberal restructuring of national states and economies have transformed societies across the world. With them, new patterns of spatial and social mobility have created forms of diversity that combine or clash the world over with established ideas and interests vested in, for example, nations, ethnic groups, or local communities. Though these new forms of diversity arguably started in developed countries in Europe, North America, and Oceania in the 1970s and 1980s, developed and developing countries in other continents have followed suit. The oil states in the Middle East, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and the richer countries of Southeast Asia, for instance, already have been important countries of immigration for decades. Internal migration and cross-border migration continue to be major factors in generating new patterns of diversity the world over. Especially in large countries, such as India and later also China, hundreds of millions of people have migrated internally, often across distances equal to international migration elsewhere. While both China and India, the two largest and most populous countries in Asia, continue to produce huge numbers of emigrants, their increased wealth and opportunities are now attracting returnees and immigrants from a range of countries, including expatriates from the developed world, traders, businesspeople, and labor migrants. To a lesser extent, economic development in the richer African and Latin American countries has spawned a similar transition.</p>
<p>Each region and country has its own unique ways in which these global changes play out. In the case of China, the post-Mao reforms and opening up to the world have been the context in which globalization and neoliberal deregulation have taken place. In fact, the magnitude and importance of reform has been such that it tended to obscure the fact that much of what was happening was part of larger global transformations. Analyses of the reforms emphasize their unique nature, a Chinese exceptionalism that earlier also dominated writings on the collective period, particularly the high Maoism of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Only in the past ten years or so, with China becoming a key global player and development model itself, has the transformation of China begun to be couched in global and comparative terms.</p>
<p>Globalization and reform are obviously about much more than economics. Post-Mao China has not only become immeasurably wealthier than ever before. Marketization, globalization, and dismantling of the planned economy and socialist entitlements have led to fundamental realignments in the organization of society. The explicit recognition of this transformation is still only partial, both in Chinese government discourse and—to a lesser extent—in academic analyses. There is a tendency to highlight those aspects of the immense changes that easily fit the teleology of “development” and “modernization.” On the positive side, these include the market economy, the rise of new entrepreneurial and middle classes, foreign trade, urbanization, or new, modern life styles. The negative side of the ledger features issues such as environmental degradation, rural–urban migration, social unrest and contestation, and income inequality.</p>
<p>In our view, the twin biases of Chinese exceptionalism and modernization teleology create blind spots in the perception and understanding of contemporary Chinese society, including Chinese government discourse and policy making. The four articles that make up this special issue develop this point by focusing on fundamental changes in China’s cultural and ethnic diversity, which globally are one of the most visible, talked about, and contentious aspects of globalization and neoliberal deregulation, but which in China remain underexposed.</p>
<p>We would like to briefly illustrate the lack of attention to cultural and ethnic diversity as an aspect of change with the example of internal migration. Reform and opening up in the 1980s unleashed unprecedented internal migratory flows that show no sign of abating; currently, around 200 million Chinese people live and work outside their place of permanent residence. While this has received ample scholarly, public, and policy-making attention, the debate focuses on rural–urban migrants as workers, the rights and public services that are denied to them, and their contribution or, alternatively, the damage they do to economic growth, development, and poverty alleviation. In other words, the issue of the “floating population” is couched in terms of what we earlier called the teleology of modernization. Even though migration is now considered an inevitable consequence of modernization, rural migrants are by no means seen as a fully normal aspect of urban society but remain a permanent exception to the enduring legacy of high socialist fixed residence and employment. In this state of exception, the broader cultural, ethnic, and political aspects of the presence of migrant communities are silenced; they remain either invisible or are denied a full expression, the well-known examples being the repeated dispersal of “Zhejiang” and “Uyghur” villages by the Beijing municipal authorities in the 1990s. This can no longer, after almost thirty years, be blamed on the newness and perhaps temporary nature of internal migration but seems to amount to deliberate suppression of forms of cultural and ethnic diversity that lie beyond what received government discourse allows.</p>
<p>By exploring the interaction between some of the new and old forms of ethnic diversity in Chinese society, this special issue wants to put this problem at the heart of discussions on the realignment of the organization of Chinese society. We look at debates on the relevance of minority and overseas Chinese policies, the increased social and spatial mobility of China’s recognized minority peoples, both internally and internationally, and the immigration of foreigners and Chinese nationals from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. These debates and patterns of mobility challenge and blur some of the basic categories and distinctions that undergird the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) map of the Chinese nation: non-Han minorities versus the Han majority, overseas Chinese versus Chinese residents in China, and foreigners versus Chinese. What do China’s current policies regarding minorities, overseas Chinese, domestic and international migration, and the labor market, for example, make of a Uyghur from Xinjiang who has returned to China to take up a job in Beijing after studying in America and acquiring U.S. citizenship? Is she a returned overseas Chinese, an internal migrant, a Uyghur, or a foreign immigrant? Which rights and duties does she have or not have as a foreign resident, member of a non-Han national minority, or former Chinese citizen?</p>
<p>Our articles show that many policies that often worked remarkably well in the 1980s or even 1990s simply no longer fit contemporary realities. Yet we also find that the Chinese authorities do not entertain a fundamental rethinking of well-established assumptions and policy choices. Instead, existing policies are reasserted, tweaked, or combined. This not only produces an amusing oxymoron like the term <italic>overseas Chinese ethnic minorities</italic> discussed by Elena Barabantseva in her article. More seriously, it prevents the Chinese authorities from formulating innovative and adequate responses to phenomena that they never encountered before.</p>
<p>Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), national minority, overseas Chinese, and foreigner have been statuses determined and inescapably imposed by the state. They came with clear, immutable, and non-negotiable sets of rights, duties, privileges, and restrictions regarding residence, employment, consumption, education, health care, and so on. These state-prescribed statuses were reasserted and elaborated in the early reform period and continue to exist, but, as Barry Sautman shows in his contribution, increasingly jar with new (neo)liberal ideas about individual achievement, fairness, and equality of opportunity that are relevant in today’s much more open market economy and society.</p>
<p>This points to an important contradiction in the effects of neoliberal marketization and globalization that occur in many different variations across the world. The emphasis on achievement and social mobility through one’s own effort and talent undermines the legitimacy of the ascribed statuses, privileges, and power of special categories of people, such as, in the Chinese case, minorities, overseas Chinese, or foreigners. However, as has been pointed out many times, neoliberal deregulation and globalization are not only about freedom, individualization, mobility, and achievement, but also give rise to an opposite trend. New forms of mobility and social differentiation create new social and cultural inequalities, conflicts, collective identities, and communities that are all at variance with individualistic and meritocratic values. In much of the developed world, new immigrant communities and the reassertion of xenophobic nationalistic sentiments are the twin products of neoliberalism and globalization. As Frank Pieke shows in his article, in China xenophobia is as yet not in evidence, but international migrants in China’s cities are nevertheless beginning to transform into ethnic communities that both outdated government policies and fledgling liberalist attitudes among the population might find hard to accommodate.</p>
<p>The growth of a middle class, consumerism, leisure, and other aspects of modern urban life, as well as increasing social and spatial mobility caused by reform and globalization, have made life in contemporary Chinese society in many respects more similar to other capitalist economies, especially in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, however, the specifics of established policies, political and administrative structures, and ideology continue to make China unique. With the growth of the market economy, the Chinese state no longer rules by assuming the identity of its own administrative structure with the economy and society. However, it is not enough merely to say that the state’s role is now simply the creation of an institutional environment adequate to support the market economy (the “establishment of the service state,” <italic>fuwu guojia jianshe</italic>), a standard element of the current CCP leadership’s “scientific concept of development” (<italic>kexue fazhanguan</italic>). The continued mismatch between the principles that undergird policy and the development of contemporary Chinese society renders important issues, people, and groups politically “invisible” and leaves certain interests inadequately catered for. The new patterns and meanings of cultural and ethnic diversity described in our articles are one example. They require a much more fundamental reconsideration of principles of governance and indeed of the concept of the Chinese nation than a mere adaptation of existing ideas, structures, and policies.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation incorporates two very different, even conflicting narratives that are both increasingly at odds with what China in the twenty-first century is and wants to be. With the rise of nationalism in the late nineteenth century, the Chinese nation was imagined as the home of the Chinese people, a safe haven and instrument to undo the injustices of national humiliation (<italic>guochi</italic>) after the Opium Wars and to restore China’s rightful place in the world. But the Chinese nation is also the reincarnation of an empire, a composite “multination country” (<italic>duo minzu guojia</italic>) consisting of autochthonous groups glued together only by the cultural, economic, and political dominance of the Han majority. The problem quite simply is that both narratives are increasingly irrelevant, although they continue to shape Chinese discourses on the nation and the way that the state manages both its own population and relations with other countries. Minority nationality identities are increasingly unimportant to life and work in China’s modern urban society. National humiliation largely has been rectified and China is regaining its rightful place in the world. Continued harping on the remaining unresolved issues (Taiwan, Tibet, South China Sea and East China Sea territorial claims) is increasingly at odds with China’s place and aspirations in the world.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party’s failure to rethink these two conceptualizations of the nation is directly relevant to more specific issues that have to do with ethnic and cultural diversity. The partial incorporation of Taiwan and Hong Kong residents and the many ambivalences inherent in the concept of overseas Chinese, for instance, make the Chinese nation more a patchwork of people and territories than a community of equal citizens. In November 2010 for the first time since the establishment of the PRC in 1949, foreign residents and immigrants in China were included in the national census. This development signaled a recognition of the undeniable relevance and role of immigrants in Chinese society. With increasing numbers of foreigners settling in China, the dynamics of immigration will have even more significant implications for Chinese citizenship and Chinese national identity. The continued reluctance to allow the acquisition of Chinese citizenship (on grounds of marriage, employment, or residence) or even permanent residence stands in the way of a clearly regulated and more permanent integration of foreign residents (especially those of non-Chinese extraction) in Chinese society and fuller incorporation of Chinese society in the world. Yet purely legalistic solutions are not enough to ensure a better incorporation of domestic and international migrants. A profound conceptual reconsideration of what constitutes “the Chinese” is required as well.</p>
<p>As a nation (as opposed to an economy or diplomatic power), China continues to be exclusivist, defensive, and even primordial. Territorial and racial formulations of the Chinese nation continue to be conflated. Since the late nineteenth century, China’s struggle for independence and sovereignty was premised on the narrow idea of common blood and origins advocated by Sun Yat-sen and his associates. The leadership of the CCP has not openly renounced racial foundations of the Chinese nation, repeatedly publicly reasserting them instead. China requires a more substantial and inclusive concept of citizenship in terms of rights, duties, and identity that are shared by all Chinese nationals, regardless of where they live, what their origin or ethnicity might be, or how they acquired citizenship (birth in the PRC, Taiwan, or Hong Kong; naturalization after immigration or marriage).</p>
<p>Yet universal and substantial individual citizenship alone is not enough. As we observed earlier in this introduction, neoliberalism and globalization spawn both individualism and inequality and realign relations of power and powerlessness that are about more than individual freedom, rights, or achievement. Government responses also require ways to address new forms of inequality, including the possible validation or curbing of the rights and identities of new social, ethnic, cultural, and religious groups and interests.</p>
<p>In the Chinese context, of particular interest and importance will be the rise of communities of internal or international migrants, especially their mutual accommodation. Wooyeal Paik and Myungsik Ham in the final article of this special issue illustrate this point very well. South Korean communities in many places in China are beginning to reach a point of institutional completeness, with schools, churches, clubs, and associations all catering to the needs of Koreans, but to what extent will they eventually incorporate communities of ethnically Korean Chinese migrants, or possibly even North Korean refugees? If such pan-Korean communities evolve, what will the response of local and central authorities be? Similar questions can be asked about Muslim or Christian migrants, immigrants, and local residents, Taiwanese or Hong Kong residents in Shanghai or the Pearl River Delta, and many other groups.</p>
<p>Countries across the globe are struggling to find new ways to accommodate both individual and group rights in a world where the significance of the nation, citizenship, and ethnicity are changing rapidly and drastically, and are contested like never before. China is therefore certainly not alone in this regard, but, and this is the point we wish to make here, it has as yet hardly started the journey.</p>
