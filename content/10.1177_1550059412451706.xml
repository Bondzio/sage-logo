<abstract>
<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) source localization in epileptology continues to be a challenge for neuroscientists. A number of inverse solution (IS) methodologies have been proposed to solve this problem, and their advantages and limitations have been described. In the present work, a previously developed IS approach called Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is introduced in clinical practice in order to improve the localization accuracy of epileptic discharge sources. </p>
<p>For this study, 31 patients with the diagnosis of partial epilepsies were studied: 14 had benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and 17 had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The underlying epileptic sources were localized using the BMA approach, and the results were compared with those expected from the clinical diagnosis. Additional comparisons with results obtained from 3 of the most commonly used distributed IS methods for these purposes (minimum norm [MN], weighted minimum norm [WMN], and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [LORETA]) were carried out in terms of source localization accuracy and spatial resolutions. The BMA approach estimated discharge sources that were consistent with the clinical diagnosis, and this method outperformed LORETA, MN, and WMN in terms of both localization accuracy and spatial resolution. The BMA was able to localize deeper generators with high accuracy. In conclusion, the BMA methodology has a great potential for the noninvasive accurate localization of epileptic sources, even those located in deeper structures. Therefore, it could be a promising tool for clinical practice in epileptology, although additional studies in other types of epileptic syndromes are necessary.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The source localization of different patterns of brain electrical activity obtained noninvasively by means of conventional EEG and/or magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an area of increasing interest in clinical neurophysiology, for both background and epileptogenic activity. This is stressed by the great number of available publications on this subject over recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451706">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>EEG source localization has proved to be a useful tool for assessing cognitive function, with event-related potentials as well as in the study of several neurological diseases (motor and sensory evoked potentials) and for psychiatric and psychopharmacological applications. In epileptology, however, the accurate localization and delineation of paroxysmal discharge sources are considered crucial steps in the presurgical evaluation of pharmaco-resistant cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451706">2</xref></sup> Therefore, the development of techniques capable of inferring this valuable information from EEG is of vital importance.</p>
<p>Such a task entails solving a difficult inverse problem (IP), which is to estimate the primary current sources inside the brain that generate the electrical activity recorded at the scalp surface. A number of methods for solving this IP have been developed and applied to simulated and actual data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451706">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451706"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412451706"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412451706">5</xref></sup> The solutions provided by these methods can be divided into dipolar (DpS) and distributed (DiS) solutions, depending on the physical nature assumed for the current sources. The former assumes that the EEG is generated by a few predetermined discrete point sources (dipoles) at specific locations in the brain, while the latter has no serious constraints on the spatial extension and number of the sources which can be continuously spread inside the gray matter. This perfectly suits the localization of epileptic sources, where the simultaneous activation of large populations of neighboring neurons is expected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451706">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412451706">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412451706"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412451706">8</xref></sup> The flexibility of DiS is its main advantage over DpS. That is, while DpS calls for a strong ad hoc knowledge about the number of dipoles that generates the measured EEG, DiSs are designed to effectively estimate both the location and the extension of the sources automatically from the data, with minimum human intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451706">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451706">2</xref></sup> Nevertheless, DiS (critically, the linear ones) is commonly produced over the smooth sources that are biased toward locations closer to the sensors. This leads to the presence of the so-called ghost sources (sources that do not make much physiological sense and obscure the interpretation of the results) and the tendency to underestimate deep generators. Recently, a new type of DiS known as BMA was developed, which claims to deal with the 2 main problems above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref></sup> BMA produces spatially extended but well-localized and compact sources.</p>
<p>In the present work, we introduce BMA in clinical practice for the estimation of the EEG sources of epileptic discharges in a representative number of patients with focal epilepsy. We compare the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of BMA results to those obtained by using the 3 popular DIS that have previously been used for the localization of epileptic sources: LORETA, MN, and WMN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451706">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412451706"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412451706">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412451706">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412451706"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412451706">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>BMA has already been used in cognitive neuroscience for the localization of sources generating different types of event-related dynamics as recorded by EEG/MEG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412451706">11</xref></sup> as well as in the study of certain pathologies such as Alzheimer disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412451706">12</xref></sup> Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no consistent results using BMA in clinical practice have been reported to date. Additionally, this method has only been validated based on simulated EEG/MEG data or by using EEG recorded during well-studied evoked steady-state responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059412451706">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1550059412451706"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1550059412451706"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059412451706"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1550059412451706"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1550059412451706">18</xref></sup> In this sense, the present work is also novel in that it uses patients with a rigorous clinical diagnosis as a gold standard.</p>

<title>Participants and Methodology</title>
<sec id="section3-1550059412451706">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We studied 14 patients diagnosed with idiopathic partial epilepsy (specifically benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes) and 17 additional patients with the diagnosis of simple or complex partial TLE. All 31 patients were precisely diagnosed by 2 neurologists, from the Havana Neurology and Neurosurgery Institute, who have extensive expertise in epilepsy.</p>
<p>The group with benign rolandic epilepsy consisted of 8 males and 6 females. Ages ranged between 6 and 11 years (mean age 8 years). The TLE group consisted of 11 males and 6 females, with the age ranging between 22 and 62 years (mean age 39.6 years).</p>
<p>For each patient we recorded conventional scalp EEG. Subsequently, paroxysmal graphoelements were identified offline, and sources of epileptic discharges were localized by using the 3 well-known distributed inverse solution (IS) methods: LORETA, MN, and WMN. In addition, we used a recently developed methodology for the analysis of EEG activity: BMA for computing epileptic sources. Images of electrical sources of epileptogenic activity were obtained using the 4 IS methods mentioned above. The results were compared in terms of the localization and extension of the estimated sources. In this comparison, both the clinical history of the patients and the main features of their crisis were used as the gold standard. We stress that we also used the results of the comparison to validate the newly developed BMA approach for the first time in a clinical application.</p>

<sec id="section4-1550059412451706">
<title>EEG Recordings</title>
<p>The EEG was recorded in the 32-channel MEDICID 05 system (Neuronic SA); patients were awake with closed eyes in a dimly lit room, level of noise 2 µV root-mean-square (RMS) and environmental temperature of approximately 23°C. Technical parameters included a gain of 10 000, filter’s pass band between 0.3 and 30 Hz, with a 60 Hz “notch” filter. The sampling frequency was 200 Hz, the impedance of all derivations was kept below 10 kΩ and linked right and left mastoid electrodes were used as the reference. The grounding electrode was Fpz.</p>
<p>Nineteen monopolar EEG derivations of the International 10/20 System (FP1, FP2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, F7, F8, T3, T4, T5, T6, Fz, Cz, and Pz) were recorded using scalp electrodes of copper coated with silver chloride. Patients underwent 20 minutes of basal EEG recordings in a relaxed awake stage with eyes closed; after that, periods of alternating open eyes (OE: 10 seconds) and closed eyes (CE: 10 seconds) were recorded avoiding visual habituation until completing 2 minutes of open eyes recording. Hyperventilation and photostimulation were performed for all of them.</p>
<p>For patients with the diagnosis of rolandic epilepsy, EEG studies were recorded in a sleep-deprived condition. The EEGs in wakefulness and during 1 hour sleep were also recorded as described previously.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1550059412451706">
<title>EEG Analysis</title>
<p>Conventional EEG analysis was carried out by 2 medical specialists in clinical neurophysiology. The EEG was assessed in both reference and bipolar montages.</p>
<sec id="section6-1550059412451706">
<title>EEG Epileptiform Activity Analysis</title>
<p>Epileptic paroxysmal activities were estimated by means of 4 distributed IS methods: MN, WMN, LORETA, and BMA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1550059412451706">
<title>MN algorithm</title>
<p>This estimates a 3-dimensional brain source distribution under the assumption (prior information or constraint) that it should have a minimum overall intensity (smallest L2-norm).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059412451706">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1550059412451706">20</xref></sup> The method gives a unique solution in the sense that only one combination of intracranial sources can have both the lowest overall intensity and at the same time maximal data fitting (minimal reconstruction error). Its main limitation is that it favors the appearance of cortical sources because less activity is required in locations closer to the sensors to give a certain EEG voltage distribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1550059412451706">
<title>WMN</title>
<p>It was developed as an attempt to overcome the MN bias toward sources on the cortical surface. This was done by using different weighting strategies which penalize superficial cortical sources while encouraging deeper ones. The most common approach is to use the inverse of the norm of each column of the “lead field” matrix (the transfer matrix which linearly relates the electric current density at the sources to the voltages measured on scalp) as the weighting function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451706">2</xref></sup> In any case, these weights are based on mathematical operations without any physiological basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451706">2</xref></sup> Although WMN gives more sensible solutions as compared to MN, it does not completely overcome the bias toward superficial sources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1550059412451706">
<title>LORETA</title>
<p>On the other hand, LORETA added a new constraint to the depth weighting. This algorithm searches for the spatially smoothest solution that best fits the data. This is done by minimizing a measure of spatial roughness of the weighted solution—the so-called Laplacian WMN algorithm implemented in the LORETA software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412451706">4</xref></sup> This method outperforms MN and WMN in terms of both bias toward surface sources and localization error; but as with WMN, it does not completely solve these problems. It also suffers from an additional problem that is common to all distributed linear IS methods: the existence of ghost sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451706">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412451706">6</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1550059412451706">
<title>BMA</title>
<p>We explain the rationale behind the BMA approach in more detail, given its novelty and higher level of complexity. Although BMA is usually referred to as a method, it is actually a general framework that could be used in conjunction with any of the linear methods described before. In our case, we will use the original implementation appearing in Trujillo-Barreto et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref></sup> The authors used BMA in conjunction with an unweighted LORETA (ie, a LORETA method without the weights obtained from the lead field). In practice, the LORETA solution seems to be insensitive to the lead field weighting. The BMA takes advantage of a higher inference level omitted by all previous methods: the model inference level. That is, it allows for addressing the problem of model uncertainty that arises when dealing with different possible models for the same data. Here we understand the word “models” in a Bayesian sense, that is, it encompasses both the Forward Model (head geometry and electrical properties) and the set of assumptions about the required solution. Examples of models are the smoothness assumption of LORETA (mathematical prior or constraint), or the assumption that the EEG sources are confined to the gray matter (anatomical prior or constraint), or even the combination of both. In this sense, all source localization methods select a single model as the true/correct model for estimating the primary current density (PCD) inside the brain. Bayesian model averaging, on the other hand, can do better than that in the sense that it actually includes the models per se as part of the inference problem. One could in principle solve this model uncertainty problem by just selecting the best of the models at hand and base the subsequent inference of the PCD on that model. This is known as model selection. This selection is commonly carried out by choosing the model that received more support from the data, by maximizing the probability of the model given the data (posterior model probability). However, this makes the PCD estimates conditional on the selected model. The BMA in contrast has the advantage that allows us to estimate the PCD inside the brain unconditionally of any model considered. The BMA approach takes into account all the possible models at hand, and the final solution is calculated as a weighted average of the individual PCD conditional on each particular model (each calculated in the same way as explained above), where the weights were defined as the posterior probability of the corresponding model given the data. Using a more familiar terminology, doing model selection could be interpreted as looking for the “mode” of the distribution of models, while BMA would be equivalent to looking for the “mean.” The BMA approach provides PCD estimates that are optimal for predictions (as measured by a log-scoring rule). Intuitively, this can be thought of as making predictions based on all models at the same time, instead of just a single model that could be wrong even if it is a highly probable one.</p>
<p>In the original implementation of BMA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref></sup> the authors developed a BMA approach in the context of optimizing the PCD when having uncertainty about its anatomical localization. That is, they kept the mathematical priors fixed and equal to the LORETA smoothness assumption, but considered different models based on different anatomical priors by assuming that the PCD could be generated locally in different anatomical regions of the brain while the rest of the areas were silent. Thus they considered a set of models that differ from each other on the areas where the PCD was assumed to lie. Then, all the solutions obtained for each of these models were combined into a single solution using the BMA approach. The different brain regions considered were defined based on the Montreal probabilistic brain atlas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1550059412451706">21</xref></sup> It has been demonstrated that this implementation of BMA can deal with the bias toward surface sources that affects the traditional IS methods, allowing for the estimation of deeper sources with greater accuracy. Additionally, it provides solutions with significantly less localization error and higher resolution as compared with traditional methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Epileptic Sources Mapping</title>
<p>The computed sources of epileptic discharges were mapped based on the Montreal Neurological Institute probabilistic brain atlas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1550059412451706">21</xref></sup> All 4 ISs were computed using the Neuronic Source Localizer, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1550059412451706">22</xref></sup> distributed by Neuronic SA (http://www.neuronicsa.com/).</p>
<p>In this way, the corresponding brain electrical tomographies (BETs) were obtained for the selected paroxysmal discharges in each patient. To visualize the ISs we used the Neuronic Tomographic Viewer software developed at the Cuban Neuroscience Center (www.neuronicsa.com).</p>
<p>Comparison of BET maps showing the epileptic sources estimated by these methodologies were visually achieved and differences in resolution power for localizing epileptic focuses were exposed, taking into consideration the patients’ clinical histories and the characteristics of their epileptic seizures.</p>

<title>Overall Results</title>
<sec id="section14-1550059412451706">
<title>Benign rolandic epilepsy</title>
<p>The clinical history of the 14 patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes was negative until 4 to 10 years, when they began to show characteristic symptoms and signs of this kind of epilepsy, without any cognitive or neurological impairment. In all of them, the clinical seizures were reported to occur during sleep. Computed tomography studies were negative.</p>
<p>The EEG background activity was well organized with regard to the patients’ ages. Focal discharges were recorded in all EEGs: spikes and spike-waves mainly in central and temporal projections that appear as single discharges or grouped in short trains. Discharges were recorded more frequently during sleep, although in some cases discharges were also recorded in wakefulness, with evident increase in frequency during drowsiness and sleep (5 patients).</p>
<p>The BET maps obtained using BMA and LORETA methodologies showed the sources of epileptic discharges with high accuracy in the centrotemporal areas with frequent spreading to the inferior frontal leads (which can be expected in this kind of epilepsy). However, the BMA model provided more precise images (showing activated zones in a sharper way) than LORETA, in which some degree of spreading and diffused activations can be seen. Much more diffused activations (over the entire affected hemisphere) were observed when IS images were obtained using MN and WMN methodologies. Moreover, in these cases, the main estimated sources were found in all patients outside of the expected localization, with maximum activation in posterior or anterior brain areas. Some examples are shown in the next section (patients DGP and CDG).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1550059412451706">
<title>TLE</title>
<p>Seventeen patients with TLE were studied (6 symptomatic TLE and 11 probably symptomatic or cryptogenic TLE). Thirteen were classified as arising in the medial temporal lobe (TL) and four as epilepsy arising in the lateral temporal neocortex.</p>
<p>Conventional EEG studies showed focal interictal discharges with morphologies of spikes and sharp waves, mainly in temporal projection, which appear as single discharges or grouped in short trains. Background activity was well organized, with adequate frequencies and amplitude gradients in most patients, but in some cases EEG abnormalities were observed in the affected hemisphere (asymmetries, slow activity).</p>
<p>As in the case of benign rolandic epilepsy, in these patients, the BETs obtained using BMA showed useful and promising results for finding the precise location of the brain sources of epileptic discharges (results in high agreement or correspondence with clinical features). However, in the majority of these patients (14 of 17; 82.3%), LORETA methodology computed the main epileptogenic sources in posterior regions, although important activated zones were found in the TL too. In addition, diffused activated zones distributed across almost all the involved hemisphere were observed. Both WMN and MN methodologies did not compute discharge sources in an accurate and delineated way; more diffused and blurred activated sources were obtained when compared with LORETA, although major activated zones were always computed in the affected hemisphere.</p>
<p>In the next section, some patients’ BETs obtained using these methodologies (BMA, LORETA, WMN, and MN) are presented and results are discussed comparing these maps.</p>

<p>The main source of the epileptic discharges computed using BMA was located at the right superior temporal gyrus. Major sources of epileptic discharges were also estimated at the right precentral and postcentral gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412451706">Figure 2A</xref>). Other activated zones (less intensity) were found at the middle and inferior temporal gyrus as well as in the inferior frontal gyrus of the right hemisphere. Similar results were obtained using LORETA (in relation with the principal activated zones, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412451706">Figure 2A</xref>), but a more diffused distribution was evident, for example, other important sources were located in posterior areas (parietal and occipital lobes including also the left hemisphere; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412451706">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>When MN was used, the principal sources were obtained at the right inferior temporal and occipital gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412451706">Figure 2A</xref>). In consecutive views of axial slices, important and more diffused activations can also be observed over the entire right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412451706">Figure 2B</xref>). On the other hand, when WMN methodology was used, major sources were computed at the right orbitofrontal cortex (anterior and inferior brain areas; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412451706">Figure 2A</xref>). In consecutive views of axial slices, high activation can also be observed in the right inferior and middle frontal gyrus with some activation in a more diffuse way over all the anterior half of the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412451706">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The BMA was the best method to localize the epileptic discharges in this patient, since it showed a single main activation in the right superior temporal gyrus. Moreover, the main activation was more localized (less diffused) than sources found by the 3 other methods.</p>

<p>Source analysis of epileptic activity exemplified our comments in the Overall Results section. Here we present some important differences compared with rolandic epilepsy, regarding the different IS methodologies.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1550059412451706">Figure 4B</xref>, we show the estimated sources of discharges in the axial, coronal, and sagittal views (light areas) for BMA, LORETA, MN, and WMN. The coordinate lines mark the location of the maximum activation in each case. Major activation areas computed with BMA were found in the left inferior frontal region: triangular and orbitofrontal area, opercular zone, left insula, left temporal tip (inferior [basal] frontal and temporal areas involving inferior cortex and medial face of the TL), with some activation in the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyrus. Similarly, WMN methodology showed the main sources at the left temporal tip, left inferior temporal gyrus, left fusiform area, amygdala, hippocampal and parahippocampal areas, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. In these 2 methods, we found a high correspondence with the expected results, taking into account the patient’s clinical features (seizure description) and EEG findings. However, there is a marked difference between the sources found by BMA and WMN approaches with respect to the spatial resolution of the source distribution. The BET images obtained using BMA showed more clear, delimited and accurate sources than WMN, which showed sources in a more diffused way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1550059412451706">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the main sources estimated by LORETA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1550059412451706">Figure 4B</xref>) were found in the bilateral posterior regions, with some lateralization toward the left hemisphere, specifically in cuneus area, precuneus, and calcarine sulcus. Important activations were also obtained in the middle and superior occipital cortex, left supramarginal, and angular zones. In accordance with the patient diagnosis, diffused sources (although with low intensity) were computed also over the medial left hemisphere: cingulum, left medial orbitofrontal area, medial superior frontal cortex (see sagittal view), superior, and middle temporal gyrus.</p>
<p>Using MN the major sources of epileptic discharges were in the superior and middle frontal gyrus of the left hemisphere, with diffused activations at the inferior frontal, parietal, and superior temporal cortex.</p>

</fig>
<p>Analysis of the BET images using BMA showed the main activated region was in the left inferior temporal gyrus, but there were also important activated sources at the middle temporal, middle and inferior occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus of the left hemisphere, reaching superior temporal zone with slight propagation to the right inferior temporal gyrus. Sources can be observed in an accurate and delineated way in relation to the patient’s clinical diagnosis: TLE with experiential symptoms involving occipital and posterolateral association cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1550059412451706">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Using LORETA a more diffused activation was observed, where important sources are evident through almost all the posterior half of both hemispheres (postcentral gyrus, superior, middle, and inferior temporal cortex, insula, middle, and inferior occipital areas). Nevertheless, the major sources (higher intensity) were found on the left hemisphere. The maximum activation was found at the left occipital region, specifically in the calcarine sulcus and cuneus area.</p>
<p>On the other hand, MN showed diffuse activations through the posterior and inferior quadrant of both hemispheres, but with clear maximum activation in the left hemisphere and poor resolution power (blurred sources) for delimiting and specifying the activated areas. The major discharge sources were at the inferior temporal and inferior occipital gyrus, although some activation in the middle occipital cortex was also evident in the sequence of axial slices. Similar results were obtained using WMN; BET images showed diffused activations over the posterior half of both hemispheres with evident main sources in the left hemisphere. Here, the blurring of the images is even higher than in the other ISs, and it seems that the major activation is located at the left inferior temporal gyrus.</p>
<p>Once more, BMA was the most reliable for computing sources of epileptic discharges, giving BET maps with better quality, localizing and delimiting the discharge sources more accurately.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Distributed source models assume the presence of extensive active areas (EEG sources) that is consistent with the epilepsy physiopathology. The main problem with distributed IS methodologies in EEG/MEG is the nonuniqueness of the solution, that is, of the PCD distribution inside the brain. Therefore, it is necessary to include additional physiological (or anatomical) information and constraints about the physical and mathematical properties of the current sources, to decrease the number of possible solutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451706">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412451706">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412451706">8</xref></sup> In this article, a new methodology for solving the EEG IP was introduced; the third level of Bayesian inference theory known as BMA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref></sup></p>

<p>In rolandic epilepsy, discharge sources are considered localized and circumscribed to the superficial cortical centrotemporal areas. We commented on the accuracy of BMA and LORETA for computing sources, but pointed out the more disperse or diffused solution obtained with LORETA. This could be in relation to the intrinsic characteristic of the model that selects (among the infinite number of possible solutions) the spatially smoothest source distribution, based on the physiologically correlated activity of neighboring cortical neuronal populations. This generates broad and blurred solutions with dispersion. It has been reported that this can give solutions so disperse that a single activation could involve different lobes or the 2 hemispheres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451706">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451706"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412451706">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412451706">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1550059412451706">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, studies show better results for MN and WMN when sources are located in the superficial cerebral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412451706">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412451706">9</xref></sup> as in rolandic epilepsy. However, when we used these 2 methods in this kind of epilepsy, we obtained more diffuse and misallocated activated zones. This is probably due to requiring the final solution to have the lowest overall intensity and maximal data fitting. Some authors point out that the minimum overall intensity restriction is not always physiologically valid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451706">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412451706">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059412451706">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1550059412451706">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Source analysis of discharges in patients with TLE showed some similar and other (important) different results. Deeper cortical sources should be found. MN could not accomplish good results, which in some sense was expected due to its well-known limitation: it favors superficial solutions, where less activity is required to give a certain EEG voltage distribution, while deeper sources are generally incorrectly projected on the surrounded surface showing a broad and diffused activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451706">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451706">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412451706">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>With TLE, this dependency of MN on the sources' depth was overcome by WMN, which was developed to compensate for the tendency of MN to favor superficial solutions, by the introduction of different depth weighting strategies. As an illustration, we presented patient LRL, where the main sources were correctly located in the inferior (basal) frontal areas and medial face of the TL (deeper areas), although diffused activations were also obtained surrounding main sources. On the other hand, WMN was insufficient to localize epileptic foci in the majority of patients with TLE, showing diffuse activation in both hemispheres (eg, patient CRC). Some literature states that all the weighting strategies for WMN are based on purely mathematical operations and not on physiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451706">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451706">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1550059412451706">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using LORETA our results were very different when applied to TLE as compared with rolandic epilepsy. In TLE, the major sources of epileptic discharges were localized in posterior areas (misallocated) in a high percentage of patients. However, it is important to emphasize that LORETA accomplished very good results in TLE with symptoms related to epilepsy originating in the superficial lateral cortex (TL). On the other hand, and despite errors in localizing the main sources, there were also evident large activated areas in all patients. These results were expected in some sense, in the light of the theoretical characteristics of LORETA.</p>
<p>Although LORETA is one of the most used IS in the clinical setting, some important limitations are related to the requirement of “maximum smoothness” of the selected solution. In rolandic epilepsy, LORETA tends to generate broad and diffuse ISs, because neighbouring sources are modeled to assume similar strengths. Such assumptions may not always be related to an electrophysiological reality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412451706">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412451706">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The high percentage of misallocated sources in mesial TLE, we can assume is due to the other significant handicap of the algorithm (being a linear distributed source model). Despite the different mathematical constraints used for overcoming the tendency to underestimate deep sources and to favor superficial ones, this problem has not been solved. Some of the deep generators will be omitted or wrongly reconstructed, projecting or misattributing deep sources to superficial ones located near the sensors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1550059412451706">29</xref></sup></p>

<p>The different pros and cons of diverse IS methodologies have made evident the problem of uncertainty in the selection of the “most appropriate” method for modeling and analyzing EEG data. In 1999 Schmidt et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1550059412451706">43</xref></sup> stressed the advantages of considering not a single best-suited solution to the electromagnetic IP (as is computed in all methodologies so far) but taking into account a whole distribution of possible solutions, and then carrying out all the subsequent inference upon this distribution. The BMA approach is an attempt to implement these ideas, since it considers different models to solve the EEG IP.</p>
<p>We showed that BMA obtains sources with high accuracy when discharges are generated at the superficial cerebral cortex (rolandic epilepsy) and when sources are confined to deeper or more distant cortical zones with respect to the scalp sensors (TLE).</p>
<p>BMA takes into account different anatomical models. Each model consists of a different combination of anatomical regions to which the electrical current sources are constrained. For each model, Bayesian formalism allows computation of the EEG sources with the same smoothness requirements as LORETA. At the same time, it allows estimation of the adequacy of each model to explain the given data in terms of posterior probabilities (which is known as the “evidence” of the model). The final solution is calculated independently of the assumed models by averaging the solution obtained for each model, weighted by the corresponding “evidence” of the model. This procedure avoids selecting any particular solution as the best one, including that corresponding to the model with maximum “evidence.” The advantage of BMA is that it favors solutions that contribute to the generation of the EEG in terms of posterior probabilities of the models. Those solutions with small magnitude (for example deep sources) can be present in the final solution if they show high posterior probability values. Therefore, BMA can assess sources in deep structures in contrast to the other distributed methodologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1550059412451706">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1550059412451706">44</xref></sup> Moreover, if the anatomical structures in which the brain is divided for defining the models is appropriate (ie, physiologically meaningful), BMA will not produce activations larger than the size of the structures belonging to the models with high evidence. This helps to avoid largely diffused activations even when each source appears smooth in the region delimited by the corresponding anatomical structure, as required by the LORETA assumptions used for estimating each individual model.</p>
<p>An important number of articles demonstrates the advantages of BMA in the analysis of EEG (mainly in simulated data) and evoked potential data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059412451706">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1550059412451706">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1550059412451706">29</xref></sup> One of the most relevant was published in 2004 by Trujillo et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref></sup> where the authors studied the robustness of BMA in simulated EEG and MEG data (activation at occipital pole and thalamus) and also compared the results with those using LORETA and cLORETA. They demonstrated that BMA was able to accurately compute and delimit both superficial and deeper sources improving the tomographic properties of the 2 LORETA versions. Consistent results were also found when they analyzed real data (multimodal evoked potentials), emphasizing that in all cases the results were in high correspondence with the neural substrate underlying the brain processes generating the potentials.</p>
<p>In 1996, Leahy et al had assessed the accuracy of MN, WMN, and LORETA, and compared them with the Bayesian formulation in simulated data using the dipole localization error method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1550059412451706">45</xref></sup> The best localization was obtained by the Bayesian approach if the sources had sparse focal characteristics, even when not using the third level of inference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412451706">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Melie-Garcia et al applied BMA to compute sources of visual-evoked potential in 5 healthy participants and compared the results with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) statistical <italic>t </italic>maps. They found a high correlation between sources of the N1 component obtained by these 2 methods, with an excellent spatial resolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1550059412451706">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>As an additional advantage, BMA allows use of information independent of the EEG, as prior probabilities on anatomical models. This would allow it to benefit from clinical knowledge from other neuroimaging such as fMRI. Combining the good properties of BMA with fMRI allows the epileptogenic sources to be estimated with better spatial resolution. Some authors have proposed that further studies should be done to define the applicability of Bayesian models in EEG/fMRI. Others have defended this combination with BMA, since fMRI provides additional information for EEG source localization rather than acts as a constraint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059412451706">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1550059412451706">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059412451706">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1550059412451706">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1550059412451706">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1550059412451706">46</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have introduced BMA for finding the sources of epileptic discharges. To our knowledge this is the first study of BMA in the clinical setting. BET images obtained by applying this methodology were compared with the more popular and well-known LORETA, MN, and WMN. Our results suggest that BMA is a very promising tool for reliable estimation of EEG sources clinically, even in the case of such a variable and complex activity as epilepsy. BMA better delimited and located sources of the epileptic discharges in most of the patients (compared with the other 3 methods), in cases where both deep and cortical sources were expected.</p>
<p>Further studies should be carried out to provide validation of the method in other types of epilepsy or other pathologies such as stroke. On the other hand, BMA has a higher computational cost (compared with the other methods), which makes it a priority to develop fast versions of the algorithm to facilitate its application in clinical practice.</p>
