<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>In her letter, Johnson raises an important variable, “birth order,” that we did not include. It is known that breastfeeding initiation greatly decreases with increasing birth order.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412452871">1</xref></sup> Mothers who are unsuccessful breastfeeding at first birth are less likely to establish breastfeeding for subsequent children. There is no question about the importance of establishing breastfeeding at first birth and, especially for mothers who failed breastfeeding their first child, encouraging breastfeed subsequent children. In short, birth order and history of breastfeeding should be considered when developing breastfeeding education and promotion program from an individual perspective.</p>
<p>In addition, the suggestion of inclusion and exclusion of the “never breastfed” group is an important concern when we talk about duration or cessation of breastfeeding in order to identify higher risk individuals. The WIC population is identified as a target group from previous literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412452871">2</xref></sup> and this is especially true considering that they are less likely to initiate breastfeeding compared with the non-WIC population (41% vs 21%), based on our findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412452871">3</xref></sup> Thus, public health programs need a dual effort program for WIC mothers to reduce noninitiation and early cessation.</p>
<p>Although we support Johnson’s suggestions to identify individual-level determinants to develop a targeted intervention, the primary goal of this study was not to address the individual level but to evaluate the potential impact of the institutional level on breastfeeding duration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412452871">3</xref></sup> As Johnson pointed out, the majority of successful mothers who initiated breastfeeding run into “day-to-day challenges in the workforce,” and therefore we should pay attention to the institutional setting such as workplaces to support breastfeeding-friendly environments. In this instance, we studied the role of 2 institutions. First, childcare could be another day-to-day challenge for mothers, so we documented the negative impact of childcare use, particularly relative care, regardless of individual characteristics of mothers and infants. Second, we evaluated whether the government intervention, WIC program, may improve breastfeeding rates. The results showed that the WIC program may not be successful in breastfeeding promotion. To improve breastfeeding rates in the United States, both individual and institutional importance should be considered when we develop and target breastfeeding intervention.</p>
