<abstract>
<p>We address the co-evolution of language and material practices during institutionalization by proposing a tropological model of institutionalization that integrates linguistic and practice-oriented approaches into a four-stage sequence: Metaphor enables members to inaugurate institutional change by inspiring and energizing initial movement. Members use metonymy to operationalize the emerging institution by demonstrating how it can become expected practice. Synecdoche is used to facilitate diffusion, standardizing the institution across time and space. When material practice is noticeably contrary to linguistic claims, however, members use irony to bring about deinstitutionalization and generate another inaugurating metaphor. The model further proposes that ritualized actions dramatize each trope, highlighting its symbolic meaning and embedding distinct material practices that serve both to institutionalize the practice and to facilitate boundary crossing to the next trope. The paper goes beyond current literature by offering an integrated theory of trope and ritual as an explanation of how institutions are simultaneously symbolic-linguistic and practice-material.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>We currently lack a theory of the institutionalization process that properly integrates both linguistic and practice elements. This paper addresses the question of how language and material practices co-evolve during institutionalization and offers a tropological model as an answer. We also build on extant literature on tropes in organizations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611425735">Alpaslan, Babb, Green &amp; Mitroff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611425735">Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840611425735">Green, Li &amp; Nohria, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611425735">Green, Alpaslan &amp; Mitroff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611425735">Heracleous &amp; Barrett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0170840611425735">Oswick, Putnam &amp; Keenoy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0170840611425735">Sewell &amp; Barker, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0170840611425735">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0170840611425735">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>) by introducing ritual as an explanation of how institutions are simultaneously symbolic-linguistic and practice-material. The theory uses both ritual and tropes to provide an integrated explanation of movement through the trope sequence (crossing rituals) and between language and practice (association and dissociation rituals). We also suggest that several resistance strategies exist including sequence reversal and inversion of the role of tropes.</p>
<p>Several studies have discussed how institutions are simultaneously linguistic-symbolic and practice-material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611425735">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611425735">Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840611425735">Hirsch &amp; Sekou Bermiss, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840611425735">Jepperson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0170840611425735">Meyer &amp; Goes, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0170840611425735">Phillips &amp; Malhotra, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0170840611425735">Zilber, 2006</xref>). Institutions are portrayed as being both linguistic/symbolic and material/practice with some studies giving more weight to the linguistic and symbolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840611425735">Green et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0170840611425735">Phillips, Lawrence &amp; Hardy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0170840611425735">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0170840611425735">Zilber, 2006</xref>) and others giving more weight to the practice and material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840611425735">Barley &amp; Tolbert, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0170840611425735">Orlikowski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0170840611425735">Palmer, Jennings &amp; Zhou, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-0170840611425735">Westphal, Gulati &amp; Shortell, 1997</xref>), with no sense of explanatory resolution. Recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611425735">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840611425735">Green et al., 2009</xref>; Meyer &amp; Strang, 1990; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0170840611425735">Phillips et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0170840611425735">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>) is attempting to integrate language and practice, although there is as yet no robust model of institutionalization that properly explains these processes.</p>
<p>The extent to which practice is ritualized during the institutionalization process needs to be included in any explanatory framework. A ritual is ‘symbolic behaviour that is socially standardized and repetitive’ that channels emotions, frames experience, and promotes solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611425735">Kertzer, 1988</xref>, p. 9). Little is known of the role of ritual during the earlier stages of institutionalization. Much ritual may be fabricated as the need arises. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0170840611425735">Hobsbawm (1983)</xref> showed that much of the ritual that surrounds the British institution of monarchy was ‘invented tradition’, deliberately fabricated in the 19th century. However, fabrication cannot explain why ritual should be important in the early stages of institutionalization. With a new technological idea such as early automobiles around 1900, public perception was that familiar forms of transport such as horse-drawn carriages were proper and understandable; the automobile was unreal, so that people had to use familiar terms such as horseless carriage to denote it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0170840611425735">Rao, 1994</xref>). Thus the problem was to take public perception from the unreal to the real: an important boundary crossing that only ritual could effect.</p>
<p>In the early stages of an innovative idea there is only a perceived image, usually cast as a metaphor, which can be explicitly stated in a few sentences. But discussing the idea itself gives a sense of nothing achieved, no movement from unreal to real. However an important boundary crossing is achieved when the image or metaphor begins to move via ritual practice into the messy process of making the metaphorical image more complex: developing a metonymic implementation recipe, getting opinions, asking questions, fitting strategic practices into the everyday organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840611425735">Bourque &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>). Boundaries are indicated by symbolic markers (e.g. deadlines and job titles mark a shift from creative concepts to detailed job design) whose maintenance or crossing is facilitated by rituals. Bringing about institutional change involves both changing material practices and crossing symbolic boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-0170840611425735">Zietsma &amp; Lawrence, 2010</xref>). Boundaries separate incommensurables such as unreal and real, simple and complex, local and non-local, and good and bad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840611425735">Espeland &amp; Stevens, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>To address these issues consequent to the integration of linguistic and practice elements in institutionalization processes, we model a four-stage sequence of evolutional institutionalization built on the ‘master tropes’. The model depicts the four master tropes as dramatized in practical actions that serve to ritualize the institution. Rituals are both symbolic and material because they dramatize each trope, fixing their symbolic meaning and at the same time embedding material practices.</p>
<p>This paper makes three theoretical contributions. First, it discusses the process of institutionalization in a new way. Second, it investigates agency and motivation in institutions. Third, it addresses the question of why institutions are both material and symbolic.</p>

<title>Linguistic and Practice Orientations to Institutions</title>
<p>Integrating the linguistic and practice elements of institutionalization begins with the concept of logics: socially shared, deeply held assumptions and values that form a framework for reasoning, provide criteria for legitimacy, and help organize time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611425735">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>). While logics are carried and reasoned about in language, they simultaneously have deep material implications. However, language and practice are not equally in evidence throughout the process. Practices do exist throughout the institutionalization process but at the highest level of institutionalization actors stop using language – they stop discussing the practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611425735">Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840611425735">Jepperson, 1991</xref>). Moreover, institutionalization processes often take many years, during which time material practices can change (Meyer &amp; Strang, 1990; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-0170840611425735">Westphal et al., 1997</xref>). The translation of institutions into specific contexts involves moving from generic rational myths into specific ones, and these change over time in relation to material circumstances and local institutional dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0170840611425735">Zilber, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The crucial added value of a linguistic account is that it links together rhetorical structure and the significant meanings of a practice. This leads to institutional change being viewed as the typification of argumentative repertoires grounded in specific contexts; for example, in labour relations there are arguments of fairness (about pay offers) and threat (of strikes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0170840611425735">Sillince, 1999</xref>, p. 800). Such problematic contexts arouse a need for rhetoric, defined by Burke (1950/1969, p. 43) as ‘a symbolic means of inducing cooperation’. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0170840611425735">Phillips et al. (2004</xref>, pp. 641–2) argued that actions leave a textual trace (the first step in institutionalization) either if they are surprising enough to trigger sensemaking or if they threaten organizational legitimacy. Such a change often involves a shift from being spoken about to being written about and represents an increase in that practice’s persistence. However, despite this important role of context, institutionalization also involves generalization beyond the immediate, originating context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840611425735">Barley &amp; Tolbert, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840611425735">Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1967</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840611425735">Green et al. (2009)</xref> suggested that argument structure gets simpler as institutionalization occurs. Their approach aligns with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0170840611425735">Suchman (1995)</xref> who argued that pragmatic and moral legitimacy give way over time to cognitive legitimacy. Thus in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840611425735">Green et al. (2009)</xref>’s terms, arguments of self-interest (pragmatic legitimacy) and arguments of moral correctness (moral legitimacy) that explicitly, syllogistically argue for a new practice lead to a later stage in which the new practice is taken for granted and implicit; at this stage the argument structure simplifies because the practice has become familiar and hence comprehensible. The practice is now institutionalized because it ‘makes sense’, becomes taken for granted, and is now not argued about any more (i.e. comprehensibility and taken-for-grantedness together constitute cognitive legitimacy).</p>
<p>Several scholars have shown how rhetoric is actively constructed linguistically to shape practice, or have shown the role of rhetoric in linguistic explanations of practice. For example, this process works through incomplete syllogisms that allow the audience to supply the missing premise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611425735">Heracleous &amp; Barrett, 2001</xref>), contestation using rhetorical schemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0170840611425735">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>) and interplay between action and meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0170840611425735">Zilber,2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0170840611425735">
<title>A Tropological Process View of Institutionalization</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611425735">Green, Alpaslan and Mitroff (2010)</xref> asserted that institutionalization follows a tropological sequence and related this to management science. We also argue that the stages of institutionalization are characterized by tropes and, moreover, that tropes are associated with a particular style of reasoning that makes them naturally fit into a particular sequence. However, we discuss the link between language and practice more directly and relate this to management rather than management science.</p>
<p>Prior to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611425735">Green et al. (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840611425735">Klemm (1987</xref>, p. 446–7), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0170840611425735">Sewell and Barker (2006b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611425735">Alpaslan et al. (2006</xref>, p. 11) also argued for a tropological model of rhetorical movement in fluid organizational contexts. Building on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0170840611425735">White (1978)</xref>, they argued for the usefulness of a four-step tropological framework as a discursive way of understanding how organizational meaning and agency moved in fluid but still coherent ways over time. They argued that organizational meaningfulness was inaugurated via metaphorical discourse and then progressed through subsequent discourses of metonymy, synecdoche and, finally, irony. We build on this work to show how language links to practice in order to construct our theory of institutionalization.</p>
<p>We begin our account of a tropological framework for institutionalization by considering the inaugurating gesture in the rhetorical form of a metaphor to represent the future. Metaphors are ‘ways of seeing things as if they were something else’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840611425735">Manning, 1979</xref>, p. 661). In drug policing for example, the inaugurating metaphor is ‘master detective’, who starts and leads an investigation despite considerable differences from police work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840611425735">Manning, 1979</xref>, p. 663). Metaphors enable members to inaugurate action when they portray a problem or an objective. Metaphors represent the target domain of the future in terms of similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0170840611425735">Oswick, Keenoy &amp; Grant, 2002</xref>) with the source domain of the present by reframing what is familiar and by putting it in a new light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611425735">Cornelissen, 2005</xref>, p. 753; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0170840611425735">Morgan, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0170840611425735">Sackmann, 1989</xref>, p. 464). That new light can lead to an enlarged set of meanings. For example, members can use a metaphor to change the meaning of an action from unprincipled to principled: ‘Only when the meaning of striking was enlarged through the use of the metaphor (“Striking is principled behaviour”) did other group members agree to the proposed action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611425735">Donnellon, Gray &amp; Bougon, 1986</xref>, p. 48). Vaara, Tienari and Santti (2003, p. 440) showed that two merging companies were described in terms of the familiar metaphor of ‘ships’, ‘on the way’, that were seeking a new direction. Because changes are unsettling, this can be managed ‘by using metaphors that relate the changes to known experiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0170840611425735">Sackmann, 1989</xref>, p. 465).</p>
<p>This suggests that some aspects of the quality of the language–practice link in the metaphor trope are open to managerial influence. If the metaphor is not timely (does not address recent troubles) then people will be indifferent and so will not seek a link to practice. If the language (metaphor) dominates the practice then the meetings will be aimless and inconclusive. If the practice (proposals in meetings) dominates the language (the overall metaphor) then actions outside the metaphor may be advocated and the trope will lose its form and so management will lose control of direction and people’s motivation.</p>
<p>Metonymy enables members to operationalize any institutionalization process. Metonymy ‘takes the whole and reduces it to constitutive parts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840611425735">Manning, 1979</xref>, p. 661) and is thus a whole-part substitution. It thus involves analysis into steps and this recipe ensures operationalization of the new action. Metonymy is a substitution of terms determined by a material or logical relationship. The relationship we select here is prerequisite antecedence in a recipe. Examples of recipes include how to make a drug arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840611425735">Manning, 1979</xref>, p. 666) and how to do TQM using problem analysis and statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0170840611425735">Zbaracki, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>This suggests that under some circumstances the quality of the language–practice link in the metonymy trope can be managed. If the language in the form of metaphor–metonymy connection is incoherent then people will be demotivated. If people understand the recipe–metaphor link then they are more motivated to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>Synecdoche enables members to standardize the institutionalization process. Synecdoche often applies to a part-whole substitution (the part stands for the whole). We define synecdoche as a representative label. A synecdoche crystallizes an idea into a vivid and memorable image. Examples include personification (like when we refer to a CEO to mean a company), a representative narrative as in a success story used to inspire others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0170840611425735">Zbaracki, 1998</xref>), a motto or label, a ‘representative case’ in a casework organization, or a ‘synecdochal event’ that is typical and representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840611425735">Manning, 1979</xref>, p. 665). The meaning of any institutionalization process is reduced to its bare essentials by a synecdoche and this facilitates widespread diffusion.</p>
<p>This implies that the organization may be able to influence the quality of the language–practice link in the synecdoche trope. If there are harmonization and compliance processes already in place within the organization then this makes synecdochal labels work easier. If synecdochal labels are used this makes centrally directed coordination easier. If the degree of decentralization and ‘institutional distance’ are high this increases local unit discretion to re-author or appropriate synecdoches in ways unintended by centre. If local unit discretion is high then this increases ‘ceremonial adoption’ or customized alteration of a synecdoche.</p>
<p>Irony is ‘a momentary rupture in the socially constructed fabric of serious discourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840611425735">Hatch, 1993</xref>, p. 30). Irony is used to evaluate, interrogate and resist the institutionalizing practice and is thus involved in deinstitutionalization. For example, evidence that emerged about DDT’s health effects contradicted previous assumptions, which contributed to its deinstitutionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0170840611425735">Maguire &amp; Hardy, 2009</xref>, p. 160). Irony then enables people to recycle into a new inaugurating gesture. Irony contrasts something with something else such as intention and outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611425735">Hoyle &amp; Wallace, 2008</xref>) in order to show its incongruity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840611425735">Manning, 1979</xref>, p. 663) and ‘to encourage switching between them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840611425735">Hatch, 1997</xref>, p. 283). Irony also enables an institution to be interrogated in order for it to be given new meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840611425735">Green et al., 2009</xref>, p. 32).</p>
<p>This suggests that there are some aspects of the quality of the language–practice link in the irony trope that can be influenced by actors. For example, if the ironic language is based on practice in the sense of evidence of bad material effects of the tropic process then it is more likely to work. Ironic contrasting of bad (use of DDT) with good (non-use of DDT) left a space for the new metaphor of ‘green’ alternatives so that excluding ecotoxicologists and environmental NGOs in discussions of practices became ‘inconceivable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0170840611425735">Maguire &amp; Hardy, 2009</xref>, pp. 151, 172).</p>
<p>The use of tropes in language to create movement via rhetorical foregrounding and backgrounding, in our view then, becomes essential for any institutionalization process. This shifting represents a framing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611425735">Gioia, Thomas, Clark &amp; Chittipeddi, 1994</xref>, p. 369) involving a movement of one change conversation into the foreground of member attention and another change conversation into the background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840611425735">Ford &amp; Ford, 1995</xref>). Much of what we might normally consider to be the fluidity of persuasive discourse in fact is an essential movement of meaning into either the foreground or background of our attention (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840611425735">Cooren, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840611425735">Ford &amp; Ford, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840611425735">Kuhn, 2008</xref>) required for the change process to unfold. Those meanings that are in the foreground are the meanings that shape the action we take in the here and now. A tropological framework focuses our attention on the category of meanings that are in our foreground of attention and shows how different categories (or tropes) of meaning move from foreground to background. For example, if our rhetorical discourse revolves around metaphors, then issues of inauguration, of deciding whether or not the change at hand is reasonable and right, are in the foreground. If our rhetoric revolves around synecdoche, then the issue of standardization is in the foreground and our discourse would focus on how we make the institutionalization work across time and space.</p>
<p>There is some evidence of countercyclical trope movement in naturally occurring talk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840611425735">Cornelissen (2008</xref>, p. 94) found that in some cases, metaphor can be ‘cued’ from metonymy, that is, countercyclically. For example, at Marks &amp; Spencer the metonymic recipe how it had ‘leapt to top slot’ cued the spatial metaphor of an index. Yet this is counter to the trope sequence we have postulated. However, this is co-occurrence of metaphor and metonym in the same text, rather than texts at different times. Use of such cross-sectional data renders the direction of ‘cueing’ difficult to establish convincingly, and makes it impossible to link tropes to larger-scale social processes such as institutionalization.</p>

<p>Institutional theory has been criticized for its weak incorporation of human agency. An important dimension of agency is whether action is voluntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-0170840611425735">Thatcher &amp; Zhu, 2006</xref>). The existence of resistance to a practice contradicts its voluntary nature. Therefore resistance plays an important role in any theory of institutionalization. We speculate that political resistance will make the trope sequence much less deterministic. Our observations on the trope sequence so far assume one continuous controlling agent – senior management – that inaugurates the institutionalization process with the metaphor which then generates later tropes. But it is possible for political resistance and multiple agency to derail the trope sequence. This suggests that there is room for agency in choosing to resist the forward trope movement. Let us assume, for example, that top management is the agent in an institutionalization process in a royal palace cum major visitor attraction. This then generates the field of action of the metaphor ‘a storytelling organization’, which generates the metonym ‘how to tell a good story about the royal personalities’ and the synecdoche ‘royal lives’ as in ‘making the visitor feel as if royal lives were lived here’, which depicts the trope sequence in the way we have described. One manifestation of political resistance in such a case may be that staff reinterpret the synecdoche as ‘ordinary lives’ as in ‘putting the visitor in touch with ordinary lives that were lived here’. The direction of flow forward into irony as in ‘stories can’t be controlled by the managers’ would be the typical managerial response but, in the face of resistance, the flow could lead backwards into metonymy and reinvent a new operationalization around ‘how to tell a good story about 14th-century servants’. Taking control of the field of action (e.g. resistance through changing synecdoche from ‘royal lives’ to ‘ordinary lives’) thus enables the sequence to be reversed. Getting the most rhetorical force out of the trope sequence could be regarded as a managerial strategy, so that derailing this momentum would be a way to resist an institutionalization process. Therefore an obvious resistance strategy would be to replace managerial forward movement through the trope sequence by backward movement as in the example given.</p>
<p>Another resistance strategy would be to embed out-of-sequence tropes within the managerially dominated trope sequence. Resisters might then seek to embed tropes out of sequence as a conscious strategy. For example, at the synecdoche stage (e.g. ‘the project is a success story’ is used to stand for the whole institutionalization process) resisters could embed a metaphor – ‘the project is a cut flower that will soon wither’. Or at the irony stage, in which managers seek a constructive learning outcome, resisters could use a destructive metaphor such as ‘an organization is like a group of ants that cannot learn’.</p>
<p>Although metaphor engages and irony disengages, resistance can be served through inversion of these acts. This may involve inversion in which metaphor disengages (takes us elsewhere) while irony re-engages (brings us back to earth). Thus resistance to overweening power may involve imagining a utopian metaphor and enacting that utopia ritualistically to take us elsewhere to what-could-be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0170840611425735">Scott, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Irony enacts internal agency (experienced freedom to act) of resistance through an attitudinal stance toward the powerful, whereas metaphor, metonymy or syncedoche can create the active stance of resistance that enacts external agency (freedom to act). In order to move from merely internal resentment with only symbolic effects (e.g. an identity of resistance fighter), towards action with external, material effects of constructively ‘exerting power’, there needs to be a shift from irony. Moreover, when external agency and internal agency are both low then tropes will lack connection with the material world, for example, the possibility raised by the metaphor will appear unrealistic.</p>
<p>If there is no resistance, institutionalization will occur whatever the sequence. Indeed, under these conditions of strongly institutionalized practice, rituals make what has been taken for granted, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840611425735">Berger and Luckmann (1967</xref>, p. 60) called ‘internalised’, become temporarily visible, reverting back to an earlier, ‘externalisation’ stage of institutionalization, thus opening institutions up for re-examination. Thus ‘carnival’ occasions such as office Christmas parties ridicule hierarchy yet simultaneously reinforce it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0170840611425735">Rosen, 1988</xref>). On the other hand, if resistance is very high, the sequence will likely be subverted in some way. Therefore it is at medium to low levels of resistance that the sequence is most effective. We suggest that the four-trope sequence is canonical because it provides the basis from which tropes of resistance are generated.</p>

<title>The Role of Ritual in Institutionalization</title>

For example, a key stage in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840611425735">Greenwood and Suddaby’s (2006)</xref> process model is linking adverse material performance with symbolically persuading others that contradictions exist. The repeated nature of material practice suppresses the need for language yet at the same time language is needed for intellectualization or generalization by means of ‘typification’ such as ‘in these situations one does this’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840611425735">Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1967</xref>) and for ‘theorization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0170840611425735">Greenwood et al., 2002</xref>, p. 60). Again, boundary misalignment occurs when organizations no longer conform to practices laid down by regulators, making them open to symbolic influence of new ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0170840611425735">Seo &amp; Creed, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these developments, the process theory of institutionalization is unsatisfactory. Imprecision arises because of the undefined character of pre-institutionalized, semi-institutionalized and fully institutionalized stages of an organizational activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0170840611425735">Greenwood et al., 2002</xref>, p. 60; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840611425735">Greenwood &amp; Suddaby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0170840611425735">Strang &amp; Sine, 2002</xref>, p. 510). This means that theoretical tools are lacking for examining fluctuations in degrees of institutionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0170840611425735">Schneiberg &amp; Clemens, 1996</xref>) and for assessing the causes and consequences of institutionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0170840611425735">Sine, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Several process theories stress the importance of social interaction and awareness that others are adopting the new practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840611425735">Elsbach, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840611425735">Greenwood &amp; Suddaby, 2006</xref>). Our argument is that ritual goes beyond mere social interaction by dramatizing the practice and giving it figurative meaning. Further, process theories also signal the importance of common focus and emotional mood in adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611425735">Collins, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0170840611425735">Goffman, 1967</xref>). Ritualization may include a scene in which several people are present and where expressive significance is given by material objects such as scenes, props or clothes, and scripts. For example, the office Christmas party studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0170840611425735">Rosen (1988)</xref> embedded the practice of the owner generously giving and figured him metaphorically as a father figure. Such dramatization has been observed previously in ritual ‘products’ that act as resources for supporters in order to add to an organization’s legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0170840611425735">Ritti &amp; Silver, 1986</xref>) and in ritualized competitions that distribute legitimacy-enhancing prestige (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840611425735">Anand &amp; Watson, 2004</xref>). Besides these legitimacy-related functions, rituals also serve to enable generalization from situated, ritually performed practice to typified or recommended practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0170840611425735">Miller, 1985</xref>). Over time, with repeated enactment, scripts may become ‘mindless’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611425735">Ashforth &amp; Fried, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840611425735">Langer, 1989</xref>) and thus taken for granted.</p>
<p>Once institutionalization has occurred, then ritual may be used to maintain the institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840611425735">Dacin, Munir &amp; Tracey, 2010</xref>) and to reinforce boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840611425735">Lawrence, 2004</xref>) but the case of youth culture also shows that rituals may be used to resist institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840611425735">Hall &amp; Jefferson, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840611425735">Lawrence, 2004</xref>). Rituals of resistance are, however, ambiguous since they include both public rituals of subordination and apology at the same time as backstage rituals of ridicule of the powerful together with the ‘imaginative function’ of utopian metaphors about what-could-be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0170840611425735">Scott, 1990</xref>, p. 169). In the case of both maintaining and disrupting institutions, however, boundaries are established and reinforced in order to help maintain the institution (e.g. professional membership through recruitment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840611425735">Lawrence, 2004</xref>) or to disrupt it (e.g. being an outsider; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840611425735">Hall &amp; Jefferson, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to the process of institutionalization, there are at least three distinct types of ritual. Crossing rituals facilitate movement from one trope to the next. Crossing scripts guide <italic>rites de segregation</italic> for the termination of the ordinary in daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-0170840611425735">van Gennep, 1960/2004</xref>). They provide an organizing sequence of actions from one context to the next, and so create a sense of predictability and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611425735">Gioia &amp; Poole, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0170840611425735">Lord &amp; Foti, 1986</xref>). They have persuasive power and thus are ‘primitive rhetoric’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840611425735">Burke, 1969</xref>) that employs poetics to motivate collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840611425735">Burke, 1984</xref>). Crossing rituals enable transition from one context to the next, across an important invisible boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0170840611425735">Richter, 1992</xref>). Rites of passage dramatize such transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-0170840611425735">Turner, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-0170840611425735">1982</xref>). Van Gennep (1960) defined rites of passage as rituals or ceremonies that facilitate movement of one or more individuals from one context to another. They are not distinguishable because of their content but because of their symbolic transitional function. They take the form of ritualized actions that are supposed to have some cultural significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0170840611425735">Tanner, 1979</xref>). What is important is the fact that one performs a rite of passage habitually prior to transition so as to focus attention, reduce anxiety and change expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840611425735">Ashforth, Kreiner &amp; Fugate, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840611425735">Halpern &amp; Christie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840611425735">Mainemelis, 2001</xref>; van Gennep, 1960). Rites of passage are important psychological supports for transitions from one trope to another because they increase contextual awareness. For example, ‘I am moving from the idea of having a new practice to considering exactly how I would perform it’ or ‘the practice is tired and ridiculed, so it’s time to stop doing it’. Rites of passage also reduce distraction and increase emotional arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840611425735">Ashforth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840611425735">Isen, 1999</xref>). They also provide a learning function because they include tasks, routines and decision rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840611425735">Ashforth et al., 2000</xref>) that carry deeper meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840611425735">Geertz, 1973</xref>, pp. 24–8). For example, rites of inauguration are ceremonies that announce change and enjoin others to engage with and support the change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0170840611425735">Schuyt and Schuijt (1998</xref>, p. 410) give an example from consulting practice:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the organization undergoing change, the consultant initiates a process in which ordinary place and time arrangements are exchanged for special time and space. Existing procedures and positions are reviewed. People and departments are loosened ‘from their previous social status’. As regards rites of separation, one example that can be mentioned is the annual screening of an organization’s forms. Every year a number of these forms are discarded as being no longer effective. This act is performed in a communal meeting where the director together with the staff literally buries the ill-fated forms over an informal drink.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus when members participate in crossing rituals they experience a sense of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-0170840611425735">Turner, 1982</xref>, p. 24) and reinforce the momentum created by tropes.</p>
<p>Rituals may also be association or dissociation rituals. Association rituals facilitate the reinforcing of practice by language, as when a metonymic recipe frames actions, and when a synecdochal slogan frames development of a common programme template. Association rituals are <italic>rites d’integration</italic> that guide the assumption of a new status and a return to normality (van Gennep, 1960). They facilitate enactment of the practice implied by the trope. For example, an induction programme trains new members in the routines to be used in a new unit or project. Dissociation rituals facilitate the separation of language from practice, freeing metaphor from old practices, or enabling irony to discard discredited practices.</p>
<p>We summarize the relationship between the role of tropes and rituals in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0170840611425735">Table 2</xref>, which depicts institutionalization by means of mutually reinforcing tropes and rituals integrating the linguistic and practice elements.

</fig>
<p>Rituals facilitate change because they are ‘symbolic tinkering…[which] guides social purpose’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840611425735">Burke, 1984</xref>, p. 179). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0170840611425735">Figure 1</xref> shows how rituals facilitate change. Rituals of dissociation dramatize the difference between language and practice. In metaphor, language (the new metaphor) is kept separate from current practice (in order to keep aspirations unencumbered by old experiences). In irony, language (in the form of leaders’ claims) is undermined by current practice (in the form of bad experience). Rituals of dissociation assume that ritual has an important social function of expressing conflict (in this case it is conflict between language and practice rather than between groups). The assumption is that ritual helps some groups exert control through mystification from taken-for-granted sanctioning based on patterning and repetition of behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840611425735">Gluckman, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0170840611425735">Lukes, 1975</xref>). The concept of mystification again says that language does not reliably mirror or support practice.</p>
<p>Rituals of association (Durkheimian solidarity) dramatize the reinforcing nature of language and practice. In metonymy, members use language (as the metonymic recipe) to reinforce current practices of experimentation. In synecdoche, members use language (as synecdochal principle) to reinforce the current practice (in the form of unifying template). Rituals of association play a social function of enabling people to dramatize and internalize collective social categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840611425735">Geertz, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-0170840611425735">Turner, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>Crossing rituals facilitate the crossing of important symbolic boundaries. They are available as a resource to people to use the ritual process as a ‘logic of action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840611425735">DiMaggio &amp; Mullen, 2000</xref>) or ‘tool kit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0170840611425735">Swidler, 1986</xref>) of options available for charting out a course of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611425735">Bell, 1992</xref>). Even more strongly, some have argued that ritual is a tool of social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611425735">Bell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0170840611425735">Rosen, 1988</xref>). Leaders use the process of ritualization as part of a repertoire of creative strategies to reproduce and reshape their social and cultural environment.</p>
<p>Crossing rituals are used to move from metaphor to metonymy. Once a new metaphor has been chosen, its meaning remains unreal and stimulates a lot of discussion. For example, it is only when organization-wide forums for allocating funds begin to show some effect that material practice is seen to change by significant numbers of people. Therefore ritual dramatizes the shift in meaning from unreal to real. Surprising investments and shifts in patterns of promotion and hiring act as signals of important material action. The signals have strong symbolic meaning that a boundary between metaphor and metonymy has been crossed.</p>
<p>Crossing rituals are also used to move from metonymy to synecdoche. The ritual facilitates a move from complex method (where there is a small audience, an internal focus and a closed problem) to simple slogan (where there is a large audience, an external focus and preparation for homogenization to a broadcast organization-wide state). For example, workshops are trumpeted as important work in which the new idea will become specified in a plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840611425735">Bourque &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>). This also involves a shift from local to non-local meanings. Several projects are assessed and either the best is selected as suitable for ‘export’, ‘diffusion’ or roll-out to other parts of the organization, or a best-practice project is made up out of exemplary parts of otherwise ordinary projects. The explanatory framework that holds the idea in place is made as explicit as possible. All partial or special meanings are taken out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840611425735">Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1967</xref>); specialized terms are simplified; corner-cutting using informal networks and hidden funds are expunged. One ritual that carries out this work is the award ceremony which publicizes only what is exemplary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840611425735">Anand &amp; Watson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Crossing rituals are also used to move from synecdoche to irony. This shifts meanings from good connotations to bad ones. The explanatory framework that supports the practice gives rise to suspicion that it has been over-hyped. The ‘demonstration project’, usually in document form, has been presented as a teaching artefact intended to demonstrate what was exemplary, but might now be ironized as propaganda. The wide publicizing of the practice now attracts counter-evidence of failed projects and resistance that gives rise to ironic ‘counter-rhetoric’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0170840611425735">Zbaracki, 1998</xref>). The most effective ritual here is the degradation ceremony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840611425735">Garfinkel, 1956</xref>).</p>
<p>Crossing rituals are also used to move from irony to metaphor. The emphasis here is on renewal and forgetting past failures. An example of a ritual of this kind is South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission that heard from those who had perpetrated crimes against humanity under apartheid in return for granting them amnesty. Its metaphor is that of expansion from the limiting constraints of the retributive model of justice towards considering a wider view of the problem. More commonly, a senior management purge signals a crossing from failure to a state of renewal.</p>

<title>Agency and Motivation in Institutionalization</title>
<p>An advantage of integrating linguistic and practice approaches toward institutions is the possibility of linking more effectively agency and action in a dynamic way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840611425735">Kuhn, 2008</xref>). In fact, a key issue in the literature on institutional change is the depiction of change as unrelated to human agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611425735">Cooren, Brummans &amp; Charrieras, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840611425735">Hoffman, 1999</xref>). A central problem here is embedded agency – how individuals who are constrained by institutions can also change them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840611425735">Battilana &amp; D’Aunno, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840611425735">Garud, Hardy &amp; Maguire, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840611425735">Greenwood &amp; Suddaby, 2006</xref>). The literature has provided two approaches to this problem: external jolts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840611425735">Hoffman, 1999</xref>) or action by agents within the institutional field (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840611425735">Leblebici et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Institutional theory, because of its emphasis on structural constraint, has been criticized for not allowing actors sufficient agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840611425735">Hirsch &amp; Lounsbury, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0170840611425735">Powell, 1991</xref>, pp. 183–200; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0170840611425735">Strang &amp; Sine, 2002</xref>, p. 497). Typical attempts to make agency an add-on to institutional theory occur when power and interest groups are included to demonstrate agency in explanations when they are not themselves explained by the theory. Yet ‘“agency” does not exist externally to, but is a powerful product of, institutionalization processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611425735">Cooper, Ezzamel &amp; Willmott, 2008</xref>, p. 678). In order to address this criticism, several scholars have begun to frame institutions in a completely new way. For example, one view has portrayed institutions as enablers of action (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611425735">Clemens &amp; Cook, 1999</xref>). Others have suggested that institutionalized fields are impermanent because of the way institutionalized language gets redefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840611425735">Leblebici et al., 1991</xref>). But these studies raise problematic issues about agency. Even the literature on institutional entrepreneurship assumes that actors act on interests, and that these interests are institutionally shaped, thus resulting in a concept of agency that is severely ‘compromised’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611425735">Cooper et al., 2008</xref>, p. 678). Our approach to this problem is two-fold: we explore the structural properties of agency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840611425735">Table 3</xref>, column 1) and argue that action emerges from an interaction between these structural properties and the peculiar figurative opportunities offered by the structure of each trope (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840611425735">Table 3</xref>, columns 2–5). It is thus a deeply internal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611425735">Cooper et al., 2008</xref>, p. 678) explanation.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840611425735">Table 3</xref> shows how the structure of tropes contributes to agency. Agency has many definitions, both internalist – the subjective experience of free choice – and externalist – the objective ‘reality’ of an ability to achieve material interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0170840611425735">Newton, 1998</xref>). The literature is briefly summarized in column 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840611425735">Table 3</xref>. Each trope, though figurative, acts on the material world (row 1), and is enacted by persons (row 2). The degree of figuration declines and the material commitment rises through the process (row 10). Agency is viewed as a person’s relating of temporal dimensions (row 3), as act of choice (row 4), as guiding constraint (row 5), as a person’s control (row 6), as a person’s consciousness (row 7), as a person’s ability to have an effect (row 8), as a person’s use of figuration (row 9) and as voluntary (row 12). Agency can also be viewed as enablement by structure, defined dualistically as the combining of language/figuration and practice/material action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0170840611425735">Sewell, 1992</xref>) (row 11). The table focuses on structural invariants rather than on shifting content. The table shows a link between agency and degree of institutionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0170840611425735">Tolbert &amp; Zucker, 1996</xref>); that as institutionalization proceeds, the person’s degree of commitment (row 10) increases and the person’s choices are narrowed by selection of certain means–ends pathways (row 4) resulting in a decline in voluntariness (row 12). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840611425735">Table 3</xref> also adds to the literature on resources and institutional entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840611425735">Lawrence, 1999</xref>) by showing how figuration enables resources to initially have several potential metaphorical meanings, be reconfigured and summarized, and eventually devalued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-0170840611425735">Zietsma &amp; Lawrence, 2010</xref>). Moreover, it shows how subject positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0170840611425735">Maguire, Hardy &amp; Lawrence, 2004</xref>) can give rise to evaluation of two distinct types of performance – substantive and symbolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840611425735">Heugens &amp; Lander, 2009</xref>) and two types of structure – semiotic and material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0170840611425735">Sewell, 1992</xref>) (rows 9 and 10). It also implies that persons who are incumbents and challengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840611425735">Hensmans, 2003</xref>) and who are at different hierarchical positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840611425735">Battilana, 2006</xref>, p. 666) may use tropes differently, and that the status of subject positions is developed by institutional entrepreneurs using rituals (row 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840611425735">Lawrence, 2004</xref>, p. 118).</p>
<p>An important aspect of agency is that action should be voluntary. This requires that the agent should be motivated to act. Early institution theorists suggested that institutional pressures generate a choice between material and symbolic objectives (technical efficiency and social legitimacy, respectively), that can be resolved in a sequential manner by first adopting to get technical efficiency and later adopting to get legitimacy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0170840611425735">Tolbert &amp; Zucker, 1983</xref>). It has also been suggested that they can choose to retain control in the face of institutional pressure or to maximize legitimacy and resources depending on shifting environmental contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840611425735">George et al., 2006</xref>). However, more recently arguments have been advanced that organizations can balance these twin motivations simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840611425735">Kennedy &amp; Fiss, 2009</xref>), although questions still remain about how this may be achieved. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840611425735">Table 3</xref> shows that material and figurative/symbolic aspects can be attended to simultaneously, although their relative weights shift significantly throughout the institutionalization process.</p>

<title>Institutionalization as a Process of Motivating Movement through the Trope Sequence</title>
<p>In this section we introduce four key steps in the movement of discourse through the tropological framework we described above. The word trope in Greek means ‘turn’ and we shall argue that ritualistic uses of tropes help us understand the distinct motivations involved in turning through these four transitions by focusing our attention on the turning around of meaning between background and foreground as the process unfolds.</p>
<p>Inauguration using metaphorical language represents one thing in terms of another and thus suggests the ease of moving from one to the other. The recent negative memories mean that this is a healing, soothing, maybe even exciting, time. As positive emotions arise, new energy comes too. But the audience is guarded and requires a cogently shaped trope to move forward. Metaphors inaugurate any institutionalization process because metaphors ‘can initiate the process by triggering a perceptual shift, the choice of metaphors influencing the direction, interpretations of, and feelings about the shift’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0170840611425735">Marshak, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0170840611425735">Sackmann, 1989</xref>, p. 468; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0170840611425735">Schon, 1979</xref>). Self-defining metaphors to do ‘evangelist visioning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840611425735">Carlsen, 2006</xref>, p. 144) are required before embarking on metonymic operationalization because, as one of the directors of a start-up company commented, ‘Fancy market plans and the like have no purpose unless you find out who you are’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840611425735">Carlsen, 2006</xref>, p. 139). Generation of novel self-definitions is particularly susceptible to depiction in metaphorical terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-0170840611425735">Vaara et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840611425735">Carlsen (2006</xref>, p. 141) described the inauguration of a small company that won a large contract which propelled it to success in terms of the self-defining metaphor of the tribal leader Asterix alone resisting the might of the Roman army (i.e. big competitors). The small company had a self-definition as embattled outsiders that they described using the metaphor ‘Indomitable Gauls’ which meant ‘audacious outsiders, the love of front-end technology, and the tolerance of ambiguity’. Rites of inauguration facilitate the transition to a new practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840611425735">Ashforth et al., 2000</xref>; Van Gennep, 1960). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0170840611425735">Schuyt and Schuijt (1998</xref>, p. 411) describe the inaugurating effect of the ‘psychological contract’ between the manager of his ‘liquid’ organization that was undergoing change and the management consultant: ‘the contract increases the pressure on the organization and, as every consultant knows, everything becomes liquid under pressure’.</p>
<p>Inauguration using metaphorical language will move into the background when questions gain acceptance about how that inaugural gesture will be operationalized. Performance reinforces motivation because of the self-efficacy effect. Self-efficacy arises from increments of mastery that increase confidence and energy levels. Scripted performance is even more motivating because complications requiring effortful decisions are avoided. Metaphor leads easily into metonymy because the metaphor contains the seeds of a recipe. For example, engineering metaphors envision operationalization through planning, design and construction whereas adaptive metaphors envision operationalization through exploring identity, evolutionary design, and experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0170840611425735">Sackmann, 1989</xref>, pp. 469–71). If an organization is portrayed as a bleeding patient then operationalization will contain a series of rapid actions, whereas if the organization is described as a growing garden then operationalization is more open-ended and slow-moving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840611425735">Armenakis et al., 1996</xref>). Rites of renewal facilitate transition from general ideas for change to specific recipes of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840611425735">Ashforth et al., 2000</xref>; Van Gennep, 1960). Examples include the management techniques for planning and structuring work such as setting targets and performance criteria. The existence of ritual also explains why metonymy may not actually achieve operationalization, but remain only a ritual. This may include going through the motions and placatory gestures to reassure rather than to produce action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840611425735">Edelman, 1966</xref>). Planning is often not followed by the realization envisaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840611425735">Gherardi, 1995</xref>, pp. 27–31; Levitt &amp; March, 1988, part IV).</p>
<p>When people begin asking questions about how to operationalize the change, how to make the change a reality, then they will seek acceptance for the change by creating metonymical rhetoric. We thus suggest that operationalization using metonymic language will move into the background when questions gain acceptance about how those actions will be standardized. Operationalization using metonymic language specifies actions based on conditional properties of general structures. Metonymy breaks down the whole into its component parts. For example, the reengineering metaphor breaks down into process analysis and design, streamlining, process ownership and process review. It therefore sets an essential stage for an inspirational new synecdochal vocabulary about how and when the idea can be standardized. Synecdoche has an unfortunate connotation of centrally directed propaganda. Even if high centralization is necessary, each source unit should have something to feel proud of. The more that synecdoches surface from co-orientation between units, the higher the motivation and energy levels of unit members. Therefore here also, performance reinforces motivation.</p>
<p>When managers studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0170840611425735">Zbaracki (1998)</xref> decided to go ahead with TQM and standardize across the company, the general operationalization structures of TQM (in particular, statistical analysis and technical design methods) moved into the background because they were abandoned in favour of positive success stories in company newsletters. The success stories were intended to be seen as capable of being scaled up and thus standardized across time and space. The success stories became synecdoches, that is, easy-to-remember, vivid, representative anecdotes. Rites of integration included a week’s training course, in which success stories featured prominently: ‘Managers reporting to the CEO at the hospital, in describing the primary benefit of a week of TQM training, dismissed the technical content and emphasized the power of hearing about the TQM successes of a comparable hospital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0170840611425735">Zbaracki, 1998</xref>, p. 615). These events were social rituals that acted as mechanisms that produced solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840611425735">Durkheim, 1912/2008</xref>) and thus facilitated the transition to standardization. They outlawed divergent systems and practices, and enacted dramas of social cohesiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840611425735">Ashforth et al., 2000</xref>; Van Gennep, 1960). They were a covert method of control by authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840611425735">Golding, 1996</xref>, p. 83).</p>
<p>We suggest that standardization using synecdoche will move into the background when questions gain acceptance about the ironic evaluation of that action. Synecdoche links part to whole and thus standardizes across time and space from one small pilot, example or experiment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0170840611425735">Zbaracki (1998)</xref> found that when a TQM programme was being standardized, an ironic reaction arose in response to it. This new ironic vocabulary reflected questions that contrasted between proposals (requiring funding) and actual lack of funding and that questioned the expected leadership by the CEO and board by calling attention to their lack of interest in participating in the process.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I wonder how committed the CEO is…He’s a fast mover, a quick problem solver. I have to wonder about the slow TQM problem solving process. Is this driving him crazy? He says he supports it, but if he says so, why isn’t he in a group? What about the board? Are they trained in it? Do they use it? It seems like it’s packaged and sold by [two of the vice presidents]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0170840611425735">Zbaracki, 1998</xref>, p. 619)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We can see the same ironic vocabulary expressed in another reaction in Zbaracki’s study regarding the cumbersome character of TQM: ‘An engineer for the defense contractor quipped, “If you used the TQM tools to decide to go to the restroom, you’d be leaking out the door”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0170840611425735">Zbaracki, 1998</xref>, p. 621). In order to facilitate the transition from a practice that is taken for granted to one that is suspected of being panned because of its flaws, rites of degradation or <italic>rites de separation</italic> are commonly used. These achieve detachment from the old meaning of the practice (van Gennep, 1960). They destroy prior meanings and thus facilitate the transition to destruction of the old role or practice and to calls for its replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840611425735">Ashforth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0170840611425735">Pratt, 2000</xref>). Examples include relabelling, reducing resources, and the scapegoating, humiliation and sacking of people. Part of the beneficial force of irony is because people feel cleansed of pent-up feelings of anger, dissatisfaction or disgust at poor results from grandiloquently worded mission statements. People will feel their reservations have been vindicated and thus will feel increased self-esteem and hence higher levels of energy for action.</p>
<p>We next argue that ironic evaluation of an institution will move into the background when questions about the inauguration of a new metaphor gain acceptance. In the regulatory arena of the Rio Declaration, the EU ironically argued that, instead of reducing uncertainty, science actually produced it. This destroyed the ‘sound science’ metaphor and thus enabled a new metaphor of precautionary regulatory action in the face of uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0170840611425735">Maguire &amp; Hardy, 2006</xref>). Evaluation of an institution by the use of irony represents claimed consequences of the institution as actual consequences in such a way that the claim is shown to be ludicrously false. Irony destroys faith in the institution by means of contrasting its promised success with its observed failure.</p>
<p>At the company studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611425735">Barker (1999</xref>, p. 55), the metaphor had been ‘reward system’: jobs were ‘very split up as far as responsibilities went…When you worked you were assigned to a particular station and someone tracked your work at that station.’ This had the ironic implication that even though the metaphor was reward system, the ‘big company’ approach meant that ‘you didn’t necessarily have an environment where you were rewarded for risk taking and responsiveness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611425735">Barker, 1999</xref>, p. 56). The new metaphor in response was that of ‘teamwork’, which promised to enrich and empower individual team members, but the ironic result was that the team member had ‘to be prepared to pay the price of teamwork’ in terms of individual subordination to group pressure and peer surveillance and where the ulterior motive was not to benefit the individual employee but was less noble because ‘They’re really just another company out to make money’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611425735">Barker, 1999</xref>, pp. 132–3). Moreover, despite the aspiration to do away with the previous ‘big company’ approach, the irony was that in the new state where people were supposed to be empowered by teamwork: ‘whenever something comes up we make a rule for it’. This led to the new inaugurating metaphor of ‘critic’: ‘the need to cultivate a continuing ability for the teams to criticize their own actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611425735">Barker, 1999</xref>, p. 159).</p>
<p>Deinstitutionalization also affects how people enact their roles and identities. In such cases, rites of degradation are key to understanding deinstitutionalization. Rites of degradation facilitate transitions such as changes in status. For example, they are used to strip dishonoured soldiers of their medals. Again, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840611425735">Gephart (1978</xref>, p. 576) observed the removal of an organizational leader the status degradation was accompanied by ‘common ritual statements’.</p>
<p>To illustrate further the processual and ritualistic unfolding and evolution of institutionalization as a tropological process, we will draw on the example of Jack Welch’s tenure at General Electric (GE).</p>

<title>Desired future with metaphor (1981–4)</title>
<p>A metaphor claims that something unfamiliar (e.g. a desired future) can be substituted for something familiar (one’s past). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611425735">Abetti (2006</xref>, p. 78) showed that during Welch’s leadership of GE, the company experienced a first wave of metaphoric inauguration (1981–4). The ‘lean and agile’ metaphor substituted the image of the (unfamiliar) athlete for that of the (familiar) large corporation. Although the ‘lean and agile’ metaphor was vague and unreal, Welch engaged in several ritual practices that crossed from unreal to real. The good part of the company was metaphorically represented in 1983 by three circles (core, technology and services) and units that were either first or second in their business were put in these good circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840611425735">Bower &amp; Dial, 1994</xref>, p. 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840611425735">Krames, 2005</xref>, p. 129; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0170840611425735">Slater, 1999</xref>, p. 63). The metaphorical meaning of a unit being outside the circles was that the unit was in danger from Welch’s ‘fix, close or sell’ imperative. There were frightening metaphors and rituals. The ritual of inauguration aimed to inspire but also to frighten. The three circles metaphor inspired some who were asked to ‘fix’ their unit, but frightened others that they would be closed or sold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840611425735">Bartlett &amp; Wozny, 2005</xref>, p. 2). Welch presented himself through the metaphors of ‘commander’ or ‘architect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611425735">Amernic, Craig &amp; Tourish, 2007</xref>, p. 1857), which were manifested through his actions of reorganization, mass dismissals, divestments and acquisitions and ‘employees being told what to do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611425735">Abetti, 2006</xref>, pp. 77, 80). Another Welch metaphor was being daring: ‘For me, the idea is, shun the incremental and go for the leap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840611425735">Bower &amp; Dial, 1994</xref>, p. 5). The frightening and daring nature of being ‘1st or 2nd or out’ was reinforced through repetition of a formula of verbal abuse in the company’s university where employees were ritually humiliated: ‘Some call it “Scrotumville”, for all the males who have been emasculated in places like “The Pit”, the 110-seat amphitheatre where Welch does his most forceful preaching’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0170840611425735">O’Boyle, 1998</xref>, p. 73). The frightening three circles metaphor was dramatized by ritual humiliation which dissociated current practice from language (new image).</p>

<title>Way of getting there with metonymy (1985–95)</title>
<p>A metonym breaks down a whole into its constituent parts. The vision of a ‘lean’ GE contained fragmentary meanings that were potential organizational mechanisms for realizing this vision. For example, one of the meanings of ‘lean’ was cutting layers of hierarchy. Welch claimed in 1988 that ‘We’re now down in some businesses to four [layers] from the top to the bottom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0170840611425735"><italic>Los Angeles Times</italic>, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611425735">Abetti (2006</xref>, p. 78) showed that during 1985–95 the meaning of a ‘lean’ GE gave way to a second wave of operationalization in which specific recipes for diagnosing and curing GE’s ills, reducing bureaucracy and motivating employees through tangible incentives were developed and ‘employees were told how to do their assignments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611425735">Abetti, 2006</xref>, p. 78). The ‘lean’ metaphor was interpreted through a ‘Welch personality cult’ that encouraged rituals of ‘mean’ and macho behaviour. These rituals included the 1986 ‘Casino Night’ conference that encouraged sexual harassment of junior female employees, as well as Welch’s 1991 public humiliation of the poorly performing CEO of GE Plastics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0170840611425735">O’Boyle, 1998</xref>, pp. 103–21). These rituals legitimized the metonymic message that any recipe is acceptable as long as it works, i.e. that the ends justified the means. The recipes were in the form of ‘formulas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611425735">Amernic et al., 2007</xref>, p. 1849) such as ‘work out’ meetings, performance evaluation using financial targets and six sigma quality programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840611425735">Elderkin &amp; Bartlett, 1993</xref>). They guided and instructed because they were concrete actions such as ‘remove an entire layer of top management structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611425735">Amernic et al., 2007</xref>, p. 1851), and ‘programme of liberation and empowerment’ (p. 1853). Such recipes aimed at simplifying strategy, strengthening the difference between winning and losing, and ritualizing buy-in. They were documented at the company’s university in the form of the ‘GE blue books’ or ‘catechism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-0170840611425735">Tichy, 1989</xref>, p. 100).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0170840611425735">
<title>Slogan with synecdoche (1996–2000)</title>
<p>Synecdoche made the part stand for the whole, as when the slogan ‘boundaryless’ stood for the complex set of routines Welch set up in order to avoid defensive parochialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840611425735">Elderkin &amp; Bartlett, 1993</xref>). Another synecdoche was the ritual shunning of certain values: ‘The headquarters staff were instructed not to use the word “loyalty” … Loyalty, tradition, convention – values Welch had little regard for – were deemed outmoded concepts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0170840611425735">O’Boyle, 1998</xref>, p. 75). This approach dramatized new synecdochal slogans. Because slogans are easy to communicate they diffuse easily and enable change to become standard across time and space. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611425735">Abetti (2006</xref>, p. 78) showed that there was a third wave, synecdochal in character, that involved standardization (1996–2000) in which a new GE culture was created using slogans and labels about values, culture and climate for Welch’s aim to ‘create new GE values, a new GE culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611425735">Abetti, 2006</xref>, p. 78). One of the new synecdoches was ‘edge’, which meant instinctive competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840611425735">Krames, 2005</xref>, pp. 75–93). Slogans advocated continual revolution. This had a standardizing effect because it ‘was an emotional climate that would transcend [Welch’s] personality as well as his strategic and organizational reforms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611425735">Abetti, 2006</xref>, p. 80). Jack Welch stood for GE, and his approach became that of GE. This had considerable power implications. It cloaked an appropriation of stakeholders’ interests by the CEO because ‘particular sectional interests are often universalized and treated as if they were everyone’s interests…The interests of organizations frequently are equated with management’s interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840611425735">Deetz, 2005</xref>, p. 96 cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611425735">Amernic et al., 2007</xref>, p. 1855). But then the synecdoche, via Welch’s self-publicity, became GE standing for all business interests.</p>

<title>Coming to our senses with irony (post-2001)</title>
<p>Irony contrasts the inspiring, potential ideal with the disappointing, actual reality. Contradiction is the main device. This process of criticism began just before Welch’s retirement in 2001 and led his successor to seek to distance himself from Welch’s legacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611425735">Amernic et al., 2007</xref>, p. 1851). During that time an attempted purchase of Honeywell failed and ‘Welch finally retired, having lost glory and credibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611425735">Abetti, 2006</xref>, p. 80). In 2002, after Welch’s retirement, the <italic>Economist</italic> stated that the ironic question now arose – was GE’s success merely a product of Welch’s rhetoric? Control of image making now passed to GE’s stakeholders, the press and the public. Criticism of Welch became de rigeur, predictable and repetitious, and the formula for this ritual involved ironic comparison of promise and reality. Ritual ‘testing’ of Welch and GE dramatized the irony. Irony contrasted ethical rightness with financial results at all costs: ‘[Welch’s] revolution had sanctioned a tyranny of numbers…led GE managers into some ethical lapses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0170840611425735">O’Boyle, 1998</xref>, p. 210). Irony contrasted real innovation with ‘gamesmanship’ under Welch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0170840611425735">O’Boyle, 1998</xref>, p. 237). Irony contrasted the espoused value of openness with greed when his huge, secret severance package finally came to light as his second wife sued for divorce. The Consumer Federation of America publicly expressed disappointment at the huge size of the retirement settlement. Welch was finally forced into the humiliation of announcing in the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> that he was repaying this package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0170840611425735">Welch, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although Welch had claimed to inspire, he was represented as relying increasingly on fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611425735">Abetti, 2006</xref>, pp. 79–80; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611425735">Amernic et al., 2007</xref>, p. 1841). Irony was used to contrast Welch’s claims to have alone caused GE’s success with the fact that GE had record growth prior to his becoming CEO. The <italic>Economist</italic> ridiculed him as an ‘ageing philanderer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611425735">Allio, 2003</xref>) and there was ridicule in <italic>Business Week</italic> over his affair with a prominent editor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840611425735">Collingwood &amp; Coutu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0170840611425735">Orecklen, 2002</xref>).

<title>Theory Implications</title>
<p>Our first theory contribution is to discuss the process of institutionalization in a new way. We also contribute insight toward an understanding of agency in institutions. The paper further addresses the question of why institutions are both material and symbolic.</p>
<p>We also extend existing theory on tropes in organizations, especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611425735">Green et al. (2010)</xref>, by suggesting that ritual explains how institutions are simultaneously language and practice. Our theory integrates both ritual and tropes into one account of movement through the trope sequence (crossing rituals) and between language and practice (association and dissociation rituals). We also see opportunities for resistance and counter-movement using sequence reversal and inversion of the role of tropes. Our theory adds to an understanding of agency and motivation in the institutionalization process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0170840611425735">
<title>Practice Implications</title>
<p>We see two key practice implications in our theory. First, what happens when members have no interest in moving forward to the next trope in the institutionalization process? We argue that if questions from the old, preceding trope gain acceptance or if questions for the succeeding trope are discarded, a new inaugurating metaphor will move into the foreground.</p>
<p>Second, what happens when members perceive renewed interest in a previous trope stage? An example would be when institutionalization is in the synecdochal stage, but members notice greater interest in the previous trope; for example, members are discussing standardization, but then interest switches back to metonymic procedures because the current procedures are imperfect. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0170840611425735">Zbaracki’s (1998)</xref> study of TQM implementation, the people he studied standardized the success stories across the whole organization but then in some cases people moved back to considering the procedures. This involved challenging and scrutinizing these procedures, particularly statistical control techniques, which were considered too onerous for managers, and dropping them from the implementation manual. The initial metaphor of TQM as a quasi-scientific method was replaced by a new metaphor of TQM as impervious to cynical attack (‘Teflon coated’) and thus as suitable for export to other departments as part of standardization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0170840611425735">Zbaracki, 1998</xref>, p. 614).</p>

<title>Future Research and Limitations</title>
<p>We now turn to a future research agenda. We have provided a linear conception of change that echoes prescriptive accounts, and we have suggested that one source of the greater complexity that has been found to exist in observed processes of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611425735">Amis, Slack &amp; Hinings, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840611425735">Greenwood &amp; Hinings, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840611425735">Hinings &amp; Greenwood, 1988</xref>) is resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840611425735">Greenwood &amp; Hinings, 1996</xref>). Future research should investigate the relationship between managerially authored tropes and tropes of resistance and should also focus on how other sources of complexity such as reversals, new beginnings and delays can be understood in terms of tropes. Is reversal sometimes more difficult because it involves contradiction or because it involves counter-sequence moves that are rhetorically unappealing? Are disruptions usually associated with irony or is irony itself able to be appropriated for control purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840611425735">Hatch, 1997</xref>)? Are disruptions associated with the inherent uncontrollability of metaphors due to the ambiguous interpretation of their figurative meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-0170840611425735">Tsoukas, 1991</xref>)?</p>
<p>A tropical view of institutions has implications for the study of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840611425735">Clegg, Courpasson &amp; Phillips, 2006</xref>). Does institutionalization provide an advantage to the powerful? Our theory suggests that this is not the case. We believe that in order for such a reinforcement of power the powerful would need to undermine their own ideas, because irony works on what the metaphor has promised. This gives some advantage to an opposing, resisting party. Does resistance use irony continuously throughout institutionalization processes as a kind of muted background music that sometimes grows loud? Our trope model suggests that resistance’s moment of greatest effectiveness comes when synecdoche is losing force (the slogan ‘communism for a better tomorrow’ is starting to look ridiculous when tomorrow is always worse than today). Would charisma be vulnerable to the erosion of authority that results from irony? What do formal position and rewards add to the rhetorical force of a trope and therefore what is the interdependence of material and rhetorical influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611425735">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>)? Also, if there are interests that both favour and resist change, does each trope get contested, or do different interests generate relatively independent and competing waves of tropical rhetoric that are discordantly out of synchrony with each other? Lastly, future research should explore the difference between constructively resisting metonymy to ensure ‘customised’ institutionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840611425735">Ansari et al., 2010</xref>) and a destructive use of irony. Does a flexible use of metonymic operationalization avoid deinstitutionalization and thus ensure longer-lasting institutions?</p>
<p>Institutionalization also happens in societies with high degrees of illiteracy and institutions diffuse across language barriers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0170840611425735">1</xref></sup> We believe this supports our insistence on keeping language and practice linked and of equal importance. Where there is illiteracy, repeated practice and ritual overcomes a lack of language-based theorization or reflection. Moreover, tropes are highly figurative, thus again avoiding the high literacy requirements of more logical argumentation.</p>
<p>We have shown how to motivate people to engage in the institutionalization process and how they can increase their agency in challenging and resisting institutionalization. Previous rhetorical literature on the institutionalization process gives no account of what happens with blocked institutionalization when it is impossible for institutionalization to move forward. Our paper addresses this problem because we suggest not only that tropes have an inner force as in, say, a metaphor moving us, but also that tropes have a persuasive force because of the predictability and inevitability of the forward momentum of the trope sequence. An analogous argument has been made about the way that fairytales, with their predictable types of character and plot, act as a ‘ritualized sequence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0170840611425735">Monin &amp; Monin, 2005</xref>) and so become ‘codified, authoritative, and canonical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0170840611425735">Propp, 1968</xref>, p. 21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr167-0170840611425735">Zipes, 1994</xref>, p. 4). The process of change then becomes normalized, so that movement in a predictable direction, or ‘change momentum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840611425735">Jansen, 2004</xref>) seems natural and desirable. Moreover, people in organizations expect that time will be rhythmically sequenced as ‘temporal structures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0170840611425735">Orlikowski &amp; Yates, 2002</xref>) in a meaningful way. Knowing where one is in any process of institutionalization provides cues about what constitutes appropriate conduct, thus reinforcing the normative pillar of institutions. What behaviour will be judged to be appropriate will vary depending on the stage in the sequence.</p>
<p>This theory contains some limitations. First, we do not consider the cases where institutionalization is either only material (e.g. acceptance of powerful forces such as military invasion or legal enforcement) or only figurative (e.g. an intellectual fashion). Second, we do not consider those cases where institutionalization is inspired by a charismatic leader or achieved by logical argumentation, nor do we consider the interplay between these ethos/logos elements and tropes. We thus acknowledge that in some cases tropes may not always be appropriate or effective means of institutionalization.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper addresses the lack of a theory that properly integrates both linguistic and practice elements of the institutionalization process. This paper shows how language and material practices co-evolve during institutionalization through an interplay of tropes and ritual. The theory is a four-stage model of institutionalization: the trope of metaphor is dramatized in the inauguration ritual; the trope of metonymy is dramatized in the ritual of operationalization; the trope of synecdoche is dramatized in the ritual of standardization; and the trope of irony is dramatized in the ritual of status degradation. We explain the role of human agency by means of showing how different dimensions of agency are enacted by each trope and why people are motivated to move through the trope sequence. We suggest that several resistance strategies exist including sequence reversal and inversion of the role of tropes. The theory uses both ritual and tropes to provide an integrated explanation of movement through the trope sequence by means of crossing rituals and movement between language and practice by means of association and dissociation rituals.</p>
