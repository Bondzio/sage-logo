<p>Based on the self-accounts of children-in-conflict-with-law (CCL) in Indian-held Kashmir (IHK), this article attempts to understand the psychosocial issues of children in conflict zones. The issues of torture and imprisonment are extremely serious concerns of children experiencing an armed conflict. This article studies the lived experiences of Kashmiri children and analyses their self-accounts through an interpretative phenomenological frame. This qualitative investigation explores the meanings and interpretations that the CCL attach to their experiences of torture and incarceration. The exposure to such adversity chronically endangers their social, economic, psychological and physical well-being.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Since the late 1980s, a low-intensity armed conflict has been active in a South Asian territory – Kashmir, having its borders with India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and China. Kashmir continues to be a disputed territory between India and Pakistan, as both have been claiming the region since their independence from colonial rule. The two countries continue to occupy different proportions of the region on either side. However, in 1989 an armed struggle demanding independence from India started in Indian-held Kashmir (hereafter ‘Kashmir’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812447640">Rai, 2004</xref>). The conflict has resulted in huge loss of human lives, disability due to injuries, mental disorders and destruction of social and economic infrastructure. It has greatly affected public services such as health, education and nutrition. Within all these pervasive issues, ensuing uncertainty and public insecurity, the local populations are experiencing immense suffering and pain. The present article deals with the conflict-related issues of children and young people in Kashmir. It focuses on their narratives of torture and incarceration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Children in war-affected regions or armed-conflict zones get exposed to myriad vulnerabilities, threats and impairments, endangering their health and well-being. War is often characterized by the loss of security, unpredictability and lack of structure of daily life. The developmental initiatives get dwarfed, welfare activities collapse, and educational and health institutions fail to cater to the developmental needs and special demands of children of conflict. In conflict-torn regions children are the worst sufferers, directly or indirectly, bearing the brunt from all sides – physical, social, educational and psychological. Children are deprived of liberty; killed or orphaned; become targets of armed-groups; many are detained for months together; face torture and degrading treatment at the hands of counter-insurgent agencies and bear the system’s apathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872812447640">ACHR, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812447640">Hussain, 2002</xref>). In this scenario, the children-in-conflict-with-law (CCL) in Kashmir find themselves on the receiving end. The CCL are the children under 18 years of age, detained, arrested, tortured, presented before courts of law or lodged in jails for their involvement in ‘militancy-related’ or ‘anti-national activities’. The deliberate victimizing and dehumanizing treatment of children by security agencies has different underlying motives. The torture and imprisonment of children is used as a political weapon by security agencies to create an atmosphere of terror and collective fear-psychosis among people and consequently weaken the ongoing liberation movement of Kashmiri people. Moreover, the suffering of children worsens in the absence of a functional justice system. When the CCL in Kashmir encounter the justice structure, torture, degrading treatment and incarceration beset them. The flawed Juvenile Justice Act of 1986, which has been replaced in other States of India with The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, still remains unchanged in Kashmir. Though the government in Kashmir has been quick to bring and enact draconian laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), Disturbed Areas Act (DDA) and Public Safety Act (PSA) into Kashmir, it has no concern for juvenile justice or legal protection of CCL. The security agencies in the shade of these draconian acts illegally detain, torture and exploitatively neglect all the standards of juvenile justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812447640">ACHR, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872812447640"><italic>Greater Kashmir</italic>, 2008–2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812447640">Rashid, 2009</xref>). The recent report released by Asian Centre for Human Rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812447640">ACHR, 2011</xref>) highlights the misuse of the laws like PSA by security agencies against children in Kashmir. Minors are illegally detained under the PSA that provides for up to two years of preventive detention. The various advocacy groups and rights agencies, including India’s Ministry of Women and Child Development, have recommended for upgrading of the juvenile justice system in Kashmir, but all these recommendations have been overridden and suppressed by the Indian rhetoric of national interest and security.</p>
<p>The CCL in Kashmir are exposed to engulfing vulnerabilities and threats in relation to health and education, having physical, social, behavioral and psychological repercussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872812447640">Asad, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872812447640">Gerrity et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812447640">Hussain, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812447640">Rashid, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>The study</title>
<p>During the past two decades in Kashmir, there has been an increase in the number of juveniles being detained and tortured on allegations of militant links and insurgent and anti-national activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812447640">ACHR, 2011</xref>; <italic>Greater Kashmir</italic>, 5 March 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812447640">Rashid, 2009</xref>). Though the literature on the subject of torture and incarceration is emerging, it is nonetheless scarce. More so, there has been a scarcity of qualitative investigation into the lives of the torture survivors and incarcerated persons, and in the case of incarcerated and tortured children, this scarcity is quite chronic. The study on which the present article is based is an attempt to explore qualitatively the issues of children who have confronted extreme forms of conflict-related adversities such as torture, inhuman treatment and incarceration. The study is based in Kashmir. Overall, 43 children/juveniles (39 males and 4 females) who had faced torture or had been detained/imprisoned by security forces participated in the study. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872812447640">Paton et al., 2009</xref>) was employed to study and interpret the interviews of the victims of torture and incarceration. The IPA approach focuses more on the meanings that the subjects attach to any event or phenomenon related to their lives. In case of this study, the lived experiences of the child-victims of torture and inhuman treatment were documented.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The region of Kashmir (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020872812447640">Figure 1</xref>) is a disputed territory jointly occupied by India (60%), Pakistan (30%) and China (10%). This qualitative and exploratory study was carried out in Indian-held Kashmir (IHK) in the highly-affected areas with relation to conflict and insurgency. According to the census of 2011, the total population of IHK is 12–13 million. The study was conducted over six months in 2009–10. Prisons in Kashmir, that is, district jails and the Central Jail in Srinagar were the main locations of the research. In total, 43 CCL (39 boys and four girls) participated in the study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020872812447640">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The families of CCL were in the focus of the research too. The interviews were conducted both in the prisons and at the residences of the respondents. For interviews in the prisons, no permission was sought from the concerned jail authorities because the researcher was apprehensive of the fact that the authorities would deny such activity in jails. Instead, the researcher separately met the respondents in meeting halls of the prisons, to which the relatives of the respondents would often facilitate the researcher’s access. Except for nine cases, the researcher visited the houses of all the respondents for in-depth interviews and interaction with the family members. A conducive and confidential atmosphere was ensured for interviews and due care was taken not to re-traumatize the respondents.</p>

<title>Major findings</title>
<p>A general trend prevails when we assess the cycle of exposure of CCL to the justice system or security agencies in Kashmir. A juvenile involved in or alleged to be involved in militant-related activities is dealt with ‘no differently’ from those of adult offenders, violating, abusing and neglecting not only the standards of juvenile justice, but also ignoring the universal human rights and the criminal-procedural rights of convicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812447640">ACHR, 2011</xref>). The CCL at no stage of their conviction are considered ‘minors or juveniles’ by the agencies like police and counter-insurgent forces. In fact, CCL are tried in normal courts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812447640">ACHR, 2011</xref>). The approach of these agencies in dealing with CCL is extremely punitive and degrading. It starts with sudden nocturnal raids and arrests and physical and mental torture; goes through stigmatizing and lengthy trials; and often ends with incarceration and imprisonment. Imprisonment generally ranges from 4 to 24 months. The lived-experiences of the children in interrogation and torture centres, security camps, police stations and prisons points to the inadequacy and incompetence of the juvenile justice systems in Kashmir.</p>
<sec id="section6-0020872812447640">
<title>Torture, degrading treatment and incarceration of children</title>
<p>The cases of the CCL studied brought to the surface the victimization and exploitation these juveniles are subjected to. The course or stages of the degrading treatment are almost the same, with a similar <italic>modus operandi</italic>, be it torture techniques, interrogation methods or physical or mental harassment. There was a deadly monotony in the narratives of the CCL covered in the study. With due regard and respect to their individual experiences, the present section discusses only five representative case studies, which ‘symbolize or represent’ the issues and suffering of all the 43 CCL, and which fortifies the argument that little was unique in their stories.</p>
<sec id="section7-0020872812447640">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>One of the child prisoners, Sajad (all the names and locations have been changed to ensure confidentiality), aged 16, narrates:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was arrested in April 2005 by the Special Task Force [STF: Police] and detained for 14 days in the camp. I was continuously tortured for seven days . . . my private parts were given electric shocks . . ., limbs were forcefully stretched. I was kept naked throughout . . . during nights they would blindfold my eyes and take me in night raids and operations, and give an impression that they would kill me in a fake encounter. I many times lost my consciousness . . ., it was horrible! . . . my health deteriorated . . . And due to the electric shocks I had an intense pain in abdomen and around . . .! I pass blood with urine . . . I lost many things . . .!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After the torture, he was shifted to different camps and ultimately to the local police station, where he was booked for criminal offences. After his conviction, Sajad spent two months in the Srinagar Central Jail, and thereafter shifted to the Katua Jail (a notorious jail in the Hindu-dominated Jammu region), where he was detained for a year (in 2006). He recollects:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was the youngest of all the 150 inmates of Katua Jail, where I spent almost a year. . . . I shared the room [barrack] with other nine inmates, all adults involved in criminal cases. It was too horrible and traumatic! Frequently I was made to clean the toilets; prepare food and do other laborious work in the jail. The quality and quantity of food was too poor. There was an intense space-deficit and congestion; with no open field . . . one would feel choked! At around evening we were locked inside our barracks. It was like a torture cell, a hell!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sajad’s stay in Katua Jail during the year 2006 exposed him to various stressful experiences and dangers, being prone to physical, sexual and emotional abuse and exploitation. He lived a life of fear, insecurity and victimization in the Katua Jail. After his release from the Katua Jail, he was taken back to Srinagar Central Jail for 19 days, and again sent to an Interrogation Centre for 11 days, and this completed his almost two-year long traumatic imprisonment in 2007. Consequently, his health worsened and he could not continue his education. He developed serious kidney and reproductive health complications as a result of the electric shocks and beatings in the custody. His uncle narrates:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . it has been a tragedy! We have lost a son; his life has been ruined . . . his health is our major concern now.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The case is just one example among hundreds of children and families that go through the same traumatic circumstances and tragic experiences. The case epitomizes the victimization – social, psychological, emotional and educational – which countless children in Kashmir are subjected to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872812447640">ACHR, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812447640">Amin and Rashid, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812447640">Rashid, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0020872812447640">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>In 2006, 13-year-old Asif Ali was sleeping in his room, when around the middle of the night a police party raided his house. All the members of the family were in shock. He was bundled in a vehicle and taken to SOG (Special Operation Group, a counter-insurgency police unit) camp; thus started his ordeal of interrogation, torture and abuse. He was booked for ‘grave offences’. The next day he was shifted to Cargo interrogation centre, where he had to face the worst and horrible hours of pain and agony at the hands of police. Much like Sajad (Case 1), his private parts were given electric shocks, his limbs were stretched, he was kept naked and hanged to a ceiling by tying his arms backwards and he was beaten ruthlessly throughout. Above all, what Asif couldn’t bear was the threat that they (police) would kill his mother if he declined to confess his guilt before the media. Ultimately, he did so before the media and before the court as well, and was lodged in Srinagar Central jail for almost 26 months. In 2008 Asif was released on bail after a lengthy judicial trial.</p>
<p>Recalling his initial experiences of torture in custody, Asif narrates:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was ordered to take off all the clothes. The situation was such that you are caught in helplessness. You know you can’t escape; you can’t hide; you have to give-in! I was beaten . . . my front-tooth was broken. They stretched my legs . . . interrogated and tortured me continuously for 5–6 hours during the night. My body was writhing in pain . . . I was in shock . . . many a times I would feel happy in my own self that ‘I was dead’ . . . meaning no more torture and pain! But when I would try to move my body, see here and there and feel the body-pain, I could realize the reality . . . I was again thrown in the abyss of pain, agony and despair! . . . Thereafter I came to know of new forms of torture. In the morning my arms were tied backwards and I was kept hanged . . . hardly I could withstand and bear it for a minute. I felt as if my arms have been separated from my body . . . it was excessively painful . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The interrogation and torture that 13-year-old Asif was subjected to bear testimony to how the security and counter-insurgent agencies relish and enjoy impunity under various draconian laws (AFSPA, PSA, DAA, etc.) that encourage them to act in contravention of international and national standards of human rights, not to speak of juvenile justice standards.</p>
<p>Asif continues:
<disp-quote>
<p>After 1–2 hours, I was taken to Cargo Interrogation Centre where my private parts were given electric shocks . . . this was the most dreadful and soul-shocking torture. My private parts and thumb of foot were connected with an electric circuit powered by a manual dynamo. When the dynamo was made to move, strong electric-currents shook my abdomen and . . . they would pour water to intensify the pain. I felt it in my spine, kidneys and whole abdomen! It was horrible; dreadful! It is the torture that not only pains your body, but sullies your mind and soul too . . . thereafter, I was shifted to the local police station . . . and my 30 day stay there was further traumatic and agonizing. I could hardly pass urine because of the intense pain in the kidneys, back and urinary tract. It was unbearable . . . even today when I get reminded of those torturous experiences I have difficulty in passing urine.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His two-year imprisonment in Central Jail has transformed Asif and many aspects of his life. His personality and perceptions have witnessed a sharp change. Naturally, having experienced horrible and traumatic experiences at this tender age of life, he has developed a coping mechanism in the form of a strong religious devotion. His family environment has been altered too. Both he and his family give deeper meaning to their suffering and pain, which go beyond the normative notions of grief and sorrow. Asif’s return to the family has brought with it a different, more powerful and expressive position and status for him in his family and neighbourhood. He has become the centre-point in the family and seen as a ‘matured’ human being. He is consulted in all the matters of the family and takes decisions. ‘Religion’ dominates his narratives, through which he rationalizes his pain and agony. The ‘changed’ Asif remarks:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have changed; my family has changed. Before imprisonment I was off-track, not knowing why God created me; not realizing the Truth hidden behind tragedies, happiness . . . ups and downs of life. I came to know what the world is all about. I feel enough lucky that I spent more than two years in jail. I have been transformed. Though no one could deny the torture, sufferings and agony I was subjected to. But everything ends and it has to! . . . at the end of the day I have won! What I learnt and experienced in two years in jail, would have taken decades otherwise. I came to know my religion! It came to my rescue, when nobody understood my agony. I embraced it when the tyrants were hell-bent to make me suffer!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The exposure to adversity in the form of torture and incarceration has enhanced Asif’s position, personal power, agency and resilience (for detailed discussion on these arguments, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812447640">Boyden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872812447640">James and Prout, 1997</xref>). The case-account of Asif thus brings to the surface the impact of torture and incarceration on a juvenile’s personality. Exposure to the worst forms of trauma and torture not only has physical implications, but impacts mental patterns and dispositions too.</p>
<p>Besides trauma and agony, the families of the CCL incur huge economic losses due to lengthy court trials. But the post-imprisonment well-being and health of the CCL figure empathically in the narratives of their families. The mother of Asif remarks:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have got back my missing body-part [referring to her son]. Asif was both arrested and released on Fridays . . . now on every Friday I feel very happy and joyous. I have asked my son that we would celebrate his ‘release day’ every year. It is my new Eid [festival] . . . Zalims [tyrants; referring to police] have tortured him . . . he needs care.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His elder brother is worried about his health. He says:
<disp-quote>
<p>He often complains of severe pain in abdomen . . . as a result of electric shocks to his private parts. He is on a medical treatment . . . but we can’t discuss this with the females in the house . . . it is very sensitive. We are broken inside.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<p>Another CCL, 15-year-old Rayees, was arrested by a team of a local STF (police) camp and kept in custody for 10 days, and sent to Central Jail for two years. He was convicted on the grounds of assisting militants, facilitating weapon delivery and linking youth with the insurgent organizations. As is the case with all those arrested in militancy-related cases, he was subjected to severe interrogation and torture in police custody. His family alleged that the security agencies demanded 50,000 rupees to drop the allegations and ‘hush-up’ the case. The inability of the family to pay the ‘ransom’ resulted in Rayees’s prolonged imprisonment. He narrates:
<disp-quote>
<p>A wave of shock runs my spine whenever I think of it. When I get reminded of that torture and those frightening nights, I find myself shattered . . . my hunger dies, my sleep disappears; even if I fall sleep nightmares haunt me! I was associated with insurgents . . . it was an adventure . . . I had never thought I would be arrested. I had not imagined that my family could face such an ordeal. It was my entire fault . . .! During my detention and torture in the camp, whenever I was reminded of my parents, I felt, as if, a mountain collapsed on me . . . unbearable it was! My family was mentally tortured!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rayees was ‘motivated and lured’ by a local militant to facilitate and assist insurgents in the area. In his innocence and tender age, he couldn’t resist the adventure of handling weapons – grenades, pistols, etc. This adventure landed him in prison. When asked about the motivation to assist and associate himself with insurgents, he strangely replied:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know what motivated me . . . handling arms, talking to insurgents on phone and meeting them, seemed to be an adventure! I would take pride in it. I had thought that I was the luckiest of my friends.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A student of brilliant academic record, Rayees’s career seemed to shatter. But thanks to his determination and courage, he continued his education in jail despite all the odds. After 18 months of imprisonment, he took his high school examination and passed with grade A. Besides all the positive things, he has feelings of guilt. He regards himself responsible for his parents’ ordeal. He says:
<disp-quote>
<p>My father is illiterate, but he had a dream of me studying and becoming an ‘officer’! He was shattered with my imprisonment; . . . he developed, thereafter, many health complications. After my release he has never talked to me like that, . . . it really pains me! Now I will work hard and compensate, so that I could fulfil my father’s dream.</p>

<title>Case 4</title>
<p>In Kashmir, there have been many instances of young girls being detained, tortured and harassed by the security agencies. In 2007, a girl from rural South Kashmir, Rosy (15), and her mother (40) were illegally detained by police/SOG on the allegation of ‘feeding and giving shelter’ to militants. The duo were detained in the local SOG camp for several days. They were beaten, mentally tortured and abused by SOG personnel. After protests and demonstrations by the people of the village, the mother and daughter were released. They both were in intense shock and trauma. Rosy’s elder brother narrates:
<disp-quote>
<p>My sister was mentally agonized to the extent that she thereafter refused to live at home and ultimately migrated to her maternal home and also changed her school from which she dropped out soon after. For months she was haunted by fears of detention and torture.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The researcher during his visit to Rosy’s relatives (maternal home) was advised/cautioned by them not to talk about the incident directly while interviewing the girl-victim because its mention may re-traumatize her. The interview with Rosy was conducted 16 months after the incident and utmost care was taken not to touch on sensitive issues. The questions asked pertained to her routine activities and interests. She responds:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . I generally remain indoors and do embroidery work (on shawls for commercial use) . . . and have very few friends here. I feel it is very unsafe for girls to do work outside or go to school . . . <italic>Halaat</italic> [circumstances] in Kashmir are not favourable. . . . Education is essential, but not in our place where fear and insecurity are everywhere.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rosy represents hundreds of children, especially girls, who leave education mid-way because of the prevailing uncertainty and insecurity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812447640">Amin and Rashid (2010)</xref> have reported that scores of young girls in Shopian (in South Kashmir) dropped out of school when in 2009 two girls were found raped and murdered by security agencies in the area. The situation worsens in the want of legal or referral or a support system for children that could have somewhat alleviated their suffering and pain and addressed the sensitive issues.</p>

<title>Case 5</title>
<p>Among the CCL studied in this research, Mudasir is one more of those ill-fated children who suffered at the hands of the counter-insurgency agencies. He was 16 at the time of arrest. Narrating his story, Mudasir recollects:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was frightened . . . it was like a nightmare! As their vehicle stopped, I was dragged out of it and taken to a dark room . . . I was brutally tortured for hours together by iron-rods, rollers and hung to ceiling . . . until I fell unconscious. Intense electric shocks were given to my private parts. A copper-wire with an intermitted current was inserted into my private organ. I don’t know what happened thereafter! When I regained my senses, I had an intense pain in abdomen and kidneys . . . there was profuse bleeding with urine. It was a shock of my life!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The CCL, besides being physically tortured, are traumatized through ‘threats’ to their families, abuse of their close ones in front of them and exploitation in whatever ways police choose. He points out:
<disp-quote>
<p>During my detention I came to know about the ordeal and mental torture my family was subjected to while searching for me from one camp to another. The security agencies had demanded 60,000 rupees for my release.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He is undergoing treatment for the urinary tract and reproductive complications. He has been complaining of psychological distress and anxiety.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The literature suggests that children are more prone to mental health problems than adults when they confront the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872812447640">Desai, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812447640">Hagell, 2001</xref>). Moreover, several factors may account for the social and economic consequences of their exposure to torture and imprisonment. Loss of social and occupational status and opportunities because of prolonged imprisonment exacerbate social and economic difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812447640">Rashid, 2009</xref>). It causes significant social disability, irritability and rage-reactions that impair interpersonal relations. Marital and family problems occur because of the inability to feel intimacy or re-establish trust. Capacity for learning decreases. Symptoms of impulsiveness may lead to problems with the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872812447640">Gerrity et al., 1999</xref>). The fact of being detained with adults or other ‘criminals’, the chances of having ‘criminal contamination’ and ‘career escalation’ or ‘offence specialization’ in juvenile offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812447640">Erickson, 1979</xref>) cannot be ruled out, although some self-accounts of juveniles give a high positive regard to the ‘religious and spiritual knowledge’ they were exposed to during their imprisonment. It dissolved their psychological stress and alienation by giving meaning and worth to their experiences. However, the point of the focus is that the adverse and traumatic events such as witnessing dead bodies, killings and bomb blasts and being subjected to torture, incarceration and injuries in conflict zones drastically moulds and shapes perceptions and personality of children. Interestingly, the emerging global literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812447640">Boyden, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872812447640">Hart and Tyrer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872812447640">James and Prout, 1997</xref>) on the subject discusses how children perceive, analyse and make sense of the adverse circumstances around them. When exposed to adversity how do they make use of their agency and resourcefulness in developing new forms and means of coping and managing that adversity?</p>
<p>The present article, by documenting the lived experiences of the five (representative) incarcerated and tortured children, brings out many hard realities to the forefront, depicting the plight of the CCL when encountering the criminal justice system in Kashmir. Torture, such as electric shocks to private parts, has rendered many sexually impotent and unable to marry or continue their life smoothly. The physical and psychological disorders developed during detention and torture eats into their social health and fitness. There was a high prevalence of respiratory infections, kidney malfunctions and visual disorders among the CCL. The prominent symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD), depression, insomnia and irritability were alarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812447640">Amin and Rashid, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872812447640">Das, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812447640">Hussain, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447640">Margoob and Dutta, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872812447640">Sonpar, 2007</xref>). The ill-awareness of the CCL and their families of these physical and mental complexities exacerbates the issue. Moreover, many leave their education and face extreme economic hardships and dwindling life-prospects. Though the present study did not directly focus on the health outcomes of torture and incarceration, it nonetheless explored similar forms of physical and mental health disorders as found in children exposed to traumatic experiences in other conflict zones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020872812447640">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0020872812447640">4</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The redundant and unrelated 1997 JJ Act applicable to Kashmir is inconsiderately silent on the special needs and concerns of Kashmiri children experiencing armed conflict. Moreover, the dysfunctional juvenile justice infrastructure, that is, the non-availability of juvenile courts, juvenile homes, reformatory schools or welfare boards or committees, makes it hard to conceptualize or develop a social work intervention or rehabilitation program that could enhance coping and recovery of CCL and alleviate their suffering. The CCL are detained in adult prisons or security camps, which are generally inaccessible to a social worker or a researcher. Also, such incidents are not uncommon where social workers or researchers themselves have to bear the brunt of intelligence or security agencies and where the fear of deadly reprisal impedes initiation of any professional activity. These arguments in no way deny the scope of a social work intervention, but they do empathically show that fierce advocacy and activism is imperative in seeking a massive legal revamping of juvenile justice legislation in Kashmir. This revamping needs to protect and safeguard rights of CCL and prevent abuse of children, clear the way for the rehabilitation of child-torture survivors or prisoners and provide a conducive atmosphere for professional activity with respect to children.</p>
