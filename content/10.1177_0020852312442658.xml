<abstract>
<p>The United Kingdom (UK) instituted a performance framework for the National Health Service (NHS) in the late 1990s that, inspired by the New Public Management (NPM), employed performance measurement and management in an effort to improve the quality of health services to citizens, in addition to realizing efficiency goals. Using data from the 1996 and 2002 Eurobarometer and a difference in differences analytical approach, we evaluate the impacts of these performance reforms by comparing the UK to other European Union countries in terms of overall citizen satisfaction with the health care system and perceptions of how well the health care system performs. In general, our results suggest that citizen satisfaction and performance perceptions in the UK were more favorable after the reforms than what would have occurred, absent the implementation of the reforms. The estimated improvement in satisfaction and perceived performance is both statistically and substantively significant, and thus provides evidence that the UK’s NPM-inspired performance framework did accomplish at least some of its goals.</p>

<p>In the late 1990s, the United Kingdom instituted a performance framework for its National Health Service (NHS) that, in addition to having the perennial efficiency and cost-saving goals, employed a New Public Management strategy to improve the quality of health care and the experiences of system users. Indeed, these reforms have been viewed as a prime example of the performance measurement and management movement in public administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020852312442658">Pollitt and Bouckart, 2004</xref>). Using data from the 1996 and 2002 Eurobarometer, we attempt to evaluate the impacts of these performance reforms by comparing the UK to other European Union countries in terms of overall citizen satisfaction with the health care system and perceptions of how well the health care system performs. To preview our results, we find that citizen satisfaction and performance perceptions in the UK were generally more favorable after the reforms than what would have been the case, absent the implementation of the reforms. The estimated improvement in satisfaction and perceived performance is both statistically and substantively significant, and thus provides evidence that the UK’s performance framework accomplished at least some of its goals.</p>
<p>While there have been philosophical debates about the strengths and weaknesses of New Public Management reforms, empirical studies can better inform researchers, policymakers, and practitioners about which features of these reforms may influence different types of outcomes. Our results suggest that the quality and customer-focused aspects of New Public Management that were applied through the UK’s health system reforms seem to have worked in this case. Policymakers’ and practitioners’ efforts to measure, report, and improve quality may have noticeable effects on citizens’ attitudes.</p>
<p>This study proceeds as follows. The next section provides an overview of the study’s context and research question, with a focus on the UK’s National Health Service and especially the late 1990s performance-oriented reforms inspired by the New Public Management. The following section details the study’s data and methods. The results are presented next, including sensitivity analyses using different groups of comparison countries. The final section concludes with a discussion of the findings and policy implications.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0020852312442658"><title>Context and research question</title>
<p>The UK national health system was founded in 1948, following the Second World War, and is financed largely through government taxation. Services are free at the point of use, except for prescriptions, optical and dental care. Though services are financed publicly, health care is delivered through both public and private hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852312442658">Emmerson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852312442658">Green and Irvine 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312442658">Leichter 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020852312442658">Robinson and Dixon 1999</xref>). Like the UK, some other European welfare states (Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Sweden) are financed through public taxation with some supplementary private voluntary insurance and direct payments. Denmark and Portugal are tax-financed with some direct payments, but no private voluntary insurance. Of these countries, the UK, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, and Sweden are classified by the World Health Organizaition (WHO) as well-established tax-financed systems, while the others implemented public funding of health care later as a reform or in stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852312442658">Saltman and Figueras, 1997</xref>). In contrast, health systems in countries such as Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, and Luxembourg are financed through a system of compulsory social insurance, with supplemental funds coming from public taxation, private voluntary insurance, and direct payments. The Netherlands has a more mixed system, with health care financed primarily through compulsory social insurance and private voluntary insurance, augmented by public taxation and direct payments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852312442658">Directorate General for Research, 1998</xref>). These different classifications of health care systems form the basis, in part, for the countries chosen for comparison in our study.</p>
<p>In the UK, throughout the Conservative administrations of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Prime Minister John Major, health reforms focused on creating a competitive ‘internal market’ for health care in order to improve efficiency. In 1991, the government denied the need for monitoring the results of health sector reforms and refused evaluation assistance from outside academics or others. This stance gradually shifted as the lack of evidence of effectiveness became politically problematic. Although some outcomes targets were set during this time, the real shift toward measuring performance came during the next administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312442658">Oliver, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020852312442658">Robinson and Dixon, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>When Tony Blair and the Labour Party came into power in 1997, the emphasis shifted away from privatization and toward quality and performance. Health care became one of the top domestic priorities, making it a relevant sector to evaluate during this time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020852312442658">Pollitt and Bouckaert, 2004</xref>). A White Paper, <italic>The New NHS: Modern. Dependable</italic>, provided an overview of the reforms, which included the creation of two new entities: the National Institute for Clinical Effectiveness, which sets performance standards, and the Council for Health Improvements, responsible for enforcing them. A new Commission for Health Improvement was established to support and oversee the quality of clinical services at the local level, and to tackle shortcomings (NHS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852312442658">Executive, 1997</xref>, Section 3). Thirty-seven performance indicators were developed in six areas of performance: health improvement, fair access, effective delivery of appropriate health care, efficiency, patient/carer experience, and health outcomes of NHS care. In the area of patient/carer experience, the government aimed to measure the way in which patients and carers viewed the quality of treatment, in part through a new national patient survey. One of the six key principles of the New NHS was ‘to shift the focus onto quality of care so that excellence is guaranteed to all patients, and quality becomes the driving force for decision-making at every level of the service’ (NHS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852312442658">Executive, 1997</xref>, Section 2). Contrasting the reforms with those under the Conservative Government, the White Paper reads, ‘Under the internal market, NHS Trusts’ principal statutory duties were financial. The Government will bring forward legislation to give them a new duty for the quality of care’ (Section 6). The creation of these entities, the development of performance indicators, and the emphasis on patient experience suggest that improved performance, quality and user satisfaction were goals of the reform and pertinent outcome measures for our study.</p>
<p>As various public management scholars have noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020852312442658">Pollitt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020852312442658">Walshe, 2002</xref>), these UK reforms represent an important example of the New Public Management movement within the public sector and its emphasis on performance measurement and management to improve the delivery of public services. Although much has been written about the guiding assumptions and implementation challenges of this performance movement in public management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852312442658">Heinrich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312442658">Radin, 2006</xref>), less attention has been paid to empirically evaluating the actual impacts of specific performance initiatives on the perceptions of public services, especially on a large-scale such as the UK’s National Health Service. The evaluations that have been done have tended to focus more on output and efficiency measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852312442658">Wollman, 2003</xref>). Few prior studies have tried to evaluate a large-scale, New Public Management-inspired performance initiative in terms of its impacts on the satisfaction of citizens with the performance of public services (an exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852312442658">Rieder and Lehmann, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Citizen satisfaction, moreover, is a germane outcome to consider when evaluating the impact of a New Public Management, performance-oriented reform like the one tried in the UK. From its beginnings, the performance movement in public administration has called for a renewed focus on customer service and citizen satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312442658">Barzeley, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852312442658">Kettl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020852312442658">Osborne and Gabler, 1992</xref>). Books by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020852312442658">Osborne and Gaebler (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312442658">Barzeley (1992)</xref> proposed strategies for making public organizations more customer focused. This call for a customer orientation in the public sector was subsequently picked up in the US by Vice President Gore’s National Performance Review (Gore, 1993), which began in 1993. As Kettl observes of this period in his review of New Public Management reforms worldwide (2005: 51): ‘The concept of improving government’s service to citizens – and using this strategy to transform bureaucracy – has been one of the most robust features of reform.’ Indeed, the UK’s health reforms of the time were an important example of this trend.</p>
<p>There are several ways in which emphasizing performance measurement in the health care system may lead to greater citizen satisfaction. To begin with, health care providers may have incentives to improve the quality of care, knowing that their performance will be measured and reported. This increase in quality may in turn lead to an improvement in citizen satisfaction with the health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312442658">Berwick et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852312442658">Bevan and Hood (2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020852312442658">2006b)</xref> discuss how measuring performance in the NHS may have led to actual improvements in waiting times, one important performance measure, but may also have led to the reporting of misleading numbers. Another mechanism through which performance measurement and management may boost citizen satisfaction is that citizens, given improved information, are better able to choose doctors or hospitals that perform well and meet their needs. These citizens would then be more satisfied, presumably, with the health care system. Finally, the publicity and rhetoric resulting from the government’s push to measure and report on performance, conveyed by the media and other sources, may itself have influenced citizens’ perceptions of the health care system.</p>
<p>Thus, our study addresses the following research question: Did the New Public Management-inspired UK health reforms of the late 1990s realize their performance goals in the form of greater citizen satisfaction with the health system and more positive perceptions of the system’s performance? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020852312442658">Jreisat (2002: 157)</xref> argues, ‘Only through the comparative method can questions be satisfactorily answered, such as which reforms work, which do not, and under what conditions’. Thus, we compare citizen satisfaction and performance perceptions in the UK to the experiences of citizens in other EU countries over the same time period, as explained in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0020852312442658"><title>Data and method</title>
<p>To evaluate the late-1990s’ UK health reforms, this study uses data from the Eurobarometer and a pooled cross-sections, difference in differences analytical strategy to compare changes in citizens’ views of the health care system in their country between 1996 (Eurobarometer 44.3) and 2002 (Eurobarometer 57.2). The Eurobarometer is a face-to-face survey, representative of the population over age 15, based on random samples of approximately 1000 individuals in each EU country. Established in 1973 and conducted by the Public Opinion Analysis Sector of the European Commission, the survey measures attitudes over time in European Union member countries. Special modules in 1996 and 2002 asked a number of questions about health-related issues, allowing a comparison of attitudes before and after the UK reforms on the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Difference in differences (diff-in-diffs, for short) is a statistical strategy that, in this case using pooled cross-sections, compares change over the period in the UK to change over the same period in other countries, with the set of comparison countries varied (as explained shortly) to assess the robustness of the findings. Diff-in-diffs models may use panel data or, as in this study, pooled cross-sections taken before and after an intervention or event. In a regression framework, our model is as follows (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312442658">Remler and Van Ryzin, 2011</xref>):

The slope <italic>b</italic><sub>uk</sub> estimates the difference in outcome (<italic>Y</italic>) between the UK and comparison countries during the pre-reform period and is assumed constant over time. The slope <italic>b<sub>yr</sub></italic>  estimates the difference in outcome (<italic>Y</italic>) between the pre- and post-reform period for the comparison countries and is thus assumed to be the trend that would have occurred in the UK, absent the reforms. Finally, the slope on the interaction <italic>b</italic><sub>int</sub> estimates the difference in differences, or the net difference (from the trend) in the outcome (<italic>Y</italic>) for the UK and is thus the presumed causal effect of the reforms on the satisfaction and performance perceptions of UK citizens.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0020852312442658"><title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>The dependent variables or outcomes (<italic>Y</italic>) in our analysis are two questions from the Eurobarometer that asked about satisfaction with the health care system and perceptions of the system’s performance in both 1996 and 2002. The <italic>satisfaction</italic> question asked respondents in both years:<disp-quote>
<p>Please tell me whether you are (1) not at all satisfied; (2) not very satisfied; (3) neither satisfied nor dissatisfied; (4) fairly satisfied; or (5) very satisfied with the health care system in (our country).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The <italic>perceived performance</italic> question asked respondents in 1996 and again in 2002 the following question:<disp-quote>
<p>Now I will read you four statements about the way the healthcare system runs in [Country]. Which one comes closest to your own point of view? (1) Health care system in [our country] runs so badly that we need to rebuild it completely; (2) There are some good things in the way health care in [our country] runs, but only fundamental changes would make it work better; (3) There are some good things in the way health care in [our country] runs, and only minor changes would make it work better; (4) On the whole, the health care system in [our country] runs quite well.</p></disp-quote>Because both variables are ordinal, we employ ordered logistical regression analysis, with responses coded such that higher numbers reflect more satisfaction and more positive perceptions of system performance. (Since the perceived performance question involves a somewhat complex set of ordinal responses, which arguably may not have been understood as ordinal by respondents, we also tried dichotomizing the measure and using logistic regression to estimate the odds of responding that the health system ‘runs well’ (coded 1) versus the other three categories (coded 0). Results did not differ substantively from the ordered logistic regression analysis reported here.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0020852312442658"><title>Control variables</title>
<p>As indicated, our diff-in-diffs model includes a number of control variables to account for individual characteristics that may influence attitudes toward government health services as well as trends within countries in overall levels of satisfaction and perceived performance. Age is included as a control variable because of its obvious relationship to health and health care utilization and because previous research has found that older individuals give more positive ratings to government services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020852312442658">Van Ryzin et al., 2008</xref>). We control for gender because women and men have different health care needs and experiences and because some studies suggest that there are gender differences in satisfaction with health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312442658">Hall et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852312442658">Weisman et al., 2000</xref>). The Eurobarometer also asks individuals if they have any longstanding illness, health problem or handicap that limits, to some extent or severely, their work or daily activities. Responses to this question are included as a control variable because individuals with a condition requiring frequent use of health care services might have different perceptions of the health care system compared to relatively infrequent users.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic status is an obvious factor in attitudes toward government benefit programs and the health care system in particular, given its high and rising costs, and thus we control for both income (defined as being below, or above, the median for the country<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020852312442658">1</xref></sup>) and employment status (defined as being currently employed, or not). Countries with more unemployment tend to have greater stress on the funding of their health systems, whether financed through insurance or taxation. Additionally, in some countries people who are employed can purchase additional private health insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852312442658">Saltman and Figueras, 1997</xref>). For these reasons, employment status might affect citizens’ attitudes toward their country’s health system. We also control for type of community (rural area, town, or large town) because it may affect access to health care services and because studies have shown differences in satisfaction with government services based on type of community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312442658">Montalvo, 2009</xref>). In addition, we control for immigrant status (defined as a respondent whose nationality is different from the country of residence) because it may affect health care access and attitudes and because of rapid changes in immigration in some EU countries over the study period.</p>
<p>Political ideology may be another factor influencing citizens’ satisfaction with the health care system and perceived need for reform. Those in favor of the current government may be more likely to express satisfaction with the health care system regardless of its actual quality, simply because of their political preferences at the time of the survey. A 10-point scale measuring how far to the left or right individuals place themselves on the political spectrum is thus used as a control variable to capture such broader political preferences. Because previous research has found that attitudes toward the role of government in health care provision are also related to satisfaction with public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852312442658">Blekesaune and Quadagno, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852312442658">Gevers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312442658">Hasenfeld and Rafferty, 1989</xref>), we control for an agree–disagree question that reads: ‘The government should only provide everyone with essential services such as care for serious diseases and encourage people to provide for themselves in other respects.’ Of the available questions in the Eurobarometer, we judged this one to best capture general attitudes toward the role of government in health care provision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020852312442658">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0020852312442658"><title>Comparison countries</title>
<p>The European Union countries included in the Eurobarometer in both 1996 and 2002 are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In addition to comparing the UK to this full set of other countries available in the Eurobarometer, we also compare the UK to several subgroups of countries that have health systems and populations most similar to the UK. The first subgroup consists of the four other EU countries with well-established, tax-financed health care systems and mainly public health care providers: Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852312442658">Emmerson et al., 2002</xref>). The second subgroup consists of the other four largest countries in the European Union by population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP): Germany, France, Spain, and Italy. These subgroups provide points of comparison that may be more relevant for the UK and also provide a means of examining the robustness of the findings across alternative definitions of the comparison group. It should be acknowledged that, during the time period covered by our study, many of these countries undertook their own health care reforms, some of which also emphasized performance measurement and quality improvement. As a result, our models should be viewed as estimating the net effects of the UK’s performance-related health reforms, above and beyond the effects of the various other reforms that happened in the comparison countries.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852312442658">Table 1</xref> shows the frequency distribution for the dependent variables, while <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852312442658">Table 2</xref> shows the minimum and maximum for the control variables as well as their weighted means, in each year, for the UK and the various sets of comparison countries. While the dependent variables have lower values (less satisfaction, more negative performance perceptions) in the UK than most of the comparison groups in both years, the change in attitudes is the focus of our analysis rather than the level of each dependent variable, as we discuss in the next section. In general, the control variables were comparable for the UK and comparison groups with some minor differences. In both years, the average age in the UK was slightly older, the likelihood of reporting an illness was higher, and the proportion of people living in large towns was higher in the UK than in the comparison countries. In 1996, the percentage of individuals employed was slightly higher in the UK than in the other countries, while in 2002 this trend was reversed. Also in 1996, the percentage of those with high incomes was somewhat lower in the UK, while the percentage of those who did not report income was higher. People in the UK were slightly more left-wing politically in both years, except when compared to the four other largest countries. Compared to the other countries, those in the UK were more likely to agree that the government should have a limited role in health care in 1996, but slightly less likely to agree in 2002. In our statistical models, it should be pointed out, we effectively hold constant all of these various changes across countries and over time in the levels of these control variables.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020852312442658">Table 3</xref> presents the regression analysis of the estimated impact of the UK reforms on satisfaction with the health care system. The coefficient on ‘year’ indicates that, between 1996 and 2002, the trend in satisfaction with the health care system was a negative one on average in all EU countries. But compared to this average downward trend, satisfaction decreased less over the period in the UK, resulting in a net positive difference in differences, as represented by the interaction (year × UK) coefficient. In other words, citizens in the UK were more satisfied with their health care system after the reforms than they would have been had they followed the trend evident in the other EU countries surveyed by the Eurobarometer. This finding of a net positive effect also appears in the regression analysis based on the comparison group consisting of the subset of four other countries with tax-financed health systems, as represented by the significant and positive interaction term (year × UK). When the UK is compared to the four other largest European countries by population and GDP, the interaction term is also positive but not statistically significant.

<p>In sum, the results from these regression analyses indicate that citizen satisfaction with health care and perceived performance of the health care system were higher in the UK, after the reforms, than they would have been had the UK continued on the same trajectory as many other EU countries during this time period (and controlling for potentially confounding variables). But the results are less certain, it should be pointed out, when the UK is compared with just the four other largest EU countries.</p>
<p>We have not said much about the magnitude of the regression coefficients and their policy significance, largely because ordered logistic regression coefficients are not as intuitively interpretable as ordinary regression coefficients. Thus, to address the substantive or policy significance of the regression coefficients, Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020852312442658">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0020852312442658">2</xref> present predicted probabilities with the control variables held constant at their means and the ‘year’ and ‘UK’ variables fixed at 1. Then, to estimate the situation in the UK <italic>without</italic> reform (the counterfactual), the interaction term (year × UK) is set at 0. And to estimate the situation in the UK <italic>with</italic> the reforms (but holding the control variables constant relative to the comparison countries), the interaction term is set at 1. As Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020852312442658">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0020852312442658">2</xref> show, when compared to the 15 EU countries in this dataset, the UK’s health system reforms led to an estimated 7.5% increase in the probability of being satisfied or very satisfied with the health care system (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.9%, 11.1%), and a 5.9% increase in the probability of perceiving the health system as running well or needing only minor changes (95% CI = 2.3%, 9.5%). When compared to the four other EU countries with well-established tax-financed health systems, the UK’s health system reforms led to an estimated 19.8% increase in the probability of being satisfied or very satisfied with the health care system (95% CI = 16.6%, 23.1%), and a 15.6% increase in the probability of perceiving the health system as running well or needing only minor changes (95% CI = 12.0%, 19.4%). When compared to the four other largest EU countries, the UK’s health system reforms led to an estimated 2.5% increase in the probability of being satisfied or very satisfied with the health care system (95% CI = −1.7%, 6.7%), and a 0.9% increase in the probability of perceiving the health system as running well or needing only minor changes (95% CI = −3.2%, 5.1%).

<fig id="fig2-0020852312442658" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Regression-adjusted change in predicted probabilities for perceiving the health system as running well or needing only minor changes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020852312442658-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To put these percentages in even more meaningful policy terms, we can extrapolate them to the adult population of the UK (about 48.6 million in 2002). Using the results from the EU 15 comparison group, we estimate that there were about 3.6 million additional people in the UK who were satisfied or very satisfied with the health care system than there would have been, absent the reforms. And we estimate that there were about 2.9 million more people in the UK who perceived the health care system as running well, or needing only minor changes, than there would have been, again absent the reforms. Compared to the counterfactual based on the four other countries with tax-financed health care, we estimate that about 9.6 million more people in the UK after the reforms were satisfied or very satisfied with the health system, and 7.6 million additional people perceived the health system as running well or needing only minor changes. Given the least optimistic estimates, based on comparison with the four other largest EU countries, about 1.2 million more people in the UK after the reforms were satisfied or very satisfied with the health system, and about 400,000 more people perceived the health system as running well or needing only minor changes than there would have been had the UK continued on the same trajectory as these other countries. In sum, these various population projections indicate that the estimated impacts of the reform were not trivial in magnitude.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth commenting on some of the control variables in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020852312442658">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0020852312442658">4</xref>. Although the results are mixed across the six models, there are some broad patterns. Males and older citizens are somewhat more positive about the health care system. However, those with an illness or health problem view the health care system less favorably. Immigrants appear to be more satisfied in most of the models, except in the models with the tax-financed countries (in which the relationship is negative). Employed people are less positive about the health care system generally, but income has little consistent relationship (although it is positive and statistically significant in the models involving all countries). Compared to people living in rural areas (the reference category), those living in small towns tend to be more positive while those living in large towns or cities seem appear more negative (except in the case of the models involving the largest countries, which show a positive relationship). Finally, those who identify themselves as politically conservative are slightly more satisfied in a few of the models, but the relationships are not strong and mostly insignificant statistically. And those who prefer a limited role for government in health care provision tend to view the health system more negatively. It is not our aim here to make substantive interpretations of these relationships. Rather, we simply note that many of these variables do have relationships with citizen satisfaction and perceived performance of the health system but that, because we have controlled for these variables in our analysis, any changes over time in the values of these variables across countries are not confounding our estimates of the impact of the UK health reforms on satisfaction and perceived performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0020852312442658"><title>Discussion and implications</title>
<p>Taken together, the results of our difference in differences analysis suggest that citizen satisfaction and performance perceptions in the UK were more favorable after the reforms than what would have been the case, absent the implementation of the reforms. The estimated improvement in satisfaction and perceived performance is both statistically and substantively significant, as judged by the estimated magnitude of the effect in the UK population. Thus our results provide some evidence that the UK’s performance framework worked, at least somewhat, to improve the satisfaction of citizens with the health care system. In this section, we discuss the implications of our results for policy and for research. But first we must acknowledge certain limitations of our method and findings.</p>
<p>In a difference in differences analysis, any changes to the treatment group (in this case, citizens of the UK), apart from what is accounted for by the trend in the comparison countries and the control variables, is attributed to the intervention. Since we cannot control entirely for country-level factors, it is possible that the changes in satisfaction and perceived performance may have been due to policies other than the New Public Management-related reforms. In particular, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020852312442658">Mossialos (1997)</xref> suggests a generally positive relationship between per capita health expenditures and satisfaction with the health care system using the 1996 Eurobarometer. Thus, change in satisfaction with the health care system in the UK could be explained simply by increased spending in this sector. To address this possibility, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0020852312442658">Figure 3</xref> shows the relationship between the change in a country’s health expenditures as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product by the change in average citizen satisfaction with the health care system between 1996 and 2002. A positive relationship would be expected if spending rather than performance reforms made the difference in satisfaction. As shown in the graph, there is no clear relationship. Some countries, such as Sweden, increased spending on health care more than other countries between 1996 and 2002, yet average satisfaction with the health system dropped considerably. Other countries, such as Spain, decreased spending on health care but saw relatively smaller drops in average satisfaction with health care. This lends more support to the finding that changes in citizen satisfaction with the health care system in the UK were due to the performance reforms rather than to changes in health care spending.
<fig id="fig3-0020852312442658" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Change in satisfaction with the health care system by change in health expenditures as a percentage of GDP, 1996–2002</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020852312442658-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Although we address the alternative explanation that health spending could explain differences in citizen satisfaction with the health system, unobserved variables could still bias our estimations. For example, another conceptual model for assessing satisfaction with public services is the expectation–disconfirmation paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852312442658">Van Ryzin, 2004</xref>). This study does not control for expectations, which may interact with quality to influence citizen perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852312442658">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, our study does not account for trends in country differences in satisfaction with public services. Results from previous surveys have found that Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain tended to have below-average satisfaction, Austria, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Finland, and Denmark tended to have above-average satisfaction, and Belgium, France, the UK, Germany, Ireland, and Sweden tended to have close-to-average satisfaction. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852312442658">Clifton and Diaz-Fuentes, 2010</xref>). More broadly, many of the countries in the comparison group were undergoing reform activities themselves during the period covered by this study, so that the comparison groups (all 14 EU countries, the four tax-financed countries, and the four largest EU countries) are not in any way a no-change comparison group. Thus, our estimates of the UK reforms represent the impacts net of the medley of related changes going on in the rest of the EU countries during this time period.</p>
<p>Another limitation of our study can be found in the outcome measures. New Public Management reforms have other goals besides improving citizen satisfaction and perceived performance. Citizen perceptions of the health care system may not correlate with experts’ views or other outcome measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312442658">Blendon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852312442658">Stipak, 1979</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852312442658">Padma et al. (2010)</xref> found that patients treat the interpersonal aspect of health care as most important because they do not have the expertise to evaluate the technical quality of services. However, these attitudes should be considered as another important part of the decision-making process. Particularly since the UK’s health system reforms emphasized the experience of patients, citizen satisfaction with the system remains a relevant, if not primary, goal of the policy. Our measures of citizen satisfaction have some other limitations. Researchers in both public administration and business administration generally prefer multi-item satisfaction scales (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852312442658">McMullan and O’Neil, 2010</xref>), whereas the dependent variables in our models are single survey items. However, we were limited by the available data and variables in the Eurobarometer surveys.</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, this study does provide at least an initial attempt to evaluate the impact of a nationwide New Public Management reform in a very important sector (health care) on citizen perceptions. There has been much written and argued about New Public Management, as well as about performance measurement and management more generally, but very few attempts to empirically examine the impact of such strategies on the actual quality of public service provision and the experiences of citizens on a national level. And, we would argue, the satisfaction and performance judgments of citizen-users of a nation’s health system are fundamental outcomes of inherent interest, not only to citizens themselves but to policymakers and system administrators. Additional research could be conducted to complement this study, examining other health care performance indicators, such as health outcomes, costs, and equity. Future research could also evaluate the impact of New Public Management-type reforms in other sectors besides health, for example education, crime, transportation, and environmental protection. Indeed, the increasing availability and sophistication of international surveys, like the Eurobarometer, make possible similar difference in differences studies of the impacts of governance reforms in other countries around the world.</p>
<p>Empirical studies of citizens’ experiences and attitudes can help inform researchers, policymakers, and practitioners about which features of public management reforms may influence different types of outcomes. Our results suggest that the quality and customer-focused aspects of New Public Management that were applied through the UK’s health system reforms seem to have worked in this case. Policymakers’ and practitioners’ efforts to measure, report, and improve quality may have noticeable effects on citizens’ experiences and attitudes.</p>
