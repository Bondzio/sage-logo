<abstract>
<p>The paper reviews recent literature on trust in urban and regional planning from engineering planning, sociological, economic and psychoanalytic perspectives using the author’s training and experiences as a backdrop. It discusses the various approaches of defining trust in the planning context and discusses four categories of trust proposed by Swain and Tait (2007). According to the author, the importance of leaders and leadership on trust is ignored in most current theories. Based on Freud’s model on groups the author proposes that leaders and significant “external objects” are central to trust and critical to successful planning. Following the group model, supported by psychoanalytic literature, the paper proposes a new way of looking at trust, how it develops and how it can be adapted and incorporated in the planning processes.</p>

<title>Introduction: What is trust?</title>
<p>In his 1966 book <italic>The City Planning Process</italic> Alan Altshuler concludes that trust was <italic>e pluribus unum</italic> for the acceptance, approval and eventual building of the Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis. Trust in the planners by the decision-makers and the Minneapolis business community enabled the City to go ahead to create this beautiful mall. Many authors believe trust is the <italic>sine qua non</italic> in all successful plans and planning; without it, plans are books on the shelf of what could have been.</p>
<p>The road map for this paper is as follows. This introduction on “what is trust” leads to making the case for the importance of leadership in the second section. This is followed by a discussion of the four forms of trust identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095211430494">Swain and Tait (2007)</xref> in the third. The fourth section makes a brief “tour” of the current planning process followed by a justification of autoplastic change: as one of the purposes in planning. The sixth and seventh sections discuss the emotional origins of trust and its place in the planning context. The eighth section concludes.</p>
<p>Trust is difficult to define. The next few paragraphs give the reader a flavour of the discourse about the concept. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095211430494">Barbara Misztal (1996</xref>), in her book <italic>Trust in Modern Societies</italic>, spends over 20 pages defining trust. Misztal (citing Dunn, p. 12) states, <italic>“Trustworthiness</italic>, [as] <italic>the capacity to commit oneself to fulfilling the legitimate expectations of others, is both the constitutive virtue of, and the key causal precondition for the existence of, any society.”</italic> According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095211430494">Habermas (1984)</xref> <italic>trustworthiness is based on truth, rightness, and sincerity</italic>. Echoing Habermas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095211430494">Swain and Tait (2007)</xref> plainly say that the role of “the professional in modern society is largely defined by notions of integrity, altruism, neutrality and trust” (p. 231). But experience shows that trustworthiness as defined above does not necessarily create trust.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095211430494">Misztal (1996</xref>: 14), “sociological literature conceptualizes trust as either the property of individuals, the property of social relationships or the property of social systems with attention to behaviour based on actions and orientations at <italic>the individual level</italic>” (author’s italics). This conceptualization covers the planner and her subjects (as individuals), the relationships between them (as social relationships), and planning as an institution and process (as social systems). It does not say if trust in the planner can be separated from trust in the planning system, and makes no headway in defining trust, except that it is a “property”.</p>
<p>In economics, trust is viewed as social capital that can reduce uncertainty and transaction costs and is therefore positively related to economic growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473095211430494">Reja and Talvitie (1995)</xref> consider it a fixed cost in corruption and therefore less ruinous to the economy than the uncertainty caused by the lack of trust, which is reflected in the variable costs of corruption. The economic literature (summary and references are in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095211430494">McKnight and Chervany, 1996</xref>) has a hedonic view of trust, but lacks practical explanations of trust and applications beyond academic exercises. A notable exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095211430494">North’s (2005)</xref> attempt at understanding the process of economic change.</p>
<p>Trust also has a cooperative dimension in a <italic>community of individuals</italic>, defined as “willingness of other agents to fulfill their contractual obligation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095211430494">Misztal, 1996</xref>: 18, citing <italic>Blackwell Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Social Thought</italic>). Fulfilling contractual obligations creates political and social order, but requires “‘artificial structure’ of trust … to close the gap in the social order left unfilled by force or reason alone” (Weil, 1987: 776, cited by Misztal). In the planning context, “political and social order” and trust in legitimate processes and transparency of assessments through public inquiries promote “voluntary compliance to decisions made in the name of the common good” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095211430494">Laurian, 2009</xref>: 377). Laurian does note that in countries with corrupt government and unpredictable legal systems, legitimate pro forma public inquiries and seemingly rational processes are used as a cover for power relations or elite capture. This line of thinking about communication and power in planning is present in the writings of Foucault, Flyvbjerg and, of course, the Marxists.</p>

<p>According to Swain and Tait rational trust is a kind of “commodity or good to be traded in transactions” (p. 233); personal trust rests on personal bonds between parties and formed through the first-hand experience of knowing each other; norm trust is knowledge-based information of the norms and motives that allows them to trust another’s motives; and finally, abstract trust is associated with professional standards and codes and, I would add, theories and search for truth.</p>
<p>A survey of the literature suggests that trust (in planning) can be viewed from two extremes: from (Foucault’s) power relations and from solidarity. In a philosophical paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473095211430494">Stein and Harper (2003)</xref> examine planning through [their] prism of Foucaldian relativistic power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1473095211430494">2</xref></sup> They argue that “[i]f participants in planning processes see everything in terms of power, this perception could breed a sense of suspicion and mistrust, making it ever more difficult to develop the relationships of mutual respect and trust so essential to collaborative planning. On a broader scale, social solidarity will be further eroded” (p. 133). Not giving credence to Foucaldian power concepts does not mean that dishonorable use of power is uncommon, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473095211430494">Flyvbjerg (1998)</xref> has shown. “Strategic misrepresentation” (Flyvbjerg’s words; “lying” in everyday language) of data and “facts”, manipulation of model results, watering down or suppressing critical findings, obfuscation of non-quantifiable benefits, elite capture in resource use and managerial appointments are all common. There can be cliques with a powerful or well-connected leader, or a reticent management with trust among themselves, to appropriate benefits of a public good or service to themselves or drive forward with ideology rather than knowledge. It does not follow, however, from these dysfunctions that democratic and deliberative planning processes need to be rejected or viewed only as an application of power. Legitimacy of planning requires competent managers and professionals in “good enough” institutions with transparent procedures but without the need for shared values; in Evans’ words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473095211430494">1993</xref>: 10), “Town planning’s claim to function in the interest of the whole community is patently absurd.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1473095211430494">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Solidarity is an enigmatic concept. Although already known in the biblical times, in recent times it broke into public consciousness and achieved worldwide recognition from Lech Walesa’s industry in the Gdansk shipyards with well-known consequences. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095211430494">Misztal (1996</xref>: 68, citing Parsons) it has two dimensions: consensus on norms and values, and collective identity—issues to which I return later, albeit in different words. Both advance the group’s (society’s) and individuals’ interests, the latter being subsidiary. The function of trust is to keep social order and its focus. Some writers differentiate between pre-modern and modern societies, but whatever descriptive differences there may be, they are secondary to the role of the leader, who personifies the group’s trust, morality, and need for reciprocity and constraint (even subordination) of self-interest.</p>
<p>Making a sharper distinction, power relations view planning as giving advantages to a small group when the solidarity approach is concerned with bringing freedom, opportunity and wellbeing to many, and ultimately to the entire society. Both strains co-exist in societies, and both are strongly dependent on leaders. How planners act and work in such difficult environments, also populated by persons and groups in between these two caricatures, to find and evolve acceptable compromises is heavily dependent on their skills and ability to build trust and become trustworthy stewards. But that is a starting point, as I have argued elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095211430494">Talvitie, 2009</xref>); trust is not enough.</p>
<p>I am aware that this brief and selective round-up of the planning and sociological writings and comments on what others have written about trust does not adequately describe their context. However, any misrepresentation is unintentional. Selectivity is justified because this is not a review paper and highlighting disagreement and agreement is desirable—the latter being necessary to retain resonance with the author’s writings. But it is not unfair to say that the cited literature comes up short on defining trust and on proposals of how trust can be evolved among individuals or within a group. The proposals lack the human dimension, and instead are legalistic, contractual, stale and system oriented: what are “others’ legitimate expectations”, what “policies should be followed”, what “should be done”, what kind of “institutions need to be created” and so on. No one denies the importance of deliberative, open and democratic planning and processes; the issue is how that is accomplished in practice.</p>
<p>This review of trust concepts and taxonomy is aptly concluded by relating trust to confidence. Paraphrasing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1473095211430494"><italic>The Random House Dictionary</italic> (1966)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p>trust implies <italic>unconscious belief</italic> (“<italic>instinctive unquestioning belief</italic>” in the RHD) in and reliance upon something; confidence implies conscious trust because of good reasons, definite evidence or past experience.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That is, trust is a feeling and needs no definition because we know in our psyche what trust is. Of course, feelings—feelings always are involuntary—can be analyzed. We also know that trust among people is a significant matter in life—and “essential to the work of planners”. Trust is rooted in experiences, personal and phylogenetic, and rationalized in philosophical, psychoanalytic, psychological, sociological, and economic terms and writings.</p>

<title>Leadership and trust</title>
<p>The writings about trust are remarkable in their lack of consideration of a leader and leadership. The index of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095211430494">Misztal’s (1996)</xref> book, which has an extensive review of sociological literature about trust, has no reference to leadership. The entire book mentions it only twice and has only one paragraph citation to a proposal to rethink [political parties] and “opt for trust in leaders’ practical capacities instead of trusting their good intentions” (p. 261). But she dismisses the proposal as “not a solution capable of sustaining and reproducing trust on a permanent basis” (p. 260–261), perhaps implying that trust can be created by following certain policies and behavior patterns. Many writers on trust seem to favor solidarity as mode of life and work, which needs no leaders, only its ideology. Adherents to or skeptics of Foucaldian power concepts also focus on the common “external object” to endorse or oppose. Nonetheless, as a broad generalization, confirmed by a reviewer, planning, sociological and political economy literature dismiss the role and function of leaders. This is surprising given the observable evidence.</p>
<p>The following discussion is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095211430494">Freud (1921)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095211430494">Bion (1961)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473095211430494">Ormont (2001)</xref> and my own experiences and readings. Freud's drive theory of the instincts,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1473095211430494">4</xref></sup> which is the theoretical basis of this paper, gives a fresh meaning to human behavior and the concept of trust, and provides a profoundly different outlook on planning and public policy as discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473095211430494">Talvitie (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473095211430494">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095211430494">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095211430494">2009</xref>). Freud’s theory offers the promise of thoughtful consideration of human phenomena, including “non-rational” choices, and a method of investigation, data collection and “cure”.</p>
<p>It is necessary to expand on the previous paragraph and its footnote. Libidinal (“life force”) ties within communities and among citizens are the basis of trust as commonly understood, but the “death drive” is equally important as the “life drive”, and also the driving force for “negative trust” as explained later. In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095211430494">Freud (1933</xref>: 209):
<disp-quote>
<p>We must not be too hasty in introducing ethical judgments of good and evil. Neither of these instincts is any less essential than the other; the phenomena of life arise from the concurrent and mutually opposing action of both.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The two drives serve “useful” and “harmful” purposes, which are unconscious derivatives and displacements of experiences. They are powerfully influenced and directed by leaders, industry organizations, labor unions, lobby-groups, interest groups and news media, as discussed and applied in group context by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095211430494">Freud (1921)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095211430494">Bion (1961)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473095211430494">Cohen, Ettin and Fidler (2002)</xref>. Freud concisely describes the structure of group ties and the concept of the leader or leading idea in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1473095211430494">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095211430494">1921</xref>: 116). A brief explanation of the figure follows.</p>

</fig>
<p>Freud defines a <italic>primary group</italic> as “a number of individuals [the solid horizontal lines] who have put one and the same [external] object [e.g. a religious or political figure or leader, a military leader, or an idea] in the place of their ego ideal and have consequently identified themselves with one another in their ego”. (Clarifications in parentheses by author.)</p>
<p>The dominant charge in emotional ties influences the structure of the group. When the dominant emotional ties are positive, libidinal, the group is cohesive and there is a permanence of the “external object” and the group. The dominant emotional ties (to the leader) can also become negative, and the group must be held together by the force of violence. Negative feelings can become powerful enough to change the “external object” and depose the leader. There is a third kind of group where its cohesion is propelled from outside: a common hatred for an external object (“the West”) outside the group is used to strengthen the group ties.</p>
<p>The two prototype groups, one with dominant positive and the other with dominant negative emotional ties, sometimes held together by force, although different in appearance have the same motivational basis. Creating trust requires cohesive groups and that there is permanence in the external object: a leader or an idea (a theory). This does not mean that, for trust in multicultural context, there can be only one cohesive group, as long as the leaders also have the same external object: truth, justice and refraining from harmful violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1473095211430494">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several applications of the group analytic process have been proposed or practiced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473095211430494">Cohen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473095211430494">Ormont, 2001</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095211430494">Reja and Talvitie, 2011</xref>). According to Cohen, the first task in group work is recognition of the importance of leaders and establishing working trust.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1473095211430494">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>The four forms of trust</title>
<p>I frame the discussion on trust using the taxonomy of Swain and Tait (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1473095211430494">Table 1</xref>): Rational calculative; Personal relations; Norms; and Abstract. Because the description of the forms in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1473095211430494">Table 1</xref> are intellectual, I expand on them to support my line of thinking before discussing each of them in turn.</p>
<p>Simplifying, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095211430494">Barbara Misztal (1966)</xref> reduces the bases for supporting or creating trust to three things: <italic>predictability of social life; creation of a sense of community</italic>; and <italic>goodwill of people to work together</italic>. With some discomfort these bases fall in the first two categories of Swain and Tait. Misztal also recognizes the importance of institutions and organizations, which are central to John Rawls’ <italic>Theory of Justice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473095211430494">1975</xref>). Rawls’ theory contains valuable constructions on social life and sense of community: <italic>equal right to basic liberties</italic> for everyone; sorting inequalities so that they are of the greatest <italic>benefit to the least-advantaged members of society</italic>; and ensuring that there is <italic>fair equality of opportunity</italic> for advancement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1473095211430494">7</xref></sup> Rawls’ theory, while institutional and organizational, is also abstract and aspiring to truth and justice, which are concepts both real and unreal and indicative of the unconscious basis of trust and distrust.</p>
<p>Along with the desires for social cohesion and sense of community there exist dysfunctional trends: discrimination; ethnic enclaves, which evoke prejudices in others; social exclusion; misuse of Rawls’ difference principle; unfair benefit transfers; and terrorism of various gradations. Most of these trends are unconscious (group) processes, which cannot be dealt with current rational planning approaches; however, it is essential that the instinctual drives are not ignored but recognized in the planning processes.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, a word on words. The word “planning” in this paper refers to city and regional land use planning, transport planning and transport services by the public sector. The concepts and processes put forward apply also in other sectors, but are not discussed.</p>
<sec id="section4-1473095211430494">
<title>Rational calculative trust: Prediction as creator of trust</title>
<p>Prediction is central to planning. Several complex mathematical models with software and visual aids are part of the standard menu: for travel demand, socioeconomic development, land use, financing and environmental impacts. The ability to formulate such models and make predictions with them provides narcissistic satisfactions and has as its purpose the creation of trust from others. Conceptual models about decision-making, governance and process oversight complete the tools and concepts with which the planners work.</p>
<p>It is only recently that cracks, long known to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473095211430494">Talvitie and Kirshner, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1473095211430494">Talvitie, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1473095211430494">Talvitie et al., 1981</xref>), have started to emerge in the edifice of planning methods and processes. Nonetheless, predictions remain the centerpiece of planning. The defense (of most planning theorists) has assumed the position that there is nothing wrong with the models because they deliver conditional forecasts. Glossing over important qualifiers, many predictions, conditional or not, tend to be self-fulfilling prophesies that in the end are not fulfilled.</p>
<p>Predictions and policies to promote economic growth and are bound up with one another. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473095211430494">Friedman (2005)</xref> argues that moral consequences from the lack of economic growth are dire and undermine social cohesion and trust. It is fair to say that he did not settle the argument; even with multiple causation the principal direction of causality probably runs the other way than Friedman proposes: undermining of social cohesion and trust causes poor economic growth and has moral consequences.</p>
<p>Prediction failures of the past, conflicting predictions and questionable transport investments are creating distrust of conditional forecasts. Instead, a broader view of a non-ergodic world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095211430494">North, 2005</xref>), where the predicted world does not happen, has become the accepted model. Self-fulfilling prophecies based on trust are gone, possibly with concomitant effects on social cohesion and goodwill to work and socialize together.</p>
<p>But change is occurring. Equal rights and liberties, benefits to the least-advantaged and equality of opportunity are increasingly mentioned in refereed planning journals and books. There are voices about social exclusion and policy proposals to alleviate and even rectify them (Blumenberg, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473095211430494">Lucas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473095211430494">Stanley, 2010</xref>). New urbanism and other planning tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473095211430494">Campbell and Fainstein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473095211430494">Gunder and Hillier, 2009</xref>), and work to restructure the planning processes, are much less bound with predictions, conditional forecasts or prophecies than the traditional approach. In fact, some of that work is in direct opposition to the forecasts made.</p>
<p>It is fair to conclude that while some of the fascination and mystery of prediction models has lost its luster their patina remains. It used to be the case that there was a greater agreement on the predicted future than of the experienced past. Now the predicted future has become a source of disagreement, too. Predictions and prophecies as creators of trust are replaced by ideologies. The planners’ world is both real and unreal and both are being challenged.</p>

<title>Personal relations: Social interaction and working together as creator of trust</title>
<p><italic>Sense of community</italic> rests on the ego ideal impelled by the “external object” and peoples’ identifications with each other. In Freud’s model, confirmed by experience and observations, a sense of community requires a leader—and not only an abstract object—or leaders who articulate and project the ego ideals and associated prohibitions of the group. The identifications may take place along multiple dimensions: geographic proximity, ethnicity, genetic heritage, shared beliefs in religion or scientific theories, shared values through employment, common experiences, brought together by leaders and reinforced by a multitude of “get-togethers”. A sense of community is rarely unconditional, although extremes with strong leaders (who enforce it) do exist. In “normal” cases the identifications are sufficient to allow acceptance or toleration of hostile feelings without lasting damage to the community or individual. This is because the identifications are grounded on common goals—ego ideals—and articulated by the leaders in communities and nationally. The common ego ideals create trust and a sense of community, not vice versa; lack of trust is a broken basis for social cohesion and social order. In Tolstoy’s sense, happy communities are alike and unhappy communities are unhappy in their own way.</p>
<p>The goodwill of people to work together and their social interactions are complex conditions for trust. Removing the word “goodwill” for a moment, it is an experiential fact that working or socializing together can create both trust and distrust; the causality runs from “together” to trust—or distrust. Adding “goodwill” to “together” is inherent in Rawls’ theory; we, as a society or group, grant: <italic>equal right to basic liberties to others, benefits to the least-advantaged members of society</italic>, and <italic>fair equality of opportunity for advancement</italic> if we can <italic>trust</italic> that the others follow the biblical “Law and the Prophets” regardless of their religion or lack of it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1473095211430494">8</xref></sup> Undoubtedly “experiences through social interaction” —public inquiries—are key to creating trust for planning work. I will return to this matter later.</p>

<title>Organization and institutions as creators of trust</title>
<p>With a degree of reservation, Rawls’ <italic>Theory of Justice</italic> can be considered under Swain–Tait’s “norms” form of trust because, clearly, his theory runs much deeper than “norms” and knowledge about them. Nonetheless, Rawls’ theory is a prescription for what society and its institutions should aim at in their policies and practices. For Rawls, trust in society and its institutions requires consciously expressed intentions for equality, liberty and justice, protected in laws and verified through legal recourses, and common and conscious knowledge about them. Tweaking again <italic>The Random House Dictionary</italic> on trust and confidence: “trust [for Rawls] implies unconscious belief in and reliance upon something with conscious confidence because of good reasons, definite evidence, or past experience.” What does this mean for planning?</p>
<p>The institution of planning is and requires organized activity. In order to counter the “collective inhibition of intelligence” in groups, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095211430494">Freud (1921)</xref> cites extensively McDougall’s book <italic>The Group Mind</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473095211430494">1920</xref>) and concludes that an organization should aim to have those “features which were characteristics of the individual” (p. 86). It is instructive to list McDougall’s prescriptions for a good organization (as cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095211430494">Freud, 1921</xref>: 86):</p>
<list id="list1-1473095211430494" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>There should be some degree of continuity, either material or formal (material when the same individuals persist in the group for some time; formal, if there is a system of fixed positions occupied by a succession of individuals).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Individual members should have a definite idea of the nature, composition, functions and capacities of the organization to develop emotional ties to it.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The organization should have interaction (even rivalry) with other similar groups, but differ from them in many respects.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The organization should possess traditions, customs and habits to determine the relations of its members to one another.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The organization should have a definite structure, in terms of specialization and differentiation of its functions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>I would add a sixth prescription for planning entities: “The organization should have transparent decision processes; progress and results of its work should be subject to public inquiries and an appeal process should be in place regarding plans and plan implementation.”</p>
<p>In democracies the planning institutions satisfy these requirements, and, to a degree, the Rawlsian prescriptions for equality, liberty and justice. Recent literature on social exclusion shows that the planning profession and planning organizations are capable of being self-correcting if unfair practices or “blind spots” are uncovered. The problem and issue is with the “external object”, because planning institutions are rarely independent in their views, but serve those who have appointed them. A planning organization always has a “steering committee” that oversees its work and gives and approves its goals, even alternatives to be studied, and often interferes or has sway over the evaluations. It is clear that the exercise of power can be used to subvert the planning work, especially when the extant technical methods lend themselves to “strategic misrepresentations”. It is to the nature of the “external object” that I turn next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1473095211430494">
<title>Theories and ideas, truth and justice as creators of (abstract) trust</title>
<p>“Abstract trust” is the one most linked to the “external object”, the ego ideal. While a planner’s ego ideal has early roots—dispositions, rather—those dispositions are capable of more than one expression. Therefore the planner’s education (including emotional education) is of paramount importance. The planning and engineering schools’ education is about alloplastic change: how to design and change the external world or promote economic growth and the methods and skills to do so. Examination of the students’ personal values and motivations is neglected. This point is important: what is crucial is an examination of the values and motivations, the ego ideals, and not merely didactic lecturing about what they ought to be. But, just to be clear, education and training in alloplastic change is important and cannot, of course, be neglected.</p>
<p>As a result, planning is principally a (pseudo)intellectual exercise and this approach carries over to decision-making. The planning literature takes the (political) decision-maker, a mysterious figure, for granted and often viewed beyond the reach of analysis. Planning proposals often support what is wished for by the decision-makers, regardless whether this wish is explicitly conveyed or not. Also the academics are prone to “jump on the bandwagon” and present positive findings and benefits of politically attractive options and not infrequently give a short shrift to costs, disbenefits and benefit transfers. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that it is difficult, and probably harmful to one’s career, whether as planner or a consultant, to make non-partisan evaluations or even to disagree professionally with the “management”.</p>
<p>And it is here where the abstract ego ideal, a believable theory and pursuit of “truth”, can go a long way to help the professional planner and consultant. Jeffersonian and Rawlsian (ego) ideals of equality, liberty and justice enshrined in the US constitution are important concepts, which need to be examined in group settings, in the classroom and personally. This calls for extra competencies from the educators. It is important, for one’s concept of the ego ideal, that the study of “psychical dispositions” is not only intellectual or brainstorming on the matter. To get such a study process off the ground I discuss, after two detours, in the section <italic>How does trust occur or begin to develop</italic>, a common beginning of narcissistic transference. And in the following section I outline how narcissistic transference<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1473095211430494">9</xref></sup> is a transitional phase in “re-educating” one’s ego ideal, and how to evolve it to trust and a concept useful to the planning profession.</p>

<title>The rational planning process</title>
<p>The previous sections establish the importance of credible technical methods, personal relations, organizations and institutions, and the importance of “external object” to trust, but they do not establish that trust is important in planning. For this reason two brief detours are taken to sketch out first the extant planning process and then focus on a key theoretical assumption—that of behavior change—which is made in planning practice.</p>
<p>The planning process is well known and only a synopsis is given here. The “rational” transport planning process includes the following activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473095211430494">Talvitie, 1997</xref>, and references in that paper):</p>

<list-item><p>recommendation for a preferred alternative.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Despite recent changes (especially private public partnerships and pricing schemes with important land use consequences in the short and long run), this nutshell text-book description of the content of the planning process, reinforced by academic tradition with prediction as its centerpiece, still holds and is hard to change.</p>
<p>Important research work is underway, especially in Europe, for addressing uncertainty, risk and ambiguity and generating “out-of-the-box” solutions and “policy packages” to improve plans and policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1473095211430494">10</xref></sup> In the US the benefit-cost analysis is experiencing a revival with a broader context but without willingness to pay, which underlines the demand curve and benefits (as defined by the economists). This approach to benefit-cost analysis circumvents benefit transfers, normally huge in transport investments, and separates financing and user payments from the costs of plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095211430494">Ieromonachou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095211430494">Talvitie, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is by no means original to call the extant rational planning model anachronistic and obsolete. Paradoxically, while the claim is true, rational planning is needed, as I argued in my “Theoryless Planning” paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095211430494">Talvitie, 2009</xref>). The issue of rationality has been argued on both sides since the 1970s if not earlier. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473095211430494">Faludi (1996)</xref> writes a useful summary of arguments and an articulated defense of the rational planning model and puts forward a “Decision-centered View of Planning” that can easily accommodate later developments, which are “but extensions of the original model” (p. 65).</p>
<p>The above description of the planning process is purposefully non-scholarly and stripped of intellectual argumentations. Not because they lack merit or meaning, but because they are not debated in the decision rooms, nor do they matter much to the decisions made. At best they are scholastic interpretations about what might have motivated the decision-makers or the public in supporting a particular plan. The rational model objectifies planning and is remote to experiential observations because planning deals with alloplastic changes. It is true that “administrative man” (cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473095211430494">Faludi, 1996</xref>), “disjointed incrementalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473095211430494">Braybrooke and Lindblom, 1963</xref>) and “muddling through” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473095211430494">Lindblom, 1959</xref>) recognize the effects of the “administrative man” and politics on plans, policies and decisions. But unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473095211430494">Altshuler (1966)</xref> they do not explicitly recognize trust and its importance to planning to help planners deal with the conscious and unconscious processes that underlie it; they are evident but ignored. Instead, predicted behavior and its derivatives are central to planning.</p>

<sec id="section9-1473095211430494">
<title>On autoplastic change</title>
<p>The economic model of behavior admits behavior change in response to the price of the good or service, or changes in prices of derived goods, or through provision of “incentives”. Recently, direct behavior modification has gained momentum. The principal aim of the behavior change approaches is to reduce negative externalities. Most proposed behavior modification measures can be lumped under the label “information theory”, although there also are “coercion methods”. An example of the former is trip planning or information on available public transport at stops and in terminals, which are believed to reduce travel or increase passenger numbers. An example of coercion is odd/even license plate drive permits on alternating days. Telecommuting combines information technology and work rules and is shown to affect travel behavior and patterns. Better walk and bikeways provide an improved private transport mode. Evidence of effects of “soft” measures in planning is limited, but undoubtedly work will continue on perfecting them.</p>
<p>Voluntary autoplastic behavior change comes from reorganization of the brain’s neural paths in response to experiences, stimulus or information. Pavlov’s and later Thorndike’s and Skinner’s experiments (as explained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095211430494">Kandel, 2006</xref>) were early tests of behavior change and its permanence. Kandel recognizes four kinds of changes: habituation (insignificant stimulus, such as workplace noise); sensitization (shock or fear-producing stimulus), classical conditioning (habituation and sensitization in sequence); and plastic (permanent) change. To cut a long story short, as Kandel tells it with clarity and mastery: behavior can change, both temporarily and permanently. Examples show that the means employed by the profession concern the first three approaches, which do not produce plastic changes.</p>
<p>Psychoanalysts, since Freud, are accustomed to think that interpretation of free-associated stories, here-and-now, can remove symptoms and effect plastic change. This classical intellectual method is still used extensively by many schools of psychoanalytic thought. The Modern Psychoanalytic School (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bgsp.edu">www.bgsp.edu</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cmps.edu">www.cmps.edu</ext-link>) founded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095211430494">Spotnitz (1972)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473095211430494">Meadow (1974)</xref> “begins where Freud left off“ (Spotnitz’s words) and, while adhering to Freud’s theories, claims to have success in treating complex problems with a technique not available in Freud’s time. A notable means is development of trust through narcissistic transference and correctly timed “emotional communications”, which appear to be capable of changing the brain’s neural pathways resulting in plastic change; this is discussed with planning and policy examples in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473095211430494">Talvitie (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095211430494">2008)</xref>. Incidentally, in planning—as in classical psychoanalysis—interpretation from models using data from the past, occasionally supplemented by “stated preferences” (hypothetical here-and-now situations), is the method of evaluating behavior responses and benefits from plans and policies.</p>
<p>A critical issue, which further research has to deal with, is the aim or aims of autoplastic change. Directed behavior modification aims at changes in preferences. Traditional policies and plans have objectives and aims but without changes in the preference structure. Psychoanalysis, whether individual or group, has no directed or intended behavior change aims; the analyst’s responsibility is simply to analyze. In so doing problems or symptoms that motivated the analysand(s) to seek help normally disappear, sometimes not quickly. As a result of the analytic process the analysand feels able to make choices and change—or not change—behavior. There is no benefit-cost or multi-criteria analysis to indicate or suggest a preferred change. Change is a key word in planning and trust is a key for change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1473095211430494">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>How does trust occur or begin to develop?</title>
<p>Many authors agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473095211430494">Stein and Harper (2003)</xref> that trust is essential to the work of planners— “without trust, all will collapse” —and theory and observations support that claim. Over 15 years ago, while working in the World Bank, I attended an international transport conference and sat next to a professional friend whose expertise and knowledge I valued. We listened to various speakers and commentaries and quietly exchanged views on them. One speaker whom I knew well, but my professional friend did not, made a lengthy but ordinary comment with which my friend agreed and thought valuable. I wondered silently why. I made a note of the observation and stored it in my diary with a memo that my friend and the speaker “looked alike”.</p>
<p>About a year later I was sitting in a Minister’s office with a World Bank manager. The financial situation in the country was bad and all the solutions for the transport problems seemed difficult or politically impossible. As we explored the options I was surprised that they agreed on all the issues, about the impossibility of solving them, and about whose fault the circumstances were. I was struck that the Minister and the manager resembled each other; an observation I had also made on previous occasions. Furthermore, I was told that the two, the Minister and the manager, worked well together. This was all the more surprising because I thought that the manager was not acting in the World Bank’s—or the country’s—best interest and, in my opinion, undermined our ability to provide constructive assistance. This was a delicate situation in which I had to choose my words carefully.</p>
<p>A year or so later, in another country, I was meeting with the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance. He invited an assistant he had recently appointed to the meeting. I was struck, not by the beauty of the assistant, but by her look-alike facial features with the Permanent Secretary. I did not suspect any sexually inappropriate behavior, but nepotism did come to mind. I checked afterward to rule out both kinds of relationships.</p>
<p>A hypothesis, which had been evolving in my mind, also from other meetings and events in between, had now convincing experimental proofs: the persons described above saw themselves in each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1473095211430494">12</xref></sup> They were alike, had—superficially—the same ego ideal, and had developed unconsciously narcissistic transference. Similar attitudes, opinions and goodwill to work together—a sense of (small) community—followed. To support my hypothesis I recalled, from Plato’s Symposium, an evolutionary tale told by Aristophanes of the foundation for love: originally there was only one human being who was double of what we are now—four arms and legs, two faces, etc.—and that Zeus cut the double in half; since then the halves—all of us—have a desire for wholeness, we like persons who are like us, our other half.</p>
<p>With (planning) teams the relationships are more complex than described above, but often there are physical similarities between persons, beliefs in the same theories, or other kinds of factors, manifested in similar ego ideals and “goodwill to work together”, that promote narcissistic transference. Careful observations of successful and less successful planning or policy situations, and functioning of the analyst and planner teams and their counterparts, confirm the importance of leaders and trust created through identifications and narcissistic transference. There is no doubt that trust is a key factor in planning and policy, and development of trust between the planners and citizens is one of the first tasks of the planning team. However, while being able to evolve identifications and narcissistic transference are a necessary beginning and basis for developing trust, they are not enough for planning a community—including land use and transport facilities and services—to advance goodwill to working together, and for advancing a just and equal-opportunity society, which also benefit the least-advantaged.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1473095211430494">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Creating trust: Planning structured as a group analysis</title>
<p>In “Theoryless Planning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095211430494">Talvitie, 2009</xref>) I propose a five-step sequence for a restructured planning process. This proposal still holds true and if carried through with a motivated client and skillful planners can create trust for plan implementation. Trust is created in the first two steps, the “Planning contract” and “Narcissistic transference”, discussed below. For the other steps the reader is referred to the above article where I cast the planning process as a Markov chain. Before discussing the issue of trust, it is important to keep in mind that while there is a technique involved in creating trust, it cannot include manipulation, lying, dishonesty or “evil” ends.</p>
<p><italic>The planning contract</italic> refers to the initial period of the work whether it is done by in-house staff or by a consultant. The planning contract is an important step in which the objectives of the work, with necessary delineations for time, budget and other constraints, are detailed and agreed. These should also be discussed with the key interest groups and made public. During the planning contract period a first-round identification of the main issues is made as seen by different interest groups; some alternatives may also be identified. The way the work will be carried out, the preliminary timeline and planned presentations to decision-makers should also be explained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1473095211430494">14</xref></sup> The possibility for modifying the Terms of Reference (TOR), including the timeline, needs to be allowed for good reasons during the work. Otherwise the citizens will not see reasons for participation because they view the TOR as a straightjacket and important decisions as having already been made. Special problems are encountered in developing countries, which are discussed in my 2009 paper and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473095211430494">Gogelia and Talvitie (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>If the planning contract phase is not well handled, affected interests will not participate meaningfully, and plans or consultancy reports will be placed and remain on the shelf—unless, of course, the decision-makers can implement what they want, regardless of public opinion, or can manipulate planning with “strategic misrepresentation”. That approach to planning will not create trust and will have unforeseen repercussions on the sense of community and goodwill for working together. For this reason the citizens must (gradually) become well informed of the planning task and policy issues. Although the internet may be a good means to disseminate information, it is not a preferred means for receiving input, because timely feedback and the group effect are impossible. Public meetings and consultations are indicated. However, ways to contact the planning team should be made available and contact encouraged. A contact should be responded to either in the next meeting or by a short note, which must not be a form letter but a genuine response. There should be recognition of problems and issues and their relative intensity, but no resolution to them should be attempted in this early stage. The planning contract period slides without special notice to the next phase.</p>
<p><italic>Narcissistic transference</italic> is a technical term for a developmental phase in the first two years of life when there are no words and the distinction between self and objects is not clear. In the planning context its purpose is to recognize that, for the participants, opinions are not collective (the internal and the external worlds do not match). Participants are angered if the match is not accepted. As described earlier, narcissistic transference in an individual or a group manifests itself as the appearance of or a desire for an ego-syntonic object, the Aristophanes’ lost double. This phenomenon is the key if the planning contract is to move forward successfully.</p>
<p>There is a long discussion in “Theoryless Planning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095211430494">Talvitie, 2009</xref>) on the various ways narcissistic transference appears in citizen participation meetings. Because public inquiry is most important for trust and for meaningful planning I cite below a paragraph from that paper (p. 199):
<disp-quote>
<p>The affected interests, the subjects of planning, will begin expressing their views and opinions about the issues … in citizen participation events (group meetings). Despite [of] superficial appearance or rationality these testimonials apparently have little to do with the issues or with planning, and there is a general lack of connections to “reality”. The statements and testimonials are unpredictable and inconsistent and reflect the unbelievable web of associations in the unconscious of the participants … is the essence of the case for <italic>theoryless planning</italic> and its universal starting point.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>How can a planning team foster the development of trust through narcissistic transference, which is so important for planning to achieve and serve useful ends? There are some tried-and-tested means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473095211430494">Ormont, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095211430494">Spotnitz, 1985</xref>); applied in the context of public inquiries they include:</p>
<list id="list3-1473095211430494" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Request to talk.</italic></bold> Normally a request to talk is complied with. But, there can be interest groups that do not, especially if there is an early-vocalized solution to a problem or issue. In a meeting on road pricing, a (professional) citizen expressed the view that road pricing should have some relation to costs of service. The organizer/manager, with support from assistants, spoke against the idea and voiced the position that there are other important objectives that road pricing needs to serve. For lack of support the rebuffed citizen went silent and did not cooperate further. In this instance a better way would have been to explore, with others present, the road pricing in a broader context. An opportunity to foster trust was not only lost but repressed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Questions.</italic></bold> In the beginning factual questions are to be preferred. They are means to elicit views about the difficulties of achieving the objectives of the work. For example, in discussing the range of possible solutions a person remarked that the situation reminded him of a situation many years ago. He was asked to elaborate. Many others joined in and gave their views, some different or from a different perspective. A useful exchange among the citizen participants followed. The question was only facilitated but not answered by the planner(s) (they were not parties in the original dispute). The response made that the planners (we?) did not previously handle the problem well and instead now identified (joined) with the citizen views, was accepted.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Explanations.</italic></bold> Explanations in the early phases need to be short. It is useful to utilize computer or other visual aids to answer concrete questions. For example, in reorganizing city street patterns and parking spaces, citizens frequently cannot understand the space requirements. It has helped when they themselves were able arrange the space using a computer or cardboard cars and trucks to comprehend and identify with the planners’ difficulties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1473095211430494">15</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Joining</italic>.</bold> The message conveyed by joining statements is that “I am like you”. Frequently, a participant in public inquiry complains about the uncertainty in forecasts. The best course of action is to agree that there are uncertainties of magnitude that also make planners uncomfortable, and possibly ask the participant what uncertainty is particularly troublesome to him (it will turn out that the participant has very vague ideas about models and uncertainty). These concerns about predictions must not be overwhelmed by information or belittled; later in the planning process opportunities will appear to address the issue. A participant (client) may complain of consultants’ past behavior and its effects on the present malaise. He may be asked to elaborate and on suitable occasions ask if the present consultant (or company) is repeating the past. A useful dialogue is likely to ensue.

<list-item><p><bold><italic>Mirroring.</italic></bold> This is a technique similar to joining. The idea is to act as the double of the speaker. By acting like a participant, imitating him as it were, trust is created. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095211430494">Marshall (2006)</xref> states that mirroring creates the experience of being alike: “Various words describe this experience of sameness, for example, resonance, symbiosis, fusion, twinness, merger, synchrony, or attunement with another person. The [person] comes to know that you are ‘in his shoes’ … [O]ther disciplines use words such as imitation, contagion, empathy, and even mind-reading that encompass the same underlying process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095211430494">Marshall, 2006</xref>: 292). Marshall reviews mirroring in several disciplines, and cites a researcher who claims that there are mirror neurons in the human brain, which “will do for psychology what DNA did for biology” (p. 292). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095211430494">Spotnitz (1972)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095211430494">Marshall (2006)</xref> state that mirroring and joining are ego changing interventions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Dealing with well-educated participants and planners.</italic></bold> There is a danger in public inquiries that well-educated citizens and planners begin flashing their knowledge of received theories by responding to questions with professional jargon. This will alienate the others. The best strategy for the planning team is to analyze silently the behavior, and perhaps grill these “experts”, and try to understand the motivations behind this behavior and to help them understand themselves. Such situations are difficult to handle, but care must be taken not to be co-opted by the behavior but rather distance the planning team from it.</p></list-item>

<p>The contact function<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1473095211430494">16</xref></sup> (defined in the footnote) must be observed throughout the narcissistic phase—in fact in all the phases. The planner team needs to restrict its attention to the issues, views and context the participants bring up. However, sometimes the context or problems require the planning team to bring up new issues. In these cases the team should revert back to contact functioning as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>The narcissistic phase can take a long time, a year or more, even with sustained public participation programs. There is no reason to hurry it up because it is in that phase the basis for trust is created. Eventually <italic>object transference</italic> will emerge, and constructive planning work can start. Warnings must be issued that authoritative interpretations and explanations must be avoided throughout the process, and efforts must be made to keep the interest groups involved and their views on the plans honestly solicited and evaluated to satisfaction, otherwise there is a danger that substantial agreement on plans, to bring forth a sense of community, is not achieved.</p>
<p>The final phase of the planning process is “<italic>cure”</italic>. In the “Theoryless Planning” paper I defined it as follows (p. 202):
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>“Cure”</italic>, the last phase, is one in which the relevant community can freely consider and analyze all the options, both autoplastic and alloplastic, … structure the planning work and the institutions for inclusive voice, and … [choose] the “good things” that are wanted with knowledge and understanding of the “bright and dark sides” of the human drives. … “Cure” is achieved when everyone involved, the planners and the affected interests, have gained an improved understanding about the functioning of … the community … and all have matured to cope better with future problems.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The paper brings a different look to trust in planning from that of the other authors on the topic. But it is fair to say that the problem has not been solved in this paper. I have conflated my experiences with those of others, theories of human development, and writings of renowned authors. Practical planning work along the suggested lines is needed to expand our knowledge and meaning of trust in planning.</p>
<p>It may appear that I have given short shrift to the technical methods of planning and the current planning process. Of course both are needed. I have focused on that part of the planning process that has been ignored, in fact hardly acknowledged to exist. The current planning process works only in the oscillating and object transference phases as I described in my “Theoryless Planning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095211430494">2009</xref>) paper, but even these phases are unfinished because of the neglect of the earliest phase to develop trust. The neglect of trust, necessary for good, just and dynamic plans and processes, is best seen in the difficulties of effecting “cure” to the planning problem in the dynamic sense of the word. Undoubtedly the planning processes need a thorough rethinking.</p>
<p>The tools of planning have served the profession well. They are intellectually engaging with high technical value. Many of them will also be used in the revised process, although in a different way. The issue is not with the technical methods as intellectual products, but the articulation of the transport and planning problems and the application of the methods to approach a compromised way out of them. There are, of course, extant technical methods that need to be developed further. Among them are dynamic transport routing and conveyance of that and other information to the vehicle; asset management; road and congestion pricing and feedback to investments; models for benefit transfers to commerce and land owners or urban hubs, especially from large investments such as railways, metros and motorways; and better conceptual models for equity. There are also development paths that are unlikely to lead to useful results and the profession needs to be on guard to understand the limitations of predicting “the phenomena of life [that] arise from the concurrent and mutually opposing action of both [life and death drives]”.</p>
<p>In all cities and regions in the developed countries there exist planning bodies that have an ongoing technical planning process not substantially dissimilar to the one described earlier. In many places there already exist identifications and transferences among and between planners and citizens. In equally many places implementation of plans is at gridlock. Whatever the circumstances, it is not necessary to start from square one, but the new approach, process and technical methods need to be tailored to fit these circumstances.</p>
<p>A special mention must be made of the developing countries where foreign consultants are hired with a fixed timeline and budget, and a TOR with limited flexibility. Many, if not most consultants, unless they have been involved in a sequence of projects (which is often restricted by procurement rules), act as if there is no time and money for the planning contract and trust (narcissistic transference) phases. Given the relatively high rate of unsatisfactory consultancies for “institutional development” it is my opinion that the time should be taken, even at the risk of not completing the often ambitious objectives of the TOR and achieving the myopic “results mindset” and “performance management” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095211430494">Swain and Tait, 2007</xref>) of the donor entities. There are indications that after a successful completion of the two beginning phases and a good deal of the remaining ones, the client country would request that the uncompleted phases are also completed (a request which the donors often deny or subject to a new round of “competitive bidding”, with unsatisfactory results because it cannot build on the emotional basis developed earlier).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1473095211430494">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Identification through ego ideal and development of trust through narcissistic transference are a necessary base but they are not enough for “cure”: a community (in whatever dimension) with a sense of community (including deliberate land use and transport facilities and service), goodwill of people to work together, and a just and equal-opportunity society, which also benefits the least-advantaged, are also necessary. Part of “cure” also is an improved understanding about the functioning of the community, understanding or tolerance of views of others in the community and, importantly, the skills the planners and the affected interests have gained to cope better with often unpredictable future problems.</p>
<p>Is trust created and fostered by utilitarian calculations and predictability, personal relations and feelings, institutions and knowledge about norms, or abstract qualities of an “external object”; or, by all of them together? Or are all these results from trust imbued by unconscious beliefs? The issue of causality is an important one. Multiple causation (a concept Freud introduced) is the likely answer because causality goes in both directions. It is possible to claim that all the dimensions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095211430494">Swain–Tait (2007)</xref> taxonomy can be collapsed to “external object” and unconscious identifications through ego ideal. But that would be a disservice to their genuine intellectual arguments and the taxonomy of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1473095211430494">Table 1</xref>, and analyses about trust in planning because rational and conscious choices about trust are part of it.</p>
<p>The words that are missing in the Swain–Tait taxonomy are “truth and justice”—although strong themes in that paper, and in the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473095211430494">Stein and Harper (2003)</xref>, and several other references—which have had enduring value in all cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473095211430494">Carveth, 2010</xref>). These words, fundamental to trust, can be contrasted with the prevailing practices of solidarity and power. Misuse of “justice” in the name of solidarity and associated problems of “free ridership” or obtaining secondary gain from perceived discrimination or exclusion are well known. Misuses of “truth” in defining benefits, costs, benefit transfers, and applications of elite capture and power in governments are also well known. My interpretation of historical evidence, and a tacit analysis of the Gini-coefficient, support the notion that a society or a group, which attempts to live in “truth and justice” guided by good enough theories is more enduring and trusting than society or group guided by ideologies of “power and money”.</p>

<p>Taxonomy proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095211430494">Laurian (2009</xref>: 383) is in line with the sociological conceptualization of trust (as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095211430494">Misztal, 1996</xref>: 14). Laurian has a post-modern view of trust and overlooks that “expert systems” of one kind or another and social trust evoked by leaders and prophets (“experts”) have existed throughout history. I use the Swain–Tait taxonomy because it is succinct and, with some tweaking, consistent with my view.</p>

<p>I admit that in spite of good efforts I am unable to follow consistently Foucault’s relativistic, context-specific views and positions. Power and power relations in planning are old concepts and did not fall out of Foucault’s work. Foucault’s work is complex and subtle; no review of it is attempted here. However, Prince Hamlet’s warning, “Madness in great ones must not unwatch’d go” seems advisable when using Foucaldian concepts in planning.</p>

<p>This footnote gives a description in a nutshell of Freud's drive theory. Freud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473095211430494">Freud, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095211430494">Hall, 1954</xref>) divides man's instinctual forces into two classes: the life drive, also called the libido, and the death drive. These never operate in “pure form” but are modified, fused and defused in the maturing (aging) process, by the forces of reality, and many accidental and genetic factors. The life drive, although not observable alone, is responsible for man's highest cultural achievements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473095211430494">Freud, 1930</xref>). The libidinal demands are governed, to a degree, by the “ego”, which the forces of reality forge out of the “id”, the original inherited store of instinctual energy. The ego has a special entity, the super-ego (or ego ideal) –detailed discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473095211430494">LaPlance and Pontalis (1973)</xref>—which, broadly speaking, issues moral demands (prohibitions and ideals) to the ego. “[T]he id and the super-ego have one thing in common: they both represent the influences of the past—the id the influence of heredity, the super-ego the influence, essentially, of what is taken from other people [<italic>parents, teachers</italic>]—whereas the ego is principally determined by the person’s own experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473095211430494">Freud, 1940</xref>: 147). The death drive includes the aggressive trends of men and has the muscular apparatus at its service while the life instinct works in concepts and ideas. An ability to fuse these instincts to allocate, postpone and channel releases of energy in constructive, thoughtful and responsible manner is characteristic of persons who are “rational”; that is, persons whose ego is the master of a substantial part of instinctual energy and whose mental functioning is governed by “reality”; however, mature and rational persons are not free of conflict. The opposites of the mature, integrated personality are “irrational” persons whose prime sources of pleasure are derived from impulsive behavior, compulsively repetitive behavior, excessively narcissistic behavior, or whose sources of pleasure are fixated or regressed to an infantile level of personality development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473095211430494">Talvitie, 1997</xref>). Interested readers should pursue the references given. Initially Freud's introduction of the “death instinct” was met with bewilderment and denial. Today, the acceptance of dual drives, life and death, enjoys wide currency. Spotnitz's extensive survey of the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095211430494">Spotnitz, 1985</xref>) shows the great importance of aggressive drive in human lives.</p>

<p>I am aware of the criticisms of Rawls’ theory. My view is that Rawls’ theory is simply an explanation of the Biblical command translated into present-day moral and political context: “So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets” (Matthew 7:12). The critiques, and Rawls himself, provide valuable explanations and commentary to the “Law and the Prophets”, from their own experiential history. To my knowledge the Biblical command is universal and expressed in different words in all religions.</p>
