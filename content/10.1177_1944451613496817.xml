<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science recently reported that at least 116 million American adults suffer from some degree of chronic pain—more than the total affected by heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451613496817">1</xref></sup> Because of the ubiquity of chronic pain, greater numbers of patients are coming to the ICU for chronic pain issues specifically or in association with other medical conditions. Opioids are the most commonly used agents to address pain and their use has escalated at an exponential rate over the past 30 years. The opioid requirement by chronic pain patients can reach dose levels that become unfamiliar to critical care providers. Consequently, failure to understand the complexities of chronic pain and recognize how pain control can differ in these patients may result in adverse consequences that could increase length of stay, morbidity, and mortality in the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451613496817">2</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section2-1944451613496817">
<title>Neurophysiology of Chronic Pain</title>
<p>Chronic pain results from alterations in the properties and plasticity of both the peripheral and central nervous systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451613496817">3</xref></sup> These changes contribute to induction of a mechanical hypersensitivity state (hyperalgesia) and an ongoing, spontaneous activation of nociceptive pathways (allodynia).</p>
<p>The peripheral nervous system may become sensitized as a result of the release of cytokines associated with peripheral pathway injury. At the molecular level, nerve injury may induce pathological changes in voltage-gated channels expressed in peripheral pathways. Therefore, the most common approach to reducing peripheral inflammatory pain to prevent progression to chronic pain is to inhibit cyclooxygenases (COX) involved in prostaglandin synthesis. Inhibitors of voltage-gated channels such as local anesthetics or opioid analgesics are utilized clinically to prevent progression. Once peripheral sensitization occurs, the same approaches (reduced inflammation and channel inhibition) are also used to ameliorate an established chronic hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>Central sensitization of the spinal cord and brain depend on additional molecular and cellular mechanisms involving the modulation of excitatory <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor systems, loss of inhibitory γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic and glycinergic inhibitory neurons and cell–cell interactions between neurons and surrounding glia. Drugs such as opioids, ketamine, and gabapentinoids modulate these targets to not only ameliorate the symptoms but also modify the pathological progression of chronic pain.</p>

<title>Opioid Analgesics</title>
<p>Opioids are usually the first-line analgesic used to address pain in the hospital. Unfortunately, there are many consequences to their use that can challenge the critical care practitioner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451613496817">4</xref></sup> Opioid tolerance is a hallmark of chronic opioid treatment and the level of tolerance is variable from individual to individual. There are ICU patients in whom pain control does not seem possible with opioids alone; in these situations nonopioid modalities should be employed. Increased dosing of opioids can lead to a higher risk of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, the phenomenon where patients have a heightened sensitivity to noxious stimuli secondary to their prolonged opioid use. Furthermore, it can induce life-threatening respiratory depression that requires continuous monitoring and careful opioid dose titration. The major risk factors involved in opioid-induced respiratory depression in chronic pain patients include renal impairment and pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions causing the unpredictable increase in opioid plasma concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451613496817">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>When a patient has opioid tolerance, it is important to quantify this with opioid conversion into oral morphine equivalents. If this calculation is not made, patients are at risk for adverse consequences such as withdrawal or overdose. Below is a systematic approach to convert opioids for the initial dose estimate:</p>
<list id="list1-1944451613496817" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Step 1: <italic>Calculate the daily opioid requirement</italic>. Include ALL of the oral and intravenous opioids.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step 2: Convert to ORAL MORPHINE using a table or an application. There may be some variability among different reference sources, but they do provide a rough guide for the initial dose estimate. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1944451613496817">Table 1</xref> provides an approximate equianalgesic comparison among several commonly used opioids.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step 3: <italic>Always consider incomplete cross-tolerance</italic>. Cross-tolerance is the extension of physiologic resistance to other opioids, even those to which the body has not been exposed. In most instances, cross-tolerance is incomplete and may range from 20% to 30%.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step 4: <italic>Determine the starting dose</italic>. The goal is to estimate an initial dose that is closest to the patient’s requirements. In this regard, it is important to recognize that overestimating the initial opioid dose can have disastrous consequences. When in doubt, start at a low dose and tailor it as the patient’s pain dictates.</p></list-item>

<p>Hydromorphone is the most commonly used opioid in patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for awake and oriented inpatients because of its potency and minimal hemodynamic effects when compared to morphine. In chronic pain patients, the ability to achieve a comfortable level of analgesia with hydromorphone PCA alone requires administration of a loading dose by bolus prior to the initiation of PCA. A basal infusion rate and a higher demand dose may be necessary in PCA settings for patients with significant tolerance, but caution must be exercised as hepatic/renal metabolism and excretion may not be consistent while in the ICU. Lockout intervals between 5 and 10 minutes are commonly used.</p>
<p>In addition to opioids, it is important to gain an understanding of all the medications that can influence a patient’s analgesic regimen; these include other analgesics, antidepressants, sleep aids and psychotropic medications. These medications can influence a patient’s level of sedation, can alter metabolism through the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathway and can lead to QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.</p>
<sec id="section5-1944451613496817">
<title>Renal Failure</title>
<p>Morphine and hydromorphone are both glucuronidated to metabolites morphine-3-glucuronidate (M3G), morphine-6-glucuronidate (M6G), and hydromorphone-3-glucuronidate (H3G), respectively. M6G is a potent morphine metabolite that can accumulate in patients with renal impairment and cause respiratory depression. Therefore hydromorphone is often favored in patients with renal failure. However, it has been reported that 3-glucuronide metabolites such as M3G and H3G may carry the increased risk of developing neuroexcitatory symptoms, including seizure at accumulated doses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451613496817">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The phenylpiperidine fentanyl has been suggested as an alternative opioid in renal failure as it does not have active metabolites. However, the volume of distribution must be approached in order to maintain an appropriate duration of pain relief. The β (elimination) half-life of fentanyl is similar to hydromorphone—therefore as fentanyl approaches its volume of distribution, its pharmacokinetics behaves similar to that of hydromorphone.</p>
<p>Remifentanil is another option for use as a continuous infusion or in PCA. Because it is an ester and is metabolized by nonspecific esterases, its pharmacokinetics is relatively independent of organ failure. Although levels of these esterases could be diminished in hepatic failure, there has been no clinically significant effect in metabolism noted in patients with hepatic failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1944451613496817">
<title>Delirium</title>
<p>Opioids can contribute to delirium, poor sleep quality, and sedation, particularly in patients with impaired elimination or poor protein binding. Despite reduced sedation usage in most ICU settings because of “sedation holidays,” a recent trial challenging this practice found reduction neither in the duration of mechanical ventilation nor in ICU stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451613496817">7</xref></sup> This study also observed that patients with sedation interruption required statistically higher daily opioid doses and a greater number of opioid boluses per day. The findings highlighted the importance of maintaining a consistent level of analgesia with less fluctuating opioid plasma concentration in the ICU. Delirium is more common in the elderly who are often taking multiple medications and sometimes have difficulty in adjusting to unusual environments. Introduction of periods of darkness and quiet may be beneficial in preserving the natural circadian rhythms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1944451613496817">
<title>Methadone</title>
<p>Methadone has many positive attributes including its long half-life, NMDA antagonism, and serotonin reuptake inhibition activity. However, there are many aspects of this drug that can be dangerous, and the number of adverse events related to this drug is increasing. The bioavailability of the drug with oral administration ranges from 35% to 99%, with a mode at 80%. Much of this depends on CYP450 metabolism, so it is difficult to know how to convert from oral to intravenous dosing for each individual patient. While practice variation exists, with some practitioners choosing to start with 50% of the estimated oral dose, whereas others choose 80% or 100%, patients need to be monitored closely regardless which conversion factor was selected. Conversion of morphine equivalents to methadone is also highly dependent on the level of tolerance and the total 24-hour consumption of morphine. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1944451613496817">Table 2</xref> for approximate values.</p>

<p>The corrected Q-T interval (QTc) should be measured since patients will often be administered other drugs that can also prolong the QTc, such as certain anti-arrhythmics, antipsychotics, antifungals, and antibiotics. There are varying thresholds for what is considered a prolonged QTc interval depending on the formula used to calculate the QTc, and patient factors.

<sec id="section8-1944451613496817">
<title>Transdermal Opioid Delivery Systems</title>
<p>Patients who come to the ICU with transdermal systems can be challenging. There are pros and cons to maintaining versus removing transdermal systems. First, the pharmacokinetics of the drugs will change depending on their clinical state. Sepsis may increase body temperature and thus increase transdermal absorption and plasma concentrations, whereas edema may slow absorption, thus making the pharmacokinetics fluctuate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451613496817">10</xref></sup> For this reason, a practitioner may want to remove a patch in order to use a more consistent route of administration such as the intravenous route. However, the large storage in lipophilic tissue of an opioid such as fentanyl may make cross-titration difficult. For other patients it may be better to keep the patch on, with scheduled changes, to maintain a constant plasma level. Therefore, these decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis weighing the risks and benefits of both approaches. The conversion from oral morphine to transdermal fentanyl is as follows: 100 mg of oral morphine over 24 hours is equal to 50 µg/h fentanyl patch.</p>
<p>Managing a patient with a buprenorphine transdermal therapeutic system patch (BuTrans, Napp Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, UK) can be challenging. Buprenorphine is an opioid agonist/antagonist with a high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor; therefore, a much larger than expected amount of full mu agonism may be required to provide analgesia. The half-life of buprenorphine is 20 to 70 hours, and therefore, it might take a week or more (5 half-lives) before the effect of the buprenorphine has dissipated.</p>
<p>Initiation of transdermal opioid patches is not suitable for the acute setting and should not be done in the ICU because of the long lag times to attain and recover from effective blood concentrations. In addition, as noted above, unpredictable skin absorption and bioavailability may occur in febrile or edematous patients.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section9-1944451613496817">
<title>Nonopioid Analgesics</title>
<p>Multimodal analgesia is a pain management strategy based on the concept of modulation of nociceptive targets at various levels within the nociceptive pathway. By using multiple agents to reduce nociceptive input at peripheral, spinal cord, or central nervous system level, this approach can produce additive and even synergistic antinociceptive effect at lower doses, thus reducing the potential undesirable side effects of each agent. Nonopioid analgesics are excellent multimodal adjuvants to use with opioids in the treatment of acute and chronic pain. These include COX inhibitors (including acetaminophen), NMDA antagonists, gabapentanoids, and systemic local anesthetics.</p>
<sec id="section10-1944451613496817">
<title>COX Inhibitors</title>
<p>Commonly known as nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, these agents act as excellent nonopioid adjuvants, and should be more precisely grouped as (<italic>a</italic>) nonselective COX inhibitors, (<italic>b</italic>) selective COX-2 inhibitors, and (<italic>c</italic>) proposed COX-3 inhibitor, acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen provides analgesia by blocking central production of prostaglandins. In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration approved intravenous acetaminophen for clinical use in the United States. Oral and suppository acetaminophen may also be used in the ICU patient, at a total daily dose no more than 4 g per day in patients without history of liver dysfunction and 2 g per day in those with active hepatitis, active alcohol consumption, or renal failure. It should not be used in acute liver failure.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen toxicity must also be taken into account when prescribing acetaminophen-containing oral analgesics such as Norco, Vicodin, Lortab, and so on. The Food and Drug Administration has mandated that these compound medications contain no more than 325 mg of acetaminophen starting in 2014. This measure, along with continued education about acetaminophen toxicity, should help prevent inadvertent liver toxicity from acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Ketorolac is a commonly used nonselective COX inhibitor available as an intravenous formulation. However, it should be used with caution in patients with active bleeding, platelet dysfunction, and coexisting liver or renal disease.</p>
<p>The COX-2 inhibitors can be useful in certain patient conditions despite a well-documented increase in cardiovascular events associated with the administration of COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx). Nevertheless, patients without history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular accident, and age &lt;65 years COX-2 inhibiters can be considered. The risk of renal dysfunction and gastritis still exists, but not to the same degree as the COX-1 inhibitors. Furthermore, cardiovascular risks associated with COX-2 inhibitors take effect after 1 month of daily use. Therefore, these medications may be used in specific cases where the benefits outweigh the risks for a short period (ie, less than 2 weeks).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1944451613496817">
<title>Ketamine</title>
<p>Intravenous low-dose ketamine infusions have been successfully used as an excellent supplement in the patients with high preexisting opioid requirement or escalating doses of intravenous opioids in the ICU. Ketamine is NMDA receptor antagonist with minimal respiratory drive depression at low dose. It is reported that ketamine also interacts with opioid, noradrenergic receptors, and voltage-sensitive calcium channels, and is known to have preemptive and preventive analgesic effects and reduce opioid consumption. To limit the undesirable side effects such as psychomotor agitation, diplopia, illusions or disturbing dreams, the most common parenteral dosing regimen for ketamine in the acute setting is 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/h (or 2-5 µg/kg/min). A 0.5 mg/kg loading dose is often recommended. Ketamine is contraindicated in patients with history of seizure disorder, increased intracranial pressure, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder.</p>

<sec id="section12-1944451613496817">
<title>Gabapentinoids</title>
<p>Perioperative oral administration of gabapentinoids, such as gabapentin and pregabalin has been shown to provide additional sedation and reduce the development of chronic postsurgical pain syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451613496817">11</xref></sup> However, gabapentin and pregabalin can only be taken in an oral form.

<title>Nonopioid Topical Agents</title>
<p>Lidocaine (5%) patches or ointment can be applied to the intact skin for lumbago, rib fractures, or peri-incisional pain. It should not be applied over a break in the skin; local anesthetic systemic toxicity is a concern with these patches.</p>
<p>Diclofenac (1.3%) patches of (1%) gel can be used for musculoskeletal pain barring any contraindications such as renal dysfunction, gastritis, and bleeding. There is minimal systemic absorption with this agent but providers should be aware that systemic side effects can occur.</p>

<title>Regional Anesthesia</title>
<p>Thoracic epidural analgesia has developed as the gold standard for acute postoperative pain control in patients undergoing thoracic or abdominal surgery and in trauma patients with chest wall injury or pulmonary contusion. It has been shown to provide superior analgesia with reduced systemic opioid usage, reduced pulmonary morbidity, decreased duration of mechanical ventilation and postoperative ileus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451613496817">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, familiarity with the American Society for Regional Anesthesia anticoagulation guidelines is essential if an epidural is planned in the ICU. Relatively strong contraindications for the placement or removal of an epidural catheter include the following: administration of most anticoagulants, direct thrombin inhibitors, antiplatelet drugs (clopidogrel, ticlopidine), IIB/IIA inhibitors and thrombolytic agents, international normalized ratio &gt;1.5, platelet count &lt;80 000, and active infection at the insertion site. ICU team members must remain vigilant for the potential neurologic complications such as epidural hematoma or infection that fortunately occur rarely with this technique.</p>
<p>For epidural infusion, the commonly used local anesthetics include 0.05% to 2% Bupivacaine and 0.1% to 0.2% ropivacaine; the common epidural opioids are fentanyl (1-4 µg/mL), hydromorphone (10-50 µg/mL), and morphine (20-100 µg/mL). Epidural opioids have different pharmacodynamics depending on whether they distribute primarily in fatty tissue or in the aqueous phase (cerebrospinal fluid). In contrast to lipophilic opioids (ie, fentanyl), hydrophilic opioids such as morphine and hydromorphone can maintain high cerebrospinal fluid levels for an extended period of time, and may result in delayed profound central nervous system effects.</p>
<p>There is emerging evidence that the less labor-intensive, non-neuraxial regional analgesic techniques can be as equally effective as epidural analgesia in appropriately selected patients. These alternatives include (<italic>a</italic>) paravertebral block for multiple rib fractures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451613496817">13</xref></sup> or thoracotomy and (<italic>b</italic>) transversus abdominis plane block for lower abdominal surgery, including major obstetric or gynecological surgery. Under ultrasound guidance these procedures have been safely performed in some patients even with significant coagulopathy.</p>
<p>In addition to providing excellent supplemental analgesia in ICU, peripheral nerve block may play a role in increasing tissue perfusion secondary to sympathectomy. It has been reported that continuous brachial plexus block can provide therapeutic distal limb perfusion after the hand reconstruction surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451613496817">14</xref></sup> or neonatal limb ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451613496817">15</xref></sup> Therefore sympathetic blockade may be used as an alternative therapy in ICU for patients who require limb salvage after hand transplantation, complicated limb surgery, or traumatic injury.</p>

<title>Management of Implanted Pain Device</title>
<p>Any patient who presents to the ICU with an intrathecal pump drug delivery dosage should be maintained without alteration during the ICU stay. Additional multimodal management will probably be required for acute pain control. These devices can be used in a MRI, but should be interrogated afterward to ensure that they are still functioning as originally programmed. Alterations in the infusion rate or medications should only be processed by a pain specialist. Further details of management of these devices can be found in an article published in the <italic>ICU Director</italic> previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451613496817">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is a growing need for more education on chronic pain management in the ICU. Ensuring chronic pain patient safety and comfort is associated with improved clinical outcome. How to reliably gauge the comfort level in critically ill patients remains a barrier to quality of patient care in the ICU, despite the myriad clinical nonverbal assessment tools that have been developed. Because of the complexity of chronic pain, a multidisciplinary team should be involved addressing not only nociception but also the psychological and physical therapy aspects to functional recovery.</p>
<p>Conventional therapy aims to ameliorate the symptoms of chronic pain. It has been shown recently that transplantation of embryonic GABAergic interneurons into the mouse spinal cord resulted in the reversal of neuropathic pain after functional integration into the host.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451613496817">17</xref></sup> Human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells can divide indefinitely in culture, while retaining their pluripotency to generate all the cell lineages of the human body. For this reason, human pluripotent stem cells may revolutionize our treatment of chronic pain by modifying the pathology of the disease.</p>
