<p>Norman Denzin begins this book by reporting that C. Wright Mills’ <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468794111436150">1959</xref>) was his ‘bible’ when he entered graduate school in 1963. He reports that Mills ‘implied that we could change history by inserting ourselves into it. If we did not do this, history would go on behind our backs’ (p. 9). From this Denzin inherited the commitment, following Marx, to ‘change society, not just interpret or write about’ it. This has finally led him to the conclusion that ‘qualitative research is a moral, allegorical, and therapeutic project’ (p. 16). As the subtitle of Denzin’s book indicates, it is intended to be a call to arms, ‘directed to all scholars who believe in the connection between critical inquiry and social justice’, a form of inquiry that he sees as ‘under attack from many different sides: from the evidence- and science-based research movements on the one hand, to postpositivists, mixed methods, and traditional qualitative researchers on the other side’ (pp. 10–11). In the same spirit, Denzin’s previous book was entitled <italic>Qualitative Inquiry Under Fire</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111436150">Denzin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>His latest book covers a range of topics related to this theme. The opening chapters outline his vision of the past and future of qualitative research, and what he envisages as its global role in bringing about social change that would, quoting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468794111436150">Stanfield (2006</xref>: 725), ‘improve quality of life . . . for the oppressed, marginalized, stigmatized and ignored . . . and . . . bring about healing, reconciliation and restoration between the researcher and the researched’ (p. 9). Subsequent chapters discuss the teaching of qualitative inquiry, the issue of ethics and ethical regulation, and problems with producing and publishing ‘experimental texts’. The penultimate chapter provides ‘templates for social justice inquiry’. Appendices supply a ‘teaching template’ and an ethical code for qualitative researchers.</p>
<p>There are major problems with this book:</p>
<list id="list1-1468794111436150" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The quality of the scholarship is poor. Concepts (ethics, politics, positivism, pragmatism, science, etc.) are used in ways that are sloppy and tendentious, perhaps partly illustrating what happens when scholars seek to reinvent themselves as poets and political revolutionaries. There is also frequent misrepresentation of sources. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794111436150">Feuer et al. (2002)</xref> are described as asserting that ‘qualitative research is non-scientific, should not receive federal funds and is of little value in the social policy arena’ (p. 11). But these authors do not say this, they argue that qualitative inquiry should be scientific and has an important role to play. Becker’s article ‘Whose side are we on?’ is severely misrepresented (p. 28), in the usual fashion, as advocating partisanship (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111436150">Hammersley, 2001</xref>). There are also frequent typographical errors, starting with ‘bicoleurs’ on the contents page, and there are references missing from the end. Denzin’s scholarship has been challenged elsewhere in the pages of this journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794111436150">Fielding, 2010</xref>); what is on display here is more of the same.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Denzin claims to speak on behalf of qualitative research, yet what he promotes is far from being the only, or the most cogent, conception of its goal and character. He presents his vision of it as the leading edge of a historical trend and as representing the future. The adoption of this historicist trope means that there is no serious engagement with other approaches, their value is occasionally dismissed but generally just implicitly denied.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A fundamental problem with his position is that it negates the very character of research, since he denies that there is any distinction between fiction and non-fiction (p. 30), and asserts that the warrant for qualitative work lies in its political impact. On this view, there can be no difference between social science, literature, and political activism; and his account of his teaching of ‘advanced qualitative methods’ seems to confirm this.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Denzin’s political values are vague and incoherent. The values he cites are presented in the most vacuous terms: the aim is to achieve ‘social justice’ (p. 42 and elsewhere), to ‘change the world in positive ways’, to achieve ‘free democratic society’ (p. 25), to promote the ‘general welfare of society’ (p. 121). We do not know whether what is proposed here amounts to radical liberalism, socialism, or anarchism. Even so, contradictions emerge. We are told that ‘the focus will be on human beings as universal singulars, individuals and groups universalizing in their singularity the transformative life experiences of their historical moment’ (p. 12), and yet Denzin claims to be advocating a communitarian ethics. In one place we are told that the researcher should tell the truth (p. 50) and that this will often cause harm (p. 80), then in another that researchers must avoid causing harm (pp. 80 and 122). This and other contradictions do not seem to trouble Denzin.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The accounts he presents of other positions, both those that oppose his own as well as the sources on which he claims to draw, are simplistic and/or inaccurate. We get many labels, including bizarre ones like ‘Chicago school neopostpositivism’ (p. 37), and stock arguments like ‘it is impossible to keep politics out of science’ (p. 105), without any engagement with the complexities of the issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111436150">Hammersley, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111436150">2001</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Denzin insists on the need for dialogue, but as already noted he never engages seriously with the arguments of his opponents. Indeed, he claims that different paradigms are incommensurable (p. 48), which would presumably imply that dialogue is impossible. In effect, he acts as recruiting sergeant for a ‘social justice’ crusade, suggesting that all qualitative researchers are under an obligation to join it (p. 115). They are not, and there are very good reasons for them not to do so.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The political strategy implied by his discussion is naive. ‘The goal is to provoke change, to create texts that play across gender and race, utopian texts that involve readers and audiences in this passion, moving them to action’ (p. 116). ‘Critical qualitative research’ is, it seems, capable of changing the world, its ‘relentless march’ is able to promote ‘human dignity, human rights, and just societies around the globe’ (p. 12): ‘at its best, qualitative research advances human rights by seeking and telling the truth about what particular people do in their everyday lives and about what their actions mean to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111436150">Erickson, 2009</xref>: 1)’ (p. 50). Apparently, revealing injustices is sufficient to generate opposition that will overturn them. Given the political goals Denzin expresses, an immediate question that arises is: on what grounds does he believe, implausibly, that qualitative research, or any kind of enquiry, is the most effective strategy? One is tempted to suggest that further lessons could have been learned from Marx. What we get here is a worse case of ‘infantile leftism’ than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468794111436150">Lenin (1950)</xref> could ever have imagined. Revolutionary action seems to amount to the presentation of psychodramas in university classrooms, and the publication of ‘experimental’ texts. On one side, there is little recognition of the deep-seatedness of ideological determination (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111436150">Fay, 1987</xref>); on the other, the sort of ‘pedagogy’ recommended appears to be highly didactic; at one point Denzin declares that what is required is a ‘writing form that . . . tells by showing’ (p. 12). How this could be justified in constructionist terms remains to be seen.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is little clarity about the nature of what it is that needs to be remedied, and even less understanding displayed of the diverse and complex social and political contexts in which remedial action would have to take place, and of what this would involve. For all its allusions to postmodernist sources, there is no understanding shown here of the intellectual and political traumas out of which those ideas emerged in France in the 1960s and 1970s; notably, the failure of the Communist Party to live up to its mission, and recognition that this mission was itself oppressive. Instead, what we get is, for example: ‘Postmodern democracy cannot succeed unless critical qualitative scholars are able to transcend the limitations and constraints of a lingering, politically conservative postpositivism’ (p. 14).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The only virtue of this book is that it underlines the urgency of deciding what sort of enterprise qualitative research should be, and illustrates the sharply discrepant positions among which we must choose. Fortunately, the options are not restricted to Denzin’s infantile leftism and his caricature of post-positivism. There is a wide range of possibilities, not least a Weberian insistence on the proper limits of social science. Of course, how much scope there will be for us to control the nature of what we do in the future remains to be seen. Denzin is correct that we face severe threats, even if his diagnosis and remedy are defective. For me, the threats come from creeping ‘strategic management’ and ‘ethical regulation’, deriving from the shifting role of universities within current societies and the increasing subordination of state politics to a commercial logic. Events may yet surprise us, but we will need to think much more clearly and carefully than Denzin does here to make use of whatever opportunities emerge. Above all, we need to get right what it is we are defending. So, if this book exemplifies how qualitative research is to be in the future, count me out. What is proposed simply makes a bad situation worse.</p>
