<abstract>
<p>The present study examines treatment length and timing of exposure from two child anxiety disorders clinics. Data regarding symptoms and treatment characteristics for 28 youth were prospectively obtained through self, parent, and therapist report at each session. Information regarding length of treatment, timing of exposure initiation, and drop-out rates were compared with those obtained through efficacy and effectiveness trials of manualized treatment for anxious youth. Findings from the authors’ clinical data revealed significantly shorter treatment duration with exposures implemented sooner than in the previous studies. Dropout rates were significantly higher than in the efficacy trial but comparable with the effectiveness trial. Outcome data from a subset of eight patients revealed large effect sizes. These findings suggest that effective treatment can be shorter and more focused on exposure than is often outlined in manuals and have important implications for outcome research and dissemination.</p>

<p>According to epidemiological data, anxiety disorders are among the most common childhood mental health diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512456546">Merikangas &amp; Avenevoli, 2002</xref>) with lifetime prevalence rates ranging from 6% to 15% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512456546">Silverman &amp; Ginsburg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512456546">U.S. Public Health Service, 2000</xref>). Anxiety disorders cause substantial impairment across a variety of domains of functioning (e.g., academic, social, familial); are highly comorbid with other anxiety, emotional, and behavioral disorders; and often persist into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512456546">Anderson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512456546">Chorpita &amp; Southam-Gerow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512456546">Mendlowicz &amp; Stein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512456546">Quilty, Van Ameringen, Mancini, Oakman, &amp; Farvolden, 2003</xref>). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for childhood anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512456546">Compton et al., 2010</xref>); however, the need for increased focus on external validity through effectiveness studies has recently been emphasized, particularly given meta-analytic findings that treatments deemed efficacious may not hold up in effectiveness trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512456546">Chorpita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512456546">Weisz, Donenberg, Han, &amp; Weiss, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445512456546">Weisz &amp; Jensen, 2001</xref>). Such findings (or lack thereof) call into question the transportability of manualized treatment to clinical practice.</p>
<p>The treatment manual most widely used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of childhood anxiety treatment is the Coping Cat (CC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512456546">Kendall, 2000</xref>). This empirically supported treatment is currently the gold standard protocol for treating anxious youth. It prescribes 16 to 20 sessions, the first half of which focuses on psychoeducation, emotional awareness, relaxation, and cognitive restructuring, whereas the latter half focuses on facing fears through exposures. In a recent RCT conducted by Walkup and colleagues (2008) comparing CBT, sertraline, and their combination to a pill placebo, a condensed 12-session version of CC was found to be superior to placebo but less effective than combined treatment. However, in two recent effectiveness studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512456546">Barrington, Prior, Richardson, &amp; Allen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512456546">Southam-Gerow et al., 2010</xref>), CC failed to demonstrate superiority over usual care with respect to percentage of youth no longer meeting criteria for an anxiety disorder. Southam-Gerow and colleagues commented on the fact that only 54.2% of the youth in the CBT condition received the full 16 sessions and only 58% received exposure therapy, which is thought to be central to anxiety disorder treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512456546">Chorpita &amp; Southam-Gerow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512456546">Davis &amp; Ollendick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512456546">Kendall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512456546">Silverman &amp; Kurtines, 1996</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the CBT group would have demonstrated greater effects had more of the youth received exposure or a larger dose of it.</p>
<p>In contrast to CC, other researchers have emphasized the use of exposure earlier in treatment and de-emphasized the use of other anxiety management techniques. For example, a multiple baseline study provides initial support for the efficacy of a modular approach that reviews psychoeducation and constructs a fear hierarchy before initiating exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512456546">Chorpita, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512456546">Chorpita, Taylor, Francis, Moffitt, &amp; Austin, 2004</xref>). A retrospective examination of outpatient treatment of child anxiety disorders consistent with the modularized approach found that when exposures were initiated by approximately the third session, large treatment effect sizes could be obtained in roughly half the sessions of CC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512456546">Vande Voort, Svecova, Brown Jacobsen, &amp; Whiteside, 2010</xref>). Moreover, they found that the more time the clinician dedicated to anxiety management strategies such as cognitive techniques, the less time was spent on exposures. This finding was particularly important, as the number of exposures correlated positively with improvements in functioning, whereas the use of other anxiety management techniques correlated negatively with this outcome. The authors concluded that a shorter and more flexible treatment approach than what is prescribed in manuals for anxiety disorders can be effective for at least some children.</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512456546">Vande Voort and colleagues (2010)</xref> demonstrated that it is <italic>possible</italic> to effect improvement with shorter, more exposure-focused treatment, the degree to which these patients are representative of children with anxiety disorders is unknown because the sample was restricted to treatment completers. Specifically, it is possible that the patients in the study were atypically receptive to exposures and that many other patients dropped out of treatment because they either found it unacceptable or did not respond effectively and were subsequently excluded from the sample. The current study was designed to build on the previous findings by prospectively examining the course of clinic-based treatment for childhood anxiety disorders. This methodology allowed for examination of treatment adherence, more accurate documentation of treatment components, and collection of symptom data throughout the intervention. We hypothesized that (a) treatment will, on average, consist of fewer sessions and implement exposure earlier than recommended in treatment manuals, (b) a greater percentage of patients will receive exposure therapy than has been achieved in effectiveness trials of manualized treatment, and (c) dropout rates will be similar to those in effectiveness trials.</p>

<sec id="section2-0145445512456546">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data regarding 28 consecutive child patients (17 male, 60.7%) ranging in age from 6 to 18 years (<italic>M</italic> = 10.89, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.53) seen in two outpatient clinics for an anxiety disorder were collected under an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol. The majority of children were Caucasian (82.1%; 3.6% African American, 14.3% unidentified). Parents were predominately married and had some postsecondary education. A doctoral level clinical psychologist, supervised master’s level clinician, or child psychiatrist made diagnoses after an evaluation as part of regular clinical practice. Diagnoses were determined for all patients consistent with the criteria outlined in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512456546">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). The majority of the patients had a primary anxiety disorder (27, 96.4%), although many had multiple diagnoses (14, 40%). The most common anxiety diagnosis was obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; 25%), followed by separation and generalized anxiety disorders (17.9% each).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145445512456546">
<title>Treatment</title>
<p>Treatment was provided by one of five therapists within the two programs: three licensed doctoral level clinical psychologists specializing in the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders and two master’s level therapists supervised by one of the psychologists. All therapists had detailed knowledge of and experience using treatment manuals (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512456546">Chorpita, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512456546">Kendall, 2000</xref>) and provided CBT, including exposures. The treatment approach was consistent with Chorpita’s modularized approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145445512456546">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>As part of the standard assessment procedure in the anxiety disorders clinics, all children and their parent(s) completed a variety of questionnaires, including a demographic form and standardized measures assessing anxiety symptom severity, functional impairment, and various additional measures not used in the present study. Beginning at the first treatment session following the assessment, the child, a parent, and the therapist completed a data entry form. All patients with a primary anxiety disorder were eligible; one family did not allow data to be used for research purposes and was excluded. The child and a parent completed a questionnaire at the beginning of each session that included idiographic questions about symptom severity and impairment. At the end of each session, the therapist recorded the treatment techniques (e.g., relaxation, cognitive restructuring, exposure) that had been implemented during the session. The reliability of clinician ratings for implementation of exposure was examined for 25% of patients by a trained assistant through a retrospective chart review using the procedure from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512456546">Vande Voort et al., 2010</xref>). The agreement level between the rater and the therapist was 84.8%, demonstrating good reliability.</p>
<p>Data collection continued until the treatment of the presenting anxiety complaint was completed or the patient dropped out of therapy. Information regarding the final disposition was gathered through a chart review with a patient considered a “dropout” if the last session attended did not include a discussion of having met treatment goals and agreement among the clinician, child, and parent(s) that further treatment was not necessary. Additional sessions for other presenting complaints (i.e., adjustment issues) or booster sessions were not included in the present analyses.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-0145445512456546">
<title>Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS)</title>
<p>The SCAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445512456546">Spence, 1998</xref>) is a Likert-type measure ranging from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 3 (<italic>always</italic>) of anxiety symptoms completed by the child (45 items) or parent (SCAS-P, 38 items; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512456546">Nauta et al., 2004</xref>). Although the SCAS-P has six basic scales, only the total score was included in the present study. High internal consistency and validity data have been demonstrated for the SCAS, including group differences between clinical versus nonclinical samples, convergent validity with other anxiety measures, and discriminant validity with measures of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512456546">Muris, Merckelbach, Ollendick, King, &amp; Bogie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445512456546">Muris, Schmidt, &amp; Merckelbach, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445512456546">Spence, 1998</xref>). Similar support demonstrating internal consistency, parent–child agreement, as well as convergent and discriminant validity also exists for the SCAS-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512456546">Nauta et al., 2004</xref>). The internal consistency in the current sample for the SCAS and SCAS-P were .87 and .91, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section7-0145445512456546">
<title>Child Sheehan Disability Scale (CSDS)</title>
<p>The CSDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445512456546">Whiteside, 2009</xref>) measures the extent to which a child’s anxiety symptoms interfere with daily functioning. The CSDS is an adaptation of the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512456546">Sheehan, 1986</xref>) and consists of items inquiring about the degree to which the child’s anxiety symptoms interfere with school, social, and family functioning. As on the SDS, items are measured on an 11-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 10 (<italic>very, very much</italic>). A 5-item parent version (CSDS-P) assesses the degree to which the parent perceives the child’s anxiety symptoms to be interfering with the child’s, as well as the parent’s, school/work, social, and family functioning.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145445512456546">
<title>Idiographic Anxiety Questionnaire</title>
<p>The child and a parent provided ratings of anxiety severity and impairment at each session. At the initial appointment, the therapist worked with the child and parent to identify the child’s primary anxiety symptom. The child and parent then rated the severity of that symptom and the degree to which that symptom interfered with functioning on an 11-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 10 (<italic>extremely</italic>). At each subsequent session, the parent and child rated the severity of the child’s anxiety symptoms and associated impairment since the last visit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145445512456546">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>The characteristics of treatment were benchmarked against two studies that represent state of the art research on the gold standard manualized treatment, CC, in terms of efficacy (Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study; CAMS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512456546">Compton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445512456546">Walkup et al., 2008</xref>) and effectiveness (ES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512456546">Southam-Gerow et al., 2010</xref>). Single-sample t-tests were used to compare the number of sessions, the session in which exposure exercises were begun, and rate of attrition in the current sample with the previous studies. To examine treatment outcome, paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare symptom and interference ratings at the first session with those gathered at the final session within a subsample of patients with complete data.</p>

<sec id="section11-0145445512456546">
<title>Baseline Data</title>
<p>At baseline, the intent-to-treat (ITT) sample of children had mean anxiety severity levels in the moderate range, as measured by the SCAS parent (<italic>M</italic> = 31.09, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.58) and child (<italic>M</italic> = 33.39, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.41) reports. Functional impairment scores, as measured by the CSDS, were similar to previously reported clinical scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445512456546">Whiteside, 2009</xref>; <italic>M</italic> = 12.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.50 for child report; <italic>M</italic> = 19.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.62 for parent report).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0145445512456546">
<title>Treatment Descriptions</title>
<p>The length of treatment for anxiety disorders ranged from 1 to 32 sessions with an average of 7.89 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.9) sessions, which is significantly less than the 12-session protocol in the CAMS, <italic>t</italic>(27) = −3.71, <italic>p</italic> = .001, and the 14-session mean treatment length in the ES, <italic>t</italic>(27) = −5.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The median and modal number of sessions was 6, and 53.4% of patients attended 6 or fewer sessions. Information regarding the session in which exposures were first implemented was available for 25 patients. All received exposure therapy—significantly more than the 58% who received exposure therapy in the ES, binomial test (24), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In addition, the mean session number in which exposures began in the clinic, 1.92 (<italic>SD</italic> = .91), was significantly sooner than in the CAMS study (Session 7), <italic>t</italic>(24) = −27.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, with all patients beginning exposures by the fourth session.</p>
<p>Given that exposures are typically prescribed earlier in manuals for OCD than other anxiety disorders, the session in which exposure was initiated was examined separately for patients with (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and without OCD (<italic>n</italic> = 18). The mean session in which exposure was initiated did not differ between the OCD (2.29; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.11) and non-OCD (1.78; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.81) patients, <italic>t</italic>(23) = 1.27, <italic>p</italic> = .217.</p>

<title>Treatment Dropouts</title>
<p>Of the initial 28 patients, 16 (57.1%) successfully completed treatment based on chart review. This completion rate is significantly lower than the 95.7% in the CAMS study, binomial test (27), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and not significantly different from the rate of 54.2% receiving the full 16 sessions in the ES, binomial test (27), <italic>p</italic> = .453.</p>

<title>Treatment Outcome</title>
<p>Outcome analyses were completed with the eight patients for whom complete session-by-session data were available. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145445512456546">Figure 1</xref> presents mean child- and parent-reported idiographic anxiety and interference ratings at each session. The effectiveness of treatment was analyzed through paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests comparing pre- and post-treatment idiographic anxiety and interference ratings. Significant pre–post reductions were found for parent-reported anxiety ratings (pre = 6.88 [2.64], post = 2.75 [1.49]), <italic>t</italic>(7) = 3.78, <italic>p</italic> = .007, and interference ratings (pre = 5.75 [3.33], post = 1.75 [1.04]), <italic>t</italic>(7) = 3.23, <italic>p</italic> = .014, and for child-reported anxiety ratings (pre = 6.25 [4.13], post = 2.00 [2.27]), <italic>t</italic>(7) = 3.19, <italic>p</italic> = .015. The reduction in mean child-reported idiographic interference ratings was not significant (pre = 4.13 [3.87], post = 1.63 [1.69]), <italic>t</italic>(7) = 1.93, <italic>p</italic> = .095. Consistent with the CAMS, effect sizes were computed using Hedges’s <italic>g</italic>, which is bias corrected and more appropriate for small sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445512456546">Grissom &amp; Kim, 2005</xref>). These effect sizes, as well as the effect sizes found in previous RCTs, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145445512456546">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512456546">Cohen (1977)</xref> suggested that effect size magnitudes of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80 correspond to small, medium, and large effects, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study compared exposure-focused treatment with efficacy and effectiveness trials of manualized intervention for childhood anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512456546">Southam-Gerow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445512456546">Walkup et al., 2008</xref>). Similar to a previous examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512456546">Vande Voort et al., 2010</xref>), we found that treatment introducing exposures earlier and consisting of fewer sessions than CC was effective in reducing anxiety symptoms and associated impairment. Moreover, although attrition was substantially greater than that found in a well-controlled efficacy trial, it was similar to rates in an effectiveness study. In addition, significantly more patients received at least an introduction to exposure therapy in the current sample compared with clinic-based CC. Therefore, introducing exposures early in treatment does not necessarily lead to higher attrition and has the potential to improve clinic outcomes by increasing the number of patients introduced to exposure.</p>
<p>The current results raise the possibility that exposure exercises can be introduced into treatment earlier than what is prescribed in the most heavily researched treatment manual. Although most protocols include the use of exposure, this technique is often instituted after multiple sessions spent introducing alternative anxiety coping strategies (e.g., relaxation, cognitive restructuring). The inclusion of these strategies is designed to directly reduce symptoms, increase engagement in treatment, and facilitate maintenance of gains. In contrast, there is some evidence to suggest that breathing retraining, relaxation, and cognitive coping are either unnecessary or related to poorer outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512456546">Craske &amp; Barlow, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512456546">Deacon &amp; Abramowitz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512456546">Vande Voort et al., 2010</xref>). The similar levels of attrition and the large treatment effect sizes associated with exposure-focused treatment relative to CC administered in a clinical setting do not support the assumption that additional anxiety coping strategies must precede the introduction of exposure exercises. As such, these findings highlight the need for dismantling studies to determine the extent to which nonexposure anxiety management techniques are necessary.</p>
<p>Determining the appropriate combination of treatment components and order in which they are implemented has important implications for improving interventions for children with anxiety disorders. To begin with, exposure exercises are thought to be a key component in the treatment of anxiety disorders and may be the primary mechanism of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512456546">Beidel, Turner, &amp; Morris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512456546">Davis &amp; Ollendick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512456546">Kendall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445512456546">Salcioglu, Basoglu, &amp; Livanou, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512456546">Silverman &amp; Kurtines, 1996</xref>). The fact that more than half of the patients in the current study and the comparison effectiveness trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512456546">Southam-Gerow et al., 2010</xref>) discontinued treatment before the session in which exposures are recommended to begin in CC suggests that many children will not receive the most important treatment component even if they receive treatment consistent with the most recent research. Alternatively, although it may not be essential to begin with nonexposure techniques, they may increase acceptability of exposures among patients who are treatment resistant or provide patients with more skills to handle future anxiety problems. To be sure, more research is needed to clarify the role of such techniques.</p>
<p>The current findings may also have implications for improving the dissemination of effective treatments. The fact that few clinicians who describe their therapeutic orientation as cognitive behavioral actually use exposure regularly when treating anxiety disorders is concerning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445512456546">Freiheit, Vye, Swan, &amp; Cady, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512456546">Goisman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445512456546">Valderhaug, Gotestam, &amp; Larsson, 2004</xref>). Lack of knowledge, lack of adequate training in exposure therapy, fear of patient dropout, ease of administration of alternative techniques, and clinician discomfort with inducing anxiety in their patients are all potential explanations for why exposure is infrequently being implemented. Thus, more education and a greater emphasis on exposures in treatment manuals are necessary. As previously discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512456546">Vande Voort and colleagues (2010)</xref>, the low rate of empirically based treatment in clinical practice should not be solely attributed to therapist factors as there appears to be some merit to clinician concerns that manualized treatments are too long and inflexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512456546">Addis, 2002</xref>). These views are further supported by the fact that many patients may achieve significant symptom relief in 6 to 10 sessions without receiving all prescribed treatment components. An approach that begins with exposures and has the flexibility to add additional techniques as needed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512456546">Chorpita, 2007</xref>) may not only be more acceptable to clinicians, it may also be more effective and cost-efficient in clinical settings.</p>
<p>The present study is not without its limitations. To begin with, the current study was based on a small sample size and needs to be replicated in a larger, more diverse sample. Second, the diagnoses were not based on a structured interview, which raises the possibility that the current sample differed from the previous trials in important ways, such as in symptom severity. However, the intention of this line of research is to inform the development of evidence-based treatment from a clinical perspective. As such, the current sample likely bears a close resemblance to patients seen by practitioners in outpatient clinics who are the targets of dissemination. Third, because the current study was descriptive and lacked a comparison group, it is not possible to weigh the relative merits of different approaches to treatment. However, the current design is sufficient to support the appropriateness of an exposure-focused condition in dismantling studies.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the current study suggests that treatment manuals focusing more directly on exposure have the potential to maintain efficacy without decreasing acceptability and effectiveness. Perhaps one of the most pressing issues facing the field of child anxiety disorders is the determination of essential and nonessential treatment components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512456546">Kazdin &amp; Nock, 2003</xref>). The development of more effective and cost-efficient treatments has the potential to improve efforts toward dissemination and reduce the gap between effect sizes found in effectiveness and efficacy trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512456546">Barrington et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512456546">Chorpita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512456546">Southam-Gerow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512456546">Weisz et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
