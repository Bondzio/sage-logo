<title>‘New Insights into Brain Development’ may have Implications for the Age of Criminal Responsibility</title>
<p>According to a survey of 90 countries, the average age at which children are considered to become criminally liable ranged in 2008 from six to 18 years, with a median of 13.5 years and a mode of 14. Most European countries have an age of criminal minority between 14 and 16 years. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1473225412438030">Table 1</xref>, the minimum age of criminal responsibility in the three jurisdictions within the United Kingdom is low by comparison, a fact that has drawn criticism from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>A report published by the Royal Society in December 2011 considers a range of implications of recent advances in neuroscience for the criminal law. One issue raised is the extent to which developments in knowledge of brain and nervous system functioning might inform discussions as to the appropriate age of criminal responsibility.</p>
<p>Research has confirmed that neural circuits with a significant influence on behaviour continue to develop until at least 20 years of age. While those parts of the brain responsible for emotional processing mature during early adolescence, the pre-frontal cortex, which is particularly important for decision-making and impulse control, is one of the slowest areas to develop. This imbalance may, the report suggests, play a role in explaining the tendency of teenagers to engage in various forms of risk-taking, raising questions as to whether it is appropriate to consider younger children as culpable for lawbreaking in the same manner as adults.</p>
<p>Launching the publication, Professor Nicholas Mackintosh, chair of the working group that produced the report, noted that the age of criminal responsibility was a matter of policy rather than science: ‘neuroscience adds to the evidence that a ten-year-old, twelve-year-old, fifteen-year-old even, is not a fully adult brain. Whether that has implications for the age of criminal responsibility is not for us to decide’.</p>

<title>Independent Review of the Northern Ireland Youth Justice System Recommends Increasing the Age of Criminal Responsibility</title>
<p>The Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 introduced new arrangements for youth justice in Northern Ireland based, in large part, around a restorative system of youth conferencing. The new system was rolled out nationally from December 2006.</p>
<p>On arresting a child, the police have discretion to take no further action or, if the offence is minor and an admission forthcoming, may facilitate mediation between the victim and offender to seek resolution without further formal process. All other cases are referred to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) whose options include:</p>
<list id="list1-1473225412438030" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>No prosecution – where there is insufficient evidence or it is not in the public interest to pursue the case;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Referral back to the police for an informal warning or caution;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Referral for a diversionary youth conference;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Prosecution.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the event of the latter, providing the young person consents, the youth court is required in most cases to order a youth conference on conviction.</p>
<p>Youth conferences may accordingly take one of two forms – diversionary or court-ordered. Figures given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1473225412438030">Table 2</xref> indicate a significant rise in referrals, with a shift towards diversionary conferencing, over time.</p>

<p>In either event, the conference takes the form of a meeting involving the child, family members, representatives of relevant agencies and, wherever possible, the victim. The purpose is to formulate a plan as a response to the offence.</p>
<p>The plan is subject to approval, by the PPS in the case of a diversionary conference, or by the youth court where the conference was court-ordered. In diversionary cases, rejection of the plan, or a failure by the child to comply with its terms, may result in prosecution. With a court-ordered conference, the youth court will, if it accepts the plan, make a youth conference order. If the plan is rejected by the court, an alternative disposal is imposed that may include a custodial sentence.</p>
<p>In 2010, the Minister of Justice commissioned an independent review of the youth justice system to ‘ensure compliance with international obligations and best practice’. The report, published in September 2011, is broadly positive in this regard, noting a ‘real commitment’ to children’s rights within the reformed system. Rates of recidivism following youth conferencing are encouraging. Just 29.4 per cent of children subject to diversionary conferences in 2008 reoffended within one year; for court-ordered conferences the equivalent figure was 45.4 per cent (compared with 53.5 per cent for other community-based court disposals). There has been a reduction in the under-18 custodial population since the late-1990s (data indicate that it has stabilized in recent years), and the principal custodial provision for children, the Woodlands Juvenile Justice Centre, is assessed as ‘constituting best practice internationally’. Nonetheless, the review team also found areas where improvements were needed.</p>
<p>These include: an overuse of detention by the police; a relatively high use of custodial remand, accounting for three-quarters of incarcerated children; the continued placement of 17 year-olds in an adult prison establishment, deemed by the Northern Ireland Prisons Review to be an inappropriate environment for children; and an overrepresentation of ‘looked after’ children among the custodial population. There has been an unhelpful tendency for conference plans to increase in length: in 2006/7, just a quarter of court-ordered plans were longer than six months; in 2010/11, the equivalent proportion was 56 per cent. The review is also critical of a lack of child specialist training for those working in the youth court.</p>
<p>However, the most ‘<italic>urgent challenge</italic>’ identified is the extent of delay that permeates the system. The average time from offence to conference referral was 210 days in 2007, but this has increased in the intervening period. A small-scale study conducted by the review team revealed that the period to referral ranged from three days to 675. Inevitably, there is additional delay between the conference and disposal. Paradoxically, the process takes longer where conferences are diversionary rather than court-ordered: during 2010/11, the average number of days from date of offence to the plan being approved was 273 for the former and 250 for the latter. The report argues that such delays are unacceptable from the perspective of children in conflict with the law and ‘their’ victims. A practical consequence is that programmes designed to address delinquent behaviour may be implemented when those subject to them have long since stopped offending.</p>
<p>One mechanism proposed to deal with this problem is the introduction of a statutory time limit – subject to prosecution appeal to protect the interests of victims – of 120 days from arrest to disposal. But the review also suggests that reducing the numbers coming into the conferencing system, through increased use of other forms of diversion, would free up resources to focus on the most complex and serious cases and allow a more proportionate response. The report notes that one third of referrals to the PPS result in no prosecution, and suggests that it should be possible to remove such cases from the system at an earlier stage through extending police discretion, with appropriate safeguards. Models that allow a higher proportion of minor offending to be dealt with outside the formal criminal justice system – including the introduction of multi-agency rapid assessment and referral to appropriate supportive interventions, and a greater use of ‘community based restorative justice’ (schemes that combine restorative justice principles with youth work practice) – are endorsed. Decisions of the PPS, it is argued, should be in accordance with the best interests of the child, and the youth justice system should not be used to access resources to address welfare issues unless the child’s offending is serious or persistent. The report therefore suggests that the aims of the system be amended to:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… reflect the principle of proportionality and include a presumption that low-level offending should be dealt with by parents (with support where necessary), school and communities, or through a police disposal.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The review also recommends that the age of criminal responsibility be raised ‘with immediate effect’ to 12 years in accordance with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child’s expressed view that a lower age is not internationally acceptable. While recognizing that the impact on system throughput would be relatively modest, resulting in a reduction of less than three per cent, the review further proposes that consideration should be given within three years to raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14, removing from the system 14.48 per cent of those currently subject to it.</p>

<title>Juvenile Arrests in the United States Continue to Fall</title>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation publishes aggregate data on a range of crime-related indicators provided by police throughout the United States. During 2009, 1.9 million children below the age of 18 years were arrested, a reduction of 9 per cent over the previous year and of 17 per cent since 2000.</p>
<p>Property offences have fallen more rapidly than violent crimes (19 per cent against 13 per cent since 2000). Within these broad categories, moreover, trends for different offence types vary considerably. For example, while aggravated assault declined by almost a quarter over the nine year period, arrests for robbery increased by 15 per cent. While arrests for motor-vehicle theft dropped by more than 60 per cent, the reduction in larceny was a more modest 12 per cent. Nonetheless, the overall pattern is one of clear decline. The picture for adults is more mixed: as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1473225412438030">Table 3</xref>, adult arrests for property crime have risen by almost a fifth; the fall in arrests for violence is also less marked than that for juveniles.</p>

<p>The juvenile arrest rate (arrests per 100,000 in the 10–17 population) was lower for violent crime in 2009 than for any year since at least 1980. For property offences, the equivalent rate was half that in the peak year of 1988.</p>
<p>Girls accounted for 578,500 juvenile arrests during 2009, almost one third of the total. While the overall reduction in arrests for violent crime was the same for boys and girls, the increase in robbery arrests for the latter was substantially greater (26 against 14 per cent). At the same time, the decline in arrests for property offending is a function of a fall in relation to young males only. Between 2000 and 2009, arrests of girls for property crime rose by three per cent.</p>
<p>Black and minority ethnic young people are overrepresented in the figures. While black children constitute 16 percent of the total 10–17 population, they accounted for more than half of arrests for violent offending and one third of arrests for property crime in 2009.</p>
<p>Despite the decline in arrests, the number of children processed by the juvenile court has risen over the longer term, suggesting a proportionate fall in diversionary measures. In 2008, juvenile courts dealt with 1.7 million cases, 44 per cent more than in 1985. In one in five cases, children were held in detention at some point – either prior to adjudication or as a final disposition. Not all children subject to court proceedings are dealt with in juvenile court since legislation in some states allows charging of those aged 15–16 years to the adult criminal court. Where a case is initially referred to the juvenile court, nearly all states also permit ‘judicial waiver’, under which jurisdiction is terminated and children are transferred to be tried as adults.</p>
<p>In 2008, juvenile courts waived an estimated 8900 cases, more than a third fewer than in 1994 but 13 per cent more than in 2001. The decline in waiver throughout the 1990s was in part a consequence of a fall in violent youth offending but was also a function of an increased tendency for children to be processed directly through the adult court, ‘bypassing the juvenile court altogether’.</p>

<title>Stricter Enforcement of Underage Drinking Legislation in the United States Fails to Reduce Drunkenness among Young People under 21</title>
<p>Legislation across the United States prohibits alcohol consumption below the age of 21 years. Nonetheless, underage drinking is regarded as ‘pervasive’, leading to significant health-related difficulties. It also draws substantial numbers of young people into the criminal justice system, both for violations of ‘liquor laws’ and as a consequence of an association between alcohol consumption and violent crime. In part, the widespread use of alcohol among young people is explained by ready availability, which in turn is indicative of a relatively low priority afforded to enforcement activity directed at illegal sales. Since 1998, funding has been available to support efforts to prohibit sales of alcoholic beverages to minors. In 2003, an evaluation, based on a randomized community trial (nominated communities in five selected States were paired according to demographic features and then randomly allocated as an intervention or comparison community) was commissioned. The 34 intervention sites were required to implement a range of activities:</p>
<list id="list2-1473225412438030" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>At least two compliance check operations per annum in at least 90 per cent of retail outlets selling alcohol;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At least one enforcement operation targeting young people driving while under the influence of alcohol;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At least one additional enforcement operation focusing on the availability of alcohol to minors;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The adoption or amendment of at least one local policy relating to underage drinking.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Implementation was relatively high with the following proportions of sites successfully completing each of the above activities respectively: 71 per cent; 97 per cent, 100 per cent; and 85 per cent.</p>
<p>The evaluation found that sites with higher levels of implementation had a bigger impact on attitudes: young people were more likely to perceive that the community ‘cares a great deal’ about underage drinking and that such drinking would attract official sanction.</p>
<p>However, these ‘normative’ improvements were not reflected in behavioural outcomes. Self-report surveys found only one statistically significant difference, across ten measures of drinking behaviour, between intervention and comparison communities, and this favoured the latter. The rise in the proportion of young people reporting being drunk in the previous 30 days as the cohort aged, was lower in the comparison communities (23 per cent) than in intervention communities (31 per cent).</p>
<p>More positively, analysis suggested that intervention areas demonstrated a statistically significant positive impact on alcohol-related crashes involving underage drivers relative to comparison areas.</p>

<title>Government Abandons Plans to Abolish the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales</title>
<p>The Youth Justice Board was established as a non-departmental public body by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to: monitor the youth justice system; promote good practice, including the development of national standards; and provide advice to the Secretary of Stage on issues pertaining to youth offending. The Board has also assumed responsibility for commissioning custodial provision for children and determining where those deprived of their liberty should be placed within the secure estate. The Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government elected in May 2010 announced that it had determined to abolish the Board, a decision confirmed in December 2010 in the publication of the criminal justice Green Paper, <italic>Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders.</italic></p>
<p>The move was opposed by the House of Lords who, on 28 March 2011, amended the Public Bodies Bill to remove the Youth Justice Board from the list of agencies proposed for abolition. The amendment was subsequently overturned and, as late as 16 November 2011 when the Bill returned to the upper chamber, Lord McNally, Minister of State for Justice, confirmed the government’s intention to establish a youth justice division within the Ministry of Justice to ‘carry out the core functions of the Board’.</p>
<p>One week later, on 23 November 2011, the Minister signalled an about turn, indicating that the Board was no longer to be abolished, but adding that the government continued to believe that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… there should be more direct ministerial accountability and involvement in youth justice. We believe… that there is a strong case for reform of the Youth Justice Board…. We will consider whether we can use [existing] powers in the context of more direct ministerial accountability but will do so in consultation with the Youth Justice Board and with the intention of working harmoniously with it.</p>

<title>Conditions for Children Held in Young Offender Institutions in England and Wales ‘Deteriorating’</title>
<p>The number of children in custody in England and Wales has reduced considerably in the past few years, from a peak of 3072 in June 2008 to 2021 in October 2011. The secure estate for children and young people has contracted in line with that fall: five young offender institutions (YOIs) have closed, including a dedicated establishment for 17 year-old girls. One consequence is that the demographic profile of the YOI population has changed. Between 2009/10 and 2010/11, the minority ethnic representation among boys in such institutions rose from 33 to 39 per cent. At the same time, the number of children and young people self-identifying as Muslim grew from 13 to 16 per cent.</p>
<p>A thematic report on the experiences of children aged 16 to 18 years in custody has found that while there have been some improvements, conditions overall, for this increasingly vulnerable group, have deteriorated over the past 12 months. Relationships with staff were less positive: fewer boys indicated that they felt that there was a staff member to whom they could turn if they had a problem (63 per cent compared with 70 per cent in the previous year); and they were also less likely to report that they were treated with respect. Just over a third of boys and 45 per cent of girls said that a member of staff had checked on them personally in the past week. The proportion of boys who had felt unsafe in custody had declined over the year to one in four, but there was significant variation between establishments, from ten per cent at Parc YOI to almost half (48%) at Stoke Heath YOI.</p>
<p>Just 18 per cent of girls reported that they received one or more visits a week. The proportion of boys indicating that visits commenced on time and that visitors were treated with respect had fallen since the previous year. Fewer than half of boys and 58 per cent of girls reported having a training plan, despite it being a requirement of all custodial sentences. A minority said that they had any input into what would happen to them on release, and fewer young people than previously knew who to contact for help with resettlement.</p>
<p>In many areas, the experience of black and minority ethnic young people was worse than that of their white counterparts. Although minority ethnic boys reported fewer problems on arrival in custody, they were less likely to receive visits or enjoy good relationships with staff, and more likely to have adjudications against them than the white custodial population. Just nine per cent of Muslim young boys indicated that the food was good or very good, compared to 19 per cent of non-Muslims.</p>
<p>Children placed in provision dedicated to those below 18 years of age were significantly more positive about their experiences than those detained in split-site establishments which also accommodate young adults, albeit in separate units.</p>

<title>Treatment of Children Arrested for Offences during English Riots Criticized by Unicef</title>
<p>Between the 6 and 9 August 2011, there was a spate of urban disturbances commencing in London and spreading to other cities in England. According to data released by the Ministry of Justice, as of 12 October 2011, 26 per cent (<italic>n</italic> = 514) of those bought before the courts for incidents arising out of the riots were children aged 10–17 years. This group came disproportionately from areas of deprivation: almost two-thirds were resident in the fifth most deprived communities; 42 per cent qualified for free school meals (compared with 16 per cent of the general secondary school population); and two-thirds were classified as having some form of special educational needs (compared with just one in five of all children in secondary education).</p>
<p>Despite these indicators of poverty, treatment in the courts has been harsh by the standards that generally apply to equivalent offences. Thirty-one per cent of adjournments resulted in the child being remanded to custody. One in three sentences imposed in cases which had proceeded to final disposal involved immediate imprisonment. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1473225412438030">Table 4</xref> rovides a comparison of sentencing for equivalent offence types during 2010, showing that children involved in the disorder of August 2011 were significantly more likely to receive custody and to be deprived of their liberty for longer.</p>

<p>Unicef expressed concern at the high rates of incarceration, arguing that care should be taken to ensure that responses to events such as the August riots did not ‘violate the rights of children’, adding that it was vital for the state to comply with obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to impose custody as a last resort and for the shortest appropriate period.</p>

<title>‘Appropriate Adult’ Support to Children in Police Stations in England and Wales Operates within ‘a Process-driven Environment’ at the Expense of Promoting Welfare</title>
<p>In England and Wales, children in police custody, aged 10–16 years, are entitled to the support of an ‘appropriate adult’ (AA) in addition to any legal representation they receive. (Seventeen year-olds are treated as adults in police detention, despite being considered juveniles for most other youth justice purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1473225412438030">2</xref></sup>) In the majority of cases, parents or other family members perform the AA role, but where they are unable or unwilling to do so, youth offending teams (YOTs) have a statutory duty to provide an AA where one is requested by the police. A joint inspection, led by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, published in December 2011, considers the experiences of children at the police station where the AA is provided though the YOT.</p>
<p>The inspectors found that recruitment and training of AA volunteers was generally sound although, since demand frequently outstripped supply, they were not confident that ‘unsuitable candidates’ were always filtered out. Less positively, policies and procedures tended to emphasize compliance with the process of police investigation – for instance, the stages where an AA presence is required – rather than underlining the importance of identifying and communicating welfare needs on behalf of the child. Thus there was provision in all areas for police to access AAs from 8.00 until 23.00, seven days a week, but call-out arrangements were based on what the police considered necessary to comply with legislative requirements rather than the child’s best interests. Children arrested in the late evening were routinely subject to an overnight rest period, rather than the timing of interviews being determined by individual circumstances. In some cases, this led to significant, and unnecessary, extensions to the period that children spent in police custody. AAs were often unclear too as to their role in relation to insisting on legal representation and, if necessary, overruling the child’s decision not to seek legal advice.</p>
<p>Information flows to and from AAs were unsatisfactory. Those attending the police station frequently received limited information from the YOT about the child whom they were to support. On arrival, details provided by the police were often no more than basic and AAs rarely reviewed custody records – which were themselves inadequately completed. Documentation returned to the YOT by AAs generally took the form of a checklist and rarely contained discussion of welfare issues. Moreover, the returned form was not always reviewed within the YOT, creating a risk that important information might be overlooked.</p>
<p>While focus groups of AAs indicated that they would challenge police in interview where necessary, evidence from cases reviewed did not support such a view. Proactive intervention was uncommon and AAs rarely explained their role to the child or ensured that the suspect understood complex legal terminology. Most children consulted during the review did not regard the AA as particularly helpful. With one exception, YOT areas inspected had no processes in place to assess the quality of AA provision.</p>
<p>The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 requires that a child below the age of 17 years, refused bail by the police subsequent to charge, should be transferred to local authority (LA) accommodation. The requirement is a reciprocal one: the police are obliged to seek such accommodation and the local authority has a statutory duty to provide it. Only in exceptional circumstances, where a child aged 12–16 years poses a risk of serious harm to the public, the police may request local authority secure accommodation, and if such accommodation is not available, may detain the child at the police station. Continued detention of a child after charge should accordingly be rare. In the areas inspected, over a six month period, one in six children was denied bail by the police but, due to a lack of monitoring, inspectors were not able to ascertain how often LA accommodation was requested, how frequently such accommodation was provided, or numbers of children detained in police custody. There was considerable confusion on the part of the police and the LA as to the relevant statutory provisions. In nearly two-thirds of the 49 cases reviewed, the police failed to request LA accommodation. Moreover, inspectors considered that non-secure provision would have been appropriate in 67 per cent of such cases. In one area, the YOT was concerned to identify children refused bail and to challenge police detention after charge but elsewhere there was complacency: the issue ‘did not feature on the agenda of the police, YOT or LSCB [Local Safeguarding Children Board].’</p>
<p>The inspection concludes that failure to transfer should be exceptional but that it was not:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[I]n practice, the reciprocal duty on the police to transfer… and ‘on the local authority to receive’… has been reduced to a short (or no) call to local authority staff requesting secure accommodation followed by the now standard response that none is available; and that under these circumstances, the AA is often precluded (by local policy) from making any representations at all.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The inspection sites appear to be representative of England and Wales more generally. Freedom of Information (FOI) data obtained by the Howard League for Penal Reform has ascertained that, in the two year period 2008–2009, approximately 53,000 children below the age of 16 years were held in police detention following charge, including 1654 children aged 10–12 years. This latter group cannot legally be detained under any circumstances, since the police are not entitled to require secure accommodation. The figures are certainly an under-estimate: only 24 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales responded to the FOI request.</p>

<p>At present, 17 year-olds are also treated as adults for remand purposes in the youth court. Legislation currently before the UK Parliament proposes to extend the provisions that apply to younger children to this older age group, but there is currently no intention to amend the status of 17 year-olds in police detention.</p>
