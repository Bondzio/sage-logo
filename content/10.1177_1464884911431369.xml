<abstract>
<p>Liberal opinion often views nationalism as a distasteful and reactionary concept. But what does it mean to be a nationalist? This article seeks to investigate what selected newspapers in the UK mean when they label a political party or an individual as nationalist. An initial content analysis demonstrates that journalists use the label to cover a variety of movements and individuals with disparate political and cultural goals. Making use of the banal nationalism concept and the idea of strategy in discourse analysis, it is suggested here that these disparate groups are brought together under the banner of nationalist to convey a sense of otherness, in contrast to the natural, timeless world of nation states which the journalists and readers inhabit. Time and space considerations require reporters to use forms of journalism shorthand when reporting on complex situations but it is argued here that the use of the label nationalist does little to enhance understanding of these complex stories. Furthermore, it is argued that, in a UK context, the exclusion by newspapers of those who support the continuation of the current British state from being categorized as nationalist is useful for those who are campaigning against local independence movements.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the late 1960s the United Kingdom has been under substantial pressure from nationalists campaigning to secure independence, or substantial autonomy, for the peripheral territories of the British state. The rise of nationalist movements in Scotland and Wales in particular has prompted fierce condemnation from politicians committed to maintaining the unity of Great Britain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884911431369">1</xref></sup> In common with many western liberals, these politicians have expressed distaste, not just for Scottish and Welsh nationalism, but for the concept of nationalism more generally. There is a powerful irony, however, in this condemnation: those politicians who profess the most dislike for nationalism are, in one sense, often the most enthusiastic nationalists, in that they work hard to preserve and strengthen the British nation state. One tactic deployed in this endeavour is to reinforce the idea that Britain is a collective, natural entity. In line with the concept of banal nationalism, discussed later, this ever-present promotion of the naturalness of Britain means the concept of nationalism can be removed from civilized political discourse and projected on to ‘others’.</p>
<p>This article is interested in these others. In particular, it investigates which groups and individuals are explicitly labeled as nationalists (and which are not) in a selection of British newspapers which consider themselves to be national titles. A discourse analysis is then undertaken to enable a more detailed discussion of why the term nationalist might be used in various contexts. Great Britain – as a multinational state – would seem to be an interesting case study in this respect: because of the rise of nationalist movements within Britain, the way the term ‘nationalist’ is used across various contexts in the UK press has a particular political relevance. It seems useful therefore to discuss how this label is used and to consider its impact.</p>
<p>For analysis purposes, the UK’s multinational status offers an additional complexity, and I hope interest, in that newspapers serving different geographical areas consider themselves to be national titles: albeit representing different nations. There are, for example, self-styled national newspapers published primarily for readers in Scotland, and national newspapers which claim to serve the whole of the UK. This study will therefore also discuss the depiction of nationalists by journalists working for the press in a ‘stateless’ or ‘sub’ nation such as Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911431369">Drakulic, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911431369">McCrone, 1992</xref>) as well as those who write for newspapers sold across an established nation state.</p>

<title>Nationalist debates</title>
<p>For political scientists there is no single agreed definition of the concept of nationalism. As Michael Keating says, there has been endless debate over its meaning. However, he says: ‘Nationalism is a doctrine of self-determination; that much is agreed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911431369">2001</xref>: 1). Anthony Smith argues that despite the various definitions, common themes are apparent, the most important of which is over-riding concern with the nation (although the idea of the nation itself is controversial). Smith himself offers a working definition: ‘An ideological movement for attaining and maintaining autonomy, unity and identity for a population which some of its members deem to constitute an actual or potential “nation”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884911431369">2001</xref>: 9). From this definition it is clear that Smith agrees that those striving for political independence are not the only nationalists – those seeking to maintain their autonomous national status can also be categorized as nationalist. As we will see, this is an important idea for the purposes of this study.</p>
<p>Much of the academic discussion about nationalism focuses on debates over its causes and origins. In this context, two contrasting positions are often used to bookend the discussion. At one end there is primordialism – an idea of continuity that locates nationalist movements in an ancient, collective identity. According to David Brown, ‘When nations claim to be communities of common ancestry, they are, from the primordialist perspective, essentially correct’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911431369">2000</xref>: 6). At the other end of the scale is the dominant modernist school – those who believe nations are essentially invented or imagined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911431369">Anderson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911431369">Gellner, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911431369">1997</xref>) and who believe that the origins of nations can be located in the industrialization processes of the late 18th/early 19th century. For Drakulic, the modernist paradigm is too mechanistic and Euro-centric. In a wide-ranging study, he says nationalism has ‘multiple and varied socio-historical origins’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911431369">2008</xref>: 235). This article is not a contribution to that debate (although I believe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911431369">Ascherson’s 2002</xref> discussion offers an effective challenge to the modernist position with respect to Scotland). Instead, I am interested in how contemporary nationalists and nationalist movements have been characterized. This opens up a further debate – not about the origins and causes of nationalism but about the nature of nationalism.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most cited debate in this context is the distinction drawn between ethnic and civic nationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911431369">Özkirimli, 2000</xref>). Ethnic nationalism is often used as a term which refers to a national group claiming the right to self-determination by reference to the homogeneous nature and history of the relevant population. Civic nationalism, by contrast, seeks to mobilize a population, sharing the same territory, which it recognizes as being ethnically diverse, by emphasizing a shared interest in coming together to promote the common well-being. As Lægaard says, ‘an allegiance to common political values, has been taken to be a mark of civic nationalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911431369">2007</xref>: 41). In this respect, in the words of Smith:
<disp-quote>
<p>while civic nationalism <italic>may</italic>, in the eyes of some political philosophers, be combined with liberalism and so achieve a measure of respectability, ethnic blood and soil forms of nationalism remain beyond the moral pale; their unregenerate particularism debars them from any civilized intercourse with ‘mainstream’ political ideologies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884911431369">2001</xref>: 41)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Except, as Lægaard and Smith both point out, things are not that clear cut. A strict civic/ethnic distinction is now largely dismissed. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911431369">Drakulic (2008)</xref>, nationalism is always associated with ethnic interests. Indeed, it seems hard to disagree with the idea that even the most civic-minded nationalist movement relies to some extent on an ethnic basis. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911431369">Kearton (2005)</xref> has argued convincingly that a mainstream self-styled civic nationalist movement, the Scottish National Party, has an ethnic core which paradoxically emphasizes a civil, inclusive view of the Scottish nation. Also, while recognizing the significance of the distinction between civic and ethnic (or what he calls ethnocultural) nationalism, David Brown is unconvinced by the whole notion of good civic nationalism and bad ethnic nationalism. He argues instead that the origins of illiberal nationalism lie in the extent to which these movements, regardless of civic or ethnic characteristics, are driven by insecurity and the perceived threat of ‘others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911431369">2000</xref>: 66–69).</p>
<p>For this study a further distinction in the study of nation states is important – the difference between patriotism and nationalism. Although a prominent nationalist scholar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911431369">Breuilly (1996</xref>: 146) finds the conceptual distinction uninteresting; politicians have been keener to draw the contrast. In western political discourse, patriotism – love of one’s country – is clearly a good thing. In <italic>The Audacity of Hope</italic>, Barack Obama writes of the American people: ‘We value patriotism and the obligations of citizenship, a sense of duty and sacrifice on behalf of our nation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911431369">2007</xref>: 55). The ex-British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, consistently championed the idea of patriotism, calling for among others things, the Labour Party to be unashamedly patriotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911431369">BBC, 2006</xref>). In contrast to patriotism, it is difficult to imagine the idea of nationalism being used by these political leaders approvingly. Indeed, Gordon Brown frequently hit out at nationalism as a means of attacking political opponents – both the SNP and the British Conservative Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911431369">Brown, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911431369"><italic>The Scotsman</italic>, 2010</xref>). This idea of good patriotism versus bad nationalism has been an important discussion point in the analysis of western press and political attitudes to the issue of national identity.</p>

<title>Nationalism and the media</title>
<p>For those interested in the relationship between the media and nationalism, Anderson’s modernist idea of <italic>Imagined Communities</italic>, cited above, has proved to be influential. Anderson emphasizes the role of publishing and print capitalism in the creation of nation states, even those with apparently competing nationalisms such as Britain. The fact that large parts of ‘what would one day be imagined as Scotland’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911431369">1991</xref>: 90) were English speaking, he says, meant that Scots had access to print English and therefore to the imagined national community of England/Britain. Helpfully for those seeking to create and sustain British identity, the non-English speaking Gaeltacht had also been largely exterminated. These factors helped to ensure 19th-century Scotland did not give rise to a ‘European-style vernacular-specific nationalist movement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911431369">1991</xref>: 90).</p>
<p>Other studies have been interested in the role of the media, and journalism in particular, in sustaining nation states once they have been imagined and created. In this respect Michael Billig’s banal nationalism concept has been particularly important. A key point in this idea is the way journalists and others present the nation state as a natural entity, divorced from nationalism. In this way, he writes: ‘“Our” nationalism is not presented as nationalism, which is dangerously irrational, surplus and alien. A new identity, a different label, is found for it. “Our” nationalism appears as “patriotism” – a beneficial, necessary and often, American, force’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911431369">1995</xref>: 55). Billig goes on to demonstrate the use of a ‘deixis of homeland’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911431369">1995</xref>: 94) – the routine deployment of words such as ‘us’, ‘we’, ‘our’ in both journalism and political rhetoric to reinforce the naturalness and obviousness of existing nation states. Keating makes a similar point:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some of those who condemn minority nationalism as necessarily backward frame this as a condemnation of all nationalism, ignoring the implicit nationalism underlying their own position and confusing their own metropolitan chauvinism with universal values and a cosmopolitan outlook. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911431369">2001</xref>: 24)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For media analysis there are therefore two principal elements to this idea: firstly, the extent to which journalists project the sense that existing, western nation states are natural, rational (non-nationalist) entities and whether therefore they help to maintain the unity of these states; and, secondly, the extent to which they attach the label nationalist to irrational or alien others. A range of studies has since been published to test and challenge the first element (in a Scottish context see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911431369">Law, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911431369">Petersoo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911431369">Rosie et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884911431369">2006</xref>). These studies are interested in assessing the language used in newspapers about the nation state in question – to discuss the presence and power of deixis in forging the idea of national togetherness.</p>
<p>In particular, because many people in Scotland say they are both British and Scottish, it has been suggested there is ambiguity over the power of words such as ‘we’. In newspaper articles will pronouns like ‘we’ reinforce the idea of ‘we the British’ or ‘we the Scots’? And if there is that ambiguity, how can it be said that these pronouns are powerful drivers of banal British nationalism? Indeed, Petersoo investigates a range of associations for what she calls the ‘wandering we’, and Law argues that Billig’s emphasis on what he calls big state nationalism restricts the usefulness of the banal nationalism concept to stateless nations such as Scotland. The first element of Billig’s idea has therefore been challenged on the basis of the complex nature of national identities in the UK.</p>
<p>But what about the second element – the ‘others’: those groups, parties and movements which <italic>are</italic> explicitly identified by the media as nationalists? This aspect of the banal nationalism idea has attracted less scholarly attention and it is this element that this article is primarily interested in.</p>
<p>If the first element has been questioned in the context of Scotland and Britain, can any conclusions be drawn about the second; in particular, are they depicted, as Billig suggests they would be, as irrational and alien by journalists in an established nation state such as the UK? It is by investigating the others, the identified nationalists, and the contrast, if any, that journalists draw between these groups and ‘us’, the citizens of existing nation states, that I hope to further the understanding of the role of the media in negotiating ideas of both nationalism and nations.</p>
<p>In particular, this study engages in an analysis of the content of selected British newspapers and investigates these questions:</p>

<title>Nationalism and discourse analysis</title>
<p>Journalism textbooks for trainee reporters offer clear guidelines on the distinction between news writing and opinion writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911431369">Randall, 2000</xref>: 198), a point reinforced in the UK by the press self-regulation body the PCC, which in its code of practice says: ‘The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884911431369">PCC, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>News reporters on the whole therefore see themselves as offering a window on the world, presenting ‘us with an ongoing narrative about the world beyond our immediate experience. This narrative is asserted to be true’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431369">McNair, 1999</xref>: 21).</p>
<p>For most journalism scholars, the idea of reporting as a window on the world is dismissed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911431369">Lacey (2009)</xref> says, as naïve. The notion of a clean separation between neutral reporting and opinionated comment writing is essentially discarded. Instead, analysis of western journalism practices has concentrated on class struggle and on explaining how the selection of news stories and the language used in those stories serves to maintain the dominant (capitalist) ideology. Classic studies produced by groups working at Birmingham and Glasgow universities in the 1970s have been particularly influential in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431369">Hall et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884911431369">Philo et al., 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Since those early studies, scholars have developed various textual analysis techniques to demonstrate the power of the media in sustaining unequal economic relations.</p>
<p>Within that basic world view, however, important differences have emerged. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911431369">Philo (2007)</xref>, for example, (contested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911431369">Fürsich, 2009</xref>) has been critical of those who, he says, concentrate on the text while largely ignoring the production process and how texts are interpreted by audiences. In so doing, he aims his fire in particular at critical discourse analysis (CDA). For one of its leading figures, CDA is defined as an ‘academic movement of scholars specifically interested in the analysis of fundamental social problems, such as the discursive reproduction of illegitimate domination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911431369">Van Dijk, 2008</xref>: 822). Derived in part from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911431369">Fowler (1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911431369">Fowler et al., 1979</xref>), critical discourse analysts are interested in linguistic conventions deployed by news journalists. For example, newspaper headline writing is examined to show how agency is deleted in certain situations and how responsibility for certain actions (by dominant groups or those who serve them) is therefore concealed from the reader. For Widdowson, this claim of concealment is problematic. ‘How,’ he asks, ‘can analysts be sure the absences from a sentence they detect would not be generated as inferences anyway via other information in the text?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884911431369">2007</xref>: 112). Further criticism, as part of a lively dialogue between CDA scholars, is offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911431369">Billig (2008)</xref>, who questions, among other things, the technical language used in such analysis. Like Widdowson, I find the certainty which scholars in the CDA tradition claim for the impact of news reports troubling. This is not to say that techniques of textual analysis, such as those used by CDA scholars, should be dismissed. Indeed, while I take issue with the certainty with which many CDA findings are presented, the techniques can offer important insights.</p>
<p>In particular, because CDA’s focus is on power structures in society, it is often used to identify the way in which political rhetoric, newspaper articles and other forms of elite communication are used to support dominant groups and marginalize others. This has prompted an interest in nationalism and how nationalists succeed in (discursively) constructing a sense of sameness among those allowed into the nation and a sense of difference and distance from those who are excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911431369">De Cilla et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884911431369">Wodak et al., 1999</xref>). This interest in nationalism suggests that some of the methods associated with CDA can be usefully deployed and adapted for this study: in particular, the way in which some individuals and groups are depicted as deviants or as others. In the introduction to a collection of papers on this topic, Riggins says: ‘Characterising others as odd or irrational is a powerful strategy of exclusion used by a dominant majority that sees itself as normal and rational’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911431369">1997</xref>: 17). This idea of strategy is important in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884911431369">Wodak et al. (1999)</xref> who identify various strategies used by politicians, journalists and others to achieve certain goals. Strategies in this sense may not always be consciously pursued but can be applied automatically depending on the relevant social and material conditions. Politicians and journalists are said to have the greatest degree of conscious intention while individuals responding to questions have the least. Discourse analysts then study texts to investigate the means by which these strategies are realized. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911431369">Ricento (2003)</xref> identifies various rhetorical strategies in political speeches which discursively construct Americanism.</p>
<p>In this current article I attempt to adapt this method of analysis in the following way: I do not seek to identify strategies that help to create a sense of national community (and difference to others) within one territorial area. In other words, I am not, here, interested in how elites in Britain or the USA discursively create a sense of specifically British or American national identity. Instead, I am interested in the strategies pursued which perpetuate the general idea of the naturalness of existing (western) nation states in contrast to the movements and individuals who are explicitly identified as nationalists. In this sense I am interested in whether, and if so how, the label nationalist itself is used to identify deviants or others in contrast to the normal, acceptable community of nation states. If, as Billig asserts, established nation state elites no longer call themselves nationalists – who exactly is the term reserved for and for what purpose?</p>
<p>In carrying out this analysis as well as concentrating on the text, as a former news reporter myself, I am also interested in the process of producing newspaper articles. For many critical discourse analysts it is acceptable to assert, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911431369">Fairclough (2001</xref>: 46) does, that ‘professional beliefs and assumptions of media workers are important in keeping the power of media discourse hidden from the mass of the population’, while ignoring the processes of writing and sub-editing, through which these beliefs and assumptions are carried on to the page. In this respect the journalist-turned-linguist Colleen Cotter sets out key lessons taught to reporters during their training and careers. In her discussion of news writing, Cotter highlights the importance attached to brevity and precision, with brevity relating to minimizing word use and the injunction to use short sentences and paragraphs, and precision requiring the word choice that best conveys meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911431369">2010</xref>: 137). In terms of the earlier discussion over strategy, journalists use words to achieve certain goals – using their skills to explain complexity in a digestible format. This, to me, is a crucial area because of the potential conflict that exists between brevity and precision. Journalists are constantly striving to be brief, which in turn leads to sometimes complex situations, movements and ideas being given a label – such as nationalism. But to what extent does this requirement to be economical with language contradict the requirement for precision and therefore of understanding?</p>

<title>Analysis of selected UK newspapers</title>
<p>This study looks at five newspapers, which claim to be national titles: <italic>The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Herald</italic> and <italic>The Scotsman</italic>. There are important differences between the five, including the different ways they define themselves as ‘nationals’. The first three titles are said to be ‘nationals’ in that they are sold across the whole of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). <italic>The Herald</italic> and <italic>The Scotsman</italic> claim to be national titles because they are sold throughout one of the nations that makes up the UK – Scotland. In terms of political allegiance, <italic>The Guardian</italic> is a liberal paper, broadly supportive of the UK Labour Party (although in the 2010 British general election it endorsed the Liberal Democrats). By contrast, <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic> is generally right wing and supportive of the British Conservatives. <italic>The Times</italic> has supported both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party at various elections. <italic>The Herald</italic>’s editorial position is unaligned: at elections to the Scottish Parliament it refuses to endorse any party. <italic>The Scotsman</italic>, while hostile to Scottish independence, supported an SNP-led coalition at the Scottish Parliament elections in 2007. Taken together the papers sell nearly 1.5 million copies a day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911431369"><italic>The Guardian</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>For the investigation, an initial quantitative study of the chosen newspapers was carried out. The purpose of content analysis ‘is to quantify salient and manifest features of a large number of texts … to make broader inferences about the processes and politics of representation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911431369">Deacon et al., 2007</xref>: 119). I am interested in recording what is manifest in order to discover in which parts of the world nationalists are said to exist by journalists working in the UK and how they are explicitly described.</p>
<p>For the analysis I conducted:</p>
<list id="list2-1464884911431369" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A count of all articles (news, features, opinion columns, editorials and obituaries) in the five newspapers which contained the word nationalist or nationalists in the first three months of 2007. The count was carried out using the electronic search facility, Newsbank. The year was chosen deliberately: elections to the Scottish Parliament were held in 2007 and a self-styled nationalist party – the SNP<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464884911431369">2</xref></sup> – was enjoying a high profile having built up a healthy lead in the opinion polls. The party came under intense attack from its opponents and the term nationalist was therefore the subject of particular political controversy at the time. This means this period is useful for a discussion of the possible impact of the way newspapers used the term nationalist in their pages. Selecting three months meant a substantial number of articles could be analysed – a total of 543.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A collocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911431369">Fairclough, 2003</xref>) study – to find out the extent of any regular or habitual pattern of co-occurrence between the label nationalist and geographical locations. The routine deployment of words used together, it is argued, offers meaning to audiences. In a discussion of an earlier study of industrial reporting, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911431369">Philo (2007)</xref> highlights the routine collocation between ‘excessive’ and ‘wage increases’ which helped those (i.e. the government) who claimed pay rises were damaging the economy. The precise method deployed here was to record the occasions in articles when:
<list id="list3-1464884911431369" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>A country<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884911431369">3</xref></sup> was used immediately before or after the use of the term, nationalist/nationalists.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Other cultural/racial and/or geographical identifiers were placed immediately next to the term nationalist/nationalists.</p>
<p>In addition, a count was made of the large number of articles in which the label nationalist/nationalists appeared without an adjacent collocated country or other identifier but where, nevertheless, a country was identified elsewhere in the article as being associated with the nationalist(s) in question or could clearly be inferred from the subject matter. For example, in stories about domestic politics in <italic>The Herald</italic> and <italic>The Scotsman</italic>, quite often the word ‘nationalists’ appeared without any explicit mention of Scotland in the article, but on those occasions the papers were clearly and unambiguously referring to Scottish nationalists.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A judgmental description was used in the words immediately before or after the use of the term, nationalist/nationalists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464884911431369">4</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>After this initial content study was carried out, a more detailed textual analysis of selected articles was undertaken. Keeping in mind the news writing conventions discussed by Cotter, this was done to investigate the presence of strategies in the use of the term nationalist/nationalists.</p>

<title>Nationalists: Where are they?</title>
<p>In terms of the countries collocated with nationalists or where nationalists are clearly associated with a particular country, there is a clear distinction between the three UK-wide national papers and the two Scottish national titles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884911431369">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884911431369">2</xref>). Almost all the articles that appeared in <italic>The Herald</italic> and <italic>The Scotsman</italic> which referred to nationalists were about Scottish nationalists. In one news story a <italic>Herald</italic> journalist presents a sharp differentiation between Scottish nationalism and nationalism elsewhere by reporting on the SNP’s anger at hostile comments made by one of its opponents. ‘Call them whatever else, but don’t even hint at a link between the Scottish independence movement and the ethnic nationalists in other parts of Europe, often on the ugly, anti-immigrant far right’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911431369">Fraser, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, however, given the salience of nationalism to Scotland, <italic>The Herald</italic> and <italic>The Scotsman</italic>, in the three months studied, barely covered nationalism in those other parts of Europe. Opponents of Scottish independence were also never identified as British nationalists apart from one humorous parliamentary sketch.</p>

<p>For the UK-wide titles, although most nationalists covered tend to be those seeking to secede from the UK, nationalists are also located more widely. The governments of existing western European nation states are largely excluded from being members of the nationalist family. References to western European countries tend to be historical or relate to non-mainstream groups such as the far right in those countries. Instead, as can be seen from both <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884911431369">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884911431369">2</xref>, nationalists are largely confined to Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia in addition to the non-English parts of the UK. At this stage of the analysis it can be said with some confidence that British journalists reserve this term for non-English/British actors (or those seeking to end the British state) and for those outside mainstream western European and North American political activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1464884911431369">
<title>Nationalists: Who are they?</title>
<p>In terms of the descriptions associated with nationalists again there is a distinction between the Scottish and UK papers. As discussed earlier, because the Scottish papers carry so few foreign stories, almost all the nationalists identified tend to be Scottish (or other secessionist movements in the UK) and tend to be presented without collocation qualifiers. Journalists in Scotland routinely use ‘the nationalists’ as a synonym for the SNP, and believe that readers recognize this to be the case. Because of the size and status of the SNP (currently the governing party in the devolved Scottish Parliament), journalists clearly do not believe they need to offer any other description – any more than they would need to describe the Labour Party as centre left or the Conservatives as centre right; the party name alone is deemed to be sufficient. The SNP does not believe nationalism to be a pejorative term for its primary goal – Scottish independence – although the party objects strongly to being called, as it often is by its opponents, ‘separatists’. It seems reasonable to conclude therefore that when <italic>The Herald</italic> or <italic>The Scotsman</italic> refers to ‘the nationalists’ they expect their readers to understand both that this means the SNP and simultaneously those who are campaigning for independence. In <italic>The Herald</italic>, of the few items which did refer to nationalists outside Scotland or in general terms, only two were news stories: one concerning Ireland and one concerning Iran, where the nationalists were described as extreme. Two of the other items were book reviews and one was a television review – in which the term ‘white nationalist’ was used to describe far-right white supremacists in the USA. One of the book reviews referred to ‘blinkered nationalists’ in Germany associated with the far right. <italic>The Herald</italic> therefore presents nationalists in Scotland as part of the political mainstream, but when nationalism is taken out of its Scottish context it becomes more unpleasant – bracketed with extremists, racists and the far-right (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884911431369">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>For the UK titles the collocation study revealed that when judgmental descriptions are used (usually in non-UK contexts) there is no clear, habitual use of the same word, although the most common collocated descriptors were ultra (used 20 times), extreme, hard-line and right-wing/far-right (‘moderate’ was also used but this term was reserved for the Northern Irish political party, the SDLP). A large number of other adjectives was used more infrequently, such as fierce, fanatical, fringe, violent, sabre-rattling, ardent, rebel and proud. When collocated descriptors were used nationalists were therefore generally associated with negative values. On a few occasions more positive (or at least ambiguous) descriptions were deployed, such as intellectual or romantic. On one of the very rare occasions when a word that seems unambiguously positive (‘good’) is placed next to nationalist it is in fact used in an ironic way by <italic>The Guardian</italic> – the journalist writes about a Serbian politician being a good nationalist, in the way that you might describe a ‘good thief’: the word is not used to convey a sense of positive morality – rather his efficiency at pandering to a particular constituency.</p>
<p>If the overall impression of nationalists is negative, their aims are more diverse. Nationalists are described as having a variety of goals, confusingly sometimes in a non-national context. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884911431369">Table 4</xref> shows the term is sometimes used to convey the idea of religious segregation or supremacy (Hindu/Muslim/Catholic nationalists) as well as tribal or language interests (Pashtun and Gaelic). Nationalists are also associated with murderers (Turkey) and racists (various countries including far-right movements in Bulgaria, France and the UK); those concerned about foreign influence (China and Somalia); and occasionally more benevolently as anti-Colonialists (Arab nationalists). Why then are such diverse movements all labeled as nationalists? It is here that the application of discourse analysis and the idea of strategy can provide insights.</p>

<title>Attitudes to secessionism: A discourse analysis</title>
<p>In their discussion of national identity, Wodak et al. identify constructive strategies as the most comprehensive discursive strategies. These, they say, ‘attempt to construct and to establish a certain national identity by promoting unification, identification and solidarity, as well as differentiation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884911431369">1999</xref>: 33). Falling within the overall category of constructive strategies are various other sub-strategies. These include assimilation, which emphasizes sameness and similarities and which can be realized discursively through various means such as by using personal pronouns (e.g. ‘we’), and dissimilation, which emphasizes difference and which can also be realized by personal pronouns such as ‘they’ and ‘those’.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, this study is less interested in how a specific national identity is discursively created and perpetuated and more interested in the contrast drawn by existing, western nation state elites between themselves as belonging to natural, timeless entities and nationalist others. Assimilation strategies, in this context, in effect embrace and address readers as part of the community of normal, acceptable nation states. Dissimilation strategies, however, are used when readers are invited to recognize others. By thinking of strategies in this way, it is possible to make sense of the sometimes confusing way the label nationalist is used by many western journalists: it is a means of realizing these strategies. It has less to do with describing a particular consistent political philosophy and, in most cases, more to do with conveying a sense of something unacceptable and deviant. This point can be illustrated by an analysis of newspaper coverage on 22 January 2007 of parliamentary elections in Serbia. The three UK-wide titles all reported on this event that day, although the two Scottish papers did not.</p>
<p>The Serbian Radical Party performed well in the Serbian general election. The party’s leader was Vojislav Seselj, who at the time was on trial in The Hague for crimes against humanity. Reporters, in line with professional practice, needed to convey a complex situation in an accessible manner. It is possible to identify the way both assimilation and dissimilation strategies were deployed in their attempt to do this. The introduction to the report in <italic>The Times</italic> reads:
<disp-quote>
<p>The ultranationalist Radicals, who ruled Serbia with Slobodan Milosevic in the 1990s, won the most votes in the first election since the breakup of the country’s union with Montenegro last year.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The third paragraph starts:
<disp-quote>
<p>However, the pro-Western Democratic Party also performed strongly …</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the fifth paragraph the reporter offers some interpretation:
<disp-quote>
<p>The election will determine whether the troubled Balkan nation drifts towards mainstream Europe or returns to its nationalist path. Serbia’s pro-democratic parties could form a new government if they agree on who will be the next Prime Minister.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>At no point in the article is there any attempt to offer a general definition of a nationalist. Instead, the term is used as part of a dissimilation strategy – to separate us, the readers, from them. The Radicals in the intro are ultra-nationalists, who ‘ruled’ Serbia. It is interesting to note the use of the verb ‘rule’, more associated with dictatorship or monarchy, rather than, for example, the word ‘govern’ which we might expect to be used when describing a mainstream western political party in office. The third paragraph states clearly by implication that the nationalists are anti-democratic (dissimilation from western readership) and in the fifth paragraph nationalists are associated with wartime and the past.</p>
<p>But there are also assimilation strategies at work – the sense that the world is naturally made up of nation states and which we, the readers, belong to. In the intro the definite article is used before the word ‘country’ implicitly accepting that ‘the country’ is a natural entity. Anti-nationalists are not defined as those who question ‘the country’s’ existence: no political group in the article does that. They are instead defined as being part of ‘mainstream Europe’. By implication, those in mainstream Europe must therefore be anti or non-nationalist. The naturalness, and rights, of the world of nation states is further illustrated later in the article when the reporter discusses the issue of Kosovo:
<disp-quote>
<p>The West had feared that if the Radicals emerged as outright winners, Europe would face another crisis if Kosovo <italic>was given</italic> independence. (emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This is interesting because the issue is not presented as one of Kosovan self-determination but as something in the gift of western states – whether or not to ‘give’ Kosovo independence. The assimilation strategy here invites readers to identify with a natural world where existing nation states not only exist but have the power and right to determine whether others should be allowed to join the nation state club.</p>
<p>In its coverage on 22 January, <italic>The Guardian</italic> labels the Radicals as ‘extreme nationalists’ but also elsewhere in the story as plain nationalists with no collocation modifier. As in <italic>The Times</italic>, a dissimilation strategy can be identified in the way that readers are invited to disassociate themselves from nationalists (the extremists). An assimilation strategy can also be identified in relation to opponents of nationalism who are described as ‘liberal pro-Europeans’. A quote is used prominently from the US ambassador to Belgrade, who urges voters to reject the Radicals who espouse the ‘retrograde vision of extremists who would be happy to turn Serbia into an isolated island blinded by nationalism’. The two strategies of assimilation and dissimilation work side by side here. Firstly readers are being implicitly asked to identify and accept the idea of a world of nation states; one in which there are ambassadors (an assimilation strategy, as British readers will be aware that Britain too is a country with ambassadors) and to reject the idea of nationalism which leaves a people blinded and an isolated island (dissimilation strategy). In this article, <italic>The Guardian</italic> reports that as well as the extremists there is another ‘nationalist’ force – the party of the ‘conservative nationalist’ Vojislav Kostunica. Kostunica, it is reported, may be willing to do a deal with ‘pro-western’ Democrats. At this stage then, readers have been confronted with extreme nationalists – defined as such for having a war criminal as leader and because of their opposition to liberalism and Europe; the Democrats – who are defined as being pro-western and pro-Europe; and conservative nationalists, who the reporter has signaled as being more moderate than the Radicals.</p>
<p>Later on in the article we come to a paragraph that attempts to provide interpretation. This paragraph states: ‘The Radicals vow never to surrender Kosovo and Mr Kostunica engineered a referendum on a new Serbian constitution declaring Kosovo an eternal part of Serbia.’ So what unites the Radicals and Mr Kostunica under the banner of nationalist (in contrast presumably to Democrats) is clear: their opposition to the secession of Kosovo from Serbia. The contrast with the way the nationalist debate in the UK is framed by the British papers is striking. In that context, comments from the SNP’s opponents expressing opposition to Scottish secession from the UK are never presented as a British nationalist position. Indeed, in a leading article five days earlier on 17 January, <italic>The Guardian</italic> warns of resentment between England and Scotland, ‘of just the kind that nationalists on both sides of the border will exploit’. In other words, nationalists in this article are those who want to separate England and Scotland. The article goes on to describe those who want to maintain the UK as Unionists – the standard category used in British political discourse for opponents of Scottish (or Welsh) independence, not as British nationalists.</p>
<p>Similarly, an authored comment piece in <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic> on 19 January, written in support of the continuation of the British state, uses the phrase Scottish nationalist (and English nationalist when describing those in England who want to end the Union) but never British nationalist. In this article there is a clear constructive assimilation strategy at work, realized in the use of words and phrases such as ‘our society’, ‘our agreement’, ‘our country’ and ‘we’re all in the boat together’ to describe the United Kingdom. Nationalists, by contrast are destructive – they want to ‘attack’ the Union, and ‘break-up’ Britain (dissimilation strategy). We therefore have these descriptions offered to readers: in Serbia, nationalists are those who oppose secession; but in the UK, nationalists are those who propose secession. The label nationalist is not therefore used to describe a particular political philosophy, but as a way of realizing a strategy of dissimilation to describe others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1464884911431369">
<title>Nationalists and immigration</title>
<p>In the articles referred to, nationalists then are those campaigning to protect the territory of their state, whereas in the UK, the nationalists are those seeking to break-up the state. A further similar illustration of the way UK newspapers reserve the term for others, even it if appears to highlight inconsistency, can be seen from analysing a news story about immigration to New Zealand in <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic> on 27 February. This story was headlined: ‘British immigrants face a hostile reception after Maori call for curb.’ The news story goes on to say Maori politicians are calling for restrictions on immigration from ‘mainly white countries’. The third paragraph identifies the Maori politicians as ‘Maori nationalists’ and then later in the article specifically identifies the person making the call as the co-leader of the Maori Party. A racial element to the story is made clear as it is reported that the ‘nationalists’ are accusing the government (by implication, non-nationalists) of running a campaign to prevent the ‘browning of New Zealand’. As in the Serbian case, the reporter on this story has used nationalist as a shorthand way of describing the Maori Party to a British readership. No other explanation of the Maori Party’s political position is given other than the single word ‘nationalist’ and its call for immigration restrictions based on a racial/ethnic concern. Its nationalism is thus defined here by its position on immigration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464884911431369">5</xref></sup> The final paragraph of the article is a quote from ‘Helen Clark, the prime minister’ who dismisses the Maori Party’s demands as ridiculous, adding: ‘Our country has been built on immigration; you’re part of it, I’m part of it.’ The use of the definite article in front of Prime Minister (rather than for example ‘Labour Prime Minister’) and the phrase ‘our country’ projects Clark as being inclusive and reinforces the sense that it is natural for New Zealand to be a nation state. Nationalism in this story is therefore very much an ethnic/racial idea, opposed by an inclusive national leader, who is liberal on immigration. Indeed, it is her liberal stance on immigration (as implied by the quote) that seems to define Helen Clark, in this particular news story as <italic>not</italic> being a nationalist.</p>
<p>But applying the same criteria to the UK would lead to some confusing results. At the time the article was written, immigration was becoming one of the major political issues in Britain. In response, the Conservative Party, which is supported by the <italic>Telegraph</italic>, called for controls on non-EU migrants. This policy would clearly have an impact on Asian and African immigration into Britain, and therefore a racial element. During this debate, while the Conservatives and others expressed concern at the large number of people coming into the UK, the ‘nationalist’ SNP’s focus was different. The SNP was concerned that Scotland’s population was due to fall and therefore sought to project Scotland as an attractive destination for inward migrants. But during the three months studied, the <italic>Telegraph</italic> never described the Conservatives as nationalists – even though it was proposing a policy similar to one which in the news report highlighted here was a defining feature of nationalists in New Zealand. The crucial point seems to be that both Clark and the British Conservatives are representatives of established democratic nation states, and it is that, rather than any policy consistency, that marks them out as non-nationalists.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In her discussion of news reporting, Cotter sets out the challenges facing news writers:
<disp-quote>
<p>Daily, a reporter is charged with grasping the significant particulars about a complex situation, synthesizing those particulars and writing accessibly about them – with a minimum number of words, often in a minimum amount of time, and for readers with a minimum amount of time and attention. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911431369">2010</xref>: 173)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For journalists, working under the professional imperatives of needing to make sometimes complex issues easily understandable and of telling stories in a succinct manner, a label such as nationalist is clearly useful, but at what cost to clarity?</p>
<p>To be a nationalist in the newspapers studied can mean different things: someone who supports a secessionist movement; someone who opposes a secessionist movement; a religious segregationist; a defender of national or group culture; a racist; and various other causes or beliefs. It can often also mean being defined as an extremist, ultra or on the far right. By adding such terms next to the label nationalist, it can be argued that reporters are leaving open the possibility that other nationalists (those not collocated with such terms) are more benign. However, even if not explicitly labeled as extreme the concept is presented by many journalists studied here, as Billig suggests it would, not as respectable, but as generally alien to the world of nation states and in particular as a means of identifying others.</p>
<p>Many of the groups covered by the newspapers are indeed clearly extreme and far right, but surely it would be better to find a more precise way of explaining how they are extreme rather than grasping for the catch-all term ‘nationalist’: the use of which, it has been argued here, is one of the means by which strategies of dissimilation are realized and which in turn are part of a more comprehensive constructive strategy of constructing and maintaining the naturalness of existing nation states. Wodak et al. lament what they say is ‘the increase in discriminatory acts and exclusionary practices conducted in the name of nationalism in many parts of Europe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884911431369">1999</xref>: 1). Paradoxically, it seems one exclusionary practice is to use the label nationalist as a catch-all term for undesirable, irrational elements.</p>
<p>As set out earlier, scholars interested in the role of journalism in sustaining nation states have challenged the usefulness of the banal nationalism concept when applying it to the United Kingdom because of the multinational nature of the state. Doubts have been raised over the power of personal pronouns in maintaining a collective British national identity. What then can be said about this second aspect of banal nationalism – the way the term nationalist is used?</p>
<p>Here, it is worth noting differences between coverage in the UK-wide titles compared with the Scottish titles. Because of the paucity of foreign stories in <italic>The Scotsman</italic> and <italic>The Herald</italic> few individuals or groups outwith Scotland are identified as nationalist. Scottish nationalists themselves are usually presented without immediate textual modifiers. Banal British nationalism might therefore appear to be a relatively weak force in the Scottish press: previous studies have cast doubt on the usefulness of ‘a deixis of homeland’ and the findings presented in this article suggest nationalism is not presented as particularly irrational (in a Scottish context anyway).</p>
<p>However, other aspects of the findings reveal a more complex picture. Firstly, all three of the UK-wide titles are sold in Scotland and compete with the indigenous Scottish press. These papers, as detailed earlier, do present nationalism as a generally alien concept. Secondly, both the Scottish and UK titles hardly ever refer to the opponents of Scottish nationalism as British nationalists. This is despite the fact that the leaders of all the main UK political parties say maintaining the union between England and Scotland and therefore the current British state is of the utmost importance to them. The SNP is harshly criticized by those parties for the damaging consequences that Scottish independence would mean for the unity of the United Kingdom. Does that then mean the leaders of UK Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democratic parties are extreme or ultra-nationalists because they are so committed to protecting Great Britain? According to both the Scottish and UK-wide newspapers studied here they are not nationalists at all – something those leaders would wholeheartedly agree with.</p>
<p>Indeed, in a report in the run-up to the Scottish elections in 2007, <italic>The Herald</italic> quoted the leader of the Liberal Democrats, a Scot, as saying: ‘I’m not a Nationalist. I’m a Liberal. There is a sense in which Liberalism and Nationalism are the antithesis of each other.’ This is interesting because this comment from a senior British politician clearly excludes the possibility that support for the continuation of the British state can be considered a nationalist position. This in turn is a position implicitly accepted by the newspapers in this study.</p>
<p>Although therefore the findings of this article can be said to support the contention that because of the multinational nature of the UK, and the varied nature of the British press, banal nationalism as a concept has limitations when considered in a British media context, they also provide good evidence for an argument that contends that newspapers are useful for those who are keen to contrast their liberal outlook with what they consider to be illiberal nationalist others.</p>

<p>This article uses the terms United Kingdom (UK), Great Britain and Britain interchangeably. In doing so I recognize this is not the formal constitutional position but it is common practice and helps to avoid too much repetition. The UK is formally Great Britain (comprising England, Wales and Scotland) and Northern Ireland. Although British political leaders such as ex-Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown frequently attacked Scottish and Welsh nationalists, they refrained from criticizing Northern Irish nationalists because of the sensitivity surrounding the peace process there.</p>

<p>I am unfamiliar with the party, but its political position and philosophy are set out in its constitution, which calls for self-determination (not defined in terms of political institutions) for Maoris; although it also says: ‘The Maori Party is for all citizens of this country.’</p>
