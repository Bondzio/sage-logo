<abstract>
<p>The growing diversity of America’s public school enrollment makes it essential that all teachers be prepared for teaching students from diverse backgrounds. This paper explores the racial attitudes of teachers, specifically probing whether, and if so how, they may differ across schools of different student racial contexts. In particular, this paper compares how diverse or segregated schools, conceptualized in three different ways, may impact teachers’ racial attitudes and awareness. Teachers’ racial attitudes may influence teacher behavior towards students of different racial backgrounds, and relate to other aspects of professional behavior and decision-making. School racial context, particularly racial stability, was found to be an important predictor of teachers’ racial attitudes. This paper illuminates important patterns to consider and study further as the racial composition continues to become more diverse and school racial contexts become more complex in terms of composition, stability, and in relation to district composition.</p>

<p>The growing diversity of America’s public school enrollment makes it essential that all teachers be prepared for teaching students from diverse backgrounds. Considerable confusion exists about whether and, if so, how teachers should acknowledge race. Some teachers believe that it is inappropriate or irrelevant to bring up race and should be “colormute” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013124510392780">Pollock, 2004</xref>), because to do otherwise would demonstrate teacher prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013124510392780">Schofield, 1982</xref>). Others have argued that this colorblind or colormute approach causes teachers to overlook or fail to discuss important differences and not adapt their actions within their classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124510392780">Morris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013124510392780">Sleeter, 1996</xref>). The prevalence of a colorblind ideology can also create tension for teachers of color, particularly in predominantly White environments. Several studies have documented how Black teachers often feel marginalized in schools with White students and faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124510392780">Bell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124510392780">Maboleka &amp; Madsen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124510392780">Madsen &amp; Hollins, 2000</xref>). This unease was not because they wanted to be treated as “Black teachers” but instead because they recognized that the lack of discussion about race and inequality failed to address important issues that affected the education of students of color, in particular.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124510392780">Lewis (2003)</xref> suggests that schools can be “race-making institutions . . . they are the one place where groups who often have little contact come together . . . where children have an opportunity to learn about and, one hopes, to value difference . . . But they also play a role in providing excuses and justifications for not making systematic efforts to redress inequalities. As the narrative goes, ‘everyone has a chance’” (p. 190). Teachers in particular may be motivated by this narrative to persist in teaching, to believe that their schools and their classrooms are places in which race or class does not matter. Such a perspective fails to consider the unequal nature of opportunity provided in some schools, and the ways in which that disadvantages not only students, but also teachers in such schools.</p>
<p>These issues take on particular salience as our society is in the midst of dramatic racial change, and schools are on the forefront of demographic transition. The public school enrollment in the two largest regions—the South and the West—has a majority of students of color and Latinos are now the second largest group in public schools and among the entire population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013124510392780">Orfield, 2009</xref>). Demographic changes are spreading beyond urban districts, which have historically educated most students of color. Instead, suburban districts, particularly in the nation’s largest metropolitan areas, are enrolling growing numbers of non-White students, and patterns of segregation are following these students across suburban lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013124510392780">Orfield &amp; Frankenberg, 2008</xref>). Diversity is spreading into even formerly homogeneous White communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124510392780">Frey, 2001</xref>). These patterns are creating complex school racial contexts even as the teaching force remains overwhelmingly White.</p>
<p>This diversity makes it even more important to fully explore all beliefs students, including those related to race. The vast majority of teachers are White and White Americans, because of their dominance in the country’s social structure and the high isolation of Whites, are less aware of the racial disadvantage and barriers that may limit the opportunities of individuals from other races/ethnicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124510392780">Bobo, Kluegel, &amp; Smith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124510392780">Bonilla-Silva, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124510392780">Hawley (2007)</xref> summarized findings from teaching literature regarding the complexity of understanding needs as such: “teacher effectiveness will be enhanced by the teacher’s deep understanding of student backgrounds . . . [which] involves more than knowing the general characteristics of students from different cultures” (p. 46). Developing a “sociocultural consciousness” also prompts teachers to see beyond their own background to understand how their class, race, and other characteristics have shaped their attitudes and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124510392780">Banks et al., 2005</xref>). Teacher preparation and in-service training in schools, perhaps particularly those experiencing racial transition, could help teachers consider their role as actors in the racial hierarchy–to realize that schools can remake or challenge racial inequality and that teachers’ own experiences with prejudice or discrimination (in addition to any lack of awareness about structural racism) could relate to the actions teachers take in their classrooms.</p>
<p>This article explores the racial attitudes of teachers, specifically probing whether, and if so how, they may differ across schools of different student racial contexts. In particular, this article compares how diverse or segregated schools, conceptualized in three different ways, may impact teachers’ racial attitudes and awareness. In addition to influencing teacher behavior toward students of different racial backgrounds, teachers’ racial attitudes may be important for a number of other actions by teachers. They may also relate to whether a teacher believes it is important to incorporate lessons about the contributions of different groups. Or they might affect whether a teacher seeks out race-conscious teacher training. Ultimately, teachers’ attitudes might relate to their satisfaction and willingness to remain at a school of different racial contexts.</p>

<title>Contemporary Understanding of Racial Attitudes</title>
<p>Decades of social science research has investigated the attitudes of the public regarding racial integration and equity, although less research has focused on these issues within schools. Because of the lack of studies focusing on teacher racial attitudes, and because teachers are situated within the larger societal context in which the public’s attitudes may influence or reflect their own, this section first reviews the public’s general attitudes on race. It then turns to examining what is known about teachers’ racial attitudes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0013124510392780">
<title>General Public Racial Attitudes</title>
<p>As the U.S. Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of two voluntary integration plans in December 2006,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013124510392780">1</xref></sup> there was skepticism during the oral arguments from some of the justices about whether the community cared about integrated schools. After being assured by the counsel for the Jefferson County (metropolitan Louisville) school district that there was overwhelming support in the community, Justice Antonin Scalia then inquired as to whether this feeling of support was shared by families (or “objects of this experiment” as he called them) and whether this support was shared by parents of different races (Jefferson County transcript, 2006, pp. 43-44). The district’s attorney affirmatively answered that not only did parents support the voluntary integration plan, but also that this support was across racial lines. The justice’s questions indicate the general perception that the public, particularly Whites, has turned against school desegregation, because, at least in part, there are questions as to the importance of racial diversity for students’ learning and a belief that since we are more than 50 years after <italic>Brown</italic> the problems of racial segregation and inequality have been solved.</p>
<p>While public opinion (at least in the South) was against integration prior to the <italic>Brown</italic> decision, the general public has become overwhelmingly supportive of the ideal of integration—although this does not necessarily mean the public is also supportive of actual efforts it would take to implement integrated schools. Hundreds of organizations and individuals, including many prominent educational groups, filed briefs with the Supreme Court in Fall 2006 urging the Justices to uphold Louisville’s and Seattle’s voluntary integration policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013124510392780">2</xref></sup> Most research on attitudes about race distinguishes between the attitudes of Whites and non-Whites, usually African Americans as they have been the largest minority group in the United States until quite recently. One author concluded, “Blacks and Whites hold fundamentally different views regarding the availability of equal employment, educational, and housing opportunities and the importance of racial discrimination in limiting these opportunities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124510392780">McArdle, 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124510392780">Louie, 2005</xref>). Because this and other research have shown consistent differences in attitudes between these groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124510392780">Schuman, Steeh, Bobo, &amp; Krysan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124510392780">Frankenberg &amp; Jacobsen, 2011</xref>)—although, of course, there are variations within these groups as well, particularly by education level—these are examined separately here.</p>
<sec id="section3-0013124510392780">
<title>White attitudes: Growing, but limited support</title>
<p>One of the most consistent trends across public opinion surveys is that the support among White Americans for the general principle of racial integration of schools and other social institutions has increased dramatically since 1940. In fact, in 1985 there were such a high percentage of White Americans agreeing about the importance of integrated schools (93%) that the question was dropped from the General Social Survey, administered regularly by National Opinion Research Center (NORC). Whites with at least some college education are particularly supportive of integrated schools while the least supportive of the general principle of racial integration are less educated southerners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124510392780">Schuman et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, the youngest generation of White Americans is the most liberal toward racial integration, so far. This is consistent with other research that has found that those experiencing racially desegregated schools have more positive attitudes toward integration, which may well be the youngest generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124510392780">Orfield, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>While there has been a rise in overall support for the general principle of racial integration among Whites, there are several reasons to believe that this may not be completely reflective of the current state of race relations. First, while the percentage of White Americans expressing approval of racial integration has increased, the social desirability to express racist attitudes has declined, which may at least partially explain this trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124510392780">Bobo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124510392780">Bonilla-Silva, 2003</xref>). Second, many White Americans believe that Black disadvantage in society is due to lack of motivation or willpower; an increasingly small minority of White Americans believe that structural discrimination continues to affect the opportunities for Black Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013124510392780">Pride, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124510392780">Schuman et al., 1997</xref>). This might be due to the fact that only one fifth of Whites believe that there is discrimination in hiring/promotion or housing for Blacks. Whites also tend to overestimate the economic status of African Americans. Taken together, they cannot “see” the disparities that still exist and, as a result, may not believe in the need for race-conscious policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124510392780">Brown et al., 2005</xref>). Third, even as support for the principle of integrated schools increased, the percentage of White Americans supporting federal implementation of desegregation has waned, particularly among Whites with less education. There also continues to be little support in public opinion surveys for using busing to achieve school integration, although the youngest generation surveyed reported the most support for busing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124510392780">Schuman et al., 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0013124510392780">3</xref></sup> Finally, in integrated settings of any kind—such as schools or neighborhoods—Whites are more likely to report being willing to participate when it involves smaller numbers of Blacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510392780">Charles, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124510392780">Schuman et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0013124510392780">
<title>Non-Whites’ racial attitudes: Seeing societal discrimination</title>
<p>By contrast, the attitudes of non-Whites and Blacks, in particular, are more positive toward Whites as well as toward race-conscious policies, including school integration. For example, a higher percentage of Blacks are willing to be present in integrated settings, such as diverse schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124510392780">Schuman et al., 1997</xref>) or neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510392780">Charles, 2005</xref>). Like Whites, however, they are less willing to do so when there are higher percentages of other-race students or neighbors. Another significant difference from Whites is the explanation for continuing racial inequality. In contrast to Whites, Black Americans, particularly those with more education, are much more likely to cite societal discrimination to explain Black disadvantage rather than individualistic reasons like motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124510392780">Schuman et al., 1997</xref>). These explanations for inequality are important because, among other reasons, this would influence perceptions about the need for any governmental policies particularly those related to education, for example, to try to address persisting racial inequality.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the fact that Blacks are more likely to think that there is societal discrimination that disadvantages them, only one third of Black Americans believed that Black and White students have equal educational opportunities. In comparison, two thirds of White Americans thought there was equal opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124510392780">Carroll, 2004</xref>). Black respondents also believe more is needed to be done to integrate schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124510392780">Orfield, 1995</xref>) and have supported more redistributive policies in order to accomplish this than have Whites (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124510392780">McMiller, 2000</xref>). For example, a survey of a random sample of parents in Louisville in 1996 showed that 86% of parents with children in school and 92% of African American parents said that it was important “that schools have students from different races and backgrounds in the same school.” Furthermore, 68% of White parents and 73% of Black parents thought diversity would produce a “higher quality of education” for their own children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013124510392780">Wilkerson, 1996</xref>). Significantly, parents (particularly Blacks) also supported specific mechanisms that the district could use to create integrated schools while still providing school choices.</p>
<p>There has been relatively little research into the opinions of Latinos about integration. One exception is a 2004 survey of Latinos by the Pew Hispanic Center in which they asked whether racially integrated schools were better for students. A slight majority of <italic>native-born</italic> Latinos said that integrated schools were better while only 38% of foreign-born Latinos agreed. In contrast to White attitudes discussed earlier, three quarters of Latinos who believed that integrated schools were helpful for students also thought that the government should do more to actually create integrated schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013124510392780">Pew Hispanic Center/Kaiser Family Foundation, 2004</xref>). The same survey also asked respondents whether they would be in favor of affirmative action programs to give preference to historically underrepresented racial/ethnic groups in university admissions and more than two thirds of Latinos (and Blacks) favored such programs while the same percentage of Whites opposed the program. On this question, native-born Latinos were less favorable toward affirmative action programs, suggesting a diversity of views about race and integration/inequality within “Latinos.” Earlier, community surveys of Latinos also found them to be more supportive of integration than Whites, but not as supportive as Blacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013124510392780">Orfield, 1986</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013124510392780">
<title>Lack of racial awareness among all groups</title>
<p>An additional dimension of racial attitudes is racial awareness. Here, this is conceptualized as the ability to accurately perceive racial composition. By contrast to the discrepancies in racial attitudes by race discussed earlier, a commonality across all groups regardless of race/ethnicity was a lack of awareness about the racial composition of the entire population. A comparison of perceptions of the U.S. racial composition and the actual composition in 1995 revealed wide discrepancies. Although the U.S. population was nearly three fourths White at the time, the average responses of White, Black, and Latino respondents was that Whites comprised less than 50% of the population. Only Asians believed that more than half of all of the population was White (55%). Black and Latinos were estimated at the highest percentage by respondents of their respective racial/ethnic group, and their estimates were more than twice the proportion than their group actually was (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124510392780">Morin, 1995</xref>). Some of this misperception may be due to residential segregation—although that likely would not explain the White response—but it also suggests that there may be little awareness of the current racial composition of the country, particularly an overemphasis of the growing minority population.</p>
<p>In sum, prior literature suggests very different attitudes among Whites and non-Whites about the existence of racial discrimination, explanations about inequality, and support for race-conscious policies. These patterns may result in very different ideas about the extent to which schools should be conscious of race and diversity in educating students. Importantly, given the composition of the teaching force, there is growing support among White and younger Americans. Furthermore, respondents across all racial/ethnic groups may not be conscious of the current racial demographics of the country.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0013124510392780">
<title>Teachers’ Racial Attitudes</title>
<p>Teachers, of course, are part of the overall population. To the extent that teachers are mostly White and educated, they may reflect the racial attitudes of White, educated Americans, namely being supportive of racial integration. However, the nature of the teaching profession may be such that the attitudes of teachers differ systematically from other college-educated Whites. At the same time, however, teachers’ professional training and experiences may influence their opinions in ways that may differ from others of similar demographic background. Most research on teachers’ racial attitudes consists of qualitative studies, but a recent analysis of the General Social Survey suggested that White teachers’ racial attitudes are similar to the general population. If anything, teachers may be <italic>less</italic> tolerant than the nonteaching population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013124510392780">Sberna &amp; Moras, 2006</xref>). This finding is not surprising, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124510392780">Gomez’s (1993)</xref> earlier description of White teachers as overwhelmingly teaching in communities very close to where they grew up and having attended homogeneous teacher preparation institutions.</p>
<p>A smaller body of literature has examined the racial attitudes of teachers. Some studies have examined teachers’ own racial backgrounds to determine whether that influences teacher behavior, though this approach does not directly probe teacher’s racial attitudes. Among teachers, because of the effects of intergroup contact discussed earlier (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013124510392780">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2006</xref>), their opinions may also vary by whether they have had experience in racially diverse schools, as students or as teachers in schools where a majority of the students and/or faculty have differing racial composition from teachers. Research has also largely failed to consider the racial or economic context of the schools when assessing teachers’ attitudes.</p>
<p>In schools that are diverse or going through racial change, teachers’ attitudes may be particularly important for students. Earlier studies of desegregated classrooms found teachers’ racial attitudes and awareness influenced their students’ success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124510392780">Hawley, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124510392780">Gerard &amp; Miller, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510392780">St. John, 1981</xref>). This might be due to how attitudes would then affect teachers’ behavior such as how they structure the class, the connections they build with both White and non-White students and families, or utilizing certain teaching techniques that enhance the classroom experiences of all students. Recent research of teaching candidates, however, concluded that most tended to have negative opinions about people from different backgrounds than themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124510392780">Hollins &amp; Torres Guzman, 2005</xref>). When combined with teachers’ isolation from people of other races/ethnicities, it is not surprising that they often report feeling unprepared for teaching in racially diverse settings.</p>
<p>An ethnographic study of six White teachers, suggested for participation by educators because of their racial awareness, examined influences on White teachers’ awareness. The only teacher who talked about how important it is to see students’ race was the teacher who worked primarily with Black students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124510392780">Johnson, 2002</xref>). Although their school context, specifically the fact that they may not have had as much interracial contact, might affect teachers’ willingness to “see race,” another reason might be their teacher training programs. All but this same teacher thought that their teacher education program had little effect on their racial awareness; the one exception was the teacher who attended a nontraditional teacher education program focusing on diversity.</p>
<p>The dominance of colorblind ideology may be particularly salient in schools that are losing White students. In a qualitative study of a school that had recently become virtually all minority, White teachers denied that race was an issue, an assertion their minority peers disagreed with. The racial dynamics of the transition they experienced, however, caused staff to feel that becoming a minority school brought a more “difficult” student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124510392780">Morris, 2005</xref>). At the same time, White teachers were less likely to live in their school’s community and, therefore, fully understand the context within which the school and students were situated.</p>
<p>Augmenting these qualitative studies, existing survey evidence suggests that teachers, many with everyday experiences in racially diverse schools, believe in the benefits of racial diversity for student learning and for students’ productive economic and civic progression into the diverse American society. These benefits, according to teachers, are difficult to attain in single-race classrooms (Goldring &amp; Smrekar, 1993). Furthermore, diversity enables building respect for understanding people of other races and cultures, which teachers cite as one of the most important goals of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124510392780">Gallup, 1985</xref>). Virtually all teachers in a recent survey stated that it was important for students of different races or ethnicities to interact, though far fewer believed this was currently happening in their schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124510392780">Bagnishi &amp; Sheer, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, it appears that the little research about teachers’ attitudes regarding race has not examined how these attitudes might be shaped by teachers’ school characteristics in terms of faculty or student racial composition. There is, however, some reason to believe that teachers’ own race as well as the racial composition of others in their school may affect teachers’ racial attitudes. In general, opinion research among teachers demonstrates that most believe in the importance of racially diverse schools and understand from their professional experiences the benefits that social science research has found for students in racially diverse schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0013124510392780">4</xref></sup> What we cannot tell from this literature, however, is how teachers’ experiences and, in particular, the racial composition of their students may relate to their beliefs about the importance of race in teaching students in various school racial contexts.</p>

<title>School Racial Context: Rethinking What Diversity Is</title>
<p>In school segregation research and policy, notions of “diverse” or “segregated” schools are often under-conceptualized. Aside from racial composition alone, do schools in the midst of racial transition or schools that differ significantly from the district composition shape the racial context of schools? This study conceptualizes of the student composition in three distinct ways to attempt to more fully understand the racial context of schools and how that relates to teachers’ attitudes. By doing so, it can help us more fully understand the nuance of the ways in which student composition impacts teachers’ opinions about race in schools.</p>
<sec id="section9-0013124510392780">
<title>Stage 1: Traditional conceptualization of diversity</title>
<p>The first measurement of school racial context is a simple definition of segregation. Based on critical mass literature as well as studies showing the importance of White students as a signaling mechanism to families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124510392780">Clotfelter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124510392780">Massey &amp; Denton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124510392780">Orfield, 1983</xref>), this stage of the analysis defines segregated minority schools as those with less than 10% of White students and segregated White schools as schools with more than 90% White students. Diverse schools, then, are those with between 10% and 90% White students.</p>
<p>Both nationally and in this sample, the majority of schools are classified as diverse (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013124510392780">Table 1</xref>). More than one-quarter of schools are segregated as White schools. Segregated minority schools are underrepresented in this sample in comparison with all schools.</p>

<title>Stage 2: Racial diversity and stability</title>
<p>The second way in which this analysis conceptualizes of school racial context is by considering both racial composition and the stability or change of racial composition. For schools that have been stably diverse for a long time, for example, the diversity may not be as apparent to teachers as it would be in a school that is also diverse but has a declining percentage of White students.</p>
<p>For this analysis, diverse or segregated schools are defined as stable if their racial composition in 2005-2006 is within 10 percentage points of a decade earlier. If their racial composition differs by more than 10 percentage points, it is labeled as “unstable.” For diverse schools, unstable schools are further divided into those that are unstable and increasing in White percentage (e.g., a diverse school that has a White percentage that is at least 10% higher than a decade prior) and those that are unstable and <italic>decreasing</italic> in White percentage.</p>
<p>In this sample and nationally, the majority of segregated White and non-White schools were stable over the preceding decade, particularly among segregated White schools. More than one quarter of schools are stably diverse while another one fifth of schools are diverse but rapidly losing White students. A small percentage among this sample, and nationally, are diverse and <italic>increasing</italic> in White percentage even as the overall composition of the public school enrollment has declined in White percentage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0013124510392780">
<title>Stage 3: Relative racial composition</title>
<p>One of the ways in which school districts were judged to have eliminated vestiges of de jure segregation was the extent to which schools were racially identifiable from the district’s racial composition. “Racially identifiable,” here is conceptualized as schools in which the White percentage differed by at least 10 percentage points from the White percentage of the school’s district. Whether schools were perceived as “White” or “Black” indicated to federal courts, whether students would attend the school, and whether a school was perceived as equal to other schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0013124510392780">5</xref></sup> Advocates summarized Supreme Court precedent as holding that, “even once school systems had eliminated ‘whites only’ or ‘blacks only’ schools . . . the Court remained concerned with whether the school was racially identifiable . . . the Court has likewise seen ‘[racially identifiable] black’ schools lead to black districts, from which whites have fled for the same reasons” (<italic>Amicus</italic> brief of the Civil Rights Clinic at Howard, 2006, p. 15).</p>
<p>This article defines schools with a percentage of White students at least 10 percentage points higher as racially identifiable White schools while those schools with a percentage of White students 10 points lower than the surrounding district are classified as racially identifiable non-White schools. Both in this sample and among all public schools in 2005-2006, approximately one in four schools were racially identifiable, with more schools that were racially identifiable non-White than racially identifiable White.</p>

<title>Data Set</title>
<p>Few large-scale surveys of teachers’ attitudes about race exist. Some of the largest surveys of teachers—specifically, the periodic Schools and Staffing Survey administered by the National Center for Education Statistics and the annual MetLife Teacher survey<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0013124510392780">6</xref></sup>—rarely ask questions about teachers’ attitudes about race.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0013124510392780">7</xref></sup> For example, a 1993 Department of Education profile of American teachers contained items asking teachers’ opinions but none related with race or diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124510392780">Henke, Choy, Chen, Geis, &amp; Alt, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>This article analyzes responses from a recent national survey of 1,002 public school teachers from 48 states. The 47-item telephone survey was administered by a polling firm, National Research, which pretested the survey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0013124510392780">8</xref></sup> The survey included questions about teachers, their schools, attitudes, training, and practices related to diversity. The sample was drawn from a random list of 25,000 National Education Association (NEA) members. Forty-eight percent of people contacted who were qualified (e.g., were classroom teachers) and completed the survey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0013124510392780">9</xref></sup> Because of the focus on racial diversity, teachers in diverse schools were slightly oversampled (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013124510392780">Table 2</xref>).

<p>The characteristics of teachers in the sample are similar to the public teaching force in the United States in many respects. Like all teachers, the vast majority of teachers in this sample are White and female. There are fewer novice teachers and teachers new to their school among the sample. In addition, the percentage of teachers certified in the subject they are teaching was higher among the sample. Taken together, these characteristics suggest that the sample of teachers might be slightly more advantaged and stable than the entire teaching force.</p>

<p>Each of these questions probes how teachers think about student success as it relates to race and avoids direct questioning about racial attitudes that would likely result in answers that are influenced by the desire to be socially correct.</p>
<p>When examining the correlation between these variables, there were weak to no associations between them. The strongest relationship was between the influence of student’s race/ethnicity on success and the belief that the habits of African American and Hispanic students decreased their success (<italic>r</italic> = .317, <italic>p</italic> = .000). The bivariate correlations between all other pairs of variables were minimal (<italic>r</italic> &lt; .1).</p>
<p>Principal components analysis was used to construct a composite variable to represent teacher racial attitudes using the four indicators from the survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124510392780">Affifi &amp; Clark, 1997</xref>). From this analysis, there are two dimensions of racial attitudes that are worth attending to. Teachers who score high on the first composite are teachers who believed that race and ethnicity are related to success and that African American/Hispanic students have habits that decrease success. These teachers were also inclined to believe that student success was not related primarily to teachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124510392780">Gloria Ladson-Billings (1994)</xref> has identified one component of culturally relevant teaching as awareness of the larger societal context within which teacher–student interactions take place. This composite designates “race-conscious” attitudes. Teachers who score high on the second composite variable are teachers who agree that students learn better in racially diverse schools and that student academic success is primarily related to teachers. This second composite is labeled as “colorblind” because teachers scoring highly tend to discount racial structures and instead believe that success is related primarily to school factors. Taken together, these two components explain 60% of the total variance.</p>
<p>In addition to these two composite variables, a separate variable was constructed to measure “racial awareness,” which was the difference between a teacher’s estimate of the percentage of White students in their school and the White percentage of students according to the NCES Common Core.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0013124510392780">11</xref></sup> A positive value indicates that the teacher overestimated the percentage of White students while a negative value represents underestimating the percentage of White students in the school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0013124510392780">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>In addition to school racial context, this analysis included teacher and school characteristics as control variables. Due to the literature describing differences in racial attitudes among the general public by age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124510392780">Orfield, 1995</xref>) and race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124510392780">Schuman et al., 1997</xref>), teachers’ age and race (coded as a dummy variable with “1” for <italic>White</italic> and “0” for <italic>non-White</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0013124510392780">12</xref></sup>). Furthermore, research suggests that exposure to people of other racial groups may relate to more positive attitudes. Two control variables represent teacher’s exposure to others: percentage of other-race students in their own elementary school and the diversity of their current faculty. Finally, because of gender differences in public opinion, a variable for gender was included (female was “1”).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0013124510392780">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>This analysis used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to explore how school racial context was related to three aspects of teachers’ racial attitudes and awareness. After first fitting a model with control variables, each subsequent step in the analysis uses differing conceptualizations of school racial context to examine whether and how school racial context predicts teachers’ racial attitudes.</p>
<sec id="section16-0013124510392780">
<title>Analysis Using Personal and School Characteristics of Teachers</title>
<p>Each of the control variables included here in the initial model for the three separate outcomes have been found in prior work to be significant influences on racial attitudes. Faculty racial composition is a significant predictor of teachers’ racial attitudes, as expected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013124510392780">Tables 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0013124510392780">6</xref> show final models). Somewhat surprisingly, teachers’ age was positively associated with race-conscious attitudes, which contradicts research among the general population. This finding may reflect differences from the general population among the older teachers. Also surprisingly, a teacher’s own race (a dummy variable representing White or not) is only a significant predictor of racial awareness. And, earlier exposure to a more homogeneous White school was a positive predictor of a teacher’s colorblind attitude. Female was a negative predictor of each outcome variable but is only significant in teachers’ race-conscious attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0013124510392780">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Analysis Using Simple Categorization of School Diversity</title>
<p>The next stage of the analysis examined how school context impacted teachers’ attitudes through a simple conceptualization of school diversity: racially isolated White schools, racially isolated non-White schools, and diverse schools. During this part of the analysis, racially isolated White schools were the reference group, which accounted for just more than one quarter of schools in the sample. As expected, teaching in a racially isolated non-White school had a significant positive impact on teachers’ race-conscious attitudes in comparison to teachers in racially isolated White schools, while there was no significant impact for teachers in diverse schools. In other words, in comparison to teachers in racially isolated White schools, teaching in racially isolated non-White schools predicted higher values of race-conscious attitude. Both school types were also significant positive predictors of racial awareness (e.g., thought that their school had a higher White percentage than it did), which is not surprising because the White percentage of schools in the reference category is already high. The coefficient for racially isolated non-White schools was particularly large, meaning that teaching in schools with relatively few White students predicted a larger discrepancy between actual and estimated percentages of White students. This might suggest that such teachers are less aware of how concentrated students of color are in their schools. Being in a diverse or segregated non-White school did not have a significant impact on teachers’ colorblind attitudes in comparison to those in segregated White schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0013124510392780">
<title>Analysis Using Racial Diversity and Stability of Schools</title>
<p>The next step in the analysis was to conceptualize school diversity in terms of diversity (or not) and whether schools were racially stable or not. For diverse schools that were unstable, this was further divided into diverse schools that had an increasing percentage of White students and those with a decreasing share of Whites. The omitted dummy variable represented stably White segregated schools. In comparison to teachers in stably segregated White schools, teaching in stably segregated minority schools had a significant positive impact on teachers’ race-conscious attitudes. That is, in comparison to their peers in schools that had been overwhelmingly White for at least a decade, teaching in schools that have consistently lacked White students predicted higher values of race-conscious attitudes among teachers in such schools. Notably, while racially isolated non-White schools were a significant positive predictor of teachers’ race-conscious attitudes, when an element of stability was added to these racially-segregated minority schools, the magnitude of the impact on race-conscious attitudes is significant and positive while unstably segregated minority schools were a positive predictor of race-conscious attitudes, but did not attain statistical significance. None of the school context variables attained statistical significance in predicting colorblind attitudes, but while stably and increasingly White diverse schools had a negative impact on colorblind attitudes, teaching in diverse schools with a declining percentage of White students had a positive impact on teachers’ attitudes. Finally, again when examining teachers’ racial awareness, teaching in diverse schools losing White students has an impact similar to that of stably and unstably segregated non-White schools. Teaching in each of these three types of schools was a significant predictor of over-estimating the percentage of White students in comparison with teachers in stable White schools. It is especially interesting that diverse schools losing White students would predict similar attitudes for teachers as does teaching in segregated non-White schools. Conversely, teaching in diverse schools that were stably so or with an increasing percentage of White students was not significantly different from teaching in stably segregated White schools.</p>

<title>Analysis Comparing School Composition to Surrounding District</title>
<p>The third part of the analysis added the dimension of school district context to school diversity. In comparison to teaching in schools that did not differ much from the surrounding district’s racial composition, teaching in racially identifiable White schools had a positive impact on teacher’s racial awareness (e.g., estimated their school had a higher White percentage than it did). Racially identifiable schools were not significantly different from the control group in predicting teachers’ colorblind attitudes. Both main and interaction effects were significant in impacting teachers’ race-conscious attitudes in racially identifiable schools. While both types of schools had significant negative impacts for non-White teachers’ attitudes, the positive coefficient for the interaction terms are larger in magnitude than for the main effects, indicating a positive predictor of teaching in these schools for White teachers as compared with the omitted group. In other words, for White teachers, teaching in schools that differed substantially from the surrounding school district predicted significant higher values on the race-conscious attitude composite. Perhaps the discrepancy between the racial composition of their school—in either direction—from that of the school district made race and its relationship to opportunity more “visible” to them.</p>

<sec id="section20-0013124510392780">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article has assessed how teachers’ attitudes may differ across schools of varying racial contexts, after taking account of other personal and school characteristics that might affect teachers’ attitudes. Though this article cannot answer to questions about when these attitudes developed, whether teachers’ attitudes may shape their selection of school site, or how these attitudes relate to their professional behavior, it does provide information about how a more nuanced understanding of the school racial context in which a teacher works may predict his or her attitudes and awareness regarding students and race. Several findings merit further discussion.</p>
<p>When examining both racial stability and composition, for each of the three racial awareness/attitude variables, the coefficients differ for diverse schools depending on their racial stability. The differences in each outcome suggest that a simple, one point in time measurement of diversity may, in fact, encapsulate different types of school environments and the relationship between student composition and teachers’ attitudes. In comparison to teachers in stably segregated White schools, stably diverse environments predicted lower teacher acknowledgement of structural context for thinking about race, perhaps because these schools have been diverse and stable for so long. The racial stability of such schools may have allowed teachers to adapt their practices and be comfortable with the school’s diversity. In findings somewhat similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124510392780">Morris (2005)</xref>, teachers in diverse schools experiencing more substantial student shifts in comparison with overall demographic trends, by contrast, were more cognizant of the larger racial structure of their schools and its possible impact on the success of their students. On the other two outcomes, teaching in increasingly White diverse schools had a negative impact while the other types of diverse schools had positive outcomes. Notably, in racially transitioning schools, school racial context predicted teachers’ racial awareness demonstrating a “lagged effect” meaning that their estimates were closer to what the school <italic>used</italic> to be instead of what it currently is. On this outcome, teaching in rapidly decreasing White schools that were still “diverse” was similar to teaching in segregated non-White schools. Yet under the simple categorization scheme traditionally used, such schools would have been classified as very different kinds of schools. The addition of racial stability to the initial analysis simply using racial composition adds further understanding to differences among “diverse schools.”</p>
<p>Stability also intersects with racially homogeneous schools. In separately analyzing unstably and stably segregated non-White schools, both school types were positive predictors of race-conscious orientation for teachers, but only the latter—those schools that had remained segregated for at least a decade—were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The magnitude of the effect on race-conscious attitudes was also larger while conversely, the reverse pattern held for racial awareness, suggesting that teachers in unstably non-White segregated schools, overestimated a larger percentage of White students than their peers in more stable, segregated environments. Teaching in an unstably segregated White environment is a negative predictor in each of the three outcomes in comparison to teachers in stably segregated White schools, although none of these reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that considering the racial composition of the school in the context of the surrounding district may also significantly relate to teachers’ attitudes. Notably, in comparison to schools with similar racial composition to their district, for each outcome, the coefficients were either both positive or both negative regardless of whether it was a racially identifiable White or non-White school, indicating that at least among this sample the important factor may be deviation from the district, not which way in which school racial composition compares (e.g., either higher or lower White percentage than district). Furthermore, for race-conscious attitudes, the effect of teaching in a racially identifiable school varies by teacher race. But, at the same time, it suggests that the difference between school and district composition may have made race more discernible to White teachers. Teaching in racially identifiable White schools was a significant, positive predictor of racial awareness. In other words, teachers in school that had a higher White composition than the district may have been influenced by the “relative Whiteness” of their school to over-estimate the percentage of White students in comparison with teachers in schools whose racial composition differed little from the district racial composition.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, teacher’s race was mostly insignificant, only significant in models fit to predict racial awareness. This might be due, in part, to the small number of teachers of color in this sample that made it difficult to have a more nuanced examination of teacher race, for example, to compare White with Black teachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124510392780">Deborah Britzman (1991)</xref> suggested that simply having diverse experiences and/or biographies alone was not enough for teachers, but that experience needed to also gain meaning by contemplating the ways in which one’s own biography relates to the larger social structure and history:
<disp-quote>
<p>it behooves those learning to teach and those already teaching to rethink how social forces and dominant categories of meaning intervene in and organize their own lives and the lives of their students . . . We are all situated by race, class, and gender, and without an understanding of the social meanings that overdetermine how we invite and suppress differences, the complexity of biography is reduced either to the dreary essentialism that beneath the skin we are all the same, or to the insistence that difference can be overcome through sheer individual effort. (pp. 232-233)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Britzman noted that many of the teachers she studied grew up in segregated environments, like the teachers in these samples, but it is impossible to know to what extent teachers have contemplated these structures or develop a sociocultural awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124510392780">Banks et al., 2005</xref>). What is possible to control for is teachers’ interracial exposure, and importantly, while teacher’s personal racial background is not significant in two of the three outcome variables, variables representing teacher’s exposure, either as children themselves or on their faculty, <italic>were</italic> significant. Consistent with intergroup theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013124510392780">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2006</xref>), attending elementary schools with a higher percentage of White students was a positive predictor of colorblind attitudes among teachers, for example. This suggests that more examination is needed to understand how teacher’s own background and experiences might affect their racial attitudes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article expands upon what we know about how teachers’ attitudes about race might be related to the students they teach or see in their schools every day and has important implications for practice (e.g., school-level professional development). Simultaneously, it has highlighted the need for more research to understand the complexities of racial attitudes of teachers, as well as investigating how this relates to their behavior in the classroom and relationships they build with students and families across racial lines. It also suggests the importance of carefully considering the racial context in exploring teachers’ experiences and attitudes. Due to research indicating the importance of teacher attitudes as it relates to their behavior, this article illuminates important patterns to study further as the racial composition continues to become more diverse and school racial contexts become more complex in terms of composition, stability, and in relation to district composition.</p>

<p>In another sign of how much this topic is receding in the mind of the public, there are rarely questions asked about implementing desegregation or other race-conscious policies in most surveys unless there are specific reasons such as the 50th anniversary of the <italic>Brown</italic> decision to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124510392780">Frankenberg &amp; Jacobsen, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>A meta-analysis of studies examining whether intergroup contact relates to psychological benefits such as lower prejudice found that these benefits were stronger when intergroup contact was structured according to the conditions first postulated by Gordon Allport in 1954 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013124510392780">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2006</xref>). Importantly, one of these conditions—the one least often met in these studies—was support for intergroup contact by authorities (e.g., teachers, administration). The structures and practices within diverse schools might affect teachers’ perceptions of their relationship to educational benefits for students (see generally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124510392780">Frankenberg &amp; Orfield, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>A review of the MetLife Surveys found that the last survey to have an emphasis on minority or multicultural issues was in 1988, which had one of its foci on minority teacher satisfaction. They also surveyed students about muliculturalism in 1996. However, one of the most recent survey, focusing on teacher transitions and supportive relationships for teachers, included one question of 1st-year teachers asking what training would have helped them to be more effective and one of the possible responses (mentioned by 22% of teachers) was the need for “Better training in working with students and families from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.”</p>

<p>A search of the literature also revealed periodic surveys of teachers by Phi Delta Kappa and Gallup during the 1980s, which included some questions about race and integration, but this survey seems to have been discontinued.</p>

<p>The survey was designed by a group of educational experts. For more information, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124510392780">Frankenberg &amp; Orfield (2007)</xref>.</p>

<p>The lower percentage of people completing the survey could be due to the fact that counselors, administrators, and support staff may also be members of NEA but no longer classroom teachers. The NEA has more than 3 million members, which includes K-12 teachers, support staff, administrators, and higher education faculty.</p>

<p>Research suggests that context or order of questions can produce significant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013124510392780">Schuman &amp; Presser, 1981</xref>). Thus, it is important to note that at no point were these questions labeled as <italic>racial attitude questions</italic>.</p>

<p>It would be informative to explore how teachers of color may differ from one another in their attitudes, but they have been combined into one “non-White” category due to the low numbers of non-White teachers in this sample.</p>

<p>School poverty was also tested (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124510392780">Morris, 2005</xref>) but was not significant.</p>

<p>The racial/ethnic categories in this survey are different from how teachers were categorized by NCES’s Schools and Staffing Survey. There were also six teachers that identified as Native American, two as other, and eight refused to identify their race or ethnicity.</p>
