<title>The University of East London lead the way in the fight against MRSA</title>
<p>The University of East London (UEL) has made a breakthrough in the fight against a wide range of microbials, including MRSA and E.coli.</p>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1757913911430900-fig1.tif"/>
<p>The new range of substances is a series of molecules completely different from conventional antibiotics. Dr John George from the School of Health, Sport and Bioscience, has made a bank of laboratory-produced molecules; all of these were tested to be successful in test tubes.</p>
<p>These molecules have been shown to be far more effective than other similar molecules against bacteria, especially antibiotic-resistant strains and superbugs. The molecules also appear to have high safety levels, with very little toxicity (side-effects) even at very high dosage.</p>
<p>Speaking in response to his findings, Dr George said: “For many years now, health professionals have been desperately trying to find something that will tackle the threat of MRSA. While it is too early to say whether this is the future in terms of fighting superbugs, I do believe it is a significant finding that warrants further investigation.”</p>

<title>Alcohol free days recommended</title>
<p>The Royal College of Physicians has provided oral and written evidence to the Science and Technology Committee about alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>They recommend a change to the current guidelines of 28 units a week for men and 21 units a week for women. Instead they advise that men should be recommended to drink 0-21 units a week, and women 0-14, across more than 1 or 2 occasions, but with 2 to 3 days alcohol free a week, particularly after heavy drinking.</p>
<p>Sir Ian Gilmore, special advisor of alcohol, says: “at these levels, most individuals are unlikely to come to harm”. The current guidelines state that regularly drinking small amounts of alcohol is low risk which goes against evidence that regular drinking is a high risk factor for alcoholic liver disease. It is stated that the frequency of drinking and amount of drinking are both hazardous and ‘to ignore either of these components is scientifically unjustified’. Therefore having three alcohol-free days a week is emphasised.</p>

<title>Saving lives through changing behaviour</title>
<p>Fresh food, more exercise and no smoking. These are some of the choices we need to make in order to lead a healthy lifestyle, which is sustainable in the long term.</p>
<p>The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) has responded to the Government’s White Paper, by developing a suite of training programmes on behaviour change designed specifically to support health and wellbeing professionals to deliver these messages effectively as part of their behaviour change strategy.</p>
<p>Rises in obesity, diabetes, heart disease and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), alongside problems associated with unhealthy eating, drinking and smoking habits, have placed our health service under huge pressure. As many health conditions are both preventable and avoidable, we have a responsibility to ensure that we intervene and steer people towards healthier lifestyle choices. This not only positively impacts the wellbeing of the individual but also their communities.</p>
<p>Preventing avoidable conditions is better for both the patient and the health service, but the approach differs depending on the time available, the skill of the individual and the nature of the contact.</p>
<p>Professor Richard Parish, Chief Executive of RSPH said: “It is our belief that spreading skills and knowledge in this area will have a direct effect on driving behaviour change and reducing health inequalities, resulting in healthier communities across the country.”</p>

<title>Breast cancer screening to be reviewed</title>
<p>There has been much debate as to the effectiveness of breast cancer screening and now an independent review will assess the evidence in a bid to end the controversy.</p>
<p>Screening was introduced for breast cancer in 1988 in the UK and now offers tests to women, over the age of 50, every three years.</p>
<p>Professor Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director for England will lead the study jointly with Cancer Research UK, which will aim to determine whether breast screening causes more harm than good. Whilst the NHS says that 1,400 lives are saved through screening in England, other researchers suggest that screening can produce false positive results which cause unnecessary stress for women.</p>
<p>The director of health information at the charity, Sara Hiom, said: “Women need more accurate, evidence-based and clear information to be able to make an informed choice about breast screening. The decision whether to be screened is a personal one, but that decision should be made with all of the potential harms and benefits fully explained.”</p>

<title>Risk of short-sightedness reduced by time spent outdoors</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1757913911430900-fig2.tif"/>
<p>Recent analysis of eye health studies has found that the more time children spend outdoors the less likely they are to be short-sighted, also known as myopia. It has been suggested that exposure to natural light and looking at distant objects are key factors.</p>
<p>The data used came from eight different studies on myopia and time spent outdoors by children and adolescents and included 10, 400 participants. It was found that children who were short-sighted spent on average 3.7 fewer hours outside per week than those with normal vision.</p>
<p>Dr Khawaja, from the University of Cambridge, says: “Increasing children’s outdoor time could be a simple and cost-effective measure with important benefits for their vision and general health. If we want to make clear recommendations, however, we’ll need more precise data”.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear why spending time outdoors effects eyesight. There doesn’t appear to be a relationship between those children spending time outdoors also spending less time undertaking near work, for example playing computer games. Future studies will look into these factors and also consider whether increasing outdoor time will stop eyesight getting worse.</p>

<title>10 year use of the contraceptive pill nearly halves the risk of ovarian cancer</title>
<p>A recent study has shown that women who take the pill for over 10 years reduce their risk of ovarian cancer by 45%. Shorter term use also has an effect, with women who use the pill for a year having a 28 per 100,000 risk, compared to 15 per 100,000 per year risk for women who took the pill for over 10 years. The research also found that having children reduced the risk. For every child a women has the risk is reduced by a further 8%.</p>
<p>Naomi Allen, who works on the study, says: “Ovarian cancer is difficult to detect and so prevention is key to saving women suffering from this disease”.</p>
<p>The research does not establish how these factors effects the risk of ovarian cancer, but it is believed it may be because of changing levels of hormones. Additional findings included that a high age for menopause increased the risk, whereas age at first full-term pregnancy, incomplete pregnancies and breastfeeding were not associated with risk. The research is part of the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC) which is part funded by Cancer Research UK and is one of the largest studies into the links between cancer, diet and lifestyle.</p>
