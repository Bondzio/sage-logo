Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory idiopathic myopathy that is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and cutaneous eruptions. Patients eventually have problems with activities of daily living and may develop pulmonary disease, cardiac disease and other autoimmune disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300060513476435">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060513476435">3</xref></sup> Lung involvement in dermatomyositis may appear as inflammatory interstitial lung disease (ILD) and/or as a complication of muscle weakness, with consequences that may include aspiration pneumonia or ventilatory insufficiency. Studies report a prevalence of ILD ranging between 10% and &gt;50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060513476435">4</xref></sup> ILD is a negative prognostic factor associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300060513476435">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513476435">7</xref></sup> However, the clinical profile of ILD in polymyositis/dermatomyositis remains to be clarified. Unanswered questions about the prevalence or dermatomyositis–ILD in China, factors that may be related to its occurrence and development and its characteristic computed tomography (CT) imaging findings prompted us to conduct the present study. We hoped to establish whether CT scanning should be added to the routine examinations undertaken in future, in patients with dermatomyositis presenting to hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-0300060513476435" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="sec3-0300060513476435"><title>Study population</title><p>In a retrospective study based on information in patients’ medical records, we identified patients admitted to the Department of Dermatology at Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China, between January 2005 and March 2011, who had dermatomyositis based on the criteria of Bohan and Peter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300060513476435">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300060513476435">2</xref></sup></p><p>Screening for ILD had comprised of questioning about pulmonary complaints, lung auscultation, pulmonary function testing and lung radiological examinations. In the event of suggestive findings in the screening examinations, lung CT had been performed for verification. ILD was diagnosed when the CT findings showed bilateral reticular opacities, with or without honeycombing, or extensive ground-glass opacities. Patients with other substantial pulmonary diseases (such as severe emphysema), and those with a history of other lung diseases that could develop into fibrosing alveolitis were excluded, as were patients who had evidence of chronic congestive heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060513476435">4</xref></sup></p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Huashan Hospital, Fudan University. All investigations in this study were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Personal identifiers were removed from the data set before analyses were undertaken. Written consent was obtained from each participant included in the retrospective analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-0300060513476435"><title>Data retrieval</title><p>Clinical data retrieved from records made at the time of dermatomyositis diagnosis included each patient’s clinical history, physical examination results, laboratory findings, CT findings, pulmonary function test results and any moderate or severe electromyographic findings. Because only 25 patients had been willing to undergo muscle biopsy, no biopsy results were collected. However, all the results were consistent with the diagnostic criteria for dermatomyositis. Particular attention was paid to information that recorded signs and symptoms. Information on treatment was collected from medical records at the time when patients were discharged from hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-0300060513476435"><title>Laboratory tests</title><p>Serum samples were obtained from patients on admission, using standard techniques, and were immediately sent to the Clinical Immunology Department of Huashan Hospital for analyses of aspartate aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, creatine kinase, creatine kinase isoenzyme MB, antinuclear antibodies and antibodies against histidyl-transfer RNA synthetase (Jo1). The Euroline immunoassay system (catalogue numbers DL1590-1601 8G and DL1530-1601 3G; Euroimmun® US, Morris Plains, NJ, USA) was used for the parallel detection of different autoantibodies. All assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-0300060513476435"><title>Pulmonary investigations</title><p>Pulmonary function had been tested by measuring vital capacity (VC, a surrogate measure of pulmonary muscle strength), total lung capacity (TLC, measured to detect restrictive lung defects) and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO, measured by spirometry, using the single-breath method). Test results were expressed as percentages of predicted values for age and height.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513476435">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060513476435">9</xref></sup> Pulmonary muscle strength was considered to be reduced if VC or total lung capacity was ≤ 80% of the predicted value.

Each lung CT was performed using a Somatom® scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Slice thickness was 2 mm every 20 mm, including the entire lung. Typical CT findings in ILD include linear opacities (thickened inter- and intralobular septa), consolidation (areas with increased attenuation, and obscuration of bronchial walls and vessels) and ground-glass opacities (hyperattenuated areas in which the bronchi and vessels remained visible). Honeycombing (areas of small cystic spaces with thickened walls) and traction bronchiectasis (bronchial dilatation due to traction by fibrous tissue) were considered to be consistent with fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060513476435">10</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec8-0300060513476435"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Mean data are presented ±SD.

All tests were performed using Stata® software, version 9.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA), except for multifactorial logistic regression analysis, which was performed using SPSS® software, version 15.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicaco, IL, USA).

In most studies, ILD has been thought to be an antibiotic-resistant pneumonitis. Alveolitis appears in the early stages of collagen vascular diseases that are associated with ILD and may eventually develop into pulmonary fibrosis.</p><p>Although the outcome for patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis has substantially improved, at least one-third of patients are left with mild to severe disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513476435">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060513476435">15</xref></sup> Older age and association with severe internal diseases (such as diabetes mellitus, arrhythmia and severe pulmonary infection) are factors associated with poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513476435">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060513476435">15</xref></sup> Consequently, the survival of dermatomyositis patients with severe ILD is poor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060513476435">16</xref></sup></p><p>In this retrospective study of dermatomyositis patients, we found a high prevalence of ILD (49.6%), which is within the range of 10–50% reported by Fathi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513476435">17</xref></sup> Because ILD is a key factor relating to organ involvement and prognosis, and because of its high prevalence, it is important that dermatologists pay close attention to the early diagnosis and prompt treatment of ILD in dermatomyositis patients.</p><p>The presence of cough at disease onset was the most common pulmonary symptom in dermatomyositis patients with ILD (30 patients, 26.3%). Clinical manifestations such as myoasthenia, myalgia, difficulty in combing the hair/climbing stairs, arthralgia and dysphagia occurred significantly more frequently in dermatomyositis patients with ILD than in those without ILD. However, cutaneous manifestations were less closely related to the occurrence of ILD. Both heliotrope rash and Gottron’s papules are specific for dermatomyositis. In the present study, heliotrope rash was significantly more prevalent in the dermatomyositis patient group with ILD than in the group without ILD, while the reverse was observed for Gottron’s papules. As cutaneous manifestations might fluctuate with time, the presence of either Gottron’s papules or heliotrope rash determined at a single timepoint may not correlate with ILD. In the present study, most patients’ cutaneous manifestations were recorded at the onset of dermatomyositis. We consider that it is important to follow these dermatomyositis patients and evaluate cutaneous manifestations on future occasions, if a reliable conclusion is to be reached.</p><p>Several laboratory markers can be used to predict the development of ILD, such as the presence of antiaminoacyl tRNA synthetase antibodies; of these, the antihistidyl tRNA synthetase antibody anti-Jo1 is the strongest predictive factor for ILD in patients with myositis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060513476435">18</xref></sup> The reported frequency of ILD in patients with anti-Jo1 antibodies is &gt;70%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513476435">19</xref></sup> In our study, the frequency of ILD in patients with anti-Jo1 antibodies was much lower than this (seven patients, 6.1%), although all seven of these patients had ILD. Thus, the presence of anti-Jo1 antibody was highly associated with ILD, in dermatomyositis patients. We suggest that routine testing for anti-Jo1 antibodies is undertaken in dermatomyositis patients who present with cough, myoasthenia, myalgia and difficulty in combing hair/climbing stairs, arthralgia or dysphagia, especially in those without Gottron’s papules.</p><p>Clinical and laboratory abnormalities suggestive of muscle disease are characteristic features of dermatomyositis. The myopathies primarily affect the proximal muscles, are usually symmetrical and are slowly progressive over a period of weeks to months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513476435">20</xref></sup> In the present study, the myopathies in most of the dermatomyositis patients with ILD affected the proximal muscles. The prevalence of myopathies in patients with ILD was 55.3%) was greater than that in those without ILD (43.1%), though this difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>Interstitial lung disease is associated with restrictive lung-function impairment, which is defined as reduced TLC. Pulmonary function test results in our study showed that patients with ILD had significantly poorer function than those without ILD. However, in some myositis patients, low TLC can also be a consequence of respiratory muscle weakness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060513476435">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060513476435">11</xref></sup> Thus, we cannot exclude the influence of muscle weakness on leading to reduced lung volume in some patients. In most of our cases, restrictive lung function impairment was accompanied by reduced DLCO. Reduced DLCO did not occur in the absence of restrictive lung function impairment in the present study.</p><p>Lung CT is essential for the evaluation of ILD. Lines, ground-glass opacities and peribronchovascular thickening have been identified as the most common lung CT abnormalities observed at the initial imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060513476435">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060513476435">12</xref></sup> In the present study, the main lung CT abnormalities in dermatomyositis patients with ILD were septal lines (66.7%), patches (44.7%), ground-glass opacities (14.0%), reticulation (16.7%) and pleural thickening (18.4%): full data appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0300060513476435">Table 5</xref>.
