<abstract>
<p>This article examines the role of dual identity in political radicalism among migrants. Dual identity is defined as identification with both one’s ethnocultural minority in-group and one’s society of residence. We employed a longitudinal research design using members of the two largest migrant groups in Germany (Turkish migrants and Russian migrants) as participants. We reasoned that when dual identity is burdened with incompatibility between component identifications, it may foster controversial or even destructive forms of political mobilization, such as radicalism. Multiple regression analysis controlling for other influences confirmed the hypothesized moderated relationship between dual identification and sympathy for radical action. When accompanied by high, as opposed to low, perceived identity incompatibility, dual identification predicted increases in sympathy for radical action among both Turkish migrants and Russian migrants. The implications for public life in ethnically and culturally heterogeneous societies are discussed.</p>

<p>Research on the political mobilization of migrants (i.e., first-generation immigrants and their descendants) has demonstrated the pivotal role of collective-identification processes. There is converging evidence that for migrants, dual identity—identification with both the aggrieved ethnocultural (minority) in-group and the society of residence—possesses a unique mobilizing power that operates above and beyond the influence of a number of sociodemographic variables, other forms of collective identity, and past or habitual political engagement (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612450889">Simon, 2011</xref>). Migrants’ dual identity thus operates as a politicized collective identity combining feelings of suffering (derived from identification with the ethnocultural in-group) with feelings of entitlement (derived from identification with the society of residence). This mobilizing power of dual identity meshes well with the preference, observed among many migrant groups, for the acculturation strategy of integration that combines migrants’ maintenance of their minority culture with their active participation in their larger society of residence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612450889">Berry, Phinney, Sam, &amp; Vedder, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, research on the political mobilization of migrants suggests that dual identification with both the aggrieved minority in-group and the society of residence, as the superordinate polity, constrains politicization in one particular way: It prioritizes forms of political action that, in principle, all members of the polity can accept as legitimate, such as nonviolent protest. This finding is in line with both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612450889">Rawls’s (2001)</xref> notion of “overlapping consensus” (p. 32) and research on intergroup relations that has demonstrated a pacifying contribution of superordinate-group membership (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612450889">Brewer &amp; Gaertner, 2001</xref>). Thus, migrants’ willingness to embrace such dual identity can be viewed as a promising offer modern society should not refuse.</p>
<p>In this article, we go beyond prior studies and concern ourselves with a potentially problematic concomitant of dual identity that has so far received very limited attention in the political-mobilization literature. Although previous work attests to the phenomenological reality and psychological significance of migrants’ dual identity, there is also some indication, especially in the acculturation literature, of possible risks associated with dual identity in the case of insufficient identity integration or even identity conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612450889">Benet-Martínez &amp; Haritatos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612450889">Chryssochoou &amp; Lyons, 2011</xref>). Because identities and norms are closely intertwined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612450889">Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987</xref>), we reasoned that when burdened with incompatibility or conflict between component identifications, dual identity precipitates a sense of <italic>anomia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612450889">Merton, 1964</xref>) and paves the way to more controversial or even destructive forms of politicization, such as political radicalism. This mechanism was anticipated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612450889">Stonequist (1937/1961)</xref>, who suggested that for people with conflict- ridden dual identities, “the roles of the radical and the revolutionary are . . . natural ones to take” (p. 155).</p>
<p>To examine the hypothesis that under conditions of identity incompatibility, dual identity fosters political radicalism among migrants, we conducted a longitudinal panel study with members of the two largest migrant groups in Germany—Turkish and Russian migrants. More specifically, we recruited university students with either a Turkish or a Russian background because university or student life is typically a rich medium for political activism, including its more radical forms. In addition, investigation into students’ political mobilization is of high social relevance, because, as highly educated members of their ethnocultural in-group, university students with migrant backgrounds very likely represent the future intellectual or economic elite of their in-group, and thus have a good chance of assuming leadership roles in the wider political arena.</p>
<p>Because radical political action is typically rare, and systematic observation of it (even among students) would require an unrealistically long time period, we focused on predicting sympathy for radical political action. Such sympathy not only serves as a useful proxy for personal tendencies toward radicalism but also is an important phenomenon in its own right, because radical political action of the few usually flourishes within a wider social milieu of sympathizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612450889">Moskalenko &amp; McCauley, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure and respondents</title>
<p>To recruit our panel sample, we built on a database of students from various ethnocultural backgrounds that had been created as part of a larger research project directed by the first author. The database contained students’ responses to an electronic Web-based questionnaire between July 2009 and January 2010 (Time 1). Contact with potential respondents for that project was initiated through public notices, migrant organizations, e-mails sent out by various universities, and announcements made during lectures and seminars. The resulting database contained 845 individuals relevant to the present research: 462 Turkish migrants and 383 Russian migrants.</p>
<p>Between June and August 2010 (Time 2), we conducted a follow-up assessment of sympathy for radical action using the available e-mail addresses. Of the relevant Time 1 respondents, 341 also participated in the follow-up (180 Turkish migrants and 161 Russian migrants; response rate = 39%–42%). Time 1 and Time 2 questionnaires completed by the same person were matched using a personalized three-letter, two-digit code created by each respondent according to prespecified criteria (e.g., second letter of respondent’s first name).</p>
<p>The resulting panel sample consisted of the 341 respondents who participated in both the Time 1 and the Time 2 assessments. Their ages ranged from 18 to 46 years, with a mean of 24 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.75). Monthly net income ranged from under €50 (approximately $73 U.S.) to €2,000 (approximately $2,902 U.S.) or more, with a mean of €486 (approximately $705 U.S.; <italic>SD</italic> = 341). Sixty-six percent of the respondents were female, and 33% were male (missing data made up the remaining 1%); 50% had German citizenship (single or dual citizenship). Length of residence in Germany ranged from less than 1 year to the participant’s entire lifetime; the mean percentage of lifetime spent in Germany was 66% (<italic>SD</italic> = 36). German language proficiency was generally very good, with a mean of 3.76 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.56) on a 5-point rating scale ranging from 0, <italic>very bad</italic>, to 4, <italic>very good</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797612450889">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>We also identified some sociodemographic differences between the Turkish and Russian subsamples: Compared with the Russian group, the Turkish subsample contained fewer females and fewer respondents with German citizenship. The Turkish subsample also had lived in Germany for a larger percentage of their lifetime and had lower income than the Russian group. These differences are consistent with general sociological and historical differences between these two migrant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612450889">Simon &amp; Grabow, 2010</xref>). In light of these differences, we included the group variable both as a control and as a potential moderator variable in the statistical analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0956797612450889">
<title>Predictor, moderator, control, and criterion variables</title>
<p>From the pool of Time 1 measurements, dual identification served as our main predictor variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0956797612450889">2</xref></sup> It was assessed with four items (Cronbach’s α = .78): “I feel I belong to both the Turks/Russians and the Germans,” “Sometimes I feel more like a German and sometimes more like a Turk/Russian— it depends on the situation,” “I have many similarities with Germans as well as Turks/Russians,” and “I feel good in the Turkish/Russian as well as the German culture.” Perceived incompatibility between migrants’ ethnocultural identity and German identity, measured at Time 1 with one item (“I have the feeling that I would have to give up my Turkish/ Russian identity if I wanted to become German”), served as the hypothesized moderator variable.</p>
<p>In addition, Time 1 measurements furnished sociodemographic information (age, gender, monthly net income, citizenship, percentage of lifetime spent in Germany, German language proficiency, and group) that served mainly as control variables. Additional Time 1 controls were ethnocultural identification with Turks or Russians (four items; e.g., “I feel strong ties with other Turks/Russians”; Cronbach’s α = .82), identification with Germany (five items; e.g., “I feel strong ties with Germany”; Cronbach’s α = .86), separatist identification as Turkish or Russian (three items; e.g., “All in all I feel more Turkish/Russian than German”; Cronbach’s α = .94), religious identification (two items; e.g., “My faith is important to me”; <italic>r</italic> = .83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), group-based anger (two items; e.g., “I am angry about the treatment of the Turks/Russians in Germany”; <italic>r</italic> = .78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), collective efficacy (two items; e.g., “I believe that the Turks/Russians living here can exert influence on political decisions in Germany”; <italic>r</italic> = .30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and radical activity in the past (e.g., participation in an illegal or violent demonstration; dichotomized measure: 0 = <italic>no activity</italic>, 1 = <italic>at least one activity</italic>). These items were mostly taken or adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612450889">Simon and Ruhs (2008)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612450889">Simon and Grabow (2010)</xref>; some additional items were developed by us for the present study. The rating scales ranged from 0 (<italic>not true at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>absolutely true</italic>), except for one separatist-identification item, which was rated on an 11-point scale (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612450889">Simon &amp; Grabow, 2010</xref>). Scores for this item were later transformed and included in the overall measure of separatist identification, which ranged from 0 to 4.</p>
<p>Finally, a Time 1 control measurement was available for sympathy for radical action. The measure consisted of eight items (Cronbach’s α = .87). Respondents indicated the extent to which they would show understanding for people participating in each of six radical (illegal, violent) activities (i.e., participating in an illegal demonstration, participating in a violent demonstration, blocking a road, occupying houses or offices, writing a political slogan on a public wall, and damaging other people’s property). In addition, respondents indicated their agreement with the following statements: “I would participate even in a protest action that may involve a confrontation with the police” and “If the police and the courts can’t provide justice, you sometimes have to bring about justice yourself.” Rating scales for these eight items ranged from 0 (<italic>no understanding/not true at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>total understanding/absolutely true</italic>).</p>
<p>Our criterion variable was Time 2 sympathy for radical action, which was measured using the same eight-item scale as at Time 1 (Cronbach’s α = .85). Dual identification (Cronbach’s α = .86) and perceived identity incompatibility were also remeasured at Time 2.</p>

<p>We then performed a multiple regression analysis, with sympathy for radical action measured at Time 2 as the criterion variable. In the first step, Time 1 dual identification was entered as a predictor variable together with the following Time 1 control variables: age, income, gender (−1 = female, +1 = male), citizenship (−1 = no German citizenship, +1 = German citizenship or Turkish/Russian–German dual citizenship), percentage of lifetime spent in Germany, German language proficiency, group (−1 = Russian migrants, +1 = Turkish migrants), radical activity in the past, identification with the ethnocultural in-group, separatist identification, religious identification, identification with Germany, perceived identity incompatibility, group-based anger, collective efficacy, and sympathy for radical action. To test for moderation, we entered the Dual Identification × Perceived Identity Incompatibility and Dual Identification × Group interactions together with the Group × Perceived Identity Incompatibility interaction in a second step. As a final step, we entered the three-way Dual Identification × Perceived Identity Incompatibility × Group interaction. Dual-identification and perceived-identity-incompatibility scores were mean-centered.</p>
<p>Inspection of the variance inflation factors (VIFs) confirmed that multicollinearity was not a problem (VIFs &lt; 3.1). In the first step (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .51, adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .48), <italic>F</italic>(17, 301) = 18.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, only Time 1 sympathy for radical action emerged as a significant predictor of Time 2 sympathy for radical action (<italic>b</italic> = 0.63, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.05, β = 0.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0956797612450889">4</xref></sup> All other regression weights were nonsignificant (<italic>p</italic>s &gt; .10). More important, and as hypothesized, the Dual Identification × Perceived Identity Incompatibility interaction was significant in the second step (<italic>b</italic> = 0.06, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03, β = 0.11, <italic>df</italic> = 298, <italic>p</italic> = .012), whereas the Dual Identification × Group and Group × Perceived Identity Incompatibility interactions were nonsignificant (<italic>p</italic>s ≥ .559), as was the three-way interaction in the final step (<italic>p</italic> = .685). Simple-slopes analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612450889">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>) confirmed that the pattern of results was as expected: As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612450889">Figure 1</xref>, the effect of dual identification on sympathy for radical action was significant at 1 standard deviation above the mean of perceived identity incompatibility (<italic>b</italic> = 0.15, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.06, β = 0.17, <italic>p</italic> = .008), but not at 1 standard deviation below the mean (<italic>b</italic> = −0.04, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.05, β = −0.04, <italic>p</italic> = .504).</p>

<p>The same pattern emerged when we decomposed the interaction, applying a median split to perceived identity incompatibility (low: &lt; 2, high: ≥ 2; <italic>M</italic> = 1.46, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.46). The separate multiple regression analyses for the resulting subgroups included the same Step 1 control variables as the main analysis already reported, except for perceived identity incompatibility. As expected, dual identification predicted increases in sympathy for radical action among respondents with high perceived identity incompatibility (<italic>b</italic> = 0.25, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.07, β = 0.27, <italic>df</italic> = 115, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0956797612450889">5</xref></sup> but not among those with low perceived identity incompatibility (<italic>b</italic> = −0.07, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.06, β = −0.08, <italic>df</italic> = 170, <italic>p</italic> = .209). This pattern was also replicated for each of the two migrant groups separately. That is, dual identification predicted increases in sympathy for radical action among Turkish migrants with high perceived identity incompatibility (<italic>b</italic> = 0.29, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.09, β = 0.26, <italic>df =</italic> 56, <italic>p</italic> = .003) and among Russian migrants with high perceived identity incompatibility (<italic>b</italic> = 0.21, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.10, β = 0.30, <italic>df =</italic> 44, <italic>p</italic> = .039), but not among Turkish migrants with low perceived identity incompatibility (<italic>b</italic> = −0.05, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.08, β = −0.05, <italic>df =</italic> 79, <italic>p</italic> = .542) or Russian migrants with low perceived identity incompatibility (<italic>b</italic> = −0.09, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.09, β = −0.11, <italic>df =</italic> 76, <italic>p</italic> = .313).</p>
<p>Other forms of collective identification predicted changes in sympathy for radical action only when perceived identity incompatibility was high: Among Turkish migrants, sympathy for radical action decreased when religious identification became stronger (<italic>b</italic> = −0.15, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.06, β = −0.23, <italic>p</italic> = .017); among Russian migrants, it decreased when ethnocultural identification became stronger (<italic>b</italic> = −0.41, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.18, β = −0.53, <italic>p</italic> = .023), but increased when separatist identification became stronger (<italic>b</italic> = 0.36, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.15, β = 0.59, <italic>p</italic> = .022).</p>
<p>To further illuminate the causal direction of the relationship between dual identification and sympathy for radical action, given high perceived identity incompatibility, we regressed Time 2 dual identification, Time 2 perceived identity incompatibility, and their (multiplicative) product term on the same predictor variables as in our main multiple regression analysis. Time 1 sympathy for radical action had a negative effect on Time 2 dual identification (in all three steps, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .019) and a positive effect on Time 2 perceived identity incompatibility (in all three steps, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .046), but it failed to predict their product term (in all three steps, <italic>p</italic> ≥ .390). Sympathy for radical action also failed to predict changes in dual identification in multiple regression analyses of data from Turkish and Russian migrants with high perceived identity incompatibility, as determined by the median split (<italic>p</italic>s ≥ .123). Moreover, these nonsignificant cross-lagged paths from Time 1 sympathy for radical action to Time 2 dual identification were significantly weaker than the significant cross-lagged paths from Time 1 dual identification to Time 2 sympathy for radical action (<italic>p</italic>s ≤ .012, following the test procedure suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612450889">Kenny, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results strongly suggest that dual identification among migrants with high perceived identity incompatibility causes increased sympathy for radical action, not the other way around.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article provides novel, and possibly somewhat disconcerting, insights into the role of dual identity in the political mobilization of migrants. Whereas earlier work suggested that the mobilizing power of dual identity would be limited to forms of political action considered “legitimate” politics (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612450889">Simon, 2011</xref>), we have demonstrated that, in combination with (perceived) identity incompatibility, dual identity can also foster political radicalism among migrants. It thus appears that when dual identity is burdened with identity incompatibility, it becomes a liability eroding the overlapping consensus regarding acceptable political action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612450889">Rawls, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Several features of our research deserve to be highlighted because they support the inference that dual identity plays a causal role in political radicalism. First, we demonstrated the critical moderated relationship between dual identification and sympathy for radical action in a longitudinal design. Second, controlling for preexisting differences in sympathy for radical action, we observed that, given high perceived identity incompatibility, dual identification increased sympathy for radical action and not the other way around. This effect proved to be robust, holding up for Turkish and Russian migrants alike. Third, we controlled for a number of potentially confounding variables, including sociodemographic variables, past radical activity, and various other forms of collective identification. This is not to deny the role of other influences; for instance, there was some indication in our data that separatist identity can foster political radicalism, at least among Russian migrants with high perceived identity incompatibility. Note, however, that we found no evidence that religious identity fosters political radicalism; if anything, religious identity counteracted such radicalism, at least among the Turkish—and predominantly Muslim—migrants with high perceived identity incompatibility. Finally, it is also noteworthy that neither group-based anger nor collective efficacy, or a lack of collective efficacy, independently fostered political radicalism among our respondents (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612450889">Tausch et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we want to point out three directions for future research. First, the investigation into the role of dual identity in political radicalism should be extended to other populations in order to test whether or not the observed relationship holds true beyond our sample of rather young and educated respondents, who may be particularly vulnerable to identity conflicts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612450889">Stonequist, 1937/1961</xref>, p. 110). Second, future research should go beyond our focus on radicalization of means and also investigate radicalization of ends or goals, especially identity-related goals (for the means-end distinction concerning radicalization, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612450889">Simon, 2011</xref>). Such investigation would be an important complement to the present research, although we suspect that our decision to give priority to the radicalization of means will be vindicated. To quote from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612450889">Arendt’s (1970)</xref> seminal analysis of violence, “the means used to achieve political goals are more often than not of greater relevance to the future world than the intended goals” (p. 4).</p>
<p>Third, the concept of identity incompatibility deserves a critical multilevel analysis. Although identity incompatibility is certainly a psychological microlevel phenomenon, in that it affects the individual psyche or mind, it must not be isolated from its social context. The individual experience of identity incompatibility also reflects social (meso- as well as macrolevel) constructions or representations of collective identities and their compatibility or incompatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612450889">Chryssochoou &amp; Lyons, 2011</xref>). The responsibility for the transformation or perversion of dual identity from a promising social integration mechanism into a liability with socially destructive consequences therefore lies not only with migrants. The indigenous majority, and especially its dominant segments (who enjoy and exert cultural hegemony, which in turn burdens migrants with limiting normative expectations), must now decide on their response. They can either welcome migrants’ dual identity as a promising contribution to a pluralistic society, recognizing such people as <italic>different equals</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612450889">Fraser &amp; Honneth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612450889">Habermas, 1999</xref>), or reject the concept of dual identity and thus create a liability for society as a whole.</p>
