<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) contains various growth factors and appears to have a potential to promote tendon healing, but evidence is lacking regarding its effect on human tenocytes from rotator cuff tendons with degenerative tears.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis:</bold> Platelet-rich plasma stimulates cell proliferation and enhances matrix gene expression and synthesis in tenocytes isolated from human rotator cuff tendons with degenerative tears.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Controlled laboratory study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Tenocytes were enzymatically isolated and cultured. To evaluate cell proliferation, tenocytes were cultured with 10% (vol/vol) platelet-poor plasma (PPP), PRP activated with calcium, and PRP activated with calcium and thrombin at platelet concentrations of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, and 16,000 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL for 14 days. Cell number was measured at days 7 and 14. To investigate matrix gene expression and synthesis, cells were cultured with a PPP or PRP gel (10% vol/vol) at a platelet concentration of 1000 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL for 14 days. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the expressions of type I and III collagen, decorin, tenascin-C, and scleraxis, and measurements of total collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis were conducted at days 7 and 14.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Platelet-rich plasma significantly increased cell proliferation at days 7 and 14 in a dose-dependent manner, and the addition of thrombin moved up the plateau of proliferation. Platelet-rich plasma significantly induced the gene expression of type I collagen at day 7 but not at day 14, while it significantly promoted that of type III both at days 7 and 14. The ratio of type III/I collagens did not change at days 7 and 14. The expressions of decorin and scleraxis significantly increased at day 14, whereas that of tenascin-C significantly increased at days 7 and 14. Platelet-rich plasma significantly increased total collagen synthesis at days 7 and 14 and GAG synthesis at day 14.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Platelet-rich plasma promoted cell proliferation and enhanced gene expression and the synthesis of tendon matrix in tenocytes from human rotator cuff tendons with degenerative tears.</p>
<p><bold>Clinical Relevance:</bold> These findings suggest that PRP might be used as a useful biological tool for regenerative healing of rotator cuff tears by enhancing the proliferation and matrix synthesis of tenocytes from tendons with degenerative tears.</p>

<p>Clinical results after rotator cuff repair have been shown to be satisfactory regardless of the operative technique used, which includes open surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512437525">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0363546512437525">61</xref></sup> mini-open surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512437525">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0363546512437525">51</xref></sup>and arthroscopic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437525">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0363546512437525">64</xref></sup> Average satisfaction rates of 85% have been reported for open surgery and from 84% to 95% for arthroscopic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0363546512437525">62</xref></sup> However, 2 important problems, namely the quality and speed of healing, still remain to be solved despite recent advances in mechanical fixation methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437525">25</xref></sup> Furthermore, as the degenerative torn ends of rotator cuffs do not appear to contribute to healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437525">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0363546512437525">59</xref></sup> and as tendon healing is naturally slow,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546512437525">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546512437525">47</xref></sup> an additional biological strategy is required to improve the tissue quality of torn ends and to aid the regeneration of native tendon-to-bone insertions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437525">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a platelet concentrate that typically contains more than 1000 × 10<sup>3</sup> platelets/µL, representing a 3- to 5-fold increase as compared with whole blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437525">25</xref></sup> Because platelets contain various growth factors in their α-granules, PRP potentially can release these growth factors at higher than physiological levels. As growth factors known to be in α-granules, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), are also known to be upregulated or involved during tendon healing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512437525">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512437525">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512437525">38</xref></sup> it has been suggested that the addition of PRP would aid tendon healing. However, basic experimental and clinical evidence is lacking or still controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512437525">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437525">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546512437525">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>A few studies have investigated the effects of PRP on human tenocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437525">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512437525">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0363546512437525">68</xref></sup> Anitua et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437525">3</xref></sup> showed that 20% PRP (vol/vol) stimulated tenocyte proliferation and increased VEGF and HGF production by tenocytes, and de Mos et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512437525">12</xref></sup> demonstrated that 20% PRP (vol/vol) promoted tenocyte proliferation but decreased the gene expressions of type I and type III collagen. Recently, Zargar Baboldashti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0363546512437525">68</xref></sup> reported that PRP diminished the adverse effects of dexamethasone and ciprofloxacin. However, in these studies, tenocytes were isolated and cultured from the normal hamstring tendons of young patients undergoing hamstring tendon release or anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and as has been previously mentioned,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512437525">12</xref></sup> tenocytes from the degenerated torn ends of rotator cuff tendons in older patients might respond to PRP very differently from those of normal hamstring tendons in young patients. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been performed on the effects of PRP on tenocytes from human rotator cuff tendons with degenerative tears.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of PRP gel on the proliferation, matrix gene expression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG), and total collagen synthesis of tenocytes from human rotator cuff tendons with degenerative tears. Our hypothesis was that PRP gel would promote tenocyte proliferation and induce matrix gene expression and synthesis.</p>

<title>Isolation and Expansion of Tenocytes From Human Rotator Cuff Tendons</title>
<p>After informed consent was obtained, tendon tissues were obtained from patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for the treatment of degenerative rotator cuff tears (n = 9). Pieces of tissue 3 × 3 mm in size were obtained after debriding the severely frayed portion of the lateral edge of rotator cuff tendons with a basket forceps. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at our institution. All 9 patients had shoulder pain with an insidious onset and no history of trauma.</p>
<p>Tendon tissue was harvested after the debridement of severely frayed tissue from torn free ends using a basket forceps. After removal of the overlying bursal or synovial tissue, the tendon specimens were washed twice in calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and finely minced. Cells were released by treating with 0.3% collagenase II for 2 hours in low-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (LG DMEM) containing antibiotic solution (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin) with gentle agitation. After the same volume of DPBS was added, undigested tissue was removed using a 100-µm nylon sieve, and cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice, resuspended in LG DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotic solution (growth medium), and plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 2 to 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The medium was replaced twice weekly. When cells reached 60% to 80% confluence, they were detached by incubation for 10 minutes with 0.25% trypsin (Welgene, Daegu, Korea), washed, and then replated at a ratio of 1:3. Cells from the second passage to fifth passage were used in the study.</p>

<title>Preparation of PRP Gel</title>
<p>Platelet-rich plasma (n = 9) was obtained from patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for the treatment of degenerative rotator cuff tears using a plateletpheresis system with a leukoreduction set (COBE Spectra LRS Turbo, Caridian BCT, Lakewood, Colorado) according to a previously described standard collection program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437525">25</xref></sup> The target concentration of platelets in the final product was 1400 × 10<sup>3</sup> platelets/µL. The system was set and primed with saline solution and anticoagulant acid citrate dextrose as the anticoagulant according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Aliquots were taken to determine complete blood counts. For the application experiments, platelet counts in PRP were first adjusted with platelet-poor plasma (PPP) to 1000 × 10<sup>3</sup>platelets/µL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437525">25</xref></sup> and then further diluted or concentrated if necessary. To produce a gel from prepared PPP or PRP, 10% calcium gluconate with or without 166.7 IU/mL thrombin (thrombin-lyophilized power of 5000 IU) (Reyon Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea) was added to PPP or PRP at 1:10 (vol/vol). The dilution and gelling procedure was performed immediately before experiments. Throughout the experiments, cells were treated with PPP, PRP activated with calcium (PRP-Ca), and PRP activated with calcium and thrombin (PRP-Ca-Thr). Cells treated with only 2% FBS were used as controls.</p>

<title>Assay for Tenocyte Proliferation</title>
<p>Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in the bottom of 24-well plates with cell culture inserts (SPL Lifesciences, Pocheon, Korea) and were allowed to attach for 24 hours in LG DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and antibiotic solution. Platelet-rich plasma gels (10% vol/vol) at platelet concentrations of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, or 16,000 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/µL activated with 10% calcium gluconate with or without 166.7 IU/mL bovine thrombin were then placed on the cell culture insert of each well. Media were replaced every 3 days. Cell proliferation was determined using the WST colorimetric assay (EZ-CyTox, Daeil Lab Service, Seoul, Korea) at days 7 and 14. All experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>

<title>Assay for Matrix Gene Expression</title>
<p>Cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in the bottoms of 6-well plates with cell culture inserts (SPL Lifesciences) and allowed to attach for 24 hours. Platelet-poor plasma or PRP gels (10% vol/vol) at a platelet concentration of 1000 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/µL activated with 10% calcium gluconate with or without 166.7 IU/mL bovine thrombin were placed on the cell culture insert of each well. Media were replaced at 2, 7, and 9 days. Matrix gene expression was evaluated using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at days 7 and 14.</p>
<p>Total RNA was extracted, and reverse transcription and amplification were performed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437525">26</xref></sup> Briefly, total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and quantified using a NanoDrop ND-100 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, Delaware). First-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the Superscript III Reverse Transcription kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). Briefly, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from cellular mRNAs (1 µg) by heating a mixture (1 µg mRNA, 1 µL Oligo(dT)20 [50 uM], 1 µL dNTP [10 mM], and up to 10 µL DW) to 65°C for 5 minutes, cooling on ice for 1 minute, and then adding a mixture containing 2 µL 10× RT buffer, 4 µL MgCl<sub>2</sub> (25 mM), 2 µL DTT (0.1 M), 1 µL RNaseOut (40 U/mL), and 1 µL Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (200 U/mL) (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was held at 50°C for 50 minutes to promote cDNA synthesis, and the reaction was terminated by heating to 85°C for 5 minutes and then snap cooling at 0°C for 1 minute. Finally, RNase H (1 µL, 2 U/mL) was added and incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes to remove RNA strands from RNA-cDNA hybrids. Synthesized cDNA was either stored at −20°C or used immediately for real-time RT-PCR.</p>
<p>To perform real-time RT-PCR utilizing a LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) were used as a probe/primer set specified for type I collagen (assay ID: Hs00164004_m1), type III collagen (assay ID: Hs00943809_m1), scleraxis (assay ID: Hs03054634_g1), decorin (assay ID: Hs00266491_m1), tenascin-C (assay ID: 1115665_m1), and GAPDH (assay ID: Hs99999905_m1). The PCRs were performed in a final volume of 20 µL containing 10 µL 2× LightCyclerH 480 Probes Master (FastStart Taq DNA polymerase, reaction buffer, dNTP mix [with dUTP instead of dTTP], and 6.4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) (Roche Applied Science), 1 µL TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems), 5 µL cDNA as the template, and 4 µL H<sub>2</sub>O using the following program: 95°C for 10 minutes, 40 cycles at 95°C for 10 seconds, and 60°C for 1 minute, followed by 72°C for 4 seconds, and a final cooling at 40°C for 30 seconds. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and averaged values were calculated for normalized expression levels. During PCR amplification, amplified product amounts were monitored by continuous measurement of fluorescence. Gene expressions were normalized versus GAPDH as follows: the cycle number at which the transcript of each gene was detectable (threshold cycle, Ct) was normalized against the Ct of GAPDH, which is referred to as ΔCt. Gene expressions relative to GAPDH are expressed as 2<sup>–ΔCt</sup>, where ΔCt = C<sub>T gene of interest</sub> – C<sub>T GAPDH</sub>.</p>

<title>Assay for Total Collagen and GAG Synthesis</title>
<p>To assay total collagen and GAG synthesis, cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in the bottom of 6-well plates with cell culture inserts (SPL Lifesciences) and allowed to attach for 24 hours. A PRP gel (10% vol/vol) with a platelet concentration of 1000 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/µL activated with 10% calcium gluconate with or without 166.7 IU/mL bovine thrombin was added to cell culture inserts in wells. All assays were performed in culture supernatants and in triplicate at days 7 and 14.</p>
<p>Total soluble collagen was measured in culture supernatants using the Sircol assay (Biocolor, Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 900 µL of Sirius Red reagent was added to 100 µL of supernatant and mixed for 30 minutes at room temperature. The collagen-dye complex was precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes and washed with 750 µL of ice-cold Acid-Salt Wash Reagent provided with the kit (Biocolor). Wash reagent was used to remove unbound dye from the surface of pellets and the inside surface of microcentrifuge tubes. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes, supernatants were discarded, and pellets were dissolved in the acidic solution provided. Absorbance was measured at 555 nm. The calibration curve was set up on the basis of a collagen standard provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Glycosaminoglycan amount was measured using the Blyscan 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay kit (Biocolor) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, Blyscan dye reagent (500 µL) was added to supernatants (500 µL) and the kit standard and mixed for 30 minutes at room temperature. Insoluble pellets of sulfated GAG were precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Bound dye was released with the dissociation reagent (500 µL), and the absorbance was measured at 656 nm. The calibration curve was set up on the basis of a collagen standard provided by the manufacturer.</p>

<title>Effect of PRP on the Proliferation of Tenocytes From Tendons With Degenerative Tears</title>
<p>Platelet-rich plasma activated with calcium and PRP-Ca-Thr significantly stimulated the proliferation of tenocytes in a dose-dependent manner in comparison with the control, whereas PPP did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512437525">Figure 1</xref>). No definite morphological change was observed during culture. The addition of thrombin for activation showed a tendency of advancing the platelet concentration for a cell proliferation plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512437525">Figure 2</xref>). At day 7, PRP-Ca with a platelet concentration of 4000 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL showed the greatest proliferation by 4.98-fold compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512437525">Figure 2A</xref>). However, cell proliferation plateaued statistically at concentrations over 2000 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL. For PRP-Ca-Thr, the greatest proliferation was observed at a concentration of 8000 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL, an increase of 4.44-fold compared with the control. A proliferation plateau was reached at a concentration of 400 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL. The activation of PRP with calcium and thrombin further promoted proliferation at the lower concentrations of 100, 200, and 400 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL. At day 14, the highest proliferation was observed at a concentration of 8000 cells × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL for PRP-Ca and at 16,000 cells × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL for PRP-Ca-Thr, which represented increases of 5.70- and 5.41-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512437525">Figure 2B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study demonstrate that PRP-activated calcium with or without thrombin significantly stimulated the proliferation of tenocytes from human rotator cuff tendons with degenerative tears in a dose-dependent manner. Platelet-rich plasma–activated calcium with or without thrombin also significantly upregulated the gene expressions of type I and III collagen but did not significantly influence the ratio of type III/I collagen expression level. Platelet-rich plasma significantly induced the gene expressions of decorin, a representative proteoglycan of tendon, and of tenascin-C, a representative glycoprotein of tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512437525">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546512437525">42</xref></sup> In addition, PRP significantly upregulated the gene expression of scleraxis, a tendon-specific marker.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0363546512437525">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0363546512437525">54</xref></sup> Furthermore, the syntheses of total collagen and GAG were also significantly enhanced with PRP. However, gene expression levels and the amount of matrix molecules synthesized varied considerably by culture time and activation method. Meanwhile, PPP neither stimulated the proliferation of tenocytes nor induced the expression or synthesis of tendon matrix except for decorin at day 14 and total collagen, suggesting the importance of bioactive materials released from granules in the platelet. The addition of thrombin for platelet activation significantly accelerated cell proliferation especially at lower concentrations compared with the addition of calcium only and demonstrated a tendency of lowering the platelet concentration for reaching the proliferation plateau. Meanwhile, it did not significantly affect matrix gene expression and synthesis except for tenascin-C. Considering that final cell proliferation level is more influenced by the proliferation rate in the earlier culture period than in the later period, and that matrix gene expression and synthesis were not significantly affected except for tenascin-C, these results would be because of the initial burst release of growth factors with the addition of thrombin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512437525">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512437525">35</xref></sup> Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that PRP has positive effects on the proliferation, matrix gene expression, and synthesis of tenocytes from degenerated torn tendons and that the degrees of these effects are dependent on the kind of matrix molecules, culture period, and the concentration and activation status of PRP. These results suggest that PRP might be applied usefully in the treatment of degenerative tendinopathy, whereas its application strategy, such as the concentration, activation method, timing, and application numbers of PRP should be further investigated.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the effects of PRP on tenocytes from human rotator cuff tendons with degenerative tears.

We consider that the effects of PRP on any specific disease or injury should be investigated using tissue or cells from appropriate diseased or injured sites, and thus, we suggest that the results of this study provide useful information about potential effects of PRP on the repair of torn rotator cuffs.</p>
<p>Previous studies on the effects of PRP on tenocytes suffer from a lack of standardization or from inadequate characterization of PRP preparations, which result in interstudy differences in platelet concentrations, activations, and WBC contamination levels. Furthermore, these factors could affect the concentrations and the release kinetics of growth factors, which make it difficult to compare study results and could explain contradictory results. Accordingly, in the present study, we used a plateletpheresis system to prepare PRP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437525">25</xref></sup> which, we believe, provides the most consistent and reproducible PRP with minimal WBC contamination. Furthermore, we agree with Zimmermann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0363546512437525">69</xref></sup> that this type of preparation provides the only practical means of elucidating the platelet-dependent and leucocyte-independent mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of PRP.</p>
<p>The results of this study show that PRP stimulated tenocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, PRP was found to have no inhibitory effect on cell proliferation at levels of more than 50-fold over the physiological level. A number of studies have addressed the effect of PRP concentration on the proliferation of osteoblasts, periodontal cells, or mesenchymal stem cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512437525">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512437525">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512437525">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512437525">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512437525">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0363546512437525">53</xref></sup> Some authors have reported that PRP at higher concentrations did not further promote or even suppressed proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512437525">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512437525">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512437525">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512437525">28</xref></sup> On the other hand, only a few studies have investigated the effect of different concentrations of PRP on the proliferation of tendon fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512437525">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512437525">12</xref></sup> We agree with Anitua et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512437525">5</xref></sup> that the biological effects of PRGF may depend on platelet concentration and on the anatomic origins of cells. In the current study, we tested a variety of platelet concentrations from 100 to 16,000 cells × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL and examined 2 different activation methods, that is, calcium and calcium plus thrombin. Considering that physiological platelet concentrations range from 150 to 300 cells × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512437525">13</xref></sup> the concentrations used in the study correspond to approximately 0.5- to more than 50-fold over the physiological levels, which would seem to be sufficient for simulating clinical situations. In addition, considering that the in vivo half-life of platelets is about 7 days,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512437525">13</xref></sup> some authors who reported negative effects for PRP on cell proliferation may have investigated too short a period, 3 to 7 days, to examine the effects of PRP on cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512437525">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512437525">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512437525">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512437525">28</xref></sup> Our results support this suggestion, as cell proliferation plateaued at a lower concentration, 400 cells × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL at day 7, whereas at day 14, cell proliferation was highest at a concentration of 2000 cells × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL.</p>
<p>Several studies have examined matrix molecular changes in rotator cuff tendons with chronic tendinopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512437525">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512437525">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546512437525">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512437525">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0363546512437525">65</xref></sup> In one study of ruptured supraspinatus tendons, a significant reduction in total collagen content and an increase in the expression of type I and II collagen with an increase in type III/I ratio were found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512437525">45</xref></sup> However, relatively little is known about changes in proteoglycans and glycoprotein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512437525">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546512437525">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546512437525">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0363546512437525">55</xref></sup> In the case of proteoglycan, a generalized increase in the amounts of hyaluronan and sulfated GAG has been reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546512437525">44</xref></sup> but little is known of other proteoglycans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512437525">41</xref></sup> Lo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512437525">31</xref></sup> reported a significant increase in aggrecan and a significant decrease of decorin in ruptured rotator cuff tendons. Glycoproteins such as tenascin-C and fibronectin are known to be increased in ruptured tendons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546512437525">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0363546512437525">55</xref></sup> On the other hand, the results of the present study show that PRP has some reversing or recovering effects, at least in part, to the above changes in chronic tendinopathy and tendon rupture on tenocytes from human rotator cuff tendons with degenerative tears; that is, in the present study, PRP significantly increased the gene expression of type I collagen but maintained the type III/I ratio, stimulated total collagen synthesis, and enhanced the gene expression of decorin. These results, along with the observed increased cell proliferation and the increased expression of scleraxis, a tendon-specific marker,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0363546512437525">50</xref></sup> suggest that PRP could reverse matrix molecular changes caused by tendon degeneration.</p>
<p>Type III collagen is present in normal tendons (less than 10% of total collagen) and is weaker than type I collagen. It is characterized by a small fibril in a woven pattern that is deficient in cross-linking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0363546512437525">58</xref></sup> Type III collagen is synthesized as a repair response to tissue injury, especially in adhesive or scar tissue, in a larger amount up to 20% to 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512437525">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512437525">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0363546512437525">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0363546512437525">66</xref></sup> This increase of type III collagen, especially relative to type I collagen, could inhibit the growth of collagen fibrils, lead to adhesion and contracture formation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512437525">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437525">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0363546512437525">65</xref></sup> and may result in the tendon being less resistant to stress and thus at increased risk of rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512437525">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512437525">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512437525">45</xref></sup> Some authors have reported that larger amounts of type III collagen production in the supraspinatus tendon are closely associated with shoulder contracture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0363546512437525">57</xref></sup> and that the maintenance of type III collagen expression level is important for avoiding excessive scar formation in injured rotator cuff tendons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0363546512437525">52</xref></sup> which suggests that type III collagen production in injured rotator cuff tendons is associated with scar and adhesion formation rather than healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0363546512437525">65</xref></sup> In this respect, the results of the present study regarding increased type I collagen expression without an increase in type III/I ratio suggest that PRP has a positive influence on regeneration rather than on healing via scarring on tenocytes from rotator cuff tendons with degenerative tears.</p>
<p>One limitation of the present study is that no control tenocytes from normal healthy tendons were included. Practically, it is difficult to obtain normal tendons from age-matched patients without a rotator cuff tear. However, other studies have used cells from normal tendons, and thus, some comparison is possible. Considering batch-to-batch variation, especially in the gene expression of type I collagen, further studies considering the control and chronicity of tears, such as size, would be necessary. In addition, not all cells isolated from torn degenerative rotator cuff tendons would be tenocytes. There may be other cells such as endothelial cells, inflammatory cells, and so on. However, we harvested small pieces of tendon after removing overlaying synovium and then finely minced them. During the procedure, any suspicious tissue other than tendon was removed. So the majority of cells used in the study would be tenocytes. Another limitation is that we did not normalize the measurements of total collagen and GAG synthesis with DNA or total protein. Nonetheless, it does not seem to significantly affect the results, as we performed the assays in subconfluent densities, which did not allow cells to proliferate significantly further because of contact inhibition. Another limitation is that we used allogenic PRP, whereas autologous PRP is usually used in clinical practice. This was because of the time for obtaining an adequate number of tenocytes, which usually takes several weeks. Nevertheless, we consider that allogenic and autologous PRP are likely to be similar in an in vitro setting, as it is unlikely that an immune reaction affected our experimental result considering that platelet concentrates can be intravenously infused without ABO blood matching. Another possible limitation is that we used PRP gels without further replacement, as we simulated a single PRP application. However, no consensus has been reached regarding the method of PRP use for the treatment of rotator cuff disease. We believe that multiple replacement of PRP with growth medium might exaggerate the effects of PRP and would not be a good starting point. Based on this study, additional studies are required simulating different clinical situations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that PRP promotes the proliferation of tenocytes from human rotator cuff tendons with degenerative tears and that it enhances the gene expression and the synthesis of tendon matrix. The results of this study indicate that PRP might offer a useful biological strategy for promoting the regeneration of rotator cuff tears.</p>
