<abstract>
<p>This article explores intertextual representations of Billie Jean King, focusing on the announcement of her relationship with Marilyn Barnett in 1981 as a disruptive moment that occasioned remedial narrative work on King’s part. Media framing of the incident is examined through three mainstream newspapers, U.S. magazines, television interviews, and King’s autobiography. Analysis of the coverage reveals that at first glance King was quite successful in overcoming the potential rupture to her life story by controlling the narrative, for example, through the staging of a very public apology, relatively supportive public interviews, and the timely release of her second autobiography. Framing the analysis within the context of theories of intertextuality and narrative disruption, and heteronarrativity, we argue that King’s success came at the expense of a more radical statement regarding the fluidity of sexual desire.</p>

<body>
<p>On August 28, 2006, in a nationally televised celebration, the United States Tennis Association officially rededicated the tennis center in Flushing Meadows, New York as the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, making this the largest sports facility in the world to be named after a woman. The dedication was particularly noteworthy since the USTA gave up an estimated US$5 million per year in corporate naming rights to honor King in this way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0193723512442203">Sandomir, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0193723512442203">1</xref></sup> Amidst official congratulations from other tennis greats Chris Evert, Venus Williams, Jimmy Connors, and John McEnroe, Billie Jean King took center stage in a public celebration orchestrated to mark the culmination of the remarkable career of an extraordinary athlete and social activist who had won 39 Grand Slam tennis tournaments, helped establish the women’s tennis circuit, Women’s Sport Foundation, WomenSport Magazine, and World Team Tennis and, most famously, defeated Bobby Riggs in straight sets in the 1973 Battle of the Sexes.</p>
<p>King is such a central figure in the struggle for sporting equity that studying her life provides clear insight into the important narratives circulating in the history of women’s sport and gender relations in the United States in the late 20th century. To access the cultural meanings she sustains, we conceptualize King as a text, a repository for multiple narratives, including those she coproduces, and we read those narratives critically. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193723512442203">McDonald and Birrell (1999)</xref> have argued, this analytical strategy is grounded in a recognition that
<disp-quote>
<p>What were once regarded as individuals, celebrities, or even heroes become repositories for political narratives, and our task as cultural critics is not to search for the facts of their lives but to search for the ways in which those ‘facts’ are constructed, framed, foregrounded, obscured, and forgotten. (p. 292)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All biographies—the written and the lived—are narratives, and all can be seen as intertextual projects. Therefore, in this article we use strategies of intertextual analysis to uncover the meanings that circulate around Billie Jean King and that work in her name to produce particular understandings of gender, sexuality, and sport. A theoretical and methodological strategy for critical narrative analysis derived from poststructuralist literary theories, “intertextuality asserts that all texts are interconnected and any given text derives its meanings from the meanings that adhere to it from readers’ previous encounters with other texts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723512442203">Birrell, 2007</xref>, p. 11).</p>
<p>The particular accomplishments and events of King’s life can be understood as the texts that together form the narrative recognized as her public biography. Over the course of a tennis career that spanned 21 years, King established herself as the best player in the world. Representations of King laud her for these accomplishments but she is best known as the face of “women’s lob,” the creative force behind the founding of the women’s professional tennis tour and the subsequent boycott and fight for equal prize money for women professionals. The most famous episode in this dominant construction of King is her triumph over Bobby Riggs in the tennis Battle of the Sexes where the feminist soundly defeated the self-proclaimed male chauvinist in straight sets.</p>
<p>King was not without her detractors, however. For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193723512442203">Baltzell (1995)</xref> characterizes the King–Riggs match as “the most vulgar and most popular media event in the history of tennis,” while describing King as “tennis’ leading Female Chauvinist” (p. 10). Despite the presence of similar critiques, King’s biography generally follows the familiar path of traditional liberal narratives that center on individual effort as the path to success and hard won triumph over barriers and inequities. The liberal trajectory of her struggle to make a place for herself as a tennis champion and then her fight to extend equal rights for women within the tennis and sport worlds articulates King within dominant cultural discourses that suggest that social change is made through individual will and effort.</p>
<p>So long as the textual moments of a biography present a relatively unambiguous storyline—for King, the story of liberal accomplishment—they satisfy the western cultural preference for order and clarity, and they can be said to work together intertextually to form a coherent narrative. Biographies, then, are narratives of identity or historically produced subjectivities constituted through performance and consolidated through repetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723512442203">Butler, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>But lurking below the surface of all dominant narratives are potentially disparate events and fractured, fragmented, ambiguous and competing textual interpretations. Intertextual analysis is a deconstructive project that can be used to search for and interrogate those disruptive moments that provoke narrative crises and destabilize the fabric of coherent narrative production. In the case of Billie Jean King, that moment of narrative disruption occurred in April 1981, with the revelation of her lesbian relationship with Marilyn Barnett.</p>
<p>Thus, by focusing on textuality, we ask why particular narratives are constructed as they are, why others are forgotten, whose interests are served by these particular constructions, and what sort of cultural work the narrative accomplishes. By focusing on intertextuality, we explore the relationships among the seemingly discrete textual moments that constitute a whole narrative—the recognizably eventful moments of a particular life, for example. And by focusing on narrative disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193723512442203">Birrell, 2008</xref>), those anomalous moments that explicitly challenge the coherence of the intertextual narrative project, we reveal the ways that narrative remedies mobilized to integrate wayward moments into an apparently seamless biographical script work as normalizing processes to subvert, erase, or dismiss alternative, potentially radical meanings.</p>
<p>The revelation and subsequent resolution of Billie Jean King’s lesbian relationship can also be understood as a heteronormative narrative, or a “heteronarrative” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0193723512442203">Roof (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193723512442203">Kaufmann (2006)</xref> might characterize it. They argue that most narratives begin in the dominant heteronormative—in the case of Billie Jean King, with her life of accomplishment, shared publicly with her husband Larry—and are challenged by a precipitating event—the entrance of Marilyn Barnett into that narrative. This disruptive action drives the narrative in new and pleasurable directions as the reader is culturally conditioned to yearn for the reestablishment of stability and familiarity. Although the possibility of “homologic escape” does exist, generally the narrative ends in “heterological suture” or recapitulation as the aberrant incident is folded back into the dominant heteronarrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193723512442203">Kaufmann, 2006</xref>, p. 1152)—in this case one which presumes Whiteness, and as we argue below, one that reaffirms the value of the family, monogamy, and heterosexuality. These points in ongoing narratives where dominant meanings are interrupted and the process of iteration and citation is revealed tells us a great deal about the cultural discourses they articulate—and even more about those they silence.</p>
<sec id="section1-0193723512442203">
<title>Excavating Heteronarratives in Sport</title>
<p>Exactly how such textual challenges play themselves out before the public is the result of a variety of complex and often contradictory forces. Dominant public understandings might interpret the incident as the result of a temporary lapse in judgment, or it might be seen to reveal deep-seated character flaws only now rising to the surface: The most “infamous” examples here include cases of criminal behavior such as the O. J. Simpson murder trial, revelations of Tiger Woods’ extramarital sexual appetites, or allegations of drug use or cheating such as the Roger Clemens and Pete Rose scandals, in which questions about the integrity of an athlete threaten to undo his or her record of accomplishments. In some cases, the aberrant moment might even provide an opportunity for enhanced reputation if one’s character is seen to be redeemed by rising to a seemingly insurmountable challenge. This seemed to have been the case in regard to Muhammad Ali who regained his heavyweight boxing title 3 years after he was stripped of his title for refusing military serve in Vietnam. In all cases, intertextuality is at play as we read back from the present to reconstruct our understandings of the past. Frequently at the heart of the process is a subject, working to exert authorial control over the meanings that will be left for posterity, and in Billie Jean King’s case, this remedial face-work turned out to be central to shaping public opinion.</p>
<p>Read another way, however, these narrative interruptions create potentially radical spaces that challenge hegemonic positions. Numerous examples can be cited of events that interrupt and eventually replace the traditional narrative of freedom, transcendence, and progress typically attached to sport and elite athlete’s lives. For example, the Tonya Harding–Nancy Kerrigan affair revealed the seemingly pristine world of ladies figure skating as not so pristine after all, as the physical assault on Kerrigan by Harding’s associates demonstrated, and former NBA star Dennis Rodman’s donning of a wedding dress and his Technicolor hairstyles disrupted, however fleetingly, heteronormative sporting masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193723512442203">Lafrance &amp; Rail, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analysis of the Billie Jean King/Marilyn Barnett incident draws on publicly available narratives as primary sources. We began with all the news accounts appearing in three major sources—the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>, the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic>, and the <italic>Washington Post</italic>—published between the time the Marilyn Barnett story first broke (April 30, 1981) until the lawsuits were resolved (December 12, 1981).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0193723512442203">2</xref></sup> Follow-up stories in these newspapers were also included as were articles, opinion columns, and letters to the editor in mainstream magazines such as <italic>Time, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, Ms., Women’s Sports, Vogue</italic>, and <italic>World Tennis</italic>. Although there are many biographies and two autobiographies of Billie Jean King available, we focused on King’s second autobiography written with Frank Deford in 1982 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>), whose primary purpose was to get King’s side of the story to the public as quickly as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0193723512442203">Zaharoudias, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Secondary sources such as Selena Roberts <italic>A Necessary Spectacle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193723512442203">Roberts, 2005</xref>), and retrospective accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193723512442203">Buchanan, 2006</xref>) provided some distance on the impact of the incident. Finally we consulted three authorized biographical pieces produced for television: HBO’s <italic>Billie Jean King: Portrait of a Pioneer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723512442203">Grossi, 2006</xref>), a “60 Minutes” interview with Billie Jean and Larry King first aired on CBS in 1972 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0193723512442203">Safer, 1972</xref>), and a “20/20” Barbara Walters interview with Billie Jean and Larry King that aired on ABC on May 7, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193723512442203">1981</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193723512442203">Walters, 1981</xref>).</p>

<title>Marilyn Barnett and the Politics of Interruption</title>
<p>According to dominant narratives, Billie Jean King first learned that her former lover Marilyn Barnett planned to make their relationship public in April 1981. Although King considered the affair to have been over for several years, media accounts suggest that Barnett apparently had difficulty with that decision. Matters came to a head when King told Barnett that she and her husband Larry planned to sell the Malibu beach house Barnett had been living in since 1974. Barnett threatened to sell to the press a packet of about 100 letters that King had sent her over the years. The Kings tried to forestall this action by offering Barnett half of the proceeds from the sale of the beach house. Instead, Barnett hired a lawyer and sued the Kings for property rights to the house, claiming Billie Jean King had given her the house and promised to support her. Barnett’s case was dismissed in the Supreme Court of Los Angeles on December 11, 1981; Judge Julius Title ruled that Barnett could produce no proof of her claim to the house and that her threat to sell King’s letters amounted to “attempted extortion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>, p. 214). He enjoined her from the release of the letters. Barnett subsequently dropped plans to sue for support, the so-called “galimony” aspect of the case.</p>
<p>The announcement that Billie Jean King had had a lesbian relationship activated homophobic discourses that reverberated throughout the sport world. According to these homophobic narratives, much was at stake in the way this revelation played itself out. In practical and political terms questions were immediately raised about the impact on King’s endorsements, her reputation, and the gains for women’s sport she had worked so hard to achieve. As columnist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193723512442203">Ellen Goodman (1981)</xref> put it, “For the moment, the weight of this new information—dredged up from a well of bitterness—overbalances all the rest. For the moment, the articles and interviews claim that her homosexual affair negates all these accomplishments” (p. 7c). In the language of intertextuality, this situation raises questions about narrative power and how unanticipated textual events endanger the normative narrative by challenging, decentering, or displacing dominant meanings. Barnett presented a moment of textual confusion in which King herself was temporarily captured.</p>
<p>The Marilyn Barnett case introduced just such a disruptive moment into King’s biography, and King quite perceptively summarizes this intertextual predicament in her second autobiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>), which was rushed into print in an effort to contain the potential damage to her reputation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . what bothered me when I became aware that my privacy would be invaded and the affair would be publicly disclosed in the lawsuit was what people would think whenever my name came up. I feared that I always would be categorized by that, whatever else I have accomplished. I worked hard all of my life to achieve my goals . . . and became famous for being a tennis champion, and then, because of the disclosure, I was put in the vulnerable position of being remembered and categorized because of this very private and inconsequential episode. (p. 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>King astutely recognized the necessity of reshaping the narrative, and she voiced her frustration with the limited options she felt were available to her.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The damage was compounded because the disclosure of my private affair surfaced when it did, right at the time when I was finishing as a player. Now, I have very little time left to play championship tennis to help people forget that insignificant part of my life. There is no way I can get back in the news for winning something on the tennis court, which could send the Marilyn episode back to oblivion. . . . I fear that, years ahead, when people hear the name of Billie Jean King, they will think of scandal before championships. And that would hurt, hurt very badly. I don’t want that. (p. 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As this passage suggests, this unwanted challenge produced a break point in King’s public life, and an eager nation apparently awaited her next move.</p>

<title>Narrative Moves: Mrs. King Breaks Back</title>
<p>Billie Jean King was troubled by what we might see as textual substitution—the replacement of a normative public image, often nurtured over a lifetime or career, with a socially stigmatizing one. She quickly realized the she must become an active shaper of the story that, in her mind, threatened to destroy her reputation and the gains in women’s sport she had championed for so long. After denying for several days that she had a relationship with Barnett, King reversed her tactics and, in effect, “charged the net”:
<disp-quote>
<p>Whatever the consequences, I’m a person who takes risks. And the only way I can deal with this is to be aggressive and stand up. That’s the way I am; that’s the way I’ve always played tennis. Maybe it’s safer the other way, but this is me, and I want to be true to myself. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>, pp. 6-7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Against the advice of her friends and her attorney, she scheduled a press conference, held on May 1. Looking directly into the cameras, she admitted “I did have an affair with Marilyn Barnett. It’s been over for quite some time . . . I made a mistake and I will assume responsibility for it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723512442203">“Billie Jean’s odd match,” 1981</xref>, p. 36).</p>
<p>The press conference was staged to display the King’s commitment to one another. They entered holding hands and Larry sat with his arm around her throughout. Billie Jean said “It’s very important to me to thank Larry, because I love him very much. He’s my lover, my husband, and my best friend—has been for 19 years.” She said she and Larry “are much closer than ever now” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723512442203">“Billie Jean’s odd match,” 1981</xref>, p. 36). This performance of solidarity was repeated in the <italic>20/20</italic> interview with Barbara Walters a few days later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193723512442203">Walters, 1981</xref>) and in a spread in <italic>People</italic> magazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193723512442203">McCall, 1981a</xref>), which opened with a full-page picture of the two of them lying together on a bed in their Marina Del Rey apartment. Declaring “I’ve always been aboveboard with the press” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723512442203">“Billie Jean’s odd match,” 1981</xref>, p. 36), King took many opportunities to address the media, most notably, in the second autobiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>), which was available within months of the court decision.</p>
<p>The press conference helped to reshape the public discourse. By admitting the affair, King silenced the speculation about her sexual relationship with Barnett, removing a major point of contention from the upcoming court case; focus would now be on the palimony aspect of the case. But King unwittingly created another controversy. What, exactly, was the “mistake” she had admitted making? Gay activists and others were upset that King appeared to be apologizing for having had a lesbian relationship and later comments by the Kings support this interpretation. In the <italic>People</italic> interview, King said, “I hate being called a homosexual because I don’t feel that way,” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193723512442203">McCall, 1981a</xref>, p. 75) and the couple took many opportunities to foreground their apparent heterosexual relationship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0193723512442203">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>King quickly insisted the “mistake” she was referring to was adultery. In the interview with Barbara Walters filmed only a month after the story broke, King says “I did make a mistake. I’m married. It was wrong” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193723512442203">Walters, 1981</xref>), and in “Portrait of a Pioneer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723512442203">Grossi, 2006</xref>) she repeated what she had meant: “It was a mistake because I believe in monogamy. I think people got confused and I’m sorry for that confusion.” But King was not successful in redefining the narrative as an issue of monogamy. While she may have been repenting her adultery, the press coverage continued its normative coverage focusing on the lesbian aspects. Admission of adultery was unlikely to have caused such great concern among the companies for whom she was a spokesperson; lesbianism was another matter.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, because it played into dominant homophobic discourses, the apology served as a recuperative narrative move. According to scholars who study public apologies, a successful apology must meet four criteria: it must provide a straightforward acceptance of guilt and not blame others; it must be well performed so that people can look you in the eye, assess your body language, and believe your sincerity; it must be voluntary, not forced or coerced and not seen as a last resort; and it must fulfill public expectations by providing a sense of closure (Hearit in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193723512442203">Conan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193723512442203">Frandsen &amp; Johanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193723512442203">Hearit, 2006</xref>). Although not a perfect apology—the confusion over the nature of the “mistake” was a major flaw—King apparently satisfied all but the harshest of critics. The press characterized her as “a women’s rights activist who has never shied away from controversy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193723512442203">Lorge, 1981a</xref>, p. A1) and “an ace with a heart” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193723512442203">Greene, 1981</xref>), and noted admiringly, “Tough old lady serves notice she’s still game” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193723512442203">Green, 1981</xref>); others praised her for her honesty: “Billie Jean King finds honesty the only policy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193723512442203">Mann, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Some columnists, however, voiced skepticism over her motivation, arguing that her admission was disingenuous: “If at first you don’t succeed, confess” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0193723512442203">Shields, 1981</xref>) and “Billie Jean apologizes—but not really” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193723512442203">Cohen, 1981</xref>), and some feminists were dismayed by her initial denial and the ambiguity of the “mistake” she admitted to making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193723512442203">Kort, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0193723512442203">Roberts, 1981</xref>). Still, public response, as indicated by the almost universally positive responses in published letters to newspapers and magazines, was overwhelmingly forgiving. In inimitable fashion, King had risen to the challenge of this narrative break point, in so doing, pulling it back safely within the bounds of the very narrative it was seen to threaten—that dearest of American narratives in which the individual risks all to step up to a challenge.</p>

<title>Building a Heteronormative Narrative</title>
<p>Our analysis of the publicly available accounts of the Billie Jean King/Marilyn Barnett relationship revealed great support for King and a willingness to construct a context for understanding, even forgiving, the incident as an atypical and unimportant moment in the larger scheme of King’s noteworthy life. Both contemporary and retrospective accounts represent the moment within relatively traditional liberal discourses of triumph over challenges. Four themes characterized the dominant narrative: the routinization of a lesbian presence in sport; the supportive husband as a model of forgiveness; the nastiness of a woman scorned; and sexuality as a private matter. All four work together to minimize or decenter the “lesbian threat” and reestablish the dominant heteronarrative.</p>
<sec id="section5-0193723512442203">
<title>So there are lesbians in sport</title>
<p>When the revelation of King’s relationship with Barnett was made public, many were concerned that discrediting King would discredit the recent gains in women’s sport that were synonymous with her name. Fear of a lesbian presence has long haunted women’s sport, often invoking heterosexist prejudices and defensive homophobic denials. Thus the announcement that King had had a lesbian affair might, one reporter worried, create “dangerous topspin for the image conscious women’s tennis circuit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193723512442203">Beach, 1981</xref>, p. 77). Indeed, a number of women players reported that the <italic>National Enquirer</italic> was nosing around, offering players as much as US$25,000 for additional details on Billie Jean King and the other possible lesbians on tour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193723512442203">Hicks, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193723512442203">Lorge, 1981c</xref>); no one took them up on this offer.</p>
<p>But most news accounts minimized the potential homophobic sensationalism of the topic by almost routinizing the assertion, suggesting that “It is generally agreed that homosexual relations among women athletes tend to be more open, more enduring, and at the top level of certain sports, more widespread than among their male counterparts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723512442203">Kirshenbaum, 1981</xref>, p. 13). Writing in <italic>Newsweek</italic>, Pete Axthelm noted, “Contrary to the favorite catchwords of last week’s tabloid headlines, lesbianism in sports is neither ‘rampant’ nor a ‘scandal.’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193723512442203">1981</xref>, p. 133). Feminist writers were of the same opinion. Liberal feminist Helen Gurley Brown wrote, “It seemed so antique and primitive for anybody to make such a fuss about the whole thing” (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193723512442203">Lorge, 1982</xref>, p. 47) and radical feminist Kate Millett said, “I thought the media’s response was old-fashioned” (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193723512442203">Lorge, 1982</xref>, p. 46).</p>

<title>The supportive husband</title>
<p>As Billie Jean King’s husband and manager, Larry King was a familiar character in her life story: “He’s the king of their courtship,” said one review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193723512442203">Kay, 1982</xref>). King herself was fond of acknowledging that it was Larry who first awakened her feminist consciousness by pointing out the inequities of college tennis for men and women. In the news conference after the affair was revealed, during the court case that followed, and in many public occasions beyond, the media portrayed Larry King’s support for Billie Jean as unwavering. “Anybody would support their wife in this situation, you know, when they get stabbed in the back,” he said in the HBO “Portrait of a Pioneer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723512442203">Grossi, 2006</xref>), and asked by Barbara Walters on <italic>20/20</italic> “Can your marriage survive this?” Larry answered “It can as far as I’m concerned. I don’t anticipate that it wouldn’t” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193723512442203">Walters, 1981</xref>). Larry had known about the affair all along, it turned out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723512442203">“Larry King,” 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193723512442203">McCall, 1981a</xref>), and in several interviews blamed himself: “I contributed to it . . . by not fulfilling her need to have me there . . . I was in some ways defaulting on my responsibilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193723512442203">Walters, 1981</xref>). The subtext of this quote seems clear: if he could forgive his wife’s extramarital affair, surely the public should as well.</p>

<title>A woman scorned</title>
<p>Having set things in motion, Marilyn Barnett must have been stunned by how quickly she lost control of any narrative advantage. Although King did not choose to have this conversation, once it was initiated, the microphone was hers. She was repeatedly interviewed in the media while Barnett was rarely quoted and had no real voice outside the courtroom (see Oppenheim, 1981, for the rare exception). As a result the story is told entirely from King’s perspective. A <italic>People</italic> interview with the Kings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193723512442203">McCall, 1981a</xref>), published before the trial had begun, provided a very public opportunity for them to control the narrative. “We’ve been trying to help her for years,” said Billie Jean about Barnett (p. 76); Larry King added, “She became more and more of a hassle, always wanting more” (p. 76). The interviewer (a close friend of the Kings) noted, “She was far from a trouble-free houseguest”: she had been rushed to the hospital three times for drug-related issues and had attempted suicide by jumping from the balcony of the Malibu beach house (p. 74). Larry King went even further in his assessment of Barnett’s actions: “I think when Marilyn induced Billie Jean to write the letters she had this lawsuit in the back of her mind” (pp. 75-76). King’s second autobiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>) provided further guidance to the public as to the preferred meaning of the incident.</p>
<p>News accounts refrained from blatantly negative comments, generally avoiding provocative adjectives or speculations about her motivations. One of the more sensitive aspects of Marilyn Barnett’s story was the fact that she was a paraplegic, since how she became a paraplegic was an issue open to interpretation, even judgment. The <italic>Post, Tribune</italic>, and <italic>Times</italic> all mentioned early on in their coverage that Barnett was a paraplegic or “wheelchair bound,” and news photos also provided this information. The <italic>Post</italic> reported that she was wheelchair bound as the result of an alleged suicide attempt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193723512442203">Lorge, 1981a</xref>, p. A10), but both the <italic>Times</italic> and the <italic>Tribune</italic> preferred to limit their description to phrases such as “a paraplegic because of a fall” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193723512442203">Oliver, 1981a</xref>, p. 1) and “injured in a fall” (Oppenheim, 1981, p. 6). The subject received more sustained attention in news magazines. <italic>Time</italic> reported that the LA County fire department logs had listed the accident as a “possible suicide attempt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193723512442203">Beach, 1981</xref>, p. 77). <italic>Newsweek</italic> printed King’s business manager and friend’s account: “She told me she jumped from the balcony of the Mailbu house and she was trying to kill herself” and noted that she had also “tried to drive her car off a cliff into Malibu Canyon” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723512442203">“Billie Jean’s odd match,” 1981</xref>, p. 36). Thus the potential sympathy Barnett’s paralysis might have evoked was muted by the public accounts of its origins, and the Kings’ characterization of Barnett as a troubled individual became the dominant public image.</p>
<p>To the extent that lesbianism was constructed as a problem in this story, it was Barnett who came to represent the “lesbian menace.” Her personal narrative had only one storyline while the public could draw on a lifetime of narratives of King. Thus the one-dimensional Barnett became the “real” lesbian and cultural fears about disability no doubt contributed to her construction as the villain as the public drama played itself out. The <italic>People</italic> interviewer observed “At the bottom of it was a woman scorned” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193723512442203">McCall, 1981a</xref>, p. 74), and <italic>Time</italic> magazine referred to Barnett as “the spurned secretary” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193723512442203">Beach, 1981</xref>, p. 77). A more direct critique of Barnett was voiced by feminist Susan Brownmiller, one of four women invited to contribute to a <italic>World Tennis</italic> forum:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think people rallied toward Billie Jean King not because sexuality doesn’t make a difference or because we’re all so liberal about what other people do, but because of the incredible vindictiveness of Barnett . . .

<title>A private matter</title>
<p>A final framing posits that the King/Barnett affair is irrelevant because sexuality is a personal and private matter. King consistently invoked this argument, and the theme was widely taken up, for example, in two <italic>World Tennis</italic> forums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193723512442203">Lorge, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193723512442203">“Private lives, public tantrums,” 1982</xref>). Writing “In defense of Billie Jean,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193723512442203">Chris Evert (1981)</xref> summarized this sensibility stating that
<disp-quote>
<p>Your sex life seems to me to be the most private thing in life. It can be funny, it can be embarrassing, it can be so many things, but it should be something the remains entirely your own. Nobody should be put in the position of having to reveal anything that personal—and Billie Jean had it blasted all over the paper. It was a terrible invasion of her privacy, twice. (p. 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Friends rallied to her side, decrying the intrusive attention she was enduring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193723512442203">Greene, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193723512442203">Lichtenstein, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193723512442203">McCall, 1981b</xref>). And public responses, as indexed by letters to the editors of newspapers and magazines, were strongly in agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193723512442203">Hoffman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193723512442203">“Private lives, public disclosures” 1981</xref>); as Grace <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193723512442203">Lichtenstein (1981)</xref> reported, “When I polled some women at my tennis club at the height of the King scandal, the overall reaction was: ‘Interesting, but so what?’” (p. 100).</p>
<p>While these responses were no doubt reassuring to King, framing sexuality as a private matter is a political strategy with deep implications. While some civil rights advocates argue fervently that the government has no right to intrude into private bedrooms, others argue that the silence and privatization of sexuality apologizes for and undermines the fight for public and legal validation for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people. Ironically, and unfortunately, this stance on privacy contributed to the conservative tenor of the media coverage of this incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193723512442203">“Oh, Billie Jean,” 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0193723512442203">Roberts, 1981</xref>).</p>

<title>Rallying for Billie Jean</title>
<p>Dire as the predictions about negative effects of the Marilyn Barnett affair were when the story originally broke, the overall impact, according to contemporary assessments and with the added perspective of 30 years, was more mixed. Certainly the Kings suffered financially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0193723512442203">“Sequel,” 1981</xref>). Court costs ran to US$100,000, and the loss of other income forced King to continue her tennis career for 2 years longer than she had planned. She lost a lucrative contract with Murjani Clothing and several other sponsors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>, p. 213), and sponsors began to abandon Team Tennis and back out of the tennis tournaments Larry was organizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0193723512442203">“Sequel,” 1981</xref>). King estimated that she lost almost US$1.5 million due to the suit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>, p. 213).</p>
<p>Other sponsors, notably Nike and Yonex, stood by King, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0193723512442203">“Sequel,” 1981</xref>) and NBC announced they still wanted her as a commentator at Wimbledon later that summer (Aldridge, 1981). Initial hesitation among some WTA sponsors was dispelled when public opinion turned clearly in King’s favor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193723512442203">Lorge, 1982</xref>). Writing on the economic condition of the WTA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193723512442203">Lorge (1982)</xref> reported that “An executive of one prominent sponsor said privately that his company had expected bags full of negative letters, but received only half a dozen” (p. 48). Avon and Toyota announced they would continue as major sponsors of the WTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193723512442203">Lorge, 1982</xref>); indeed, David W. Mitchell, chairman of the board of Avon, appeared almost hurt when he said “Recent newspaper reports that some WTA members feel Avon will withdraw from women’s tennis because of the personal lifestyle of players have distressed me and are completely unfounded” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193723512442203">Lorge, 1982</xref>, p. 48).</p>
<p>King’s place in women’s tennis was also reaffirmed thanks partially to the recuperative effect of liberal and private discourses around sexuality. She offered to withdraw as Tracy Austin’s doubles partner: Austin’s parents asked her to remain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193723512442203">Amdur, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193723512442203">Lorge, 1981b</xref>). She offered to resign as President of the Women’s Tennis Association: the players refused her resignation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723512442203">“King will remain as president,” 1981</xref>). Chris Evert’s very public support here was particularly noteworthy since her “girl next door” image had often been constructed by the media in contrast with the more assertively feminist players of King’s generation (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723512442203">Kirkpatrick, 1976</xref>). From the very beginning, King reported that “everyone has been absolutely fantastic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193723512442203">Lorge, 1981b</xref>, p. D1) and that support never diminished: “I’ve received a couple thousand letters of support” she told <italic>People</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0193723512442203">“Sequel,” 1981</xref>, p. 111). She seemed particularly pleased to recount a standing ovation she received when she entered the court for an event in a particularly conservative and religious community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>, p. 213).</p>
<p>While numerous accounts supported King, these narratives did not displace homophobic fears of a lesbian presence, fears which have a long history within women’s sport and the professional tennis circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193723512442203">Cahn, 1994</xref>). For example, several articles and books recount Martina Navratilova’s struggles after King’s lawsuit. Despite coming out shortly after becoming a U.S. citizen in 1981, Navratilova was reportedly hesitant to more fully discuss her sexuality, fearing that such revelations would hurt the sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193723512442203">Blue, 1995</xref>). Media and marketing accounts subsequently constructed Navratilova as an outsider, preferring instead to promote her rival Chris Evert as the ideal (heterosexual) public face of women’s tennis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193723512442203">Spencer, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Backhanded Compliments: Silencing Radical Challenges</title>
<p>Amidst the various narratives generated, our understanding of the public response to King must also be grounded in part in terms of the cultural moment in which it occurred. The public revelation of the Billie Jean King and Marilyn Barnett relationship offered a moment of same-sex visibility contextualized within a broader liberalization of sexual norms partially fueled by the feminist, and gay and lesbian movements. The 1960s and 1970s had presented a shifting cultural landscape characterized by feminist challenges to conventional sexual arrangements and advocacy for greater sexual autonomy for women. Public opinion, general trends, and countercultural conventions worked to dislodge the unquestioned premise that marriage was the only legitimate means for sexual expression. Burgeoning gay urban cultures fostered affirming institutions and practices such as the gay press, art and scholarship, and forged the social support and resources necessary to challenge homophobic legislation and attitudes, thus enabling a wider acceptance for sexual minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0193723512442203">Seidman, 1997</xref>). By the mid-1970s important legislative victories were being won, as half the states in the United States repealed sodomy laws and local governments began to pass legislation to make sexual preference a protected category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193723512442203">Miller, 1995</xref>). A backlash of antigay crusaders, most notably Anita Bryant and her conservative group Save the Children, Inc., became increasingly vocal, but they were also discredited for their blatant homophobic tactics and fearmongering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193723512442203">Miller, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>While the general support for King can be attributed in some degree to the fact that the King–Barnett affair was narrated within this cultural landscape of broadened acceptance for divergent sexual norms and gender behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0193723512442203">Seidman, 1997</xref>), we argue that conservative forces were as important as the expansion of liberal politics in creating a context of acceptance for King. The key to this can be found in the way the narratives of explanation, or heteronormative legitimation, were produced and circulated. Ironically, it was King herself who accomplished this through the narrative strategy she chose. By offering an apology, however ambiguous, for her “mistake,” King positioned herself within a narrative of tolerance, in which apologies and confessions are the cultural currency and forgiveness and tolerance the anticipated outcomes. This framing was particularly powerful given the proliferation of similar narratives.</p>
<p>Praiseworthy as King’s efforts might be, successful as she might have been in minimizing the alleged “damage” done to her reputation and to women’s sport, brave as she might have been in stepping to the mike, King and the media missed the opportunity to create a more radical rupture in our understanding of sexuality and intimate relationships. Ironically, Billie Jean and Larry King were well positioned to do so, articulating a relationship outside the norms of traditional White-middle class “respectability.” On the public stage, they modeled a decidedly nontraditional marriage with Billie Jean as a role model for the assertive working woman and Larry working behind the scenes to manage their tennis interests. Billie Jean credited Larry with making her career possible: “If I’d married a guy who was very different—whoa!—I probably would have stayed home” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723512442203">Grossi, 2006</xref>). They had decided to delay having children—“it would be selfish until our life is more stable” said Larry on <italic>60 Minutes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0193723512442203">Safer, 1972</xref>) and Billie Jean had famously signed on to an ad in <italic>Ms</italic>. Magazine in 1972 publicly acknowledging that she had had an abortion.</p>
<p>As she noted in her autobiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">“King with Deford,” 1982</xref>), her deviation from the role of typical housewife caused some concerns:
<disp-quote>
<p>I understand how hard it is for most people to appreciate the sort of marriage that we do have. It doesn’t fit into any sort of neat niche, and that irritates a lot of people . . . I had the distinct feeling that many people were not just uncommonly curious about our marriage, but that they really were rooting against it . . . I suppose many of the critical people have been angry at me because I shouldn’t have the right to have such an atypical marriage still lasting. (pp. 64-65)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Together they had founded World Team Tennis and <italic>Womensport</italic> magazine, but their independence from one another was a keynote of the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193723512442203">McCall, 1981</xref>). In an interview with Larry King during this time, entitled “He’s the king of the courtship nobody knows,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193723512442203">Linda Kay (1982)</xref> revealed that Larry was the caretaker of his 13-year-old nephew while his sister struggled with a nervous breakdown. “Shane is part of the life King has fashioned apart from Billie Jean,” reported Kay (p. 6).</p>
<p>As the public learned, the Kings had had a sexually open marriage as well. Larry King had known about the Barnett relationship from the beginning, and even accepted it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723512442203">“Larry King,” 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193723512442203">McCall, 1981a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193723512442203">Walters, 1981</xref>). He regarded Marilyn Barnett as “an unfortunate revelation . . . It was something I had dealt with six, maybe seven years before. It was just history and it was a waste of time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193723512442203">Kay, 1982</xref>, p. 1). He admitted to extramarital relationships of his own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723512442203">Grossi, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193723512442203">Selena Roberts (2005)</xref> argues, King’s depiction of her affair with Barnett as “a singular mistake” was misleading: “As everyone on the tour knew . . . Billie had been exploring relationships with women long before Marilyn came along” (p. 181), and in fact, at the time of the Barnett lawsuit, Roberts claims, King was already involved with the woman who is still her partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193723512442203">Roberts, 2005</xref>, pp. 181, 238) although King had proactively denied this in her autobiography at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723512442203">King with Deford, 1982</xref>, p. 216). Chris Evert also offered a cultural insider’s view into the relationship and the knowledge other members of the tour had: “When I saw Larry, you know, sitting with Marilyn watching Billie Jean [at the Riggs match], I was just trying to figure out, how did it work? Nobody was making any judgments and everybody was cool with it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723512442203">Grossi, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>King’s acknowledgement in her autobiography that she was not the typical heterosexual housewife might have served as a basis for disrupting normative ways of thinking about the self. The potential for even more disruptive discourses that would actively repudiate the sexual binary and challenge monogamous marriage was always just below the surface of their marriage. Rather than attempting to fold the interruption seamlessly into the public narrative of her life, King and the media might have made a more profound critique of the situation. Yet those who helped generate these narratives rarely interrogated the ideal of heterosexuality and instead focused on promoting gayness as either an object of tolerance or as a poor substitute for heterosexuality. As Shelly Roberts wrote of King’s apologetic stance, “I wish you had simply left it at, ‘Yes, I did it.’ Or, even better, you might have said that regardless of how it has turned out, the affair had been a valid experience for you” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0193723512442203">1981</xref>, p. 19).</p>
<p>All narratives have the potential for disrupting hegemonic power; resistance, or “homologic escape,” is always an option. The Marilyn Barnett disruption challenged narratives of sexual normativity, not in the dominant way, that is, not in terms of the appropriateness or morality of lesbian relationships vis a vis heterosexual ones, but in the silencing of more radical configurations of sexual relationships. An alternative account might have suggested that individual sexual desire and practices are not neatly reducible to the powerful disciplining apparatus of the hetero-homo binary. That is, King’s relationships are paradigmatic in revealing that bodies do not discretely line up within a predictable patterned ordering of heterosexuality and homosexuality but instead reveal the fluid character of desire. Such a perspective was hardly unarticulated, as the Kinsey Reports of the late 1940s and early1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193723512442203">Kinsey, Pomeroy, &amp; Martin, 1948</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193723512442203">1953</xref>) had previously proposed a continuum of variable desire and thus the changeability of sexuality. But this notion would only later be linked to broader regimes of power and knowledge via queer theory, a discourse most visibly mobilized by AIDS activists in the 1980s, in an era when King’s tennis career had finished.</p>
<p>While the storylines produced around the event at the time crossed divergent and sometimes intersecting sensibilities, their underlying premises are that sexuality is an individual marker of a static identity, and that sexual identity—while a personal, even private, attribute—can be easily expressed through the discrete categories of heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality. Our iterative performances and our need to produce coherent narratives of identity work to confirm such assumptions.</p>
<p>The Marilyn Barnett story interrupted the flow of the dominant discourse on Billie Jean King, mobilizing a remedial narrative counterpoint on King’s part to restore her preferred storyline. Successful as that strategy may have been for the narrative of a particular modern life, such defensive work keeps us from seeing more subversive and radical critiques that challenge heteronormativity.</p>

<p>This honor is not the only one that attests to the continuing respect for Billie Jean King after the Barnett incident. For example, King was listed as an “influential” woman in a <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723512442203">“Billie Jean King ties,” 1981</xref>) and was selected ahead of Golda Meir as an influential woman in a <italic>Seventeen</italic> magazine survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723512442203">Grossi, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>The Kings eventually divorced in 1987, and Billie Jean King has gone on to become a spokesperson for LGBTQ issues. In 2009 President Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor for her work on behalf of women’s sport and the LGBTQ community.</p>
