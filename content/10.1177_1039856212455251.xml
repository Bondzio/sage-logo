<body>
<p>It is estimated that the world’s population of older adults (aged &gt;65years) will increase to 1.2 billion by 2025, a sixfold increase in less than 100 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212455251">1</xref></sup> As life expectancy increases and the older adult population expands, there is an increasing need to focus on the mental health of older adults.</p>
<p>Depression is the most frequent psychiatric disorder to occur in the older adult population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212455251">2</xref></sup> It also appears that about 50% of depressive disorders among the older population present as a new condition arising in old age. With the absolute older population rising in number, this is a concern. Brodaty et al. found that 52% of patients aged 60 years or older, attending a geriatric mood disorder clinic, presented with first onset of a depressive illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212455251">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is a high prevalence of depressive symptoms among residents in aged care facilities. Snowdon and Fleming detected depressive symptoms among 40% of high-care residents and 25% of low-care residents in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212455251">4</xref></sup> It is estimated that 25% of elderly patients in medical hospital wards are clinically depressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212455251">5</xref></sup> Moreover, about one-third of older adults who attend their General Practitioner report depressive symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212455251">6</xref></sup> The rates of depression escalate among the older population with co-morbid neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia, Parkinson’s disease and stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212455251">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212455251">8</xref></sup> As one grows older, the risk of depression also increases with both the prevalence and incidence of depression doubling after the age of 70–85 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212455251">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212455251">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite its prevalence, depression in old age remains under-diagnosed and poorly managed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212455251">11</xref></sup> Unlike their younger counterparts, elderly patients are less likely to endorse classical depressive symptomatology and are more likely to report vague somatic complaints that fail to fulfil the diagnostic criteria for depression. So, although studies report that depressed older adults will present to their GP two to three times more frequently than their non-depressed peers, less than 10% of patients identified as depressed in primary care are prescribed an antidepressant and a referral to psychiatric services occurs in less than 1% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212455251">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Society has long held, and to some extent continues to hold, the view that depression is a ‘normal’ part of growing old and thus depressed mood and sadness are accepted as reasonable complaints given the stressors that the elderly face, including social isolation, deteriorating physical health, memory problems, bereavement, financial strain and loss of independence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212455251">13</xref></sup> The low rate of detection of depression in old age in primary care may, to some degree, reflect this attitude, among health care professionals. This might then potentially contribute to depression being a chronic and debilitating illness with escalating levels of morbidity and mortality, despite the mounting evidence that depression can be readily identified and differentiated from common sadness or grief and can be successfully treated and reversed, even in the very old.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212455251">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, the falling birth rate and the growth of the older population has increased the focus on the need for more age appropriate and effective mental health services for older people. The financial burden that old-age depression places on society through the cost of care and the loss of productivity of carers has encouraged the need to develop more cost-effective interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212455251">15</xref></sup> There have been a number of papers published in the last decade attesting to the need for psychogeriatric care models that provide early intervention, feasible and tailored management strategies and psychoeducation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212455251">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212455251">17</xref></sup> Given the high prevalence and incidence rates and associated burden of disease associated with depression in old age, there is a clear need for age-appropriate, effective and inexpensive interventions.</p>
<sec id="section3-1039856212455251">
<title>The effectiveness of psychoeducation</title>
<p>The importance of psychoeducation in psychiatry has been well established, and numerous studies have been published in recent years highlighting the benefits of providing psychoeducation to patients and carers in order to improve compliance, hasten recovery, maximize carer support, and enhance patient outcome and satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212455251">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856212455251"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212455251">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Psychoeducation in old-age depression generally provides information about the risk factors, causes, signs and symptoms, treatment and prevention of relapse. Psychoeducation resources are generally effective, easy to implement and beneficial for patients and carers. The types of passive resources available range from educational leaflets and booklets or other audiovisual material, to more labour-intensive clinician-facilitated education, provided individually or in groups. In 2009, Donker et al. published a meta-analysis looking at psychoeducation in depression and anxiety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856212455251">21</xref></sup> This study demonstrated that psychoeducation for these illnesses is beneficial and can reduce symptoms. It appears that most resources are based on passive psychoeducation. However, it is now widely accepted that patients can actively participate in the management of their illness and are often the most effective agents of change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856212455251">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>More specifically, behavioural tailoring is an effective strategy to promote adherence to medication regimes by encouraging patients to incorporate medication taking into their daily routine, e.g. placing a tablet dosette box beside their bed to remind them to take their medication before bed and/or rationalizing patient’s medication regimes to once-daily dosing etc. Relapse prevention strategies help to reduce symptom relapse and rehospitalization, and psychoeducation approaches that incorporate cognitive behavioural techniques help to reduce the severity and distress caused by the symptoms of depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856212455251">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our clinical experience of utilizing the available psychoeducation interventions in old-age depression was that many patients lack the motivation and enthusiasm to engage with passive psychoeducation strategies. This is often due to persisting illness symptoms, pre-existing ideas about the aetiology of their problems or a perception among patients that the information alone will not help. We therefore identified the need for a tool that would combine the benefits of both passive and interactive interventions that would be cost-effective and easy to implement.</p>
<p>In addition, our clinical experience showed us that, although depression in old age is common, an individual’s experience of the illness is unique. It seemed apparent then that it is not only important to provide general information about the illness and treatment options but also to facilitate the ability of each patient to actively personalize their recovery plan and treatment for an episode of depression, based on their symptoms and personal experience of the illness. We therefore developed an educational tool that included educational material for patients and carers about old-age depression and also material to assist and facilitate the patient’s efforts to tailor and personalize their management plan and recovery pathway. This then equips each individual with a sense of control and autonomy over their recovery pathway and helps to allay fears about becoming unwell in the future. This promotes patient empowerment, which has been shown in mental health to increase motivation to participate and nurture more effective coping strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856212455251">23</xref></sup></p>

<title>The ‘Homeward Bound’ psychoeducation programme</title>
<p>The ‘Homeward Bound’ psychoeducation programme was developed in response to a need to provide patients with a useful resource to assist in active engagement in planning and implementing their recovery. The resource devised is an educational-workbook. It is divided into four sections and was developed with multidisciplinary team input from staff working within the medical, nursing, psychology and social work disciplines. It is for use by individuals who require information about the illness, including patients, family members and carers, as well as those who have previous experience with depression.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856212455251">
<title>Programme model and design</title>
<p>The ‘Homeward Bound’ education-workbook is based on cognitive behavioural principles and techniques. It aims to focus on achievable goals for patients using assignments, like homework within the cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) model, to reinforce learned information and encourage patients to apply newly acquired information and skills to their day-to-day activities. The importance of the role of homework in CBT is well established and, although most research has originated from the study of the younger population, there is also mounting evidence supporting the benefits of homework assignments in the older adult population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856212455251">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effectiveness of this resource relies on the patient’s active participation in completing the assignments in the workbook (detailed below), and patients are encouraged to view completion of the relevant sections as an integral part of their management planning and therefore a step in their progress along the recovery pathway. To an extent, progress is dependent on the patient’s ability to appreciate that they are more likely to achieve their goals if they actively engage and participate in putting newly acquired information and skills into practice. Also, patients are encouraged to seek professional carer assistance in completing the relevant sections as this will provide a source of reinforcement for their efforts.</p>
<p>Given the age-related deficits of our target population, this resource was designed with the potential sensory and cognitive impairment of the older adult in mind. The education workbook is presented in an A4-size booklet. We used size 14 font for the main body of the text and size 20 font for subheadings. Key ideas and words are highlighted in red for emphasis, and headings and subheadings are printed in bright colours. There are visual cues relating to subject matter and the body of the text is generously spaced between paragraphs and new topics. The booklet is divided into three sections and the information is provided in an easy-to-follow step-wise fashion. Simple, clear language is used throughout and the workbook section contains generous spacing to allow patients to write freely.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856212455251">
<title>Section one</title>
<p>Section one contains factual information about depression in old age and is modelled on the basic principles of psychoeducation. It includes details about the risk factors, causes and symptoms and signs of depression in the older adult population. Section one also contains information about the treatment options, including both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management strategies and self-help strategies. The information is provided in a concise manner based on current evidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856212455251">
<title>Section two</title>
<p>This section consists of a ‘wellness kit’ and was developed based on principles of interactive psychoeducation. It contains materials to help patients devise a personalized management plan and facilitate development of personalized relapse prevention strategies. This is best done in consultation with a psychogeriatric clinician, GP or a family member, friend or carer who knows the individual well and is aware of the nature of their illness. It consists of a Self-Care Check List, Adverse Events Response Lists, Early Warning Sign Checklist and Action Response Plans. This section is in a workbook style that the patient completes according to their own symptoms and warning signs of relapse.</p>
<p>The Self-Care Check List aims to encourage patients to record their daily routine and to identify and engage in health-promoting activities that can help to keep them well. Adverse Events Planners assist patients in documenting events or psychological stressors that might precipitate relapse. They then develop response plans that are put in place in advance, promoting a sense of control and autonomy over their illness and circumstances. These planners also contain a section to record symptoms that others (i.e. family members or friends) notice when a patient is becoming unwell, to encourage patients to acknowledge that at times they may not recognize they are becoming unwell and thereby recognize the importance of involvement of their support network in maintaining mental health.</p>
<p>During an episode of illness or in the prodromal phase, patients can have impaired cognition and judgement preventing them from making appropriate and reasonable decisions about their care and treatment. Therefore, it is important to encourage patients to plan in advance and have strategies in place to facilitate early detection and ensure as little distress as possible if relapse does occur. With this in mind, the ‘Wellness Kit’ has a section on relapse management, containing planners to record the names and contact details of supportive family and friends who can be informed if the patient becomes unwell. There is also a place to record a patient’s pharmacological regime and a plan for how the patient would like to be managed if they become unwell.</p>

<sec id="section8-1039856212455251">
<title>Section three</title>
<p>Carers are often left with the responsibility of providing both physical and emotional support as well as advocacy for patients, highlighting the need for information and support to equip them with skills to help reduce their burden and stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856212455251">25</xref></sup> The final section of the ‘Homeward Bound’ education-workbook is designed to provide carers with information about the importance of remaining healthy themselves and information about maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Carers are at risk of depression themselves and their needs can sometimes be neglected despite (or even as a result of) the pivotal role they play in caring and supporting others on a daily basis. This section attempts to provide strategies to care for someone with depression and also advice on how to reduce carer stress and avoid depression themselves. Furthermore, the sort of support provided by this resource helps to improve carer satisfaction and their perceptions about mental health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1039856212455251">
<title>Utilization, distribution and evaluation</title>
<p>The ‘Homeward Bound’ education-workbook has now been distributed to all our patients with a diagnosis of depression in the inpatient, outpatient and community outreach settings, and they are being encourage to read and complete the programme with assistance from our team or another clinician involved in their care. Carers are also provided with a copy to promote support and provide education among this group, not only about depression, but also carers’ wellbeing and health. The patients and their carers are encouraged to complete the programme together and retain a completed copy at home. We now plan to undertake a qualitative review involving both patient and carer feedback to assess the benefits of this intervention.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1039856212455251">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is an increasing need within our mental health service to provide beneficial, cost-effective, tailored and age-appropriate services to our older adult population. We identified a need to provide a psychoeducational resource that addressed the needs of the older adult population and that can be used extensively within inpatient, outpatient and community outreach care models. The ‘Homeward Bound’ educational resource is one in a series of educational booklets our team is designing on psychogeriatric topics in the hope that such resources will encourage active patient and carer participation in patient education, autonomy, recovery and relapse prevention.</p>
