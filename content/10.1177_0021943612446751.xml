<abstract>
<p>This study examined how dissent expression related to employees’ self reports of work engagement and intention to leave. A sample of full-time employees completed a multi-instrument questionnaire. Findings indicated that dissent expression related to both employees’ work engagement and their intention to leave. In particular, dissent expressed to management and coworkers associated with work engagement, whereas dissent expressed to nonmanagement audiences associated with intention to leave. Additional analysis revealed that for managers, work engagement was primarily a function of refraining from expressing dissent.</p>

<p>Employees routinely face dissatisfying conditions in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021943612446751">Hirschman, 1970</xref>). In response they often resort to expressing dissent—that is, to sharing their disagreement and contradictory opinions about workplace policies and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">1998</xref>). Dissent can be expressed to a variety of audiences, using a range of strategies and in order to achieve any number of interpersonal goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021943612446751">Garner, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021943612446751">2002</xref>). It is part of the routine communicative ebb and flow occurring daily in organizations. But expressing dissent can be risky, jeopardizing people’s livelihood, professional standing, and coworker relationships (Waldron &amp; Kassing, 2011). Thus, employees exercise caution when voicing disagreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021943612446751">Kassing, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021943612446751">2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the clear risks associated with dissent, employees readily express it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021943612446751">Kassing, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021943612446751">2009a</xref>). This happens when particular concerns create enough inertia to move employees to speak out. And while a host of problems, including affronts like ethical breaches, substandard employee treatment, and poor decision making, can trigger disagreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; Armstrong, 2002</xref>), not all troubling workplace issues lead to organizational dissent. Rather, employees determine if, when, and how to express dissent by relying on a complex set of filters that take into account individual, relational, and organizational factors. This filtering process provides employees with the footing necessary to estimate the possible risk of retaliation and the likelihood of being perceived as adversarial when expressing dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Dissent certainly can occur instantaneously and instinctively when employees find themselves in particularly dangerous and challenging situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021943612446751">Kassing, 2002</xref>), but more often it is a calculated communicative response. Dissent, then, is more akin to a communication process than a mere isolated and emotional reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1997</xref>). As such, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing (1997</xref>) conceptualized organizational dissent as a two-step process. Accordingly, employees first recognize some incongruence between the actual and desired state of affairs. This recognition distances them from others in the organization who either fail to see or choose not to acknowledge the incongruence. Dissent is merely felt but not necessarily voiced at this point. For employees to come to the realization that dissent must be expressed, the issue at hand needs to exceed their individual tolerance for dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021943612446751">Redding, 1985</xref>). That is, it must surpass the threshold employees set regarding when situations are grave enough to warrant speaking out given the accompanying risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021943612446751">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021943612446751">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021943612446751">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>Employees determine if, when, and how to express dissent by relying on a complex set of filters that take into account individual, relational, and organizational factors.</p>
<p>Dissatisfying workplace conditions of this magnitude also likely exert some influence on how engaged employees are with their work and the degree to which they give consideration to leaving their organization. There should be a connection therefore between the expression of organizational dissent and employees’ relative levels of work engagement and intention to leave. Previous research illustrates that dissent expression relates to other pertinent workplace outcomes, such as employee burnout, organizational identification, employee satisfaction, and organizational commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446751">Avtgis, Thomas-Maddox, Taylor, &amp; Richardson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446751">2000a</xref>). Dissent expressed to management, for example, relates positively to satisfaction, identification, and commitment, whereas dissent directed to coworkers correlates negatively with these constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446751">2000a</xref>). Interestingly, employees express modest amounts of dissent to management and little to coworkers when they report high levels of burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446751">Avtgis et al., 2007</xref>). Given the clear and regular connection with other pertinent workplace outcomes, we suspect that dissent expression may serve as a communicative signal of work engagement and intention to leave.</p>

<title>Employee Dissent</title>
<p>By definition, employee dissent entails the expression of disagreement or contradictory opinions about organizational policies and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">1998</xref>). Originally, dissent research focused primarily on whistle-blowing, which is the expression of dissent to media outlets or industry-governing bodies about issues of principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021943612446751">Graham, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021943612446751">Near &amp; Jensen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021943612446751">Stewart, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021943612446751">Westin, 1986</xref>). Dissent research has grown to include a broader focus that incorporates consideration of the multiple and various audiences that hear employee dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; DiCioccio, 2004</xref>), examination of a plethora of issues that trigger employee dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021943612446751">Hegstrom, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021943612446751">Kassing, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; Armstrong, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021943612446751">Sprague &amp; Ruud, 1988</xref>), and development of typologies describing how employees express dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446751">Garner, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021943612446751">Kassing, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021943612446751">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021943612446751">2009a</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">1998</xref>) argued that employees express dissent to multiple audiences, including management, coworkers, and friends and family outside of work. Employees choose to express upward dissent to management when they are more satisfied and committed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1998</xref>), when they possess comparatively higher levels of organization-based self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021943612446751">Payne, 2007</xref>), when they are more highly identified and see their workplaces as more tolerant of employee voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446751">Kassing, 2000a</xref>), and when they hold management positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; Armstrong, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; Avtgis, 1999</xref>). Additional research indicates that upward dissent occurs when subordinates perceive that they possess comparatively higher quality relationships with their supervisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021943612446751">Kassing, 2000b</xref>) and when they perceive that their organizations engage them in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; McDowell, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, employees who perceived that they have poorer quality superior-subordinate relationships expressed more lateral dissent to coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021943612446751">Kassing, 2000b</xref>). Lateral dissent also occurred when employees believed that their respective organizations stifled workplace freedom of speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446751">Kassing, 2000a</xref>). Findings indicate that the expression of lateral dissent relates negatively to employee satisfaction and commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1998</xref>) and that nonmanagement employees favor expressing lateral dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; Armstrong, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; Avtgis, 1999</xref>). Recent work revealed that lateral dissent diminished when employees experienced burnout symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446751">Avtgis et al., 2007</xref>) and that it declined when employees observed greater degrees of perceived fairness regarding organizational decision making in their respective organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; McDowell, 2008</xref>). However, other findings showed that informational justice or employees’ perceptions of justice tied to receiving adequate and thorough information about decisions related positively to latent dissent; this led the researchers to conclude that receiving better information about organizational decision making resulted in employees having more content about which to express lateral dissent to coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021943612446751">Goodboy, Chory, &amp; Dunleavy, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Employees also can direct their dissent outside of the organization by expressing displaced dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; DiCioccio, 2004</xref>). This entails sharing one’s dissent with family and nonwork friends. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">Kassing (1998)</xref> uncovered a negative correlation between displaced dissent and employee commitment but no other significant relationships between variables of interest (e.g., personal influence, employee satisfaction). In subsequent work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021943612446751">Kassing and DiCioccio (2004)</xref> found that younger employees with less total work experience, occupying nonmanagement positions, expressed displaced dissent. These findings coupled with earlier work led them to conclude that the expression of displaced dissent was an indicator of employee caution being exercised as they learned the parameters and constraints dictating employee dissent in their respective organizations.</p>
<p>Thus, employees express dissent in a variety of ways, and do so in response to many different factors. It is apparent from previous research that dissent expression varies along with employee attitudes and orientations regarding work. We are interested in extending this line of research by examining the relationship between dissent expression and employee’s reports of work engagement and intention to leave.</p>

<sec id="section3-0021943612446751">
<title>Work Engagement</title>
<p>Work engagement is typically conceptualized as the antipode of employee burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021943612446751">Bakker, Demerouti, &amp; Schaufeli, 2005</xref>). Employee burnout refers to mental weariness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021943612446751">Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004</xref>) or inadequate energy levels required to work effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021943612446751">Bakker et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021943612446751">Maslach, Schaufeli, and Leiter (2001)</xref> acknowledged three commonly discussed dimensions of employee burnout: (a) exhaustion or the depletion of emotional resources; (b) cynicism and depersonalization, which entail adopting a pessimistic and cynical attitude; and (c) lack of professional efficacy or effectiveness denoted by a deficiency in personal accomplishments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021943612446751">Maslach and Leiter (1997)</xref> posited that burnout and engagement were at opposing ends of a single spectrum, characterizing work engagement as the opposite of the three dimensions of employee burnout. More specifically, energy (as opposed to exhaustion), involvement (as opposed to cynicism), and efficacy (as opposed to lack of professional efficacy) comprise the makeup of work engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021943612446751">Bakker et al., 2005</xref>). However, Bakker et al. noted the possibility that an employee could experience low engagement but not necessarily experience burnout. That is, an employee could work in a job that requires little dedication or responsibility and thus be comparatively less engaged but without necessarily experiencing burnout. Thus, Bakker et al. recognized that work engagement and burnout are clearly related but argued that they should be examined as separate constructs.</p>
<p>The expression of displaced dissent was an indicator of employee caution being exercised as they learned the parameters and constraints dictating employee dissent in their respective organizations.</p>
<p>Scholars determined to measure work engagement as a unique construct contend that it is a mind-set derived from a positive and fulfilling work experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021943612446751">Schaufeli, Martinez, Marques Pinto, Salanova, &amp; Bakker, 2002</xref>). Accordingly, the dimensions of vigor, dedication, and absorption constitute work engagement. High mental resilience and high levels of energy in the workplace, clear and conscientious efforts to devote oneself to work, and persistence when facing difficulties demonstrate vigor. Enthusiasm, inspiration, and pride indicate dedication. Absorption entails full concentration and being highly engrossed in one’s work. Whereas vigor and dedication oppose dimensions of burnout (exhaustion and cynicism, respectively), absorption is not seen as the opposite of a lack of professional efficacy.</p>
<p>Dissent expression appears to fluctuate with symptoms of employee burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446751">Avtgis et al., 2007</xref>). Recognizing the conceptual link between employee burnout and work engagement discussed above, it makes sense to speculate that dissent expression should fluctuate with employees’ levels of work engagement. We offer the following hypothesis to explore this idea:</p>

<sec id="section4-0021943612446751">
<title>Intention to Leave</title>
<p>Although intention to leave suggests people’s attitudes or opinions toward leaving their respective organizations, it does not refer to actual employee turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021943612446751">Mobley, Griffeth, Hand, &amp; Meglino, 1979</xref>). However, many researchers consider intention to leave to be the most effective predictor of actual employee turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021943612446751">Brown &amp; Peterson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021943612446751">Randall, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021943612446751">Shore, Newton, &amp; Thornton, 1990</xref>). While earlier research suggested that turnover could be directly predicted by employee attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021943612446751">Porter, Steers, &amp; Mowday, 1974</xref>), more recent research suggests that the single best predictor of employee turnover is intention to leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021943612446751">Liou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021943612446751">Randall, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021943612446751">Shore et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Organizational commitment, the combination of employees’ identification with and involvement in one’s organization, is a strong predictor of intention to leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021943612446751">Liou, 2009</xref>). Research has consistently shown a significant and negative correlation between organizational commitment and intention to leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021943612446751">Brown &amp; Peterson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021943612446751">Johnston, Parasuraman, Futrell, &amp; Black, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021943612446751">Moore, 2000</xref>). In fact, intention to leave, turnover, absenteeism, and tardiness all correlate negatively with organizational commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021943612446751">Mathieu &amp; Zajac, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021943612446751">Meyer &amp; Allen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021943612446751">Wiener, 1982</xref>). Put simply, the less committed an employee is to an organization, the more likely that employee is to be absent from work or to leave the organization altogether. Conversely, more committed employees are more likely to remain with their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021943612446751">Johnston et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional research has identified a critical connection between employee burnout and intention to leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021943612446751">Moore, 2000</xref>). In particular the exhaustion component of employee burnout, which refers to the lessening of mental resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021943612446751">Moore, 2000</xref>), has received considerable attention. Exhaustion relates to lower job satisfaction and organizational commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021943612446751">Burke &amp; Greenglass, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021943612446751">Jackson, Turner, &amp; Brief, 1987</xref>) and to higher levels of turnover and intention to leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021943612446751">Firth &amp; Britton, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021943612446751">Jackson, Schwab, &amp; Schuler, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that previous research that links dissent expression to employee commitment and organizational identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446751">2000a</xref>) and the fact that dissent expression varies in response to employee burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446751">Avtgis et al., 2007</xref>), we suspect that dissent expression ought to relate to intention to leave an organization. We pose the following hypothesis to examine this relationship:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Dissent expression will associate with intention to leave.</p></list-item></list>
<p>One regular, consistent, and potent predictor of dissent expression is a person’s organizational position. Research indicates that managers tend to favor expressing upward dissent, while nonmanagers resort to expressing comparatively more lateral and displaced dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; Armstrong, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; Avtgis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; DiCioccio, 2004</xref>). Status affects how involved people believe they are in decision making as well as how fair they perceive decision making processes to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021943612446751">Kassing &amp; McDowell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021943612446751">Van Prooijen, Van den Bos, &amp; Wilke, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021943612446751">2005</xref>). It is conceivable then to suspect that managers and nonmanagers who differ with regard to workplace engagement and intention to leave may express dissent to different audiences.

<title>Data Collection Procedure</title>
<p>Survey methodology was used to collect data. Graduate students enrolled in a research methods seminar at a midsized southwestern university contacted participants as part of a class research project. The sampling method involved soliciting participation from friends, family members, coworkers, and neighbors. Participants received a cover letter describing the purpose of the research, which directed them to the online site where the questionnaire was located. Respondents completed the questionnaire online.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0021943612446751">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The questionnaire was composed of several measures, some of which were not examined in this particular study. Those addressed in this study included the following: (a) the Organizational Dissent Scale, (b) selected dimensions of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and (c) a measure of intention to leave. To keep the length of the questionnaire manageable for respondents, we chose to administer only two of three dimensions of the Utrech Work Engagement Scale (i.e., those that we deemed most relevant to the hypotheses). We discuss all of the measures we administered in greater detail in the paragraphs that follow.</p>
<p>The 24-item Organizational Dissent Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1998</xref>) measures how employees express their concerns about workplace policies and practices they find troubling. The measure uses a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranges from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (1) to <italic>strongly agree</italic> (5) and contains three dimensions: articulated/upward, latent/lateral, and displaced. All three dimensions have produced acceptable reliabilities in previous administrations that consistently range from .78 to .86 for the articulated/upward dimension, from .72 to .90 for the latent/lateral dimension, and from .71 to .84 for the displaced dimension. The articulated/upward dimension comprises 9 items (e.g., “I speak with my supervisor or someone in management when I question workplace decisions”). In this administration, it produced a coefficient alpha of .83 (<italic>M</italic> = 31.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.81). The latent/lateral dimension contains 8 items like “I join in when other employees complain about workplace changes” (α = .82, <italic>M</italic> = 24.07, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.77). The displaced dimension, which includes 6 items (e.g., “I talk about my job concerns to people outside of work”), produced a coefficient alpha of .75 (<italic>M</italic> = 20.50, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.02).</p>
<p>The 17-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale contains three dimensions—vigor, dedication, and absorption—measuring the degree to which people feel engaged, energized, and consumed by their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021943612446751">Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzalez-Roma, &amp; Bakker, 2002</xref>). The measure uses a 7-point Likert-type scale that ranges from <italic>never</italic> (0) to <italic>always</italic> (6). In this work, we administered only the vigor and dedication dimensions. In previous administrations, the vigor and dedication dimensions have produced reliability coefficients ranging from .60 to .88 and from .75 to .90, respectively. The vigor dimension consists of 6 items such as “At my work, I feel bursting with energy” (α = .85, <italic>M</italic> = 21.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.18), whereas the dedication dimension includes 5 items like “My job inspires me” (α = .89, <italic>M</italic> = 18.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.06).</p>
<p>Due to historically high correlations between the factors (ranging in a recent study from .83 to .97), researchers have recommended treating the scale as unidimensional when the focus of the research is work engagement in general— stating that “the high correlations between the three factors indicate substantial overlap between them, and thus restrict their use as separate dimensions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021943612446751">Seppälä et al., 2009</xref>, p. 476). A principal components factor analysis with oblimin rotation indicated that this was the case with the current data. Only one factor was extracted in the analysis (Kaiser’s Measure of Sampling Adequacy = .90, Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity = 922.77; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.), indicating that the two dimensions collapsed into a single factor with an eigenvalue of 6.38 that accounted for 58.04% of the total variance. All 11 items loaded on this dimension, with factor loadings ranging from .60 to .84. Thus, the dedication and vigor dimensions of the scale were combined into a single variable by summing all 11 items. When dimensions have been combined in previous administrations, reliability coefficients have ranged from .85 to .92. In this case, the overall measure of work engagement produced a coefficient alpha of .93 (<italic>M</italic> = 40.31, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.89).</p>
<p>To assess intention to leave we adopted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021943612446751">Singh’s (2000)</xref> three-item measure. The unidimensional scale measures the degree to which people have considered leaving their current position using items like “I often think of quitting.” It has performed reliably in past administrations with coefficients ranging from .87 to .94. We administered the measure using a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranged from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (1) to <italic>strongly agree</italic> (5). The measure produced a coefficient alpha of .91 (<italic>M</italic> = 7.35, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.47).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To determine which types of dissent expression associated with work engagement (Hypothesis 1) and intention to leave (Hypothesis 2) we used two forced-entry multiple regressions. For each multiple regression, the three forms of dissent expression (upward, lateral, and displaced) served as independent variables. In the first multiple regression, work engagement was the dependent variable, whereas in the second, intention to leave was the dependent variable. Because there was a statistically significant correlation between lateral and displaced dissent (<italic>r</italic> = .30), regression analysis, whereby displaced dissent was regressed against lateral dissent, was conducted to produce a residual for lateral dissent that eliminated the multicolinearity between independent variables. The residual of latent dissent was used in the subsequent multiple regression analyses. Correlations between all variables of interest appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021943612446751">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>To explore whether organizational status/role affected the relationship between the variables of interest (Research Question 1), we collapsed the aforementioned categories respondents used to differentiate their organizational role. Top management and management were combined to form a management classification (<italic>n</italic> = 37), and nonmanagement and other were combined to create a nonmanagement category (<italic>n</italic> = 93). Then the management and nonmanagement classifications were compared with one another for both work engagement and intention to leave using two-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests of independent means. There were significant differences in levels of work engagement reported by management and nonmanagement employees, <italic>t</italic>(128) = −2.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, with managers reporting higher levels of work engagement (<italic>M</italic> = 43.22) than their nonmanagement counterparts (<italic>M</italic> = 39.00). However, there were no apparent differences between managers and nonmanagers with regard to intention to leave, <italic>t</italic>(134) = −.28, <italic>p</italic> = .78. To better understand if the significant difference in work engagement would affect how employees chose to express dissent, the forced-entry multiple regression for work engagement was rerun using just management employees in one analysis and just nonmanagement employees in a second analysis.</p>

<p>The first hypothesis suggested that dissent expression would relate to work engagement. Multiple regression analysis revealed that two independent variables accounted for 36% of the overall variance in work engagement, <italic>F</italic>(3, 115) = 20.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Upward dissent (β = .41, <italic>t</italic> = 5.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and lateral dissent (β = −.43, <italic>t</italic> = −5.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) emerged as significant predictors of work engagement. These findings suggest that the presence of upward dissent and the absence of lateral dissent predict work engagement.</p>
<p>The second hypothesis indicated that dissent expression would relate to intention to leave. Multiple regression analysis indicated that two independent variables accounted for 14% of the overall variance in intention to leave, <italic>F</italic>(3, 118) = 6.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

<p>The research question speculated about whether differences in organizational status/role would affect the association between work engagement and dissent expression. Multiple regression analysis revealed that different patterns did in fact emerge regarding dissent expression for managers and nonmanagers. For managers, only lateral dissent associated with work engagement, accounting for 34% of the overall variance, <italic>F</italic>(3, 31) = 5.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; β = −.50, <italic>t</italic> = −3.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. For nonmanagers, both upward dissent and lateral dissent produced significant associations with work engagement accounting for 29% of the overall variance, <italic>F</italic>(3, 76) = 10.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, with the use of upward dissent being a stronger predictor of work engagement (β = .46, <italic>t</italic> = 4.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) than the avoidance of lateral dissent (β = −.40, <italic>t</italic> = −4.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). These additional analyses qualify the overall findings, indicating that patterns revealed regarding dissent expression and work engagement hold for nonmanagers but not necessarily for managers. Instead, work engagement appears to relate communicatively to a strong tendency for managers primarily to avoid lateral dissent. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021943612446751">Table 3</xref> presents the multiple regression analyses comparing managers and nonmanagers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We can draw several conclusions from the current work. First, dissent expression is a communicative indicator of work engagement and intention to leave. In the case of work engagement, dissent expression is a particularly robust indicator as it accounted for notable amounts of variance. Second, dissent directed to nonmanagement audiences (i.e., coworkers or family and friends outside of work) indicates when employees are giving consideration to leaving their current organizations. Clearly, other factors are at work in determining intention to leave as dissent expression accounted for only a modest proportion of the variance. Yet the findings are revelatory as they suggest that dissent expression, particularly dissent directed away from supervisors, may serve as a beacon to management regarding the likelihood of employee turnover. In contrast, the expression of upward dissent and the avoidance of lateral dissent appear to signal work engagement. This finding implies that organizations that foster upward dissent may very well benefit by having more engaged employees. This is not unexpected given the unmistakable relationship that exists between upward dissent and organizational climates open to employee voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446751">2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021943612446751">2008</xref>) or the established relationships between upward dissent and employee satisfaction, organizational commitment, and employee identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446751">2000a</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple regression analysis revealed that different patterns did in fact emerge regarding dissent expression for managers and nonmanagers.</p>
<p>Of particular note here though is the finding that the expression of upward dissent as an indication of work engagement washed out for management employees. Instead, it appears that work engagement for managers equates heavily with avoiding the expression of lateral dissent. This perhaps reflects the ongoing prevalence and continued entrenchment of the “go along to get along” mode of operation Charles Redding challenged a quarter century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021943612446751">Redding, 1985</xref>). That is, for members of the managerial ranks, holding one’s tongue and not criticizing the company remain hallmarks of loyalty. This is somewhat troubling given the move to make workplaces more participatory and democratic for rank-and-file employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021943612446751">Carroll &amp; Arneson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021943612446751">Cheney, 1995</xref>) and reflects one of many paradoxes found in such efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021943612446751">Stohl &amp; Cheney, 2001</xref>). Paradoxically, highly engaged managers may neglect dissent as a viable communication choice for themselves while soliciting it from subordinates. Unfortunately for managers, dissent—even in democratically structured workplaces—may still conflate with disloyalty despite eloquent arguments to the contrary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021943612446751">Vandekerckhove &amp; Commers, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the current findings combine with previous results to demonstrate how dissent expression appears to be a useful, communicative indicator of work engagement and employee burnout. In this work, both upward and lateral dissent related to work engagement. Apparently, upward dissent indicates greater levels of work engagement, whereas lateral dissent associates with waning levels of work engagement. Another recent study found that upward dissent diminished and lateral dissent essentially was absent when employees reported high levels of burnout, particularly exhaustion and depersonalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446751">Avtgis et al., 2007</xref>). Across these findings, dissent expression plots a specific trajectory for interpreting where employees reside with regard to work engagement and burnout. Nonmanagement employees who are engaged express upward dissent, whereas those who are less engaged look to lateral dissent. Lateral dissent, in turn, diminishes as employees slip from low levels of engagement to actually experiencing burnout.</p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, this work brings into focus a potentially valuable facet of dissent expression in the contemporary workplace. Past research has emphasized what can be gained from hearing organizational dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021943612446751">Hegstrom, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446751">Kassing, 1997</xref>). This work highlights what can be signaled or detected when dissent occurs. The findings suggest that monitoring dissent can help an organization estimate how engaged and likely to stay employees are or how disconnected and likely to leave they may be. Monitoring organizational dissent, then, stands to inform organizational leaders about the energy and dedication of their workforce as well as the likelihood that they will remain with the company.</p>
<p>But the findings present an interesting caveat that organizational leaders should consider as well. That is, how do managerial personnel practice dissent? Is it shared openly with others in the managerial ranks or muted? In this study, engagement plays out for managers as the relative absence of upward dissent and an avoidance of lateral dissent. In essence, it equates to showing overall restraint with regard to dissent expression. However, this practice results in the forfeiture of valuable critical feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021943612446751">Hegstrom, 1995</xref>), the very kind of feedback that engaged subordinates often are expected and implored to provide. Which gives rise to the question: Will engaged subordinates continue to dissent when they do not see the value of doing so behaviorally modeled or regularly confirmed at higher levels of the organization? Future research should explore the actual causes of managerial restraint (vs. the speculation offered above) as well as the impact it may have on how lower ranking employees express dissent. It would be interesting and worthwhile to see how employees confront the paradox of expressing dissent to managers who in turn do not choose to share dissent themselves.</p>
<p>Monitoring organizational dissent, then, stands to inform organizational leaders about the energy and dedication of their workforce as well as the likelihood that they will remain with the company.</p>
<p>As with all research, this work is not without limitations. It relies on a limited range of variables to test the relationships being examined. The variance accounted for in the current results suggests that other variables are at play with regard to work engagement and intention to leave. It would be worthwhile to consider how dissent expression compares with other constructs in relative terms. This design, then, could be expanded on in future research by incorporating a greater representation of variables that predict work engagement and intention to leave. At the same time, a larger sample than the comparatively modest one used here could be solicited. Additionally, this work relies on a convenience sample. This shortcoming limits the ability to generalize the findings to other work settings, particularly given possible industry, organizational, or cultural differences that a larger random sample may have addressed.</p>
<p>In spite of these limitations, there are two clear communication patterns revealed across these data. Work engagement is at least for nonmanagement employees a function of dissent expressed to management, whereas intention to leave is a function of dissent expressed to audiences other than management. Taken together, these findings present important considerations for management with regard to facilitating and hearing employee voice. Simply put, companies that are better equipped to foster employee dissent can expect to have employees who are more engaged at work and less inclined to leave. Attending to work engagement and intention to leave are critical as they represent powerful indicators of employee wellness with obvious links to employee burnout and commitment. They are clearly relevant to overall organizational health too as higher levels of turnover tax human resource systems and impede efforts to keep well-trained employees. This work adds to our growing understanding of dissent expression and the apparent role it plays regarding work engagement and intention to leave. In so doing, the work reminds us that dissent can be beneficial for employees and organizations alike.</p>
