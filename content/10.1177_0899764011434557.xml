<abstract>
<p>Management problems are prevalent within ad hoc networks of public and nonprofit organizations that engage in disaster relief. This study explores the enabling factors that have an impact on the performance of public-nonprofit networks during disaster response and outcome factors that are influenced by the network performance. A survey is conducted among 288 disaster managers and analyzed by Partial Least Squares (PLS). The analysis reveals that a general openness to collaborate, collaboration experience, mutuality, and coordination have a strong impact on the performance of public-nonprofit networks. The network performance highly influences the long-term outcomes of a disaster response. The whole network of organizations can be strengthened and single organizations can acquire new knowledge. The results of this study help to derive implications for the management of public and nonprofit organizations active in disaster management operations.</p>

<p>Researchers and practitioners alike have highlighted a number of management problems that occur during disaster response operations, most of which can be attributed to joint disaster management activities of public and nonprofit organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011434557">Comfort, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011434557">Kapucu, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764011434557">Kapucu, Augustin, &amp; Garayev, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764011434557">Kettl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764011434557">Morris, Morris, &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0899764011434557">Smith &amp; Dowell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0899764011434557">Waugh &amp; Streib, 2006</xref>). These organizations are brought together under extreme circumstances and expected to perform well ad hoc, even though they might have little experience in doing so. As disasters occur without warning and often surprisingly there is no time for long negotiations or prearrangements for the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764011434557">Moynihan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0899764011434557">Waugh &amp; Streib, 2006</xref>). Resulting problems can be a lack of coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0899764011434557">Smith &amp; Dowell, 2000</xref>), information exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764011434557">Huxam &amp; Vangen, 1996</xref>) and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011434557">Kapucu, 2006a</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, isolated results on the management of such ad hoc networks between public and nonprofit organizations can be derived from the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764011434557">Gazley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011434557">Kapucu, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0899764011434557">Mitchell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0899764011434557">Shaw, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764011434557">Stephenson, 2005</xref>). Researchers have highlighted the importance of analyzing enabling factors such as communication, coordination, and mutuality for public-nonprofit networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764011434557">Brinkerhoff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011434557">Comfort, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011434557">Gazley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764011434557">Prizzia, 2008</xref>). However, while several authors have identified more than one enabling factor for the management of public-nonprofit networks, there is no published study that captures a complete list of factors relevant for the management of ad hoc networks.</p>
<p>Less research than on network enablers has focused on the result side of public-nonprofit networks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764011434557">Babiak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764011434557">Moynihan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764011434557">Provan &amp; Milward, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0899764011434557">Simo &amp; Bies, 2007</xref>) and further insights into the performance and outcomes of public-nonprofit networks are needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764011434557">Milward &amp; Provan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764011434557">Provan, Fish, &amp; Sydow, 2007</xref>). Studies that empirically assess networks as a whole usually address networks within the health or public services sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764011434557">Provan et al., 2007</xref>); but lack insights into the special nature of disaster networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764011434557">Provan &amp; Milward 1995</xref>). Analysing disaster networks as a whole can help to understand how services can be delivered more efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764011434557">Provan et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764011434557">Provan &amp; Milward (2001)</xref> defined a range of effectiveness criteria for the long-term evaluation of public-sector organizational networks. To this point, research findings on network enablers and network results have not been combined and there is a lack of conceptual frameworks that allow a comprehensive analysis of public and nonprofit organizations engaged in ad hoc networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011434557">Lister, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>We contribute to the above described research gaps in three ways. First, we identify the main factors that do have an influence on public-nonprofit network performance during disasters. Second, we offer measures to assess public-nonprofit network performance in the short-run and factors to evaluate long-term outcomes. Third, we link the identified factors in a process model and analyze possible causal effects between network enablers, network performance, and network outcomes.</p>
<p>This article is organized as follows. We briefly discuss theoretical foundations and the characteristics specific to public-nonprofit networks during disasters. Then, building on a conceptual framework, we develop eight hypotheses for the management of ad hoc networks. Next, the hypotheses are investigated by means of an empirical study among public and nonprofit organizations that were active in the response to the Haiti earthquake in January 2010. The article will conclude with managerial implications and future areas of research.</p>
<sec id="section1-0899764011434557">
<title>Theoretical Foundations and Characteristics of Public-Nonprofit Networks During Disasters</title>
<p>In the literature, the terms collaboration, network, and partnership are commonly used to describe the working together of public and nonprofit organizations in disaster response operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011434557">Kapucu, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0899764011434557">Simo &amp; Bies, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0899764011434557">Waugh &amp; Streib, 2006</xref>). We will use the term public-nonprofit network with respect to multiple organizations from the public and nonprofit sector working together to pursue shared goals. Organizations engaged in disaster response networks experience different levels of integration but most practitioners referred to their joint activities as ‘collaboration’. Even though some activities within the analysed disaster networks would be considered ‘coordination’ or ‘cooperation’ by researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764011434557">Keast, Brown, &amp; Mandell, 2007</xref>), we will refer to collaborative activities, including all levels of integration.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0899764011434557">Park (1996)</xref> developed a ‘theory of interorganizational networks’ and characterized networks as a flexible and reciprocal intermediate form of governance, which make it easier, faster, and less costly to approach resources under certain environment conditions such as uncertainty, information constraints, and complexity. Most of these environmental conditions apply to the context of public-nonprofit networks during disasters. Uncertainty is a prevalent factor during disasters because public and nonprofit organizations cannot easily predict future events, especially in the first phase of a disaster response. Information constraints add to uncertainty, as communication infrastructures might be damaged and information is disseminated slower than under normal conditions. Thus, the flow of information between different organizations is hindered and organizations are forced to make fast decisions under strict information constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764011434557">Prizzia, 2008</xref>). Complexity is another factor that calls for networks during the disaster environment, rather than market or hierarchy. Disasters mark a turbulent situation that requires flexible decision making and complex tasks need to be carried out under strict time constraints. All these environment factors indicate that networks can be considered an adequate structure to respond to disasters.</p>
<p>Different groups of actors usually engage in joint activities within a disaster response network: Public international organizations such as the United Nations or State Departments, international nonprofit organizations (e.g., ICRC, World Vision), and the local public and nonprofit community. The mix of these players is dependent on the nature of the disaster. In the case of Haiti, the country relied on international help to an extensive degree. Different networks existed during the Haiti earthquake response, the largest being the network of different aid clusters coordinated by the UN.</p>

<sec id="section2-0899764011434557">
<title>A Process Model for Public-Nonprofit Networks</title>
<p>We develop a model that differentiates three process steps of the network engagement to capture network activities of public and nonprofit organizations during a disaster (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0899764011434557">Figure 1</xref>). First, network enablers that affect the relationship management and that enable the formation, maintenance, and the development of public-nonprofit networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764011434557">Austin, 2000</xref>) are regarded. Second, the network output that directly results from the collaborative activities is described. This output encompasses measures that can be used to assess the performance of the disaster response by the networking organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764011434557">Kemshall &amp; Ross, 2000</xref>). Network outcomes that refer to the long-term effects of network actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764011434557">Provan &amp; Milward, 2001</xref>) build the last step of our process model.</p>

<title>The Effect of Network Enablers on Network Output</title>
<p>According to exchange theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764011434557">Levine &amp; White, 1962</xref>), organizations that follow common goals and that do not have sufficient resources to reach its goals independently, voluntarily interact with other organizations. Communication is one measure of interaction that is often highlighted by authors who address management problems during the collaborative disaster management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764011434557">Cigler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764011434557">Huxam &amp; Vangen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011434557">Kapucu, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764011434557">Kapucu, 2006b</xref>). A sufficient level of information exchange between partners within the disaster response network is necessary to create an understanding of constraints on each actor and possible combinations of collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011434557">Comfort, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0899764011434557">Rulke &amp; Galaskiewicz, 2000</xref>). Informed partners can better act and react to other organizations’ actions, therefore organizations should communicate their plans and actions timely and truthfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764011434557">Kapucu, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764011434557">Prizzia, 2008</xref>). A lack of communication can lead to a waste of resources as the same task might be carried out by more than one organization and organizations might have to adapt their behavior repeatedly after learning about the other organization’s actions. Communication becomes a major challenge when size and scope of the disaster increase and heterogeneous organizations from different sectors and cultural backgrounds engage in the aid network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011434557">Comfort, 2007</xref>). A first hypothesis is suggested:</p>
<list id="list1-0899764011434557" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (H1)</italic>: A good communication among members of the public-nonprofit network is positively related to perceived network performance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Exchange theory also refers to coordination, a second factor relevant to enable an effective disaster response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011434557">Comfort, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764011434557">Kettl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764011434557">Stephenson, 2005</xref>). Responsibilities of the different organizations engaged in disaster response activities are often not well defined and lead to a lack in coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0899764011434557">Smith &amp; Dowell, 2000</xref>). Coordination in the area of disaster aid is difficult as organizations that compete for donations might be hesitant to coordinate tasks and to share resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0899764011434557">Palm &amp; Ramsell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764011434557">Stephenson, 2005</xref>). The complexity of heterogeneous organizations involved in the disaster response also complicates coordination if organizations have a poor understanding of other organization’s roles and responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764011434557">Stephenson, 2005</xref>). Problems resulting from a lack of coordination can either be technical, e.g. if partners use radios with different frequencies or manage technologies too centralized, making them vulnerable for sudden disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764011434557">Kettl, 2003</xref>), or bureaucratic, when different organizations try to maintain their authority and there is no clear line of command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764011434557">Prizzia, 2008</xref>). To address coordination problems, researchers have suggested giving control power to the UN mechanisms, but this suggestion remains controversial among different organizations engaged in disaster response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764011434557">Stephenson, 2005</xref>). We derive the second hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list2-0899764011434557" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (H2)</italic>: Good task coordination among members of the public-nonprofit network is positively related to perceived network performance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Organizations that can equally participate in decision making and that are not dominated by partners experience high degrees of mutuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764011434557">Brinkerhoff, 2002</xref>). According to exchange theory, these organizations perceive mutual benefits from interacting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0899764011434557">Skelcher &amp; Sullivan, 2008</xref>) and are more supportive of each other’s mission, goals and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764011434557">Brinkerhoff, 2002</xref>). Networks with partners who benefit equally from their relationship tend to perform higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764011434557">Kanter, 1994</xref>), but mutuality often seems hard to achieve between different types of organizations. Asymmetries of power between public and nonprofit organizations, as well as between large and small organizations exist, for example, public managers might be reluctant to rely upon nonprofit organizations during disasters as they distrust their intentions or capabilities and fear that volunteer might get into way of professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011434557">Kapucu, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0899764011434557">Waugh, 2000</xref>). This lack of mutuality can hinder the disaster response, thus,</p>
<list id="list3-0899764011434557" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (H3)</italic>: The greater the degree of mutuality among members of the public-nonprofit network, the higher the perceived network performance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Network members follow relational norms to guide its interaction with other members involved in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011434557">Gazley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764011434557">Mandell &amp; Keast, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0899764011434557">Rulke &amp; Galaskiewicz, 2000</xref>). In line with the theory of interorganizational networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0899764011434557">Park, 1996</xref>), networks are based on reciprocity and common relational norms can function as an incentive to partner with each other in a disaster context, where partnerships are usually not formalized by contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011434557">Gazley, 2008</xref>). Organizations with a lot of experience might not trust the abilities of smaller, less-experienced organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011434557">Kapucu, 2006a</xref>) and common norms of information exchange, flexibility, and trust can facilitate the collaboration among different organizations within the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764011434557">Heide &amp; John, 1992</xref>). Whereas partners engaged in long-term networks have time to adjust their norms and thus the effectiveness of the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764011434557">Mandell &amp; Keast, 2008</xref>), ad hoc networks during disasters only have limited time to adjust and develop common norms. The following hypothesis is established:</p>
<list id="list4-0899764011434557" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4 (H4)</italic>: Common relational norms among members of the public-nonprofit network positively affect network performance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A fifth network enabler refers to experience in collaborative activities with the different organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0899764011434557">Shaw, 2003</xref>). Previous relationships are important for the success of the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0899764011434557">Human &amp; Provan 2000</xref>) as experience leads to stronger ties, facilitating exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0899764011434557">Rulke &amp; Galaskiewicz, 2000</xref>). The legitimacy and trustworthiness of partners is often judged through previous experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764011434557">Bryson, Crosby, &amp; Stone, 2006</xref>). On a personal base, experience in working together means that actors of different organizations have met before, are familiar with each other, and have developed a general level of sympathy for each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0899764011434557">Shaw, 2003</xref>). If partners dislike each other, the provision of joint tasks and services of a disaster management network can be affected negatively. Network members might hesitate to contact each other, which would result in a delayed provision of services. Our next hypothesis is</p>
<list id="list5-0899764011434557" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5 (H5)</italic>: More experienced members of the public-nonprofit network report a better network performance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A last enabling factor, supported by exchange theory, is the general openness of an organization and its members to collaborate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764011434557">Austin, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764011434557">Austin (2000)</xref> finds that openness plays an important role, particularly in the area of social purpose collaborations. This also applies to the disaster context as social purposes such as a health, a strengthening of the community, and learning are intended. During the creation stages of the network, organizations that are open to join resources and participate in collaborative activities facilitate interorganizational interactions. An openness to work together and to find ways to fulfill joint tasks more effectively can strengthen the output and outcomes of the disaster response. Public and nonprofit managers might have different perceptions of a collaborative disaster response as external factors such as local community needs or political pressure, as well as prior collaboration experience can affect their level of openness toward collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764011434557">Gazley, 2010</xref>). Our hypothesis is</p>
<list id="list6-0899764011434557" list-type="simple">

<sec id="section4-0899764011434557">
<title>Conceptualization of Network Output</title>
<p>We consider performance measures to define the output of public-nonprofit networks. Funding and policy decisions for public and nonprofit organizations engaged in networks can be made depending on the performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764011434557">Milward &amp; Provan, 1998</xref>). While approaches to evaluate single organization performance employ organizational indicators such as goal accomplishment or performing trend analyses, networks require models that encompass performance criteria for multiple organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0899764011434557">Siegel, Clayton, &amp; Kovoor, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764011434557">Provan and Milward (1995)</xref> develop a theory of network effectiveness and find that network performance is usually highest when a system is stable and resources are munificent. In the specific context of disasters, system stability is usually low and resources are limited. Therefore, different performance criteria apply to measure the network performance in a disaster context. Networks in a disaster setting are expected to function ad hoc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764011434557">Cigler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764011434557">Comfort, Ko, &amp; Zagorecki, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0899764011434557">Stallings, 2006</xref>) and goods and services used for disaster relief have to be delivered and carried out quickly, as people’s lives and properties are threatened. Networks can help to provide goods and services timely by exchanging or combining resources. The combination of resources can also help different organizations to reach the affected regions fast, as planes or other transportation vehicles can be shared.</p>
<p>Aid does not only have to be provided timely, but also in a certain quality. The period of disaster response and recovery might last several weeks and months, thus goods and services should be appropriate to achieve a sustained improvement of the affected community. It is important to treat injured persons efficiently to prevent them from later infections and to avoid repeated treatments. Provisional infrastructural services also need to be carried out in a good quality to prevent them from being damaged by future natural disasters. We conclude that network performance can be measured by regarding measures for time and quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764011434557">Cigler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764011434557">Kemshall &amp; Ross, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>The Effect of Network Output on Network Outcomes</title>
<p>The achieved network output can be considered a determinant of long-term network outcomes. Community, network, and organization actor levels of analysis can be distinguished when evaluating network outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764011434557">Mandell &amp; Keast, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764011434557">Provan &amp; Milward, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764011434557">Provan &amp; Milward, 2001</xref>). We analyze network and organization actor outcomes by surveying relief workers active during the Haiti earthquake response. Since our focus is on management implications for public and nonprofit organizations and for network management in general, a survey of the community and community related implications were omitted in this study.</p>
<p>When evaluating public-nonprofit network outcomes, an exclusive focus on single organizations is insufficient as network effects are neglected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0899764011434557">Sydow &amp; Windeler, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764011434557">Provan and Milward (1995)</xref> propose a theory of interorganizational network effectiveness and highlight the particular importance of network outcomes in networks involving public and nonprofit organizations. An evaluation of network outcomes is more complex than measuring the outcomes for a single organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764011434557">Provan &amp; Milward, 2001</xref>) and needs to capture the specifics of interorganizational relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0899764011434557">Siegel et al., 1990</xref>). In this context, nonfinancial and intangible outcomes should be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764011434557">Provan &amp; Milward, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0899764011434557">Sydow &amp; Windeler, 1998</xref>). Network growth can be one aspect of network outcomes, as more agencies might be attracted to a well functioning network. An enhanced strength of the network and an absence of service duplication can be other aspects. Our next hypothesis is</p>

<p>Considering the individual organization’s perspective is also important when studying disaster network outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764011434557">Provan et al., 2007</xref>). Even though organizations act within a network, each organization still has its own organizational identity and pursues organization-specific goals. An engagement in public-nonprofit networks can benefit the single organizational actors and lead to specific organizational outcomes. For example, a good network performance can have a positive effect on single organizations as its legitimacy among funders or the community can be enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764011434557">Provan &amp; Milward, 2001</xref>). Additionally, organizations can gain knowledge and acquire resources that can be used for the single organization in the future by cooperating and performing with other network partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764011434557">Babiak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764011434557">Gazley &amp; Brudney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764011434557">Provan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764011434557">Provan &amp; Milward, 2001</xref>).

<title>Empirical Study</title>
<sec id="section7-0899764011434557">
<title>Data Collection and Scales</title>
<p>To test the above developed hypotheses, an online survey that followed the research model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0899764011434557">Figure 1</xref> was designed and its items were tested among 24 disaster management graduate students in Germany. In autumn 2010, a personalized e-mail invitation to participate was sent to 1,387 members of more than 500 public and nonprofit organizations who were involved in the Haiti earthquake response and attended UN cluster meetings in Haiti. This sample is non-independent, as more than one respondent per organization was surveyed. Nevertheless, surveying only one person per organization might be misleading, as one organization is not conterminous with one network, but with several networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764011434557">Milward &amp; Provan, 1998</xref>). While one person of the organization might have been in charge of the cluster for health provision, another person of the same organization might have been an expert regarding food distribution.</p>
<p>To enhance the participation in this study, the survey was conducted anonymously and each participant was given the possibility to receive the results of the study. In December 2010, a reminder to participate in the survey was sent to all the contacts. In total, 1,214 members of public or nonprofit organizations active during the Haiti earthquake response could be reached, the remaining contact e-mails were either misspelled or not in use anymore. 288 members of organizations active in Haiti participated in the online survey, which equals a response rate of 23.7%. The survey was conducted in English and online only; therefore, members of organizations who were not fluent in English and members who did not have access to the internet could not respond. Potential nonresponse bias was checked by using an extrapolation method and comparing the first wave of respondents to respondents that filled out the survey after receiving the reminder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764011434557">Armstrong &amp; Overton, 1977</xref>). No significant difference was found in any of the constructs used in the research model.</p>
<p>We adapted accepted scales to measure the latent constructs in our research model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764011434557">Fang, Palmatier, &amp; Scheer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764011434557">Heide &amp; John, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764011434557">Kemshall &amp; Ross, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0899764011434557">Thomson, Perry, &amp; Miller, 2008</xref>) or derived indicators from the existing literature on networks in disaster management (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011434557">Gazley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011434557">Kapucu, 2006a</xref>). New scales were developed for the openness to collaborate and network performance. These scales were derived from interviews with disaster managers who were active in Haiti. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0899764011434557">Appendix A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0899764011434557">B</xref> illustrate the measurement scales used in this study.

<title>Sample Characteristics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0899764011434557">Table 1</xref> provides the sample characteristics of our study. The descriptive statistics show that more men than women answered our survey. This reflects the original composition of men and women in our contact list. The majority of respondents worked for a nonprofit organization during the Haiti earthquake response (69.7%) while 23.6% worked for a public organization. The remaining respondents were either volunteer who usually work for a private organization or worked for an international organization; leaving open if this was public or nonprofit. The majority of the surveyed individuals worked for international nonprofits (66.4%) and international public organizations (25.9%), only a small amount worked for local nonprofits (5.6%) and local public organizations (2.1%). Thus, the share of locally organized organizations participating in the UN cluster meetings was very low. The large share of international organizations involved in disaster relief is particular to the case of Haiti. The country and its capital were severely destroyed by the earthquake, intensifying the need for international help. Almost half of the respondents worked for a large organization with more than 249 employees. Most surveyed members of the Haiti relief network were in an executive position within their organization during the earthquake response (63.8%). Among the other respondents, several stated they were active as program managers, information managers, or consultants, thus also being in an executive position. The respondents have a mean experience of almost nine years in the area of disaster management and worked in a disaster setting about nine times. This leads to the conclusion that the majority of respondents could compare their disaster response in Haiti to former disasters and assess the networks performance as compared to other performances, giving a reliable impression of network performance in Haiti.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to test the above developed propositions. Both formative and reflective constructs were used in our model and observations were nonindependent. Additionally, the observations for network enablers were not normally distributed. Therefore we chose the variance based approach Partial Least Squares (PLS) and estimated the model with the software application SmartPLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0899764011434557">Chin &amp; Newsted, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0899764011434557">Ringle, Wende, &amp; Will, 2005</xref>). To ensure content validity all constructs and scales were derived from the literature and from interviews with disaster management experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764011434557">Rossiter, 2002</xref>). We deleted 41 cases from our sample that did not answer any of the scales of our research model. We then applied the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to address the remaining missing values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764011434557">Dempster, Laird, &amp; Rubin, 1977</xref>). The research model shows six exogenous latent variables that measure network enablers, one latent endogenous variable to express the network output, and two to address network outcomes. The direction of causality from manifest variables to the latent ones was tested according to the decision rules developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764011434557">Jarvis, MacKenzie, and Podsakoff (2003)</xref>.</p>

<title>Assessment of the Measurement Model</title>
<p>In a first step, the measurement model that reflects the relationship between each construct and its indicators was analyzed. The formative constructs were tested by measuring the outer weights, <italic>t</italic>-values, and variance inflation factors (VIFs) of each indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764011434557">Chin, 1998</xref>). The weights of each item and <italic>t</italic>-values are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011434557">Table 2</xref>. It shows that the majority of formative constructs have weights higher than .1. Three indicators on the network enabler side and one indicator on the outcome side show negative weights. Three of these negative indicators have insignificant <italic>t</italic>-values; only one indicator stating that problems during the collaboration were treated as joint responsibilities shows a significant negative effect on the enabling factor mutuality. The indicators were then tested for multicollinearity, yielding VIF values below the critical value of 10. This indicates that there is no critical level of multicollinearity and all indicators remain in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764011434557">Diamantopoulos &amp; Winklhofer, 2001</xref>).</p>

Two indices were used to evaluate construct reliability: Composite reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0899764011434557">Werts, Linn, &amp; Jöreskog, 1974</xref>) and average variance extracted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764011434557">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>). Composite reliability values exceed the threshold value of .7 for both constructs, with .91 (relationship norms) and .95 (network performance) and the average variance extracted (AVE) is above the critical value of 50% for both reflective constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764011434557">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>). Discriminant validity was tested by applying the criterion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764011434557">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</xref>. The constructs share more variance with its assigned indicators than with the other latent variables; therefore, discriminant validity is confirmed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0899764011434557">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>In our first hypothesis we state that a high degree of communication within public-nonprofit networks has a positive effect on the network performance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0899764011434557">Table 4</xref> shows a path coefficient of –.01 and a <italic>t</italic>-value of .11 which is not statistically significant, thus H1 is not confirmed by the data. This is surprising, as communication is highlighted as one of the main network enablers in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764011434557">Huxam &amp; Vangen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764011434557">Prizzia, 2008</xref>). A possible explanation is that organizations that are brought together in ad hoc networks have no choice but to communicate and share information, especially in a disaster setting like Haiti, where much of the infrastructure broke down. Whether the communication is good or not does not have an impact on the actual performance though. Our second hypothesis is that a high degree of task coordination does have a positive impact on network performance. H2 is confirmed, with a path coefficient of .18 and a <italic>t</italic>-value of 2.25 which is significant at the 95% level (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). A good coordination of tasks and available resources and the sharing of these resources with other organizations enhance the performance of the network. In a disaster setting like the Haiti earthquake, good coordination can help to overcome technical and bureaucratic barriers. Task coordination can substitute for organizations with central power to control the network. The data also support our third hypothesis, stating that a high degree of mutuality among public-nonprofit networks has a positive effect on network performance. With a path coefficient of .29 and a <italic>t</italic>-value of 3.88 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) we find strong empirical support for H3. A mutual commitment to the goals of the whole network facilitates the collaboration and makes agreements on tasks and resources among different organizations easier. Networks engaged in disaster response are composed of different types of actors from different sectors and regions. The high significance of mutuality underlines the need for an equal treatment of distinct organizations within the network. The fourth hypothesis states that common relational among network members positively affect network performance. The path coefficient between relational norms and network performance is .03; the <italic>t</italic>-value is .28. These data do not confirm H4. This finding is supported in the literature, where statistically significant impacts of mutuality on collaboration outcomes and nonsignificant outcomes of trust were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0899764011434557">Thomson et al., 2008</xref>). In the evaluated disaster context, trust, as one component of relational norms, has no impact on the actual performance of the network. We find that our fifth hypothesis that suggests a positive relationship between the collaboration experience of public and nonprofit organizations within a network and the performance of the network is supported by the data. Previous experience in working together with other organizations in the network and sympathy towards other organizations can help to overcome the hasty formation of disaster networks. Members of organizations that met before can work together more efficiently and reach a better performance than inexperienced organizations. With a path coefficient of .18 and a <italic>t</italic>-value of 1.98 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) H5 is therefore confirmed.</p>
<p>A last hypothesis concerning the effect of network enablers on network performance was that a high degree of openness of organizations within public-nonprofit networks has a positive effect on network performance. H6 is also confirmed, with a path coefficient of .20 and a <italic>t</italic>-value of 2.37 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Therefore, organizations that are open towards collaborations with other organizations and join resources during the disaster response can achieve a better network performance.</p>
<p>The data highly support the hypotheses that cover the relationship between network performance and network outcomes. A strong, positive effect of network performance on network outcomes is measured, confirming H7 with a path coefficient of .59 and a <italic>t</italic>-value of 10.58 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Networks that experience a good performance are more likely to attract further members and to strengthen the relationship with existing members. It is important to note that a high number of organizations involved in one network response does not necessary mean that tasks will be fulfilled better. If the number and variety of groups within the networks becomes too large, negative effects such as hindered decision making can be the result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764011434557">Faerman, McCaffrey, &amp; Van Slyke, 2001</xref>). The network performance does also affect the organization actor outcome positively, as suggested by the eighth hypothesis. The path coefficient is .59 and the <italic>t</italic>-value 10.39 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); therefore, H8 is confirmed. The successful engagement in disaster response networks reflects on the individual organization level as organizations can apply best practices and gain new knowledge from other organizations involved in the disaster response. Public and nonprofit organizations heavily rely on policy makers and funders. A good network performance can improve a single organization’s legitimacy in the eyes of different stakeholders.</p>
<p>The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values show the construct variance that is explained by our developed model. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764011434557">Chin (1998)</xref> considers values of .19, .33 or .67 as weak, moderate or substantial, respectively. The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of network performance, the latent endogenous variable we try to explain by network enablers, is .494. Thus, the model explains 49.4% of the performance of networking organizations during the disaster response. The percentages of explained variance for the network outcomes are 35.3% for network outcome and 34.9% for organization actor outcome, respectively. These results show that network enablers are appropriate to measure network performance, as a substantial effect can be identified. Additionally, a moderate effect of network performance on the two outcome levels network outcome and organization actor outcome is confirmed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section13-0899764011434557">
<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>This study contributes to our understanding of public-nonprofit performance in ad hoc disaster networks. Using data from 288 disaster respondents who were active during the Haiti earthquake in January 2010 we assessed causal relationships between network enablers, network performance, and network outcomes in ad hoc networks. We derived a list of six enabling factors relevant for the collaborative disaster response from the literature and combined the process steps of the disaster response, analyzing the effect of these network enablers on perceived network performance and the effect of network performance on network outcomes.</p>
<p>Our analysis of enabling factors reveals that good task coordination within a network, a high degree of mutuality among organizations active in the disaster response and the extent of collaboration experience among networking organizations have a strong effect on the performance of the network as a whole. Organizations that have worked together before and that know the individuals active in the disaster response have a better understanding of the mechanisms and resources of the other organizations. Finally, the openness of an organization to collaborate affects the performance of the disaster response. In the dynamic environment of disasters, a certain level of openness can facilitate operations such as the sharing of resources between different types of organizations.</p>
<p>Our results further advance the understanding of network performance during disasters and of long-term outcomes resulting from disaster networks. The network of organizations is strongly affected by a timely and highly qualitative disaster response. If a good performance can be achieved, organizations are more likely to keep their network up and work together in the future. A good performance also helps the coordination of tasks and services. By working together organizations can specialize on the services they fulfill best and benefit from the specialization in other areas of the networking organizations. The single organization actors are also affected by the performance of disaster response operations. A good disaster performance can help single organizations to acquire knowledge. Through the network single organizations can see and learn from other organizations and apply this knowledge to their own organization. Additionally, a single organization can achieve a risen legitimacy in the eyes of the community and funders if a good network performance is reported. By combining resources it is also possible to decrease the cost of the service provision for a single organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0899764011434557">
<title>Management Implications</title>
<p>Several management implications result from this study. A good coordination of the network significantly affects the disaster management performance. To improve coordination, organizations need to be aware of their needs and coordinate with those organizations that can fulfill their needs. The degree of mutuality of an organization should also be high to enable a good disaster performance. Mutuality can be fostered by pursuing the same goals as the other organizations active in the disaster response. Mutuality should also be existent in the case of decision making. Organizations that engage in joint activities should equally participate in decisions regarding the joint projects, not distinguishing between public and nonprofit organizations. Additionally, the collaboration experience of an organization engaging in joint disaster response operations has an effect on the network output. To enhance the collaboration experience of an organization, special measures such as workshops among organizations from the same area can take place in preparation for a disaster. Another possibility is to join with other organizations and engage in predefined networks of organizations active in the disaster response before a disaster takes place. Finally, the openness to collaborate should be high. The openness of an organization to collaborate can be enhanced by engaging in collaborative meetings or responding to requests of other organization. The CEO/president and executive managers of an organization can demonstrate openness to collaborate by working together with other organizations and voluntarily engaging in collaborative activities. Instead of spending time on the development of contracts organizations can work together and use other mechanisms, such as personal networks, to facilitate the collaborative activities. On the outcome side, network outcomes that result from the network performance during the disaster response affect the network as a whole and the single organization. Organizations should be aware of these effects and include special measures to enhance the outcomes. Long-term network outcomes do not only have an effect on the current disaster response and recovery, but can be used for future disaster responses as well. Organizations that experienced a good network performance during one disaster can form alliances or use common information channels in order to work together during a future disaster. Single organizations should also conserve the gained knowledge from the networked disaster response and establish mechanisms to conserve and spread knowledge from one disaster and one group of organization members to future disasters and other members of the organization.</p>

<title>Limitations and Further Research</title>
<p>The results of this study are limited to a certain degree. Our survey includes members of public and nonprofit organizations who were active during the Haiti earthquake. While some members reported they had a high experience in disaster response operations, this studies’ questions focused on the Haiti disaster response only. The answers are therefore limited to the description of one disaster case and should be tested in other settings before generalizing the implications of this study. It should be noted that this study only considers public and nonprofit manager’s perceptions of network performance and outcomes. This perspective can be considered a first step in the analysis of ad hoc network performance, but further perspectives such as the affected community or reports that include measurable performance criteria should be considered in the future. A further limiting factor addresses the operationalization of the factors included in the research model. Most of these factors have not been analyzed in an empirical setting and in a disaster context before. Some factors were operationalized according to studies in settings other than disaster management (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764011434557">Brass, Galaskiewicz, Greve, &amp; Tsai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764011434557">Fang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764011434557">Heide &amp; John, 1992</xref>), others were derived from the literature on disaster management and brought into a scale (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011434557">Gazley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011434557">Kapucu, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0899764011434557">Shaw, 2003</xref>). Although the scales indicate reliability and validity to a high degree, more research into the conceptualization of the used factors will be helpful. 288 members of organizations who were involved in the response operations to the Haiti earthquake answered our survey. Self-selection bias might be a problem given that those individuals that experienced a ‘normal’ disaster response had fewer incentives to respond to the survey than those individuals that experienced problems or those that experienced a very good disaster response.</p>
<p>For the future, we suggest two main areas for research. First, the developed model should be tested in different scenarios, such as the response to floods, volcanoes, fires or man-made disasters. Insights into different types of disasters can help to identify different needs for the disaster response. Second, more insights into the structure of the disaster response can be helpful to evaluate network performance in a disaster context. While one main network structure that can be identified in the disaster response is the coordination by the United Nations through cluster meetings, other structures such as the coordination of organizations from one country by the country’s embassy or the predefined agreements among certain groups of organizations can be observed during a disaster response. It remains to be analyzed what kind of structure is the best to achieve a high performance and high outcomes of the disaster response. The extent to which an organization can engage in networks during the disaster response might also depend on the size and resource endowment of each organization. Larger organizations might not experience any problems when attending cluster meetings and engaging in joint network activities while smaller organizations might have to struggle for resources and have less access to network mechanisms due to this lack of resources.</p>
