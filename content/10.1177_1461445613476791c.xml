<p>This volume in the series <italic>Law, Language and Communication</italic> is interdisciplinary research specializing in socio-legal and professional fields. The title <italic>Exploring Courtroom Discourse</italic> is a pertinent reflection of the collection of papers connected via an invisible link – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445613476791">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> face theory. As participant linguistic behaviors are to a great extent a reflection of their social classes, the close relationships between social class and justice cannot be more obvious. From a socio-semiotic perspective, courtroom discourse as judicial signs is representative of and constrained by not only inter-textual relationships, but also the discourse community, society and culture at large. As the editors highlight in the Introduction (p. 2), through the inter-semiotic operation between the daily and individual activities to larger institutional social structures and processes of power and control in courtroom discourse, the theme of ‘Power and Control’ has been explored not only <italic>in</italic> language (Part I) but also <italic>behind</italic> language (Part II).</p>
<p>In Part I, the in-language studies explore the internal structures of courtroom language in relation to specific issues. By examining linguistic features in trial transcripts, interview data and ‘cultural script’, the asymmetric power of language has been exposed. McCaul argues that the linguistic power imbalance of the courtroom can be attributed to the societal power struggle across cultures in Australia. Dettenwanger’s research shows how lawyers and judges interact with different witnesses by using address terms and references, and how such interactions affect jurors’ judgment on credibility within trials. Two chapters focus on transformed legal narratives. Grebler discusses how false confession is induced in interrogation by the police and how the confession is strategically repackaged into a compelling narrative at trial, and Di Donato demonstrates what roles the client and the lawyer play in constructing the legal story and how the client’s ‘naive representation’ of the event is transformed by the lawyer by legal violation. Also in this Part, Cavalieri discusses the functions of textual and interpersonal metadiscourse in the realization of counsels’ argumentative strategies to produce effective questions during witness examination.</p>
<p>The behind-language studies in Part II investigate the general features of courtroom language from the broader perspectives of language, legal communication, law, society and culture. Corcos discusses to what extent comparisons can be made between the lawyer and the magician, the courtroom and the stage, magic words and magic acts by making law and magic analogies. The influences of social and cultural conventions on legal language have been demonstrated through studies on the linguistic practices of the ‘reasonable man’ in American evidential rules and the construction of ‘truth’ by judges in legal decision-making. Rycroft highlights the specific challenges faced by non-English speakers in the UK criminal justice system and contends that courtroom interpreters need to deploy linguistic strategies to solve predicaments deriving from the ideal ‘conduit’ role of the interpreters. While most legal systems operate monolingually, Powell and David present an interesting phenomenon in Kenyan and Malaysian courts – language alternation, which can be used as a strategy to support interlocutors as well as coerce them. Jemielniak focuses on <italic>loci arbitri</italic>, the place where arbitration is to take place, and discusses the place of arbitration in online proceedings in the context of territoriality principle.</p>
<p>Power is disseminated through language, and this is especially the case in the legal profession. As a legal setting, the courtroom is known as ‘the site of unequal encounters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445613476791">Harris, 1988</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613476791">Simpson and Mayr (2010</xref>: 9) emphasize that ‘courtroom interaction is a particularly marked form of institutional discourse’ and state that ‘in practice interactions in institutional settings have a very specific goal and are often asymmetrical in their distribution of speaking rights and obligations’. How exercise of control and power in the courtroom is achieved by various means of linguistic manipulation, which is usually considered in micro studies (in-language studies), is a central issue of a great number of macro studies (behind-language studies).</p>
<p>The book offers penetrating insights into the power of language and the power of the law. The topics addressed in the book are well selected and organized, exploring how the disciplines of law and linguistics can help readers understand the nature of ‘Power and Control’ – both oral and written – and how it might be clarified to unravel linguistic representation of legal reality. Based on research methods of cross-cultural linguistics, corpus linguistics, functional linguistics, ethnography and sociology, contributors conduct micro- as well as macro-studies to work on how the exercise of control and power is achieved. The micro-studies (Part I) of the book examine the linguistic manipulation in courtroom interaction between barrister and Indigenous people in Australia, lawyer and witness in US cases, counselor and witness in public inquiries in Great Britain, legal narratives such as repackaged confessions in some high-profile US cases, and constructed client–lawyer stories. Taking legal discourse as a tool in implementing and applying the law, the macro-studies (Part II) explore courtroom discourse incorporating context in a broader sense, for example, magical analogies to legal practice, social and cultural bias and convention of speech, contextual constraints of courtroom interpreting, motivation behind courtroom language alternation, and the ontological and semiotic relevance of the place in virtual arbitration.</p>
<p>The appeal of the book lies in the actionable knowledge it brings to this emerging field of research and practice as it contains contributions from internationally recognized scholars from a range of continents, including Asia, North America, Europe and Oceania. Integrating practical and theoretical reflections, this volume provides an updated profile for the trend and evolution in interdisciplinary studies between law, language and discourse, which is valuable not only for the professionals and academics in the fields of law and forensic linguistics, but also for those in the field of discourse studies.</p>
