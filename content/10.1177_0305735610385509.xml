<abstract>
<p>In the context of advanced instrumental learning, this study had two purposes: to investigate the relationships of epistemic beliefs to first-year music students’ self-reported learning strategies in practising a musical instrument, and to examine the adaption of a measure of academic personal epistemology to the musical domain. One hundred and thirty music students (71 women and 59 men) from six music academies/conservatoires filled out questionnaires detailing their epistemic beliefs and strategy use. To some degree, the factor analysis showed cross-subject generalizability in the dimensions of epistemic beliefs in the music version of the original measure. The four dimensions found were: certainty of knowledge (α = .64); control of knowledge acquisition (α = .66); ambiguity of knowledge (α = .56); and simplicity of knowledge (α = .50). Beliefs about the control of knowledge acquisition and the simplicity of knowledge were significantly related to strategies, but the correlations were low. Gender and degree programme were also significantly related to epistemic beliefs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article focuses on the epistemic beliefs of advanced music students in the context of advanced instrumental learning in music academies/conservatoires. Personal epistemology is a relatively new concept in research on how students become active participants in their own learning process (i.e., become self-regulated learners; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0305735610385509">Zimmerman, 1986</xref>, p. 308). In the academic domain today, personal epistemology is a popular line of inquiry among educational psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735610385509">Muis, 2007</xref>, p. 173), as it’s seen as a theory that might help to explain why some students are more likely than others to be self-regulated learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735610385509">Bråten &amp; Strømsø, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735610385509">Neber &amp; Schommer-Aikins, 2002</xref>). Personal epistemology concerns ‘beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735610385509">Schommer, 1994</xref>, p. 25), and are seen as <italic>systems</italic> of personal beliefs about the nature of knowledge and how it should be acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735610385509">Hofer &amp; Pintrich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of academic learning, students’ assertions of the nature of knowledge are considered as ‘prefigurative in the sense that they constrain, at the most fundamental level, an individual’s understanding of what knowledge consists of and how it should be acquired’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0305735610385509">Spiro, Feltovich, &amp; Coulson, 1996</xref>, p. S53). Early attempts to investigate students’ epistemic beliefs in academic learning, focused on developmental issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610385509">Hofer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735610385509">Hofer &amp; Pintrich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735610385509">Muis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer, 1990</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735610385509">Perry (1970</xref>, pp. 9–10) assumed that personal epistemology is unidimensional and develops following a sequence of nine positions. He suggested that students in the early positions see knowledge in polar terms of either right or wrong, and believe that authority figures can teach them the answers. In later positions of development, the students realize that knowing is relative in time and circumstance and that one is faced with the responsibility to commit oneself to some ideas. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735610385509">Hallam’s (1992)</xref> reformulation of Perry’s notions, she suggests that music students move from considering other styles of playing as ill-founded, via accepting other styles of playing as legitimate and possible to, finally, having developed their own personal style of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735610385509">Hallam, 1992</xref>, p. 114).</p>
<p>In her investigation of students’ epistemic beliefs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer (1990</xref>, p. 498) has suggested that personal epistemology may be conceptualized as a multidimensional ‘belief system that is composed of several more or less independent dimensions‘. She proposes that there are at least five dimensions: the structure, certainty, and source of knowledge, and the control and speed of knowledge acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">1990</xref>, p. 498). The dimensions of structure, certainty, and source originate from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735610385509">Perry’s (1970)</xref> work, which found that many students enter college with the beliefs that knowledge is simple, certain, and handed down from authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer, 1990</xref>, p. 498). The dimension of control of knowledge acquisition is taken from Dweck and Leggett’s research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735610385509">1988</xref>), which ascertained that some students have a predominant belief in intelligence as a fixed entity, whereas others believe it can be improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer, 1990</xref>, p. 498). The last dimension is derived from Schoenfeld’s research (1983, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer, 1990</xref>, p. 498), based on his findings that some students believe in quick, all-or-none learning.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735610385509">Schommer (1993</xref>, p. 406), each dimension is viewed as a continuum from what she terms more ‘naïve’ beliefs to more ‘sophisticated’ beliefs. Stated from the more ‘naïve’ perspective to the more ‘sophisticated’ perspective, these five dimensions, and shorthand terminology in parentheses, include the following:</p>

<list-item>
<p>Ranging from the belief that ‘the ability to learn is fixed at birth’ to the belief that ‘ability to learn can be changed’ (control of knowledge acquisition);</p>
</list-item>

</list-item>
</list>
<p>In academic learning, recent research relates the epistemic beliefs of students to their academic cognition and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735610385509">Bråten and Strømsø, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735610385509">Schommer (1993)</xref> found that an individual’s beliefs about knowledge and knowing interacts with learning strategies and academic performance. For example, students who maintain the ‘naïve’ epistemological belief that ‘knowledge is acquired quickly or not at all’, tend to earn lower grade point averages than students who hold the more ‘sophisticated’ belief that ‘knowledge is acquired gradually’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735610385509">1993</xref>). Further, students who believe in fixed ability, simple knowledge, quick learning, and certain knowledge also tend to report less use of self-regulated learning strategies than students who have more ‘sophisticated’ epistemological beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735610385509">Garrett-Ingram, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735610385509">Paulsen &amp; Feldman, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of music education and self-regulated learning, epistemic beliefs may concern issues regarding technical and musical problem solving in the development of musical skills. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735610385509">Hallam (1992</xref>, p. 113), central issues may concern whether the student ’considers that there is a ‘right’ way for things to be played, whether favourite interpretations are ‘copied’, whether a number of influences are absorbed, and how individual style is developed’. Students pursuing higher education in music face a rethinking of their music performance practice with alternative interpretations and styles of playing. Becoming reflective musicians, the students assume a responsibility to develop an awareness of these alternative interpretations in developing their own personal style of playing. To my knowledge, no other studies of personal epistemology in instrumental learning have been conducted. Thus, the present study set out to investigate the relationships between specific epistemic beliefs and individual adaptive practice behaviour.</p>
<p>In the present study, music students’ individual adaptive practice behaviour was conceived as their use of specific learning strategies. Learning strategies are generally conceived of as deliberate or purposeful processes, originally consciously applied, but normally undergoing automation as a result of development and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735610385509">Schneider &amp; Weinert, 1990</xref>). If we view learning strategies as activities aimed at achieving a particular goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0305735610385509">Weinstein &amp; Mayer, 1986</xref>), no single learning strategy will work equally well for all students, and few, if any, strategies will work optimally on all tasks. The effectiveness of a strategy will be prone to change as a skill develops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0305735610385509">Zimmerman, 1998</xref>), and several studies during the last 30 years have illustrated the individual diversity in the way music students and musicians develop musical skills during practice (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735610385509">Ginsborg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0305735610385509">Gruson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735610385509">Hallam, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735610385509">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735610385509">Miklaszewski, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735610385509">S. G. Nielsen, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0305735610385509">1999b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735610385509">2001</xref>).</p>
<p>With this in mind, the main purpose of the present study was to contribute to the literature on self-regulated learning in musicians by addressing the following questions:</p>
<list id="list2-0305735610385509" list-type="order">

<p>What is the dimensionality of epistemic beliefs in relation to instrumental achievement with first-year music students?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What are the relationships between the adopted epistemic beliefs of first-year music students and their learning strategies used during practising?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Are there any differences in adopted epistemic beliefs with regards to main instrument, degree programme, or gender?</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>One hundred and thirty (<italic>N</italic> = 130) first-year music students (71 women and 59 men) ranging in age from 18–43 years (<italic>M</italic> = 20.8 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 6.3 years) participated in the present study. The students were enrolled in church music, music performance or music education programmes in six Norwegian music academies/conservatoires. A breakdown by music genres was a follows: 105 students (80.8%) working in the classical genre and 25 students (19.2%) working in the jazz, pop and rock genres. Because of a competitive admission process to these programmes, all students in the sample could be classified as advanced students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0305735610385509">
<title>Questionnaire design</title>
<p>The questionnaire was structured into two sections:</p>
<sec id="section5-0305735610385509">
<title>(i) Epistemic beliefs</title>
<p>Students’ epistemic beliefs were assessed with a Norwegian adaptation of the <italic>Epistemological Belief Questionnaire</italic> (EQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer, 1990</xref>) to apply to instrumental practising and achievement. Schommer’s EQ-measurement scale of epistemic beliefs is the most commonly encountered measurement scale in the literature on epistemic beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735610385509">DeBacker, Crowson, Beesley, Thoma, &amp; Hestevold, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The measurement scale included five subscales where some items were altered to capture the context of instrumental practising and achievement. Each subscale was measured by two or three subsets of items. The certainty of knowledge subscale (α = .48) was measured by the subsets of ’avoid ambiguity’ (five items) and ’knowledge is certain’ (six items; sample item: ’Today’s facts on the performance practice of a piece may be tomorrow’s fiction’). The source of knowledge subscale (α = .20) was assessed through the subsets of ’depend on authority’ (four items) and ’don’t criticize authority’ (five items; sample item: ’For success on your instrument in a music academy, it’s best not to ask too many questions’). The two subsets of ‘seek single answers’ (nine items) and ‘avoid integration’ (seven items) formed the structure of knowledge scale (α = .48; sample item: ‘A good music teacher’s job is to keep his/her students from wandering from the right track’). The control of knowledge acquisition subscale (α = .35) was measured by the three subsets of ‘ability to learn is innate’ (four items), ‘can’t learn how to learn’ (five items) and ‘success is unrelated to hard work’ (four items; sample item: ‘The most successful musicians have discovered how to improve their ability to learn’). Further, the three subsets of ‘learn the first time’ (three items), ‘learning is quick’ (five items) and ‘concentrated effort is a waste’ (two items) are designed to assess the subscale of speed of knowledge acquisition (α = .35; sample item: ‘Learning is a slow process of building up knowledge and skills’). For each of the 59 items, students rated themselves on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). Higher scores on the subscales represented more ‘naïve’ epistemic beliefs whereas lower scores corresponded to beliefs that were more ‘sophisticated’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0305735610385509">
<title>(ii) Learning strategies</title>
<p>Students’ reported use of learning strategies were assessed with 36 items from a Norwegian adaptation of the <italic>Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire</italic> (the MSLQ-inventory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735610385509">Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, &amp; McKeachie, 1991</xref>) to apply to instrumental practising. The measurement scale included six subscales where some items were altered to capture the context of instrumental practising; repeating strategies, elaboration strategies, organization strategies, metacognitive strategies, strategies used to manage time-and-study environment and regulate effort invested. The repeating strategies subscale (four items; α = .73) addresses the extent to which students use strategies to repeat parts of the material to master the task (sample item: ‘I select important technical and musical parts, repeating these over and over again’). The elaboration strategies subscale addresses (six items; α = .69) to what extent students use strategies to integrate new information with existing knowledge (sample item: ‘I try to develop musical ideas by making connections between alternative interpretations from listening to music and from lecturers’). The organization strategies subscale (four items; α = .69) addresses to what extent the students use strategies to select appropriate information and to construct connections within the information (sample item: ‘When I practise, I go through the music and try to find the most important musical ideas’). The metacognitive strategies subscale (11 items; α = .67) addresses to what extent students plan, monitor and regulate their problem solving during practice (sample item: ‘When practising, I set goals for myself in order to direct my practising’). The time-and-study-environment-manage subscale (seven items; α = .59) assesses the students’ use of strategies for controlling their time and environment for effective practising (sample item: ‘I find it hard to stick to a practice schedule’). The effort regulation subscale (four items; α = .60) assesses the student’s ability to regulate their attention and effort during practising (sample item: ‘I often feel so lazy or bored when I practise, that I quit before I finish what I planned to do’). For each of the 36 items, students rated themselves on a 7-point scale (1 = not at all true of me; 7 = very true of me). The internal consistency of the Norwegian adapted version of the MSLQ-inventory for the music participants ranged from a medium of .59 (time-and-study-environment management strategies) to a high of .73 (repeating strategies). On the whole, these data suggested that the music version of the MSLQ-inventory is somewhat less internally consistent for our Norwegian music students than the original MSLQ-inventory for the American college students who comprised the norming sample. The lower Cronbach’s alphas in the present study may be due to a relatively small sample size (<italic>N</italic> = 130). However, although the reliability estimates are lower than the norming sample, they still may be considered acceptable for research purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735610385509">Cortina, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735610385509">Schmitt, 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0305735610385509">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The adapted EQ and MSLQ-questionnaires were administered to one class at a time. The project was performed consistently with the national ethical guidelines regulating research given by the Privacy Ombudsmann for Research (i.e., due to these ethical guidelines of anonymity, only sex, age, and main instrument were reported). Students who missed the session in which the questionnaires were administered the first time were given another opportunity to complete them if they wished.</p>
<p>The original scales was taken directly from research on academic subjects and translated into Norwegian by a group of researchers. Then, afterwards, some items were altered to facilitate understanding in the context of music performance. In the following, two examples are given on how some items were adapted to the context of music students’ instrumental practising and music achievement: (a) the original MSLQ-item ‘I memorize key words to remind me of important concepts in this class’ was altered to ‘I select important technical and musical parts, repeating these over and over again’; and (b) the original EQ-item ‘Getting ahead takes a lot of work’ was altered to ‘Getting ahead on your instrument takes a lot of work’.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0305735610385509" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In order to investigate the first-year music students’ dimensions of epistemic beliefs in relation to instrumental achievement, several item-based factor-analyses were conducted. The interpretations of the results (i.e., concerning the number of factors to keep and the omitting of items) of the three factor-analyses followed the advice of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735610385509">Bryman and Cramer (1999</xref>, pp. 276–77, 280). For example, the 16 factors found with an Eigenvalue greater than 1 as a cut off point for factors in the first factor-analysis were reduced to four factors after analysis of the scree plot. Likewise, only items with high loadings on one factor (&gt; .40) and low overlap for other factors (&lt; .30) were kept, and thus, for example, the second four-factor analysis included only 32 items. Finally, a principal component analysis with orthogonal rotation with 21 items of the adapted EQ generated four factors that accounted for 35.3% of the variance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735610385509">Table 1</xref> for item-to-factor loadings, Eigenvalues, and Cronbach’s alpha for each of the four factors).</p>

<p>After examining the content of the items that loaded high on each of the factors, the four factors were given descriptive titles. Factor 1 was ‘Certainty of knowledge’; Factor 2 was ‘Control of knowledge acquisition’; Factor 3 was ‘Ambiguity of knowledge’, and Factor 4 was ‘Simplicity of knowledge’.</p>
<p>The first factor, certainty of knowledge, concerned the nature of knowledge about music performance. This factor generally included beliefs about how possible it is for advanced performers to ultimately obtain indisputable interpretations of music, and included items derived from one of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer’s (1990)</xref> subsets to measure the certainty of knowledge (three items), and from the subsets ‘learning is quick’ (one item), ’avoid integration’ (one item) and ‘don’t criticise authority’ (one item). Stated from the more ‘naïve’ perspective (i.e., high scores) to the more ‘sophisticated’ perspective (i.e., low scores) this dimension ranged from the belief that ‘indisputable, true interpretations in music ultimately can be found by expert performers’ to the belief that ‘interpretations in music are tentative’. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735610385509">Table 2</xref> shows that more than 80% of the students scored 2.91 (i.e., one <italic>SD</italic> over the mean) and below, assuming a normal distribution. Thus, the results showed that first-year music students were more likely to hold the belief that interpretations in music are tentative than to hold the belief that true interpretations ultimately can be found.</p>

<p>The second factor, control of knowledge acquisition, concerned the nature of learning in music. It included five items derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer’s (1990)</xref> subsets designed to measure the fixed ability dimension. Stated from the more ‘naïve’ perspective (i.e., high scores) to the more ‘sophisticated’ perspective (i.e., low scores), this dimension ranged from the belief that ‘the ability to learn an instrument is fixed and given at birth’ to the belief that ‘ability to learn an instrument can be changed and is related to a lot of practice’. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735610385509">Table 2</xref> shows that more than 95% of the students scored 3.52 (i.e., two <italic>SD</italic>s below the mean) and over, assuming a normal distribution. Thus, the results showed that first-year music students were more likely to hold the idea that the ability to learn an instrument is fixed and given at birth than to believe that the ability to learn can be changed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735610385509">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The third factor, ambiguity of knowledge, concerned the nature of knowledge about music performance, and consisted of five items representing the belief that an unambiguous solution to a problem is possible through depending on authorities, trusting innate abilities to learn, and avoiding ill-defined problems. Stated from the more ‘naïve’ perspective (i.e., high scores) to the more ‘sophisticated’ perspective (i.e., low scores), this dimension ranged from the belief that ‘unambiguous solutions to musical and technical problems are possible’ to the belief that represent ‘a general awareness of alternative interpretations in playing’. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735610385509">Table 2</xref> shows that more than 80% of the students scored 3.54 (i.e., one <italic>SD</italic> over the mean) and below, assuming a normal distribution. Thus, the results showed that first-year music students were more likely to have a general awareness of alternative interpretations in playing than to hold the view that unambiguous solutions to problems are possible (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735610385509">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The fourth factor, simplicity of knowledge, concerned the nature of knowledge in music performance. It generally included beliefs about how important it is for advanced performers to get the big picture and to view knowledge in music performance as complex and integrated wholes. The items were derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer’s (1990)</xref> subsets ‘simple knowledge’ (three items), ‘omniscient authority’ (one item) and ‘certain knowledge’ (one item). Stated from the more ‘naïve’ perspective (i.e., high scores) to the more ‘sophisticated’ perspective (i.e., low scores), this dimension ranged from the belief ‘that knowledge in music performance is organized in loose parts’ to the belief that ‘an evolving musical performance depend on getting the big picture and viewing knowledge as integrated wholes’. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735610385509">Table 2</xref> shows that more than 80% of the students scored 2.75 (i.e., one <italic>SD</italic> below the mean) and over assuming a normal distribution. Thus, the results showed that first-year music students were more likely to believe that knowledge in music performance is organized in loose parts than to believe that musical knowledge is complex and dependent on ‘getting the big picture’ (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735610385509">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The four dimensions found in the present study in the context of advanced music learning were to some degree consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer’s (1990)</xref> system of epistemic beliefs developed in an academic context. The factors ‘certainty of knowledge’ and ‘control of knowledge acquisition’ reflected two of the dimensions reported by Schommer and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735610385509">Schommer-Aikins, Duell, &amp; Barker, 2003</xref>), while the factors ‘ambiguity of knowledge’ and ‘simplicity of knowledge’ reflected <italic>subsets</italic> of dimensions reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer (1990)</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735610385509">Table 1</xref>, only one of the factors in the present study contained items that all came from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer’s (1990)</xref> subsets designed to measure that specific dimension, namely the dimension control of knowledge acquisition. However, the other three factors in the present study all mainly contained adapted items that came from the corresponding dimensions or subsets of Schommer’s system of epistemic beliefs. Thus, to some degree the present study was able to show cross-subject generalizability across academic and music student samples.</p>
<p>In terms of the relationships between the adopted epistemic beliefs of first-year music students and their use of specific learning strategies during practice, reported use of strategies only correlated significant with beliefs about the simplicity of knowledge and the control of knowledge acquisition (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0305735610385509">Table 3</xref>). Students who viewed knowledge in music performance as organized in loose parts, then, were less likely than students who held the idea that such knowledge is complex and dependent on ‘getting the big picture’ to use elaboration strategies (<italic>r</italic> = − .23), organization strategies (<italic>r</italic> = −.30), and metacognitive strategies (<italic>r</italic> = −.32). Further, students who believed that the ability to learn an instrument is fixed and given at birth were less likely than students who held the idea that the ability to learn an instrument can be changed and is related to a lot of practice, to use both metacognitive strategies (<italic>r</italic> = −.30) and effort regulation strategies (<italic>r</italic> = −.30). However, the correlations are low.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0305735610385509">Table 3</xref>, the dimensions of epistemic beliefs correlated low with each other. ‘Simplicity of knowledge’ was significantly correlated with the dimension control of knowledge acquisition (<italic>r</italic> = .18) and with the dimension ambiguity of knowledge (<italic>r</italic> = .20). These findings suggested that students who believed that knowledge in music performance is organized in loose parts (i.e., the more ‘naïve’ perspective) were more likely than students with more ‘sophisticated’ epistemic beliefs to believe that ability to learn an instrument was fixed and given at birth as well as that unambiguous solutions to musical and technical problems are possible. Further, the dimension ‘ambiguity of knowledge’ was significantly correlated with the dimension ‘certainty of knowledge’ (<italic>r</italic> = .30). Students who held the view that unambiguous solutions to musical and technical problems are possible (i.e., the more ‘naïve’ view), then, were more likely to believe that advanced performers ultimately may obtain indisputable interpretations of music, than students who held the more ‘sophisticated’ view.</p>
<p>In order to study differences in adopted epistemic beliefs with regards to main instrument, degree programme, or gender, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed using the four dimensions of epistemic beliefs as the dependent variables. A significant multivariate effect of gender was found, <italic>F</italic>(20, 365) = 1.71, <italic>p</italic> = .03 (Wilks’ Lambda). These results indicated that female students were more likely than male students to view knowledge in music performance as organized in loose parts. However, this result should be read with caution as the power estimate was relatively low (only 8.2% of the variance in the factor simplicity of knowledge could be predicted from gender). Further, the MANOVA indicated a multivariate effect of degree programme, <italic>F</italic>(4, 125) = 3.43, <italic>p</italic> = .011 (Wilks’ Lambda). The Sheffe post hoc test showed an effect of degree programme for the factor control of knowledge acquisition between students in performance studies in the jazz genre and students in music education studies in the classical genre. The jazz students were significantly more likely than the classical students to hold the belief that the ability to learn an instrument is fixed and given at birth, <italic>F</italic>(5, 113) = 3.25, <italic>p</italic> = .009. However, this result should also be read with caution as the subsamples of students in each degree programme were small and the power estimate was relatively low (only 12.6% of the variance in ‘control of knowledge’ acquisition could be predicted from degree programmes). No significant multivariate effect of main instrument was found.</p>

<title>Discussion and educational implications</title>
<p>The present research adds to our understanding of the self-regulatory processes that shape and influence the development of expertise on a musical instrument in several ways. First, by examining the adaption of a measure of academic personal epistemology to the musical domain and demonstrating that advanced music students’ epistemic beliefs includes the four dimensions certainty of knowledge, control of knowledge acquisition, ambiguity of knowledge and simplicity of knowledge, the present study, to some degree, was able to show cross-subject generalizability of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer’s (1990)</xref> system of epistemic beliefs in the context of advanced instrumental learning. The dimension regarding speed of knowledge acquisition from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer’s (1990)</xref> original questionnaire was not found in the present study. This finding is in accordance with a review study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735610385509">DeBacker et al. (2008)</xref>, which documents that it is difficult to achieve a factor structure that exactly replicates all five dimensions reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer (1990)</xref>. Not even Schommer herself has been successful in this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735610385509">DeBacker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, by measuring the four dimensions of personal epistemology of advanced music students, the present study showed that the first-year music students overall tended to hold both epistemic beliefs usually termed ‘sophisticated’ and ‘naïve’ about musical knowledge and learning. Specifically, the results from the present study suggested that first-year music students were likely to reject the ‘naïve’ notion that there are indisputable, true interpretations of music (i.e., they hold a more ‘sophisticated’ perspective on certainty of knowledge). The students were also likely to reject the ‘naïve’ belief that unambiguous solutions to problems are possible through depending on authorities (i.e., they hold a more ‘sophisticated’ perspective on ambiguity of knowledge). Hence, they were more likely to hold other ‘naïve’ beliefs as that the ability to learn an instrument is fixed as well the view that knowledge in music performance is organized in loose parts. In particular, it is interesting to note that the finding of the present study regarding first-year students’ belief in fixed abilities indicated the same positive relationship between high levels of performance achievement and ’talent’, conceived as innate, genetically programmed superiority, as the folk psychology of musical ability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735610385509">Sloboda, Davidson, &amp; Howe, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, by comparing the reported use of self-regulated learning strategies with the students’ adopted epistemic beliefs, the present study showed that first-year music students who believed ability is fixed (i.e., a more ‘naïve’ belief) were less likely than students with a more ‘sophisticated’ belief (i.e., to believe in ability to learn as malleable and related to hard work) to use both metacognitive and effort regulation strategies. Likewise, it showed that students who viewed knowledge in music performance as organized in loose parts (i.e., a more ‘naïve’ view) were less likely than students with a more ‘sophisticated’ view (i.e., to believe that knowledge is complex and dependent on ‘getting the big picture’), to use elaboration, organization and metacognitive strategies. The first finding is in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735610385509">Garrett-Ingram’s (1997)</xref> study, which found that academic students who believe in fixed ability also reported less cognitive and metacognitive strategy use than students who have more ‘sophisticated’ epistemic beliefs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735610385509">Neber and Schommer-Aikins (2002</xref>, p. 60) argue that ‘poorly developed epistemic beliefs should be considered as a mediational barrier explaining why underachieving highly gifted students do not fully use their cognitive potential’. This is an important point to be aware of that will be elaborated in the forthcoming discussion of practical implications.</p>
<p>Fourth, by comparing the reported adopted epistemic beliefs with regards to the students’ gender, the present study was able to show that female and male students differed significantly with regard to whether they tended to believe that knowledge in music performance is organized in loose parts (i.e., the ‘naïve’ perspective). This finding is in keeping with Paulsen and Wells’ study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735610385509">1998</xref>), which found that men appear to hold more ‘sophisticated’ beliefs about the nature of knowledge. Women, on the other hand, appear to hold more ‘sophisticated’ beliefs about the nature of knowledge acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735610385509">1993</xref>). However, in the present study women and men did not differ with regard to beliefs about how to acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>Fifth, the results of the present study indicated that students with jazz instruments in the performance studies are more likely than students with classical instruments in the music education studies to have ‘naïve’ beliefs in fixed ability (i.e., they reject the notion that the ability to learn an instrument can be changed and is related to a lot of practice). This finding may be related to the more severe entrance requirements for jazz students in music academies/conservatoires. The few jazz students who are admitted to a performance degree programme have succeeded in a highly-selective process where most applicants do not succeed despite lots of practice. This line of argumentation is inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735610385509">Bråten and Strømsø’s (2005)</xref> findings regarding business administrative students’ stronger beliefs in fixed ability and unchangeable intelligence compared to student teachers. Business students ‘who do succeed in the competition may well develop the belief that they are more gifted than others or even born smart’ (p. 559).</p>
<p>However, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735610385509">Garrett-Ingram (1997)</xref>, the theoretical quality of the measures used should also be considered in examining some of the weaker relationships seen in the present study. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735610385509">Garrett-Ingram (1997</xref>, p. 10) argues that the ‘naiveté’ of the epistemic beliefs could be viewed from several perspectives. For example, if, in the present study, we define instrumental learning as learning by apprenticeship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735610385509">K. Nielsen, 1999</xref>), where the instrumental teacher has the role of the master, and where information is handed down from an expert, the more receptive students may very well realize that it is best not to ask too many questions in order to succeed. It could also be that the well-adapted students, who are placed under time constraints during one-to-one tuitions, exams, and who have limited time to practise their instrument, learn from these institutional settings that they will not be successful if they do not ’get it’ quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735610385509">Garrett-Ingram, 1997</xref>). These considerations call into question the determination of ‘naiveté’ on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610385509">Schommer’s (1990)</xref> questionnaire both generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735610385509">Garrett-Ingram, 1997</xref>) and in a musical context. As ‘labelling certain epistemic beliefs as sophisticated strongly signals the desirability and effectiveness of those beliefs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735610385509">Bråten, Strømsø, &amp; Samuelstuen, 2008</xref>), no doubt, further research on epistemic beliefs in music should ‘empirically explore in different task contexts and at different levels of expertise . . . what positively affects learning and comprehension and, thus, rightly deserves to be labelled sophisticated’ (p. 832).</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of education, the results of the present study suggested some important practical implications. The findings demonstrated that music students differ in terms of their epistemic beliefs. Thus, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735610385509">Schommer-Aikins et al. (2003)</xref> regarding faculty in the academic domain, instrumental teachers in music academies/conservatoires should also take into consideration that their students hold different beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning in music. The students may also differ from their teachers in their adopted epistemic beliefs. For example, when an instrumental teacher gives students difficult and time-consuming pieces to learn, some students may cease to try because they think that only gifted students can overcome the obstacles of challenging musical and technical problems (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735610385509">Schommer-Aikins et al., 2003</xref>). Other students may persist in the face of difficulty because they believe learning an instrument requires hard work and a lot of practice and that their ability to learn develops through experience (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735610385509">Schommer-Aikins et al., 2003</xref>). Considering the findings of research into the expert performance of music that highlights the quantity of deliberate practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735610385509">Ericsson, Krampe, &amp; Tesch-Römer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735610385509">Ericsson, Roring, &amp; Nandagopal, 2007</xref>), this belief may prove to be a more ‘sophisticated’ and adaptive one in the context of advanced instrumental learning.</p>
<p>The findings of the present study also indicated that the students do not arrive in music academies/conservatoires as blank slates in regard to beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning in music. Thus, it is important that institutions of higher education in music reinforce or influence in students more adaptive epistemic beliefs in order to help highly-gifted students to fully use their cognitive potential in developing their musical expertise. It may be important for an introductory course to music academies/conservatories to address the prevailing conceptions of a discipline, as well as to determine what conceptions are desirable to convey regarding optimal development technically and musically on the instrument.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610385509">Hofer (2004)</xref>, teaching styles of teachers may also influence students’ epistemic beliefs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735610385509">Nerland (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735610385509">Mills (2002)</xref> found that the teaching styles of instrumental one-to-one teachers in higher education differed. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735610385509">Mills (2002</xref>, p. 80) found that undergraduates perceived a range of teaching styles in instrumental tuition as effective for them: (a) ‘My teacher tells me what to do’ (transmission); (b) ‘My teacher and I work out together what and how I should improve’ (collaboration); and (c) ‘My teacher teaches me to how to learn to be a musician’ (induction). The findings of the present study added to this literature by indicating that this range of students’ perceived effective teaching styles also may differ according to students’ adopted epistemic beliefs. Consequently, in addressing adaptive and maladaptive epistemic beliefs in the development of expert performances in music, further work should investigate the relationships between students’ adopted epistemic beliefs and their perceived effective teaching styles as well as the relationships between students’ and teachers’ adopted epistemic beliefs in one-to-one instrumental teaching.</p>
