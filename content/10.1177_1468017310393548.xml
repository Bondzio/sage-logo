<p>• <italic>Summary</italic>: In 2001, federal research funding (#90-CO-0960) was awarded to conduct an in-depth study of one agency’s experience with domestic special needs adoption placements (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). This private Ohio agency has been involved in the placement of special needs children since the beginning of the US special needs adoption movement in 1976. A rigorous and comprehensive chart review was conducted profiling 362 consecutively referred special needs adoption cases from 1997 to 2005, providing one of the most accurate and in-depth profiles of both special needs adoption children and their biological mothers to date.</p>
<p>• <italic>Findings</italic>: In summing the major child and biological mother risk factors reported in this study (i.e. child neglect + child physical abuse + child sexual abuse + child prenatal drug exposure + child positive toxicology screen at birth + maternal mental illness + maternal substance abuse + maternal homelessness + maternal history of domestic violence + parental incarceration + and death of a significant person), youth averaged 4.7 (SD = 1.61) cumulative risk factors, not including poverty, multiple placement disruptions, and other undocumented risk factors.</p>
<p>• <italic>Applications</italic>: Accurate and comprehensive profiling of child and biological parent characteristics are required to inform the service needs of at-risk families, domestic special needs adopted children, and adoptive parents. Implications for adoptive parent recruitment, training, and support, as well child monitoring and treatment are discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1468017310393548"><title>Background</title>
<p>The child welfare system in the US is overburdened in its efforts to assure child safety and provide for the needs of abused and neglected children. In 2006, an estimated 3.3 million referrals alleging child abuse or neglect involving approximately 6 million children were accepted by states or local child protective service agencies for investigation or assessment. Of those 6 million children, 3.6 million received investigations by child protective service agencies and an estimated 905,000 children were victims of abuse and neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017310393548">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2008a</xref>). In that same year, approximately 799,000 children were served in the public foster care system throughout the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017310393548">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>A significant portion of children served by the public child welfare system is awaiting adoption. Over 75 percent of these children meet the criteria for ‘special needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017310393548">US General Accounting Office, 2002</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017310393548">Tang, Marfo, and Dedrick’s (2007</xref>, p. 1270) recent review of child welfare literature, the term ‘special needs’ refers to a broad range of characteristics including: older age; cultural/ethnic minority status; being part of an adoptive placement sibling group; having a mental or health related disability; having a history of maltreatment, violence exposure, exposure to alcohol, other drugs, or HIV. In fiscal year 2007, the number of children waiting to be adopted was approximately 130,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017310393548">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2008b</xref>). Of those 130,000 waiting children, there were 84,000 whose parental rights had been terminated, an increase from 77,000 in 2002, the highest since Adoption Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) data have been reported. The number of children adopted annually has remained relatively constant during the same time period at approximately 52,000. In Ohio, the state where the private agency conducting this study is located, the number of adoptions of children with public child welfare agency involvement has increased significantly from 1202 in 1995 to 1803 in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017310393548">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2008c</xref>). Approximately 4011 Ohio children were waiting to be adopted in FY-2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017310393548">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2008d</xref>).</p>
<p>The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA; P.L. 105–89) was designed to promote the safety and adoption of children, and improve the timeliness of permanency for both foster and adoption eligible children. A great deal has changed since the passage of ASFA, yet much of the profile information on adopted children predates this important piece of legislation. The most recent child welfare data comes from large administrative data sets that contribute to national Adoption Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) and Child and Family Service Reviews (CFSR) reporting. While advances in collecting child welfare data on a national level have been monumental, the data elements collected are broad and extremely limited, not providing the depth and accuracy necessary to truly articulate client characteristics and needs. In contrast to large administrative data sets, many cross sectional studies rely on adoptive parent retrospective survey responses which can be fraught with selective recall bias. While both of these types of data sources have merit, the amount of missing, limited, and inaccurate data present significant drawbacks for researchers, especially those working in a field that is already limited by sparse federal funding to support adoption research.</p>
<p>Given that context, a scientifically rigorous and in-depth profile analysis of special needs adoption children and their biological parents can do much to further understanding regarding the impact that pre-placement experiences ultimately have on adoption adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017310393548">Brand &amp; Brinich, 1999</xref>). A rigorous and comprehensive chart review methodology provides a more comprehensive and accurate look at the characteristics of special needs adoption children and their biologic mothers. This type of profiling, using consecutively referred admissions from one large adoption placement program, complements findings from administrative data provided to AFCARS by providing a wealth of valuable information not normally collected or disseminated in peer-reviewed literature. Such scholarly dissemination is hampered by the laborious and time-consuming nature of comprehensive, lifetime chart reviews, and, the challenges of achieving high rates of inter-rater reliability necessary to meet research standards for scientific rigor.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1468017310393548" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="sec3-1468017310393548"><title>Population and sampling</title>
<p>A mixed retrospective/prospective design (460 retrospective and 104 prospective) was used to examine the profile and descriptive characteristics of 564 consecutively referred special needs adoption children linked by a common core of over 200 client, family, and system variables. For the purposes of this article, the last 368 adoptive cases were analyzed, because the adoption placements ranged from 22 February 1997 to 17 April 2005, coinciding with the implementation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act. Since 1977, cases were identified from a single client log kept by an Ohio adoption program that is part of a large child multiservice mental health agency. The agency’s adoption program has been an early pioneer in the US special needs adoption movement, and has been the recipient of five Adoption Opportunities grants through the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The program has a long history of accepting older, hard-to-place, predominately minority children with significant emotional and behavioral issues. The program’s adoption log was considered the most accurate and comprehensive listing of consecutive adoption referrals to the adoption program during this early period. Six case files were not able to be coded during the study period, bringing the number of reviewed cased to 362.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468017310393548"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>Extensive case file reviews (sometimes also referred to as chart reviews, case file schedules, or life histories or chronologies) were utilized to detail the profiles of the families and children, and describe the pathways that these children navigated in their movement to permanency. Additional pathway descriptions chronicled children’s movements through their out of home placements as a means to explore family and system factors that impact adoption outcomes. Placement pathways, characteristics of adoptive caregivers, and the 202 pre-ASFA cases are not chronicled in this article, but will be published later.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1468017310393548"><title>Reliability</title>
<p>Exhaustive case file reviews were conducted by research staff working specifically on the adoption research project. A previously developed case file review codebook, updated during the study to capture more detailed information on this later post-ASFA cohort, provided precise and specific operational definitions for over 200 study variables, both numerical and qualitative. Many of the case files had hundreds, if not thousands of pages, containing assessments, adoption forms, progress notes, and various other types of documentation across multiple charts. In many instances, the codebook identified specific fields on adoption forms or chart documentation that would be used to extract information. Such standardized coding procedures greatly improve reliability coefficients, providing a gauge of overall agreement between raters, critical to both the validity and generalizability of study results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017310393548">Tinsley &amp; Weiss, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Inter-rater reliability was calculated across two raters by item, and different variable types required different techniques for assessing inter-rater reliability. The use of percent agreement does not allow for the likelihood that the degree of agreement is different from what is expected to occur by chance. Along the same lines, Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> only measures consistency, so if two raters consistently differ in their assignment of scores, a high Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> will be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017310393548">Auerbach, La Porte, &amp; Caputo, 2004</xref>). Therefore, Cohen’s kappa and interclass correlation coefficients were the most appropriate statistics to use to measure inter-rater reliability in this study to account for the above mentioned deficiencies. Cohen’s kappa (<italic>κ</italic>) is appropriate for use in evaluating reliability in categorical variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017310393548">Cooper &amp; Hedges, 1994</xref>). Interclass correlation (<italic>R</italic>) should be used with continuous level data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017310393548">Cooper &amp; Hedges, 1994</xref>), interval level data, and ordinal scales that assume interval properties unless there is little variance in the ratings. <italic>R</italic> is the proportion of the total variance in the ratings due to variance in the item being rated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017310393548">Tinsley &amp; Weiss, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Reliability analysis is time-consuming and an examination of each of over 200 variables was both time- and cost-prohibitive. Therefore, a subset of 18 variables that featured most prominently in the following analyses were selected for an investigation of inter-rater reliability. Reliability estimates of these key study variables contribute significantly to the confidence of the project findings. Coder instability can arise when a lengthy period of coding is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017310393548">Cooper &amp; Hedges, 1994</xref>). For this reason, reliability was calculated at multiple time points in order to determine if adjustments were needed to clarify coding definitions. Kappa scores ranged from 0.52 to 1.0. The average Kappa score was 0.81 indicating almost perfect agreement among raters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017310393548">Auerbach et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec7-1468017310393548" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The results are organized by the two categories of key questions exploring profile characteristic of special needs adoption children. The categories include child characteristics and biological mother characteristics. Descriptive data are presented for each category. Child characteristics include: gender, race, member of a sibling group adoption, type of adoptive placement, type of maltreatment prior to first out-of-home placement, drug and alcohol exposure, mental health and developmental diagnoses, and death of a significant person. Biological mother characteristics include the biological mothers’ history of prostitution, alcohol and drug abuse, being a victim of domestic violence, abuse or neglect as a child, mental health diagnoses, homelessness, incarceration, age at loss of custody, and highest grade completed in school.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1468017310393548"><title>Child characteristics</title>
<p>The children referred for adoption were equally split by gender, 181 or 50 percent were male and 181 or 50 percent were female. The average age of the child at the time of adoption placement was 7.5 years old (SD = 4.12), and 80 percent of the children were referred from the largest county in Ohio, whose major urban metropolis is among the poorest cities in the United States. The majority of the children were African American, 233 (64.4%), 102 (28.2%) were Caucasian, 20 (5.6%) were Asian or Pacific Islander, and six (1.7%) were biracial. One client’s (0.3%) race and ethnicity could not be determined from the record review. The agency’s treatment foster home network is predominately African American. African American children taken into custody and needing treatment foster care placements would most likely be matched with foster parents from a similar racial background. Many of these locally referred children would become eligible for adoption. The remaining 19.9 percent of children were referred from 23 other counties throughout the state of Ohio. One child was referred from the neighboring state of West Virginia. The earliest out-of-home placement for referred children dated back to 18 August 1983.</p>
<p>The majority of adoption referrals were foster-to-adopt, 206 (56.9%), followed by matched adoptions, 106 (29.3%), kinship foster-to-adopt, 46 (12.7%) and four kinship adoptions (1.1%). Slightly over 62% of the children were referred for adoption as part of a sibling group, ranging from two (30.9%) to five (1.7%) siblings. The average number of children adopted per family was 2.04 (SD = 1.08).</p>
<sec id="sec9-1468017310393548"><title>Child maltreatment</title>
<p>Case file reviewers coded the nature and type of maltreatment that each child experienced in their biological homes. There were 19 maltreatment categories covering various types and interactions of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect, including medical and educational neglect. Out of 362 cases, there were 49 (13.5%) cases where data was determined to be incomplete or missing to make a determination regarding maltreatment. In addition, there were another 59 cases (16.3%) where there was no documented maltreatment. This may be due to the fact that some children may have come into custody due to other reasons such as the death of a caretaker, or serious abuse of a sibling and irresolvable ongoing safety concerns. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468017310393548">Table 1</xref> presents the results of abuse types by seven condensed categories of child maltreatment for the 254 children who had clear documentation of child maltreatment. While neglect was the primary or most common type of maltreatment affecting 54.7 percent of children, over a third or 38.2 percent of children had experienced multiple types of maltreatment, including 9.8 percent who had experienced neglect in combination with physical and sexual abuse. In addition to the various types of child maltreatment reported, 66 (18.2%) children also resided in homes where there was case file documentation that domestic violence occurred.

<sec id="sec10-1468017310393548"><title>Death of a significant person</title>
<p>There were a variety of significant interpersonal losses that clients experienced prior to adoption placement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468017310393548">Table 2</xref>). One of the most significant losses is the death of a loved one or caretaker. Sixty-eight clients (18.8%) experienced a significant interpersonal loss through death. The most frequent loss was of a biological sibling (<italic>n</italic> = 20, 5.5%), followed by a parent, either a father (<italic>n</italic> = 14, 3.9%) or mother (<italic>n</italic> = 13, 3.6%). Seven children (1.9%) experienced the death of their foster parent, and five children (1.4%) experienced multiple deaths.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1468017310393548"><title>Primary diagnosis at intake</title>
<p>Clients were assigned a primary diagnosis at intake into the agency by a master’s level licensed independent social worker who completed a comprehensive diagnostic assessment. The diagnostic codes that were assigned from the <italic>Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 4th edition</italic> (DSM-IV) (American <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310393548">Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) were collapsed into major categories in order to more parsimoniously display diagnostic information (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468017310393548">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Out of 362 clients, 310 (85.6%) received an intake diagnosis. The remaining 52 clients (14.4%) were undiagnosed typically due to their young age (i.e. infants) or lack of clinical impairment. Of those who received intake diagnoses, the most frequent diagnoses were V-Codes for Child Neglect, Physical/Sexual Abuse of a Child (29%), followed by Adjustment Disorder (22.9%), Relational Problems (11.9%), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (10%), and other disruptive behavior disorders (5.8%). Approximately 6.8 percent of children had intake diagnoses of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and another 6.1 percent had diagnoses of Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD).</p>
<p>In addition to DSM-IV mental health diagnoses, information regarding developmental disabilities, handicaps, and delays were also extracted.

<p>Approximately 37.6 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 136) of biological mothers had a documented history of a mental health disorder, suicidal behavior, or unspecified mental health issue noted in the case file documentation. An additional 13 mothers had an alleged mental health disorder that we did not include in this group (<italic>n</italic> = 136) because there was not clear documentation of the disorder, or how it impaired functioning or child care. The most common diagnoses were mood disorders, frequently in combination with other disorders. This is not surprising given the high comorbidity between mood disorders and substance abuse. Over a quarter of the children, 96 (26.8%), had a mother with a history of incarceration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1468017310393548">Table 7</xref>). This includes the 9.9 percent of children who had both parents incarcerated.

<p>Demographically, the average age in this sample was 7.5 years old (SD = 4.12), with 64.4 percent African American. The majority of adoption referrals were foster-to-adopt (56.9%), similar to national data (59%). Slightly over 62 percent of the children were referred for adoption as part of a sibling group, and the average number of children adopted per family was 2.04 (SD = 1.08). These demographics indicate that for this sample foster-to-adopt is the modal permanency pathway, particularly for preadolescent children of color who are part of a sibling group. Compared to 2005 AFCARS data (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2006), the children in this sample are somewhat older (7.5 years v. 6.7), more likely to be African American (64.4% v. 30%), with a larger number of special needs related to emotional and behavioral issues. Compared to the UK Department of Health-funded study, <italic>Cost and outcomes of non-infant adoptions</italic> (Selwyn, Sturgess, Quinton, &amp; Baxter, 2010), which employed a case file review methodology as well as follow-up interviews, the children in this study were primarily minority (71.3% versus 1%), and were foster parent or kinship adoptions versus matched adoptions (70.7% versus 21%). Even though foster parent adoptions are the more common in the US than the UK evidence suggests that matched adoptions (29.3%) may be the most challenging subset of youth to place, requiring an array of information and media strategies to identify potential adoptive parents. While differences in populations, study variables and definitions, make it difficult to compare across samples, children in both of these studies were surprisingly similar on a number of other characteristics including gender, mean age (7.5 years) at adoption placement, and the percent of children whose biological mothers had major mental health problems (37.5% versus 41%).</p>
<p>Profile information on biological mothers indicates numerous adversities beginning with the capacity to provide basic care for one’s children. Mothers on average had 4.45 children to care for by the age of 31, yet the majority (64.1%) did not even complete a twelfth grade education. In addition, mothers experienced high rates of clinical comorbidity within and across mental health and substance abuse disorders. Within the mental health diagnoses mood disorders are rampant, with additional documentation of suicidal behaviors. While the data on biological fathers were too sparse and limited to analyze, dual parental genetic risk factor predispositions only increase transference odds for addiction or mood disorders, particularly in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310393548">Heath et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017310393548">Kendler, Jacobson, Prescott, &amp; Neale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017310393548">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Historically, child welfare does a poor job of gathering data on fathers, however, it is reasonable to assume that a significant portion of these youth also had fathers who abused alcohol and drugs, and may have had co-existing mental health and mood disorders. This only increases concerns regarding the transference odds that shared genetic and environmental risk brings to bear on adoptees and their parents.</p>
<p>Interpersonal losses and disruptions in caregiving also mark the histories of these children as evidenced by their adoptive status. For some (e.g. 18.8%), however, interpersonal losses included the actual deaths of siblings, parents, or caretakers. These youth may be more vulnerable to despondent or depressive reactions, including anniversary reactions and ongoing fears of abandonment. Awareness on the part of the youth as well as adoptive parents, and strategies for coping, support, and resolving grief issues may be particularly important. Because of space limitations, the focus of this article is to accurately chronicle child and biologic mother profile characteristics. It doesn’t include important information regarding permanency pathways, and the numerous placement and caregiving disruptions that many of these children experience as they travel to their finalized adoption. That is the subject of a companion article that will explore these issues in greater depth.</p>
<p>Clearly, the youth in this study have significant histories of victimization and maltreatment, including high rates of multiple maltreatment experiences (38.2%). Such detailed and comprehensive maltreatment histories may not easily be compiled by adoption or foster care staff, or well-translated to adoptive parents. It is important for adoption workers to be aware that multiple patterns of neglect and abuse may be more common than documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017310393548">Erich &amp; Leung, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017310393548">Sturgess &amp; Selwyn, 2007</xref>), and this information is important in formulating a comprehensive life history of adoptees. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017310393548">Sturgess and Selwyn (2007</xref>) report that 62 percent of adoptees in their UK study had suffered from multiple forms of child maltreatment. More comprehensive and detailed child maltreatment histories can focus and guide trauma informed care, and be helpful in parsing out the deleterious effects of different maltreatment patterns associated with emerging problem behaviors during later developmental periods. Given the rich and often detailed nature of the data collected for this study, it is still very limited in describing the frequency, intensity, and impact that maltreatment has on individual child functioning.</p>
<p>In summing the major child and biological mother risk factors reported in this study (i.e. child neglect + child physical abuse + child sexual abuse + child prenatal drug exposure + child positive toxicology screen at birth + maternal mental illness + maternal substance abuse + maternal homelessness + maternal history of domestic violence + parental incarceration + death of a significant person), youth averaged 4.7 (SD = 1.61) cumulative risk factors, not including poverty, multiple placement disruptions, and other potential risk factors (e.g. early sensory and nutritional deficits) not documented or reported here. In this sample, cumulative risk appears to be the norm, not the exception. Certain clusters of cumulative risk variables (e.g. intrauterine drug exposure, maternal history of mental retardation or developmental disabilities, homelessness, etc.) help to explain the high levels of neurocognitive deficits and developmental delays (34.8%) found in this cohort of adoptees.</p>
<sec id="sec15-1468017310393548"><title>Implications</title>
<p>How does such a detailing of child and biological parent characteristics inform child welfare service needs of at-risk families, domestic special needs adoptive children, and adoptive parents? First, modal adoption demographic profiles should be generated in a manner similar to what is conveyed in this article. Foster care and adoption agencies can then use profile information to help recruit and train appropriate parents, both foster and adoptive. Subgroups such as matched adoptions should be contrasted with the foster parent and kinship adoption groups to illuminate differences in youth characteristics and needs that may better inform recruitment and adoption training and support needs. For most adoption entities a wealth of historical case-file information already exists that, if aggregated and analyzed appropriately, can be highly informative to adoption practice.</p>
<p>Second, the profile of biological mothers who have lost custody of their children clearly explicates gaps in child welfare prevention planning. These gaps include the need for: a) earlier intervention to prevent unwanted pregnancies and/or to increase the duration of time between pregnancies; b) education programming to help teen moms complete high-school or obtain equivalency and educational or vocational degrees; and c) enrollment and retention in more effective substance abuse and dual disorder services, specifically those that focus on comorbid mood disorders. On average, biological mothers had 4.45 children to raise without the benefit of even a twelfth grade education. Parenting under these circumstances would be difficult for even the best of single mothers. Added to this maternal profile are high levels of corresponding poverty, unemployment, and clinical mental health and substance abuse comorbidities. Comprehensive child welfare approaches must move ‘upstream’ and employ community-level approaches to strengthening families and neighborhoods in ways that directly address teen pregnancy, school dropout, and addiction. Given strong biologic and genetic predisposition tendencies to mood and substance abuse disorders, and the high rates of intrauterine drug exposure (47.7%), early and ongoing monitoring and prevention programming is strongly indicated for special needs adoption children. Arguments for targeting these high-risk youth early on for such needed programming are further strengthened due to the fact that the parental data reported only include information on biological mothers. Public health secondary prevention strategies targeting substance abuse prevention are strongly indicated for special needs domestic adoptees. While foster care placements are particularly relevant settings from which to initiate early prevention curricula and programming, there appears to be a significant lack of activity around this issue in spite of the overwhelming evidence of risk for future substance abuse problems.</p>
<p>Third, the onset of early mental health issues, in conjunction with developmental delays, herald the need for strong, ongoing collaboration with schools and special education personnel, including teachers, occupational therapists, nurses, tutors, mental health professionals, and speech and language therapists. Educational achievement is critical for lifelong success. Educational supports and resources that address barriers to learning represent one important domain in a menu of comprehensive post-adoption support services. In the United States, educational settings increasingly are one of the primary referral and service delivery platforms for school-aged youth in need of mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017310393548">Center for Mental Health in Schools, 2008</xref>). If research findings tell us that such services may be needed for many domestic adoptees with special needs, then establishing these potential supports early on in the adoption process are necessary, and also may help to facilitate a greater pool of adoptive parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017310393548">Voices for Adoption, 2009</xref>). Adoptive parents need to be familiarized with mental health and educational supports and laws in the pre-adoption process, including resources and mechanisms to learn about and access such services later if needed.</p>
<p>Finally, the multiple maltreatment and adversity findings argue for conceptualizing adoption pathways from a cumulative risk and protective factor perspective. This appears to be particularly true for domestic adoptees whose special needs emanate from numerous risk factors and social adversities. The ability to view problematic child behaviors through an historical lens offers critical developmental context from which to understand adoptees and their struggles. In spite of the multitude of significant risk factors reliably chronicled by studies such as this, researchers, practitioners, and parents also need to appreciate the resiliency and protective side of the child development equation. While emerging literature on resilience suggests that it is the accumulation of risk factors, rather than the presence of one or two that affects child development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017310393548">Appleyard, Egeland, van Dulmen, &amp; Stroufe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017310393548">Fraser, Kirby, &amp; Smokowski, 2004</xref>), individual resiliency factors in combination with positive environmental factors such as nurturing adult supports (e.g. foster, kinship, adoptive), supportive school environments, and access to appropriate pre-adoption services and effective treatments are critical and substantive considerations interacting to influence developmental outcomes. A detailed summary of a child’s history would include the enumeration of these, and other mediating or protective factors, providing a more balanced depiction of the characteristics and capacities of these youth. Such a careful and full accounting, including a discussion of both risk and protective factors, strengths and weaknesses, should be supplemented with the use of anticipatory guidance approaches that emphasize effective prevention monitoring, and early intervention strategies, specifically timed to match a child’s developmental stage, and emerging needs. One key to successful adoptions is parental expectations, and the importance of helping parents to accurately understand their child’s needs in light of parental expectations. The better parents can understand, anticipate, and recognize emerging child needs, the more likely they will be to modify their expectations, and if necessary reach out for help. Of course, this often falsely assumes that the proper help is available and accessible when needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017310393548">Sturgess &amp; Selwyn, 2007</xref>). Policies supporting access to a range of effective, adoption-competent post-adoption services and supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310393548">Forbes &amp; Dziegielewski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017310393548">Jenson &amp; Fraser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017310393548">Sturgess &amp; Selwyn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017310393548">Voices for Adoption, 2009</xref>) are essential to long-term adoption success, and should be viewed in a public health context that addresses both current and anticipated needs of vulnerable youth from a risk, protection, and resilience framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017310393548">Jenson &amp; Fraser, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1468017310393548"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>The comprehensive, rigorous, and detailed nature of the case file review process provides an in-depth but laborious approach to profiling and describing the characteristics of special needs adoptive youth. Due to the rigorous case file review criteria that were used, only clearly documented maltreatment events or risk factors were coded as positive. By reason of the conservative criteria that were used to code positive events, there is a strong probability that higher proportions of parents and children had experienced risk and adversity factors that were not recorded or clearly captured in formal case file documentation. Indeed, on several variables related to biological mothers (i.e. homelessness, domestic violence, and victimization of the biological mother during childhood) higher rates of adversity were noted for the last 104 cases studied (the prospective cohort that was followed for two years), probably reflecting greater interest and attention in documenting these specific events.</p>
<p>Certainly the findings from this study only reflect the characteristics of the consecutively referred youth at one large US adoption program located in the state of Ohio from 1997 to 2005. While the time frame for this adoptee cohort is more current, and the data more comprehensive than previous studies have reported, the study findings cannot be generalized beyond this group. The use of consecutive referrals, however, increases generalizability within this cohort, and the level of variable detail and reliability allows for more accurate cross-study comparisons. In addition to the above-mentioned issues regarding underreporting and documentation, DSM-IV diagnostic reliability would be considerably improved if a standardized diagnostic tool was used across all cases. This is not the practice of most agencies, however, in this study diagnoses were made by licensed master’s level mental health professionals.</p>
