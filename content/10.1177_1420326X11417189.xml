<abstract>
<p>Dalyan, a Mediterranean coastal settlement in southwestern Turkey, is attracting a great deal of attention due to its natural and cultural value and tourism potential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Dalyan coastline and its environment as a public open space to find out whether the space meets the needs of users. Responses to a questionnaire were used to propose solutions for developing the area’s performance and identity.</p>
<p>First, the area was divided into six sub-spaces that were evaluated in terms of activities and uses, comfort and image, access and linkage, sociability and sensorial aspects and meeting the users’ expectations. Second, a face-to-face interview was conducted with 255 users. A visual analysis was also conducted. As a result of this research, various sectors of the society were brought together. This research illustrated that the coastline is the most popular sector of Dalyan, and if the suggested development takes place, it would provide an important social environment as well as an open space for community use due to the enhancement of the area’s visual quality and liveability.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11417189"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Settlements along Turkey’s 7,816 km of coastline are increasingly important because of their natural and cultural features. These settlements have characteristics that reflect the identity of the local environment and are attractive locations for tourism. However, spatial quality problems have occurred due to the intense use of some settlements and attempts to increase life quality.</p>
<p>Quality is defined as the judgment of users about a product and the scale of beliefs in fulfillment of expectations and needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11417189">1</xref>]. The quality of an architectural product depends on the performance of a building feature and whether the owner thinks it meets its intended purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11417189">2</xref>]. The mission of an urban planner and designer is to create the optimal living environment for users that will meet their physiological and psychological needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11417189">3</xref>]. When investigating the expectations and needs of users one must understand that basic needs are universal, but their order of importance change from culture to culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11417189">4</xref>]. Incremental increases in consciousness about visual values increases when one seeks to evaluate landscape quality.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is a matter of some sensitivity that the quality, liveability and visual assets of coastal settlements are regarded as increasingly important. Visual analyses made with this in mind can play an important role in helping to establish the identity of an area so that negative perceptions can be identified and remedied through improving and enhancing landscape quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11417189">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Visual analysis studies are done to determine the quality of a place. Looking at the interaction of its visual elements is a significant tool that guides the processes of physical planning, design, implementation and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11417189">6</xref>]. These kinds of studies are conducted with the aim of revealing the life qualities of settlements by analyzing their landscape features and understanding spatial improvements that could be made to meet the expectations of the users. They involve the analysis of the physical environment using a visual method and incorporate users’ views that can serve many different purposes.</p>
<p>This visual analysis of the Dalyan coastal settlement had the following purposes:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To make spatial evaluations about the coastline through revealing natural and cultural landscape features of the town</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To determine the performance of the space by evaluating its availability, therefore enabling the town to acquire a more modern identity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To enrich its usage as a public open space by increasing its attractiveness</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To guide the local governments</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To be a reference for analytic and evaluative studies on spaces with similar features.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11417189" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>The main material used in the study was a document on the redesign of the Dalyan coastline implemented by the municipality of Dalyan in 2008. In addition, written sources, construction plans, photographs obtained from studies and observations conducted in the area, notes and visual analyses along with questionnaires were used as auxiliary materials in the research.</p>
<p>According to a census completed in 2007, 2,229 of the total population determined as 4,393 comprises men while 2,164 of it comprises women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11417189">7</xref>]. Dalyan is a town located in the Ortaca District of Muğla and takes its name from a channel that is 5 miles long. In 3000 BC, the ancient city of Caunos was located near the channel between the lake and sea. The remains of an acropolis, agora, two military and commercial ports, a theatre, a temple and a bathhouse can still be seen in the town [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11417189">8</xref>]. Iztuzu beach is situated east of the area where Köyceğiz Lake connects to the sea via the mouth of Dalyan channel, and Dalyan Beach, located to the west of this area, is known as one of the most important breeding grounds of the sea turtle in the Mediterranean. Dalyan’s estuary and channels are covered with reeds, another important part of this ecosystem. <italic>Trionyx triunguis</italic>, a soft-shell turtle that makes its home in the channels, is in danger of extinction. In addition to rich fish species, <italic>Callinectes sapidus</italic> is a species of blue crab that also lives in the channels and lakes and is another valuable resource peculiar to the Mediterranean. Köyceğiz, Dalyan’s wetland complex, harbours 180 bird species. It is the breeding ground for two species, <italic>Halcyon smyrnensis</italic> and <italic>Ceryle rudis,</italic> whose numbers decrease day by day in Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11417189">9</xref>]. Because of these features was named a “Special Environmental Protection Area” by the Turkish Cabinet on 12 December 1988 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11417189">10</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11417189">Figure 1</xref>).

</p>
<p>Some of the factors that were influential in choosing the town as a research area are that it is located in a special environmental protection area; it is relatively less developed in terms of tourism though it is close to many famous tourism centres, and it has preserved its unique natural and historical values for 5,000 years. Being a breathing and meeting space for users strengthened the choice of Dalyan coastline as a research area. In addition, no scientific studies are available to guide the physical planning and design of the settlement.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X11417189"><title>Developing Forms</title>
<p>Visual analysis and a questionnaire were used in this spatial evaluation conducted about the Dalyan coastline and its surrounding environment. Firstly, the borders of the research area were determined, and a visual analysis and questionnaires were developed to be used in the fieldwork. The design border of the coastline that was redesigned and implemented by the municipality was accepted as the research area border, and the analysis and questionnaire studies were conducted within this area. Following the preliminary observations conducted in the research area, six sub-spaces were observed to discover their features. The spaces were named with the abbreviations S1 through S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11417189">Figure 3</xref>).

Within the scope of visual analysis study, the research evaluated the following four areas: Activities and Uses, Comfort and Image, Access and Linkage and Sociability. There were 34 sub-titles under the 4 main areas that were scored between 1 (lowest) and 5 (highest). In this way, a numerical determination was made with regard to the space. At the end of the evaluation, point averages were determined for each sub-title and comparisons were calculated. The second part of the visual analysis study was a sensorial evaluation in which there were 13 adjective pairs made, and “1 point” was graded as most negative and “5 points” was graded as most positive in evaluation of each adjective couple. In the second stage, questionnaire was conducted on the users by means of standardized question forms in order to evaluate user views.</p>
<p>A simple random sampling method used to determine the number of people who would be surveyed was conducted; a 90% confidence level and 5% sampling error were used as the basis of the calculations. There were a total of 4 open-ended and 18 close-ended questions in the questionnaire aimed at learning the user’s views and revealing user satisfaction. The population of Dalyan (4,393) was used as the population size (<italic>N</italic>) and the number of users on whom the survey would be conducted was determined as 255 (254.96) at the end. Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1420326X11417189">1</xref>) was used to determine the sample size for the survey.

<p>The observational study revealed that outdoor furnitures were used in appropriate places, but there, users experienced problems with its quality. Plant material was better quality than the structural material; features such as Rock Tombs, boats, and reeds have made positive contributions to the identity of the space, serving as symbolic elements.</p>
<p>The study indicated that the most inadequate spaces in terms of quality of outdoor furniture were S1 and S5, and the visual contribution of structural material was lowest in these sub-spaces.

<p>This study revealed that visitors could easily access the spaces on foot, and there was a sufficient level of separation from the environment for physical control purposes. People rated the ability of public transportation vehicles to access the area and parking facilities in the area as moderately acceptable, but the guidance system had to be handled again. Respondents indicated that parking areas in S1 and S2 sub-spaces were very insufficient and said that accessibility for public transportation vehicles in the S1 sub-space was insufficient. All of the sub-spaces were rated rather insufficiently in terms of information – communication and guidance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1420326X11417189">Table 5</xref>).

<p>The second part of the visual analysis study concentrated on the sensorial aspects of the sites. Respondents graded each sub-space using numbers between 1 and 5. Averages were taken at the end of evaluation, and in this way, sub-spaces were compared with one another. Thirteen pairs of adjectives were used in the sensorial evaluations.</p>
<p>It was determined that the research area was generally perceptible, roomy and relaxing, and most users felt safe (averages are 4.0, 4.3, 3.7 and 3.7, respectively). It was determined that S5 sub-space was more complex, unkempt, monotonous, unclean and ordinary compared to the other sub-spaces.

<sec id="sec11-1420326X11417189"><title>Evaluation and Synthesis</title>
<p>The following sections report on the results of the visual analysis studies conducted with regard to the Dalyan coastline and its surroundings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1420326X11417189"><title>Evaluating the Results in Terms of Activities and Uses</title>
<p>The area generally provides an opportunity for passive recreational activities and it is appropriate for these also physically. However, the area could be developed to support water-based recreational activities.</p>
<p>In research area, existence of eating and sitting opportunities, existence of a square which will take on the function of gathering particularly in S4 sub-space, closeness of S3 sub-space to this square and its involving sitting elements, S6 sub-spaces involving playground as well as eating places enrich the space by increasing activity variety. This situation causes more users to congregate in these sub-spaces. It is also necessary to strengthen the physical structure in sub-spaces such as S1 where fewer users gather and to restructure these spaces to address different user groups.</p>
<p>Respondents indicated their dislike of certain environmental factors, such as the temperature, humidity and wind in all of the sub-spaces. Particularly in the summer months, the humidity increases would negatively affect users. Therefore, developing an active water element or games and natural and artificial shading components might eradicate the negative influences of natural environmental factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1420326X11417189"><title>Evaluating the Results in Terms of Comfort and Image</title>
<p>A majority of the users indicated that the research area is inadequate in terms of comfort. They indicated that S2 and S5 were the most inadequate sub-spaces that need to be developed. Some participants reacted negatively to the quality of outdoor furniture and visual contribution of structural material to the space. Broken seats and neglect of lawns negatively influenced the image of the research area even though most people had a positive reaction to the plantscape. Even though the Rock Tombs and reeds have made Dalyan famous worldwide, people said the weak structural elements make great contribution to the image of the area as a symbolic element. The respondents indicated that the tombs have a picturesque that brings visitors to Dalyan.</p>
<p>The large number of boats leads was disruptive in some sub-spaces and decreased some users’ ability to enjoy viewing the reeds or the channel. However, others said that boats enliven the research area and make a visual contribution to it. Therefore, it might be necessary to decrease the number of boats allowed in the channel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1420326X11417189"><title>Evaluating the Space in Terms of Access and Linkage</title>
<p>The research indicated that S1 is the most inadequate sub-space in terms of access and linkage. In addition, respondents pointed out that the information communication and guidance system was weak. Because the entire research area is highly accessible to those on foot, it would be appropriate for all sub-spaces to be developed for pedestrian use. However, parking facilities must be increased in the close environment, particularly for those coming to the space from outside the Dalyan settlement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1420326X11417189"><title>Evaluating Research Area in Terms of Sociability</title>
<p>The study showed that all of the sub-spaces except for S1 and S5 are appropriate for group use and gatherings. The S1 and S5 sub-spaces must be developed. Existence of a square, seating areas and places to eat would contribute to gatherings of society’s different sectors. In addition, creating facilities for different income groups throughout the research area would positively increase the chance that a variety of people would gather there.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1420326X11417189"><title>Evaluating Coastline in Terms of Sensorial Aspect</title>
<p>The study results show that the research area is above the average in the sensory pleasures it can provide to the visitors. However, it is necessary to increase its originality and dynamism and to make improvements that will make the space more entertaining. In particular, S1 and S5 sub-spaces need to be spruced up, and they are monotonous compared to other sub-spaces. The lawns and structural elements in the area need further improvement work. Limited activity opportunities in S1 and S5 areas have caused the spaces to become less lively than others. Most participants indicated that the sub-spaces were attractive. However, the appeal of the spaces must be increased by bringing their symbolic features to the forefront (placing boards and statues that introduce the Rock Tombs and <italic>Caretta carettas</italic>, better illumination of Rock Tombs, etc). The natural appearance of the spaces has been protected, except in the S4 sub-space, where there is a lot of concrete paving and insufficient plants in the space, making it appear more artificial. The sub-space must be integrated with the natural structures dominant in other sub-spaces by choosing better structural and vegetable materials.</p>
<p>• Participants were asked open-ended and closed-ended questions (demographic questions, rating scale questions, compulsory and optional questions) in order to reveal details about the user’s profile, his or her to the space, purposes in visiting, frequency and duration of visits, the physical and sensorial structure of the research area and opinions about the research area.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the answers given by survey participants to these questions revealed the following opinions: <italic>activity variety insufficient; research area generally used for passive activities like taking a walk, resting, viewing the scenery;</italic> natural <italic>– cultural feature and location of the area’s being influential in preferring the area, the area is described as green, relaxing, attractive etc. These findings</italic> support expert views.</p>
<p>It is seen that boats come to forefront among environmental factors influencing the use of spaces negatively. At this point, boats’ narrowing fields of vision of people become the main factor.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, respondents to the questionnaire indicated that spaces were generally used in summer months and on weekends, despite high temperatures and humidity. The increased intensity of use in summer months paralleled the opening of the tourism season.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1420326X11417189"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The research determined that the Dalyan coastline and the surrounding environment met the users’ spatial expectations (User satisfaction, satisfied: 55.8%, partly satisfied: 34.3% and unsatisfied: 9.9%). The ratings of the sub-spaces were at the medium level according to the expert view (general average values: activities and uses, 2.9; comfort and image, 2.0; access and linkage, 3.2; sociability, 3.3 and sensorial evaluation, 3.5), and respondents indicated it was necessary to develop S1 and S5 sub-spaces in terms of activities and uses, comfort and image, access and linkage and sociability. Participants indicated that current activities were not adequate, and it was necessary to develop the area, particularly in terms of active recreational activities and that the attractiveness of Dalyan needed to be increased by bringing elements symbolizing Dalyan to the forefront.</p>
