<p>In 2010, two multistate consortia were awarded funding under the Race to the Top initiative: the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.parcconline.org">www.parcconline.org</ext-link>) and the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.smarterbalanced.org">www.smarterbalanced.org</ext-link>). The purpose of funding each consortium was to provide financial support to enable them to design an assessment system for use in improving teaching and learning and to measure student readiness for college and careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146621612458175">U.S. Department of Education, 2012</xref>). Currently, the two consortia are undertaking the work necessary to develop these comprehensive systems to help move K-12 assessment into the future. A key component in these newly developed systems will be the implementation of computer-based assessment (formative, interim, and summative; either linear or computer adaptive).</p>
<p>Based on individual papers from the 2010 Maryland Assessment Research Center for Education Success (MARCES) conference, <italic>Computers and Their Impact on State Assessments</italic> is a thorough presentation of the issues related to computer-based assessment in a K-12 environment. The book comprises an introductory chapter followed by 10 chapters that are broken down into three sections: computer-based testing and its implementation in state assessments (Chapters 2-5), technical and psychometric challenges and innovations (Chapters 6-10), and predictions for the future (Chapter 11). In Chapter 1, Hong Jiao and Robert Lissitz provide an overview of the different types of computer-based assessments and introduce some of the challenges of delivering each of them. In addition, the first chapter also includes a short description of each subsequent chapter in the book.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 begins by providing a historical account of the use of technology in educational assessment. This is followed by a brief discussion of the current state of affairs, in terms of the use of technology in educational assessment. Finally, John Poggio and Linette McJunkin summarize some of the benefits, as well as the potential obstacles, to moving toward computer-based assessment in a K-12 setting.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, authored by Vincent Dean and Joseph Martineau, expands on the benefits and challenges of computer-based assessment from the state perspective. An overview of the current state and federal accountability requirements is provided. In addition, findings from a survey of statewide technology, including the number of states that currently use various types of computer-based assessment, are presented.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 offers a comprehensive overview of the necessary preparations a state needs to go through when transitioning to computer-based testing. This chapter is authored by Walter Way and Robert Kirkpatrick, and provides an interesting perspective on (a) how to retain contractor services, (b) strategies for transitioning from paper-and-pencil to computer testing, and (c) considerations for test delivery, comparability studies, and scoring models from a test vendor’s perspective.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, authored by Richard Luecht, summarizes the eight systems that need to be carefully thought through to implement a quality computer-based testing program: (a) item development and banking, (b) test assembly and publishing, (c) registration and scheduling, (d) test delivery, (e) managing and transmitting results, (f) post-administration psychometric analyses required, (g) score reporting and communication of results, and (h) quality control and assurance. This chapter helps to lay out a valuable plan for implementation.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 introduces the concepts of innovative test items and forms that can be used in a computer-based assessment system. Kathleen Scalise discusses how test items have changed with the advancement of technology and provides examples of some innovative items such as digital simulations and digital games. Also presented is a taxonomy of item formats for test construction where types of items are organized based on complexity and the degree of constraint on answer options (ranging from fully constrained multiple choice items to unconstrained essay items).</p>
<p>Chapter 7, authored by David Williamson, focuses on using evidence-centered design (ECD) as a foundation for scoring performance items. Examples of various design and scoring models that can be used with ECD, as well as scoring methods, are given. The author also presents an in-depth discussion of the benefits of automated scoring, or scoring using computer algorithms, in comparison to human scoring. Many of the challenges associated with this type of scoring are also addressed.</p>
<p>In Chapter 8, Hua-Hua Chang introduces cognitive diagnostic modeling (CDM). The author presents work done to help implement a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for the purpose of cognitive diagnosis. Internet-browser-based applications for delivering CATs in a cost-effective manner and in a school setting are discussed.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 expands on the information in Chapter 8 in the context of benchmark tests. This chapter is a detailed account of Terry Ackerman, Robert Henson, Ric Luecht, and John Willse’s work to transition a paper-and-pencil benchmark test to a CAT. The authors explain CDM and a standard setting procedure where teachers developed a pool of items based on given attributes, items were pretested, and another set of teachers classified test items by attributes. Finally, the authors discuss how they will use the results of this initial work to convert the benchmark test to a multistage CAT, where bundles of items are adaptive, rather than single items.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 by G. Gage Kingsbury and Steven Wise presents information on vertical scaling and scale stability. Results from a research study looking at item drift, and its impact on test scores and test validity are presented. The authors also cover the topics of student engagement and motivation as a measure of individual score validity. Finally, techniques to improve tests such as incorporating student interests and improving item selection are presented.</p>
<p>The final chapter details some of the implications for the future of assessment within what Kristen E. DiCerbo and John T. Behrens refer to as a <italic>digital ocean</italic>. This term refers to how daily activities (e.g., online usage tracking) can now easily be recorded as data. The authors present a four-process delivery model for assessment—task selection, presentation, evidence identification, and evidence accumulation—and discuss how these four processes may differ within the digital ocean.</p>
<p>With the recent formation of the two aforementioned consortia, both of which will be developing computer-based assessment systems, the timing of this book couldn’t be better. Computers are going to play a major role in the next generation of state assessments, and this book provides an excellent overview of the challenges and considerations associated with technology-based assessment. This book is very reader-friendly, while still remaining quite thought provoking. Many readers who are relatively new to computer-based testing may find themselves thinking of answers to practical implementation questions that they have not yet, or would not have ever, considered.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the book chapters are based on individual papers from conference proceedings. This makes the book unique as it offers multiple perspectives on the broad topic of statewide computer-based assessment; however, it also results in some overlap in content from chapter to chapter. The overlap primarily occurs in the introductory paragraphs of the chapters where many authors provide a brief overview of topics such as Race to the Top and the Common Core State Standards; however, there is also some overlap in the more technical aspects of the book (e.g., same psychometric models given in more than one chapter). As such, readers may find themselves skimming over some sections that contain very similar or identical content.</p>
<p>While this book covers many topics, there were a few that I would have liked to have seen expanded on. For example, computer-based assessments allow for enhanced student accessibility options. The ability to enlarge text or change the screen contrast at a click of a button, the use of sign language avatars, and even options for Braille will improve accessibility and the testing experience for many students. I would have appreciated a more in-depth discussion of this and other specialized topics.</p>
<p>In general, this book is an important read for those transitioning to computer-based assessment. While the focus of the book is on assessment in a K-12 environment, the audience need not be limited to this group. Many of the issues and potential solutions presented in this book are relevant to any program beginning to implement computer-based assessments including licensure and certification, higher education, and admissions testing.</p>
<p>I see the target audience for this book as twofold. The first section of the book may best be suited for K-12 assessment coordinators and policy makers who will be involved in the decision making and process of converting existing assessments to computer. The practical suggestions for implementing a computer-based testing program that are brought forth in these chapters would be invaluable for this audience. It is important to note, however, that while the first section presents information in a highly conceptual manner, it would be helpful for the reader to have a general understanding of basic testing and psychometric terminology.</p>
<p>The second section of the book, which takes a more technical approach, is targeted more toward psychometricians and those who will be faced with the data challenges that will come with next generation assessments and innovative test items. These chapters present some of the issues that revolve around item scoring, modeling, and test equating, as well as offer some possible solutions to those issues.</p>
<p>Although moving from paper-based assessment to computer-based assessment is no small task, once implemented, there is the potential for great rewards. Students and teachers can benefit from nearly instantaneous test results and tailored assessments. Districts and states can benefit from cost-effective test delivery. Educational research can also benefit from the exciting possibilities for studying learning processes, educational outcomes, and student growth, when student performance data are abundant. As we enter into this next generation, it is my opinion that <italic>Computers and Their Impact on State Assessments</italic> will provide the guidance necessary to help build a successful computer-based assessment program.</p>
