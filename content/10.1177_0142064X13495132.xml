<abstract>
<p>Traces of the Roman triumph have been identiﬁed in the procession narratives in Mk 11 and 15, but how its themes should be understood to function in Mark’s telling has never achieved consensus. Reading these narratives alongside evidence for the Roman triumph demonstrates how the <italic>ritual logic</italic> of the triumph allowed Mark to exploit the degradation of Jesus’ passion, undermine the performance of Roman power and portray Jesus as a king, and a threat to Rome. The Roman triumph paradoxically magnified triumphal victims, presented kings as ideal victims, and drew a close parallel between the victim’s kingly status and the conqueror’s grandeur. Mark employs the logic of the triumph to transform Jesus’ status as victim into an assertion of his authority, so that Jesus’ execution by Roman agents emerges as a ritualized assertion of Jesus’ Davidic kingship. In this article, Mark emerges as a cultural <italic>bricoleur</italic> who co-opts Roman spectacle in order to naturalize Rome’s dominant language, symbols and practices, thereby translating them to the purposes of gospel.</p>

<title>Introduction<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142064X13495132">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>In his book <italic>Christ is the Question</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142064X13495132">Wayne Meeks (2006</xref>: 76-77) imagines the situation of early followers of Jesus coping with his death: ‘They faced a massive hermeneutical dilemma: interpret or despair. The movement did not despair. For the earliest formative remnant of them the paradoxical notion that God’s anointed vice regent was ignominiously killed became the generative center of their beliefs.’ This sense of the ‘hermeneutical dilemma’ of early Christians has occupied New Testament scholarship for more than a century, and has dictated the way that this literature is understood to interface with its cultural milieu. The cultural milieu that has been understood to lie behind the New Testament text has usually been that of the nascent Jewish literary culture in which the New Testament was nurtured, or the sub-literary and popular Greek literature that was most similar to the context of its composition.</p>
<p>However, during the 1980s, and especially after the landmark essay by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X13495132">David Aune (1983)</xref> on Roman court and cult ceremonial as a source for the liturgical arrangement of the Apocalypse of John, Rome and Roman religious ritual emerged as an increasingly signiﬁcant resource for contextualizing the New Testament.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X13495132">2</xref></sup> The implicit importance of <italic>ritual</italic> for conceptualizing the practices, expositions and narratives of the New Testament raised a whole series of previously unconsidered questions. One of the less noticed readings that developed in this new venue in scholarship suggested that the narratives of Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem and procession to cruciﬁxion in Mk 11 and 15 are described in parallel to the Roman triumph—the civic ritual that celebrated victorious Roman generals as gods, who paraded their tyrannical adversaries, as well as spoils and plunder from foreign nations, through the city to the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. This suggestion was certainly creative, but it failed to convince many.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Markan narrative can be shown to parallel the Roman triumph, not in terms of a <italic>narrative</italic> parallel, but with respect to the <italic>ritual</italic> movements, symbolic categories, and performative logic employed in the Roman triumph. When one considers the discussion of triumphal themes by Greek-speaking Roman subjects and attends to the accounts of the triumph of Titus and Vespasian in Josephus’s <italic>Jewish War</italic> 7.5.4-6, which reflected the immediate context of Mark’s Gospel, it becomes more plausible still. Mark’s narrative exhibits an eclectic bricolage of appropriated cultural and religious source material that borrows the <italic>logic</italic> of the Roman triumph, which paradigmatically imagined a republican, Roman general celebrating the defeat of a tyrannical, kingly adversary, in order to innovate an ingenious choreography for the procession of a victorious victim of Roman power, whose royal majesty is conﬁrmed by his being made an ignominious spectacle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X13495132">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Approaches to Jesus’ Processions in Mark 11 and 15</title>
<p>Mark’s imitation of Roman triumphal themes has tended to be considered as a mocking parody that intentionally subverts Roman authority. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0142064X13495132">Schmidt (1995</xref>: 1-2), who proposed the most sustained reading of the passion narrative in Mk 15.16-32 alongside the Roman triumph, considers the cruciﬁxion narrative in Mark to be an ‘anti-triumph’ that works ‘to suggest that the seeming scandal of the cross is actually an exaltation of Christ’. He claims that the ritual supplies the best unifying scheme of the details in Mark, which he sees—following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0142064X13495132">Gundry (1993</xref>: esp. 1-26)—as an extended apology for the cross. As such, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0142064X13495132">Schmidt (1995</xref>: 1) parallels the events of Mark’s narrative to what he deems to be the ritual’s constituent parts. These include the gathering of the army, the dressing of the victor, the leading of the victim and the spoils, the march to the Capitoline Hill and the sacriﬁce of the victim or victims. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0142064X13495132">Schmidt (1995</xref>: 6) admits that the parallels he draws between Mark’s narrative and the Roman triumph vary in strength of credibility, but he insists that the details are too deliberate to be accounted for otherwise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X13495132">4</xref></sup> Even so, this analysis has been largely ignored.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X13495132">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other scholars follow Schmidt’s instinct, but tend to relocate the triumphal themes elsewhere in Mark’s narrative and construe them without the strictures of deliberate parallel. Many of these studies diverge from Schmidt’s approach and ﬁnd this imagery resonating in the scene of Jesus’ so-called triumphal entry to Jerusalem in Mk 11.1-11. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0142064X13495132">Tatum (1998)</xref> reads the triumphal entry as a mockery of Roman triumphal imagery through the polyvalent signiﬁcance of the ass that Jesus rides. He calls attention to the ass as a messianic referent and an oft-used piece of anti-Jewish/Christian imagery, exempliﬁed in the Alexamenos grafﬁto and the legend from <italic>Against Apion</italic>, where Josephus refutes the claim that the Jerusalem temple housed the head of an ass.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X13495132">6</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0142064X13495132">Tatum (1998</xref>: 133) acknowledges the resonance with the Roman triumph, and remarks on the <italic>return</italic> to one’s city as a central characteristic of the Roman practice. He writes, ‘here the conquering general enters not the vanquished city but returns to appropriate his own city of Rome’. Unfortunately, Tatum does not develop this insight further. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142064X13495132">Catchpole (1984)</xref> reads the entrance not as a literal triumph, but as a member of a ‘family of stories’ detailing a celebrated entry into a city by a heroic ﬁgure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0142064X13495132">7</xref></sup> He suggests that Mark’s account includes various shared elements with these kinds of narratives, including a victory ascribed to the hero, ceremonial entry, acclamations of the hero with invocations of God, entry to the city climaxing at a temple, and ﬁnally a cultic act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142064X13495132">Catchpole 1984</xref>: 321). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142064X13495132">Catchpole (1984</xref>: 334) insists that the account in Mark has been ‘welded into a single whole’ by the combined forces of an already-existing Jewish pattern and Mark’s ‘post-Easter Christological conviction’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0142064X13495132">Duff (1992)</xref> contradicts the notion that the narrative in Mark is triumphal in any sense, claiming that it is at best a comedic appropriation of triumphal symbolism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0142064X13495132">Duff (1992</xref>: 67-68), drawing signiﬁcantly on the parallel to Zech. 14, sees in Mark’s depiction a comedic anti-climax where, in 11.11, Jesus ‘entered Jerusalem and went into the temple and, after looking around at everything’, abruptly leaves the temple and the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0142064X13495132">8</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142064X13495132">Brent Kinman (1999)</xref> has sought to expand the presuppositions of this project and characterize the entry narrative as a παρουσία, or celebratory welcome, examples of which appear throughout ancient texts where dignitaries, royals and conquerors are narrated to be approaching cities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142064X13495132">Kinman (1999</xref>: 281) writes that, ‘the arrival of a royal or other dignitary was an occasion for an ostentatious display designed to court the favor and/or placate the wrath of the visiting celebrity’. To substantiate this claim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142064X13495132">Kinman (1999</xref>: 281-83) draws up a substantial list of historical examples of these παρουσίαι, including those of Attalus (Polybius 16.25.1-9), Mithridates (Diodorus Siculus 37.26; Cicero, <italic>Letters to Atticus</italic> 5.16), Demetrius (Plutarch, <italic>Life of Demetrius</italic> 8.4-9.1) and Alexander (Josephus, <italic>Antiquities</italic> 11.8.4-5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0142064X13495132">9</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0142064X13495132">Yarbro Collins (2007</xref>: 516) follows Kinman by calling attention to the narrative of Vespasian’s παρουσίαι in Josephus’s <italic>Jewish War</italic> 7.4.1 as a distinct entrance from the depiction of the triumph of Vespasian and Titus in 7.5.3-6.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0142064X13495132">10</xref></sup> In Vespasian’s παρουσία at Rome, the city’s inhabitants receive the general in a grandiose manner. The city saw him as their savior from the social upheaval of the previous two years, and addressed him as such. This section even incorporates the cultic fluidity of temple space, with the city itself playing the role of the temple: ‘The whole city, moreover, was ﬁlled, like a temple, with garlands and incense. Having reached the palace, though with difﬁculty, owing to the multitude that thronged around him, he offered sacriﬁces of thanksgiving for his arrival to the household gods.’</p>
<p>The diversity of these narratives illustrates the general importance that spectacles of power held in antiquity. It is all the more difﬁcult to imagine that παρουσία narratives, such as those in Josephus or in the imagery in the post-entry narrative in Mk 12.10-11 that alludes to Ps. 118 (117), could be imaginable <italic>apart</italic> from their military apogee in the Roman triumph, since these texts were written in the immediate shadow of Rome’s triumph over Jerusalem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X13495132">11</xref></sup> Moreover, the citations of the Psalms throughout Mk 11–16 complicate the logic of the practice at play here, by bringing their own ritual echoes into this text and specifying the regal victim of the triumphal procession as explicitly Davidic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X13495132">Ahearne-Kroll (2007)</xref> has persuasively argued that Mk 10–12 associates David with Jesus deliberately to downplay the militaristic aspects of Davidic messiahship, while the implicitly ritual voice of David in the psalms of lament patterns the passion narrative in Mk 14–16.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X13495132">12</xref></sup> Drawing non-martial associations between Jesus and the most supremely royal ﬁgure of the Jewish tradition in this narrative of Roman domination suggests that the category of kingship itself is being maneuvered here by Mark for some underlying purpose.</p>
<p>This line of scholarship has strongly suggested that <italic>something</italic> is going on here that models itself after Roman displays of power, but these accounts point to no literary explanation that brings these divergent tropes together. Clearly, if these tropes were intended as narrative parallels, they failed in their execution. However, the sense that triumphal themes still <italic>function</italic> in Mk 11 and 15 remains even among scholars who are not convinced that the narrative makes this explicit. That this sense persists despite the irresolvability of their approaches suggests that a cohesive explanation of how the triumphal motifs function in the Markan narrative is still needed.</p>

<title>Uncontrollable Gaze and Ritual Polysemy in the Roman Triumph</title>
<p>Since Mark has been read alongside narratives of victorious procession, the function and logic of the Roman triumph has undergone its own reassessment; recent studies have sought to move past a ‘script’ of the ritual and its elements, and have refocused attention on its role as a symbolic mechanism of civic life in Rome. This re-setting of the scholarly agenda has brought to bear how little we can say categorically about the Roman triumph. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0142064X13495132">Stroup (2007</xref>: 31) remarks that, working largely from literary evidence, ‘we know [the triumph] was big. We know it was popular. We know it was important. But we just don’t know exactly what it <italic>was</italic>.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X13495132">Beard (2007</xref>: 118) similarly cautions against codiﬁed deﬁnitions of the Roman triumph and comments, ‘many of the basic “facts” and practical details … are hard, if not impossible to pin down’. It variously entailed the celebration of military victory, the lauding of a conquering general and assertion of his (momentary) divinity, the humiliation of a foreign land, the brutal execution of the defeated general, leader or king, as well as a cultic component spanning the city, and it oriented topographically toward the temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, where the triumphator would celebrate with a sacriﬁce. But these elements should be understood as the recollections of observers that survive as carved in stone and inscribed on pages; we do not have access to Roman triumphs—we only have evidence of how various peoples <italic>experienced</italic> Roman triumphs and how subjects and citizens of Rome memorialized them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0142064X13495132">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beard’s influential study focuses on the ritual context that structured the triumph, as well as the participation of observers in dictating what the triumph <italic>did</italic>. She imagines it as a practice of dynamic cultural exchange rather than an individualized celebration of Roman victors. The Roman triumph was not a decorous rehearsal of Roman power, but rather a staged performing of martial Romanness in the view of civilians who were increasingly aloof from the world that Rome was conquering.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0142064X13495132">14</xref></sup> As Josephus narrates the conclusion of Vespasian and Titus’s triumph (<italic>Jewish War</italic> 7.5.6), ‘For the city of Rome kept festival that day for her victory in the campaign against her enemies, for the termination of her civil dissensions, and for her dawning hopes of felicity.’ Additionally, it served to showcase the global realities precipitated by Roman domination. In this way, Beard focuses on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142064X13495132">Butler (1997</xref>: 25) identiﬁes as the ‘material’ aspect of ritual performance. Butler writes, ‘ritual is material to the extent that it is productive, that is, it produces the belief that appears to be “behind” it’. The visual materiality of the triumphal ritual produced the ‘belief’ in Roman power, imperial divinity, and the global scope of Roman authority, but insofar as this materiality was constructed by <italic>foreign</italic> objects, people and symbols, the triumph itself became a complex of cultural exchange that could be exploited by Roman subjects even as they were exploited by Roman authorities.</p>
<p>Josephus, whose account of the triumph of Vespasian and Titus is the most closely relevant triumphal account to the Markan context, portrays the materiality of the triumph in visual terms by presenting it primarily as a performative spectacle. His account begins:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is impossible adequately to describe the multitude of those spectacles (τῶν θεαμάτων ἐκείνων τὸ πλῆθοϛ) and their magniﬁcence under every conceivable aspect (τὴν μεγαλοπρέπειαν ἐν ἅπασιν οἶϛ ἄν τιϛ ἐπινοήσειεν), whether in works of art or diversity of riches or natural rarities; for almost all the objects which men who have ever been blessed by fortune have acquired one by one—the wonder and precious productions of various nations—by the collective exhibition on that day displayed the majesty of the Roman empire (ταῦτα ἐπὶ τῆϛ ἡμέραϛ ἐκείνηϛ ἀθρόα τῆϛ Ρωμαίων ἡγεμονίαϛ ἔδειξε τὸ μέγεθοϛ) (<italic>Jewish War</italic> 7.4.5).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This re-enactment of victory and performance of war suggests the central role that the visibility of defeat served, but it also illustrates how spectacle resulted in the symbolic ambiguity between the victor and victim. No matter the force of domination evident in rehearsing these victories, the unquestionable result of Romans celebrating their victory was to give center stage to the victims of Roman military prowess in the precincts of Rome itself.</p>
<p>The choreography of such presentations was intentional at one level; Rome was served by being seen as victorious over powerful and threatening barbarians. However, even the performers of ritual cannot control the visage of those observers who are also participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X13495132">Beard (2007</xref>: 136) presents this as a central dilemma for triumphal celebrations: ‘this problem underlies all mass spectacle: how do you control the gaze of the viewer?’ For all its efﬁciency in scripting the world, ritual also translates its script into viewability, and thus initiates a mimetic sequence of presentation and representation that subjects the spectacle to viewers who necessarily introduce their own hermeneutic. This is not an unintentional by-product of ritual practices—it is constitutive of its logic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13495132">Bell (1992</xref>: 184) remarks that ‘symbols and symbolic actions not only fail to communicate clear and shared understandings, but the obvious ambiguity … of symbolism may even be integral to its efﬁcacy’. Memorialization via spectacle was always out of the control of the victor once it was enacted, and thus its persuasiveness as a positive memorial was never certain for the triumphator. Moreover, the manufacturing of this celebration of Roman victory was never entirely hidden from the viewer, who would not be able to ignore its fabricated elements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142064X13495132">Östenberg (2009</xref>: 5) goes so far as to suggest that the triumph was <italic>primarily</italic> an imitative spectacle, even in its exhibition of Roman power. She writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>[I]n the theatrical context of representation, imitation, and performance, [even] the triumphator played but one role in the game; he was no god, no king, but dressed up as god and king for the day, acting in the shadowland between reality and representation. The triumphator, as everything else, was imitation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Every triumphal spectacle, then, depended on an unﬁxed logic that was characterized by a symbolic polyvalence and a tendency for its categories, movements and subjects to bleed across boundaries. In some sense, the Roman triumph was intended to be a rehearsal of the defeat of foreign powers, and thus the captives of the conquest play an important role as representatives of those who had been defeated, as they were carted through Rome in front of the victorious general who had defeated them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0142064X13495132">15</xref></sup> But the necessarily exotic nature of these defeated nations entailed a doubled-spectacle that could not help but portray the victor and victim in fluid terms. The grandiosity of the victor mirrored and was mirrored by the splendor of the defeated king and the spoils of his kingdoms. By this ritual doubling, the Roman triumph was able to revel in its expansive global dominance while at the same time helping to naturalize otherwise unfamiliar people and cultures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142064X13495132">Östenberg (2009</xref>: 9) has argued that ‘the triumph possessed characteristics that made it particularly suited to construct worldviews … Following each foreign campaign close in time, the triumphal procession was in fact <italic>the</italic> public ritual that presented the outside world to Rome.’</p>
<p>The task of a Roman triumphator in presenting himself as a glorious victor required that he represent the splendor of those whom he had defeated. It was especially advantageous when the defeated was a proud king or monarch whom a virtuous republican general had put in check. We can take note that, in Caesar Augustus’s <italic>Res Gestae</italic> 4.3, his triumphs are only numbered in terms of the ‘nine monarchs or children of monarchs’ who were led before his triumphing chariot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142064X13495132">Cooley 2009</xref>: 62). The royalty of triumphal victims was the ideal way to signify the relationship between Roman power and the nations that it defeated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X13495132">Beard (2007</xref>: 121) notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Kings were seen as the ideal adversaries of Roman military might. They dominated the imaginative reconstructions of historical triumphs; and the inscribed triumphal <italic>Fasti</italic> in the Forum speciﬁed carefully when the celebration had boasted a royal victim, by adding the king’s name to the usual formula of defeat—‘<italic>de Aetolis et rege Antiocho</italic>’, ‘over the Aetolians <italic>and King Antiochus</italic>.’ No other category of enemy was picked out in the inscription in this way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0142064X13495132">16</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Execution was the all but inevitable end for kings who were led as the humiliated captive of a triumphing general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0142064X13495132">17</xref></sup> This was certainly the case for the triumph that Josephus narrates, where in 7.5.6 he writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The triumphal processions ended at the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus (τὸν νεὼ τοῦ Καπετωλίου Διόϛ), on reaching which they halted; for it was a time-honored custom to wait there until the execution of the enemy’s general was announced (μέχριϛ ἂν τὸν τοῦ στρατηγοῦ τῶν πολεμίων θάνατον ἀπαγγείλῃ τιϛ). This was Simon, son of Gioras, who had just ﬁgured in the pageant among the prisoners (πεπομπευκὼϛ ἐν τοῖϛ αἰχμαλώτοιϛ), and then, with a halter thrown over him and scourged meanwhile by his conductors, had been haled to the spot abutting on the Forum where Roman law requires that malefactors condemned to death should be executed (νόμοϛ δ’ ἐστι ‘Ρωμαίοιϛ ἐκεῖ κτείνειν τοὺϛ ἐπὶ κακουργίᾳ θάνατον κατεγνωσμένουϛ).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The dynamic of execution as the τέλοϛ of the triumph became a rhetorical commonplace, so that the momentary, festal authority of the triumphing general and the life of his conquered victim were intertwined; both ended at the conclusion of the triumph. Cicero (<italic>Ad Verres</italic> 2.5.77), in a prosecutorial oration against Verres, a former governor of Sicily, writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hy even those who celebrate a triumph and keep the enemy leaders alive for some time so that the Roman people can enjoy the glorious sight of them being paraded in the triumphal procession and reap the reward of victory [send their captives to prison] … And the day that ends the authority of the conqueror also ends the life of the conquered.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In ritual terms, the powers of the victor and the victim in Roman triumphs necessitate <italic>such</italic> close proximity that both lose their separability. For observers of the ritual they became intertwined with, and interdependent on, one another.</p>

<title>Reflecting the Triumph in Greek Narrative Fiction</title>
<p>Claiming that Mark eccentrically employed Roman triumphal imagery to describe Jesus’ entry to Jerusalem and procession to the cross is a difﬁcult case to make. Without any corroborating examples of narratives engaging triumphal themes in a non-explicit way, there is no context for seeing how other Roman subjects responded to the spectacle. Moreover, with only historical examples of παρουσία (as in Kinman’s exempla discussed above), the literary design of Mark plays no part in <italic>how</italic> the triumphal themes are employed beyond a straightforward historical description. The nascent Greek narrative tradition to which Mark and his readers contributed was accustomed to treading carefully around Roman power and was preoccupied with reconceptualizing the inheritance of Greek heritage in light of Roman political domination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0142064X13495132">18</xref></sup> The development of ancient narrative, and speciﬁcally the Greek novel, not only coincided with the development of early Christian literature, but it also felt Roman power in a similar way. The negotiation of the inheritance of the past and the strictures of the present presented a common dilemma to all Roman subjects, even where the particulars of their cultural expression might differ. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0142064X13495132">Whitmarsh (2005</xref>: 9) has noted that ‘the removal of some of the hysteria surrounding the historiography of the early Church … has meant that Christianity can now be discussed as part of the same cultural and intellectual landscape as the pagan culture of the Roman east’.</p>
<p>Chariton’s novel <italic>Callirhoe</italic>, perhaps the ﬁrst Greek novel written in the early Roman Empire, includes an elaborated παρουσία narrative that overlaps with themes of the Roman triumph in ways that signal its broad symbolic importance for how Roman spectacles influenced the literature of this period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0142064X13495132">19</xref></sup> Beginning in 8.6, Chaereas is returning home from Egypt, having reunited with Callirhoe after defeating the Persian navy, and has now severed ties with all of the powerful despots with whom he had consorted in the previous portions of the novel. With the action having been accomplished in the East, their return to Syracuse makes them appear completely foreign; Chaereas seizes the opportunity to present a spectacle and orders his captains to decorate the warships, and Chaereas’s ship is decked with Babylonian tapestries. Adhering to typical παρουσία narratives, Hermocrates, Chaereas’s father-in-law and historical commander of the Syracusan navy against the Athenians, sends a rowboat out to meet the ships; people gathering around the harbor saw Chaereas’s ship and tent and ‘thought it contained not people but some valuable cargo, and they made various guesses, suggesting everything except the truth’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0142064X13495132">20</xref></sup> The text goes on to narrate the unveiling: ‘All were puzzled and straining their eyes when suddenly the tapestries were drawn aside, and Callirhoe was to be seen, clothed in Tyrian purple and reclining on a couch of beaten gold, with Chaereas sitting beside her in the uniform of a general.’ Thus, the function of this return is essentially triumphant, but instead of returning with spoils and captives that they achieved through victory, the hero and heroine of the novel themselves are the triumphant victors <italic>and</italic> the spoils being brought back after conquering a dominating barbarian land.</p>
<p>The presentation of foreign gifts continues, very much in line with the kind of presentation and celebration of the barbarian ‘other’ found in Roman triumphs. The text explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>Chaereas went up to Hermocrates and his father and said, ‘Accept from me the wealth of the Great King.’ At once he ordered the unloading of a vast quantity of silver and gold; next he showed the Syracusans ivory and amber and clothing and all kinds of valuable material and artwork, including a couch and table of the Great King, so that the whole city was ﬁlled, not as previously after the Sicilian war with the poverty of Attica, but, paradoxically, with the spoils of Media in a time of peace (8.6.12).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Chariton makes the implicit dramatic irony of their return explicit; at a time of peace, Chaereas treats Syracuse and Hermocrates to a trove of spoils that outdoes the ‘poverty’ of Athens who had been defeated by Hermocrates in an actual war. It is a victory without a war and a triumph whose captives are the victors.</p>
<p>As the scene continues, Chaereas narrates their story; he calls for his ‘fellow Greeks’ (he is also accompanied by Egyptians) to be made citizens of Syracuse, and the crowd shouts in assent. So, despite the paradox of Chaereas and Callirhoe being the spoils of their own victory, the story nonetheless is able to include the triumphal trope of the naturalized captives into the story: a decree is passed, the three hundred Greeks take their seat in the assembly (at which Chaereas is narrating his story), and Hermocrates distributes land to the Egyptians.</p>
<p>The ﬁnal practice evident in παρουσία narratives, as well as in Roman triumphs, is the approach to the temple and the performance of cultic or prayerful acts. Chariton concludes his novel in just such a ritual setting, but he does so with a kind of silent dignity and even delicacy that is itself unusual among such narratives. Instead of giving a grand, sacriﬁcial act into the hands of the hero, it is a prayer of resignation and acceptance of her travails that is put onto the lips of Callirhoe, the true <italic>heroine</italic> of the novel. The crowd listens to Chaereas’s story with rapt attention, but as it concludes, Callirhoe stops to offer a prayer of thanksgiving and supplication:
<disp-quote>
<p>While the crowd was in the theater, Callirhoe, before going home, went to Aphrodite’s temple. She grasped the goddess’s feet, placed her face upon them, let down her hair, and kissing them said, ‘I thank you, Aphrodite! You have shown me Chaereas once more in Syracuse, where as a girl I set eyes on him as you desired. I do not reproach you, Lady, for what I have suffered: that was my fate. I beg you, never again part me from Chaereas, but grant us a happy life, and death together’ (8.8.15-16).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Chariton’s novel, the use of triumphal imagery in the return of Chaereas and Callirhoe to Syracuse serves to present an idealized Greek past in terms of Roman spectacles of power. The dominant contemporary conceptualization of a παρουσία narrative available to Chariton (as to Mark) would have been the Roman triumph, which, as Stroup suggests, was widely known, depicted, described, and inscribed throughout the ancient world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0142064X13495132">Schwartz (2003</xref>: 390) has pointed to the way in which the Greek novels are verbally silent about Rome itself, although ‘it loomed in the mental geography of their authors and audience’. Rome is ‘present in its absence from Chariton’s novel’, according to Schwartz, and the presentation of the barbarian is both subject to Roman values of what was barbaric, as well as reflective of the Greeks themselves as newly ‘barbarianized’ subjects of a new political order. There is thus not a little irony in Chaereas capturing spoils that are the cultural property of the hegemonic Persian court. Moreover, this reading suggests that the cultural understanding of Greekness and Romanness, of subject and subjector, is unﬁxed. Chariton solves this issue by creating a ‘buffer’ between barbarianism and Greekness in the role of Greek <italic>paideia</italic> among urban elites, all of whom submit to Greekness of a certain form, and thus rise above the level of the barbarian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0142064X13495132">Schwartz 2003</xref>: 390).</p>
<p>Conceived as it is within a historicized ﬁctional framework, this resolution works for Chariton’s project, which is mostly concerned with the role of love in the codiﬁcation of the social order. The more conﬁned subject of the passion narrative in Mark is playing at much higher stakes, and thus the proximity of subject and subjector is more dramatically portrayed, with greater variance between the depiction of the subjected who is to be portrayed as king. The question is this: as Chariton’s novel appropriates triumphal tropes in its own way, what emerges when Mark is read not as a parallel of Roman triumphal accounts, but rather as a literary engagement with the ritual logic of the triumph?</p>

<title>Mark’s Narrative Fissures and the Triumphal Death of Jesus</title>
<p>Bourdieu understands ‘the logic of practice’ as signifying the variable and polysemic meanings that attach to social practices, rituals and enactments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0142064X13495132">21</xref></sup> The resulting depiction of ‘practice’ is a cohesive world of subjectively construed meanings for the way in which human societies organize, choreograph and perform their social existence. Bourdieu imagines a theory of how people construct the objects of their knowledge that in turn comprise the structuring dispositions (or <italic>habitus</italic>) that limit and deﬁne human practices. Ritual is practice that exhibits both constructed objects and their necessary structuring dispositions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142064X13495132">Bourdieu (1990</xref>: 87) describes how ‘ritual practice performs an uncertain abstraction which brings the same symbol into different relationships by apprehending it through different aspects, or which brings different aspects of the same referent in to the same relationship of opposition’. In theoretical terms, Bourdieu gives a name to the slippage of the viewers’ gaze to which Beard alludes.</p>
<p>The attempt to make sense of Mark’s employment of triumphal motifs will rely on the theoretical arrangement that Bourdieu describes. This is to say, as long as the Roman triumph functioned as a mechanism to present Roman hegemony, reciprocally the ‘logic’ of the event was vulnerable to being turned around, de-centered and otherwise ‘apprehended through different aspects’. This reading will thus engage precisely with the ‘uncertain abstraction’ to which Bourdieu refers, and, unlike the optimistic reading of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0142064X13495132">Schmidt (1995)</xref>, a parallelized resemblance is not necessary. On the contrary, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142064X13495132">Bourdieu (1990</xref>: 88) suggests,
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]his uncertain abstraction is also a false abstraction which sets up relationships based on … ‘overall resemblance’ … This mode of apprehension never explicitly limits itself to any one aspect of the terms it links, but takes each one, each time, as a whole, exploiting to the full the fact that two ‘realities’ are never entirely alike in all respects but are always alike in some respect, at least indirectly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As we have already seen in Chariton, it is possible for the role of the victor and the captive to dissolve into one another where the theme of triumph is being adopted in a literary text. Mark’s Gospel takes this conceptual doubling to an extreme level in the depiction of the person and acts of Jesus as both proud king and defeated subject. Through this reading, some of the dilemmas that persist in a more direct narrative parallel of Mark and Roman triumphs are resolved by the practical logic that brings together disparate textual moments into a ritual unity. Mark 11 and 15 develop the practical logic of the Roman triumph to depict Jesus in a polysemic way, as victor and victim, in each text.</p>
<p>Mark 11.7-10 sets the triumphal stage. Jesus’ processional seat is prepared (though crucially translated through the prophetic image of the kingly rider on the πῶλον), and ‘many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the ﬁelds’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0142064X13495132">22</xref></sup> The word στιβάϛ does not convey the sense of ‘palm frond’ as traditionally associated with Palm Sunday, although even this ritual ambiguity itself relies on polysemic symbols to convey the purpose and meaning of the action in Mk 11. Here, the Davidic imagery used to characterize Jesus in the preceding narrative has its symbolic payoff. Jesus, who is ‘son of David’ to blind Bartimaeus (Mk 10.47), and who draws from the <italic>ritual</italic> imagery of the Davidic psalm to rebuke the chief priests, scribes and elders at the conclusion of the parable of the tenants (Mk 12.10-11), concretizes his kingly role by presenting his own <italic>Davidic</italic> royalty.</p>
<p>Jesus’ mocking regalia in Mk 15 introduces Jesus both as triumphal victim and as a victor, with the soldiers’ abuse allowing the text to co-opt Roman derision into a vehicle for king-making. Even so, this triumphal echo in Mk 15 cannot be perceived without acknowledging its double in Mk 11, when Jesus enters Jerusalem and its temple as a celebrated victor. The unity of these texts is signaled by a shared narrative schism, and the ritual logic of the triumph serves to knit the breaches together. Mark 11 has Jesus haltingly enter the temple, only to leave it abruptly, returning back to Jerusalem after only a brief, three-verse interlude.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0142064X13495132">23</xref></sup> But, this halting reversal is mirrored in Mk 15. The soldiers dress Jesus to mock him in Mk 15.18, but v. 20 reads, ‘after mocking him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.’ So, in the text, the robe and crown were put on Jesus solely for the act of mocking him, and then the soldiers take care to re-dress him before leading him out to be cruciﬁed. The reversal is abrupt and deliberate, but its awkwardness serves the dual nature of the narrative. It is as though the author of Mark needs Jesus to appear in purple, but inserted it into the narrative at the last minute; the continuity of the narrative is broken in order to reference this motif, and in its thematic brokenness, it calls to mind the <italic>other</italic>, broken triumphal entrance in Mk 11.</p>
<p>This textual doubling continues to affect how the logic of the triumph bears on the movements of Jesus throughout Mk 11 and 15. In fact, the directionality of both leads to an intriguing conclusion about how Mark’s narrative intentionally relies on the polysemy of ritual to reconceive how holy sites are depicted in the Gospel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0142064X13495132">24</xref></sup> One of the few uniform ritual elements of Roman triumphs among textual witnesses seems to be their orientation toward a cultic site: the procession followed the Via Sacra to the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus atop the Capitoline Hill, where the triumphal victim is led and (at least according to some authorities) executed. Religious space is fraught in the Gospel of Mark—indeed it was fraught for most Jews in Judea, both before and after the Jewish War. But especially in Mark, the temple is a place of contested religious authority; it is a locus of political conflict and an ambiguous signiﬁer of sacredness in the Gospel. For Jesus’ ﬁrst, hesitating triumphal entry into Jerusalem in Mk 11.11 to end in such an abrupt narrative reversal suggests a subsequent revision of its cultic orientation. This is compounded only a few verses later; after his abrupt departure and return in Mk 11.15, he is not only back in Jerusalem, but also back in the temple. It would seem that Jesus returns explicitly to confront the moneychangers in the temple and to exclaim a prophetic denunciation: ‘Is it not written, “My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations”? But you have made it a den of robbers’ (Mk 11.17). However, this is not Mark’s ﬁnal reference to the temple.</p>
<p>Mark 13.2 contains the Markan report of Jesus’ prophecy about the destruction of the temple, but this early tradition differs drastically from the temple Christology of the other Gospels, for here Jesus says simply ‘do you see these great buildings (οἰκοδομάϛ)? Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.’ There is no attempt to signify Jesus as the temple, or his resurrection as the rebuilding of the temple. Instead there is a dismissal of the efﬁcacy and permanence of the temple: it is destined for destruction, and the temple sign, as it were, becomes untethered to the physical building, which becomes more and more decentralized as the Markan passion narrative develops, beginning with the narrative reversal in Mark 11.11.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0142064X13495132">25</xref></sup> The ﬁnal dissolution of the temple is achieved in the narration of Jesus’ death. Mark 15.37-38 reads, ‘then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.’ The temple has been dissolved, the ritual curtain has been ripped in two, and the ritual work of God now takes place elsewhere.</p>
<p>Golgotha is the new cult site in Mark; it is the culminating place of Jesus’ role as triumphal victor and the altar for his execution as triumphal victim. And here we see Mark’s ingenuity as translator in full force. The Capitoline Hill, where all Roman triumphs end, is played here by this new place—called by the Aramaic תלגלג—but the Gospel writer is careful to include a Greek translation: κρανίου τόποϛ, ‘the place of the head’. Here it signiﬁes its ritual role by mimicking the place and mirroring the etymology of the prototypical holy hill of triumphs, the <italic>Capitolium</italic> of Rome.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0142064X13495132">26</xref></sup> Jesus’ roles as both priestly victor and defeated victim are conflated, mixed up and amalgamated into a single ritual event.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0142064X13495132">27</xref></sup> The result of this logic, torn piece by piece by the <italic>bricoleur</italic> who conceived this narrative end, is of Jesus as both victim and victor, or ritual enactor and ritual subject, but in both directions and in both ways as the triumphator. The slippage between the proud captive of a Roman triumph and the triumphing general has been exploited in Mark’s Gospel to invest within Jesus the role of both. Thus the author of Mark discovers through the logic of the Roman triumph a means by which to turn the shameful death of cruciﬁxion into an assertion of Jesus’ own self-achieved royalty and messiahship. After all, those whom Rome deems worthy enough to parade, mock and berate are kings, rivals and threats.</p>
<p>This ritual duality is given poignant signiﬁcation by the remark made by the centurion on guard, which perfectly illustrates the ritual doubling of this narrative. After the account reports the tearing of the temple curtain, the scene calls attention to the centurion. It states that the centurion ‘stood facing him’ (ὁ κεντυρίων ὁ παρεστηκώϛ ἐξ ἐναντίαϛ αὐτοῦ), and ‘saw that in this way he breathed his last’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0142064X13495132">28</xref></sup> The author of Mark cobbles together, from Roman raw materials, a means by which to turn the shameful death of cruciﬁxion into an assertion of Jesus’ own self-expressed kingship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0142064X13495132">29</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0142064X13495132">Peppard (2011</xref>: 131) presents this scene as Mark’s narrative crux:
<disp-quote>
<p>Up to this point, Mark had narratively characterized Jesus as a counter-emperor, a ‘son of God’ whose rise to power in the cosmos had mimicked imperial power on a kind of parallel <italic>cursus</italic> and <italic>triumphus</italic>. Now the course ends with a mockery and subversion of the triumph. But with the Roman centurion’s cry, the parallel tracks of analogy and reality converge and intersect, like a cross: the acclamation of the army was in reality a necessary element of imperial power, and the death of an emperor was in fact the time when his exalted status was ﬁnally evaluated.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If Mark describes a παρουσία of any sort in the passion narrative, the words of the centurion in this ﬁnal case <italic>must</italic> be considered paradoxically to signify both Jesus’ victim and victor status, and in the centurion’s statement the practice-logic of this narrative brings its consummative force. The apotheosis inherent in the Roman triumph is no less operative here, except that it is achieved through the double ritual complicity of Jesus as triumphal sacriﬁcer and sacriﬁcial victim executed as the captive king. It is the logic of the Roman triumph that allows for this effect in the text, which exploits the slippage between captive and triumphator to turn Jesus ironically into both, for the centurion as well as for the Markan audience. The centurion’s words here veritably <italic>deﬁne</italic> narrative irony: ‘truly this man was God’s son!’</p>
<p>The author of Mark’s Gospel has been depicted in this article as a <italic>bricoleur</italic>; by forging a story out of available resources, he bends a genre and contorts its referent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0142064X13495132">30</xref></sup> This text of Jesus’ death is not conceived out of whole cloth. It never could have been. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X13495132">Beard (2007</xref>: 111-14) points out that Rome marveled at what it must have been like to be a captive in the Roman triumph. She cites as an example the only extant Roman description of the triumph from the perspective of Ovid’s <italic>Ars Amatoria</italic> 1.2.19-52, where Cupid is depicted as the triumphing general who is leading the author, newly captured, in his own divine triumph. Jesus’ role in this narrative is exceptional in imperial literature and, to some degree, unprecedented. Cruciﬁxion narratives are often brief, fearsome and concerned with the victim only as a case study—a morbid curiosity. Where heroic ﬁgures do begin to be portrayed in the guise of suffering cruciﬁxion (outside of Christian martyrological literature), it is an opportunity for their salvation, and the narrative of cruciﬁxion itself is unembellished.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0142064X13495132">31</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142064X13495132">Goodacre (2006</xref>: 34) has pointed out that ‘it is easy to forget that Mark’s narrative of the cruciﬁxion is not only the ﬁrst extant narrative of Jesus’ cruciﬁxion, but one of the ﬁrst narratives of any hero’s death by cruciﬁxion’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0142064X13495132">32</xref></sup> Given the theological project inherent in Mark’s Gospel, what is being narrated here has no literary antecedent and no conceptual framework in which to forge its explanation of Jesus’ messianic death—a death that would ultimately provide a new model for a series of similarly crowned triumphant-victims to imitate and develop.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142064X13495132">Benjamin (1968</xref>: 253-64), who himself exploits the triumphal motif in his ‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’, suggests that history itself cannot help but preserve the <italic>kinds</italic> of cultural exchange that comprise it. He writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hoever has emerged victorious participates to this day in the triumphal procession in which the present rulers step over those who are lying prostrate. According to traditional practice, the spoils are carried along in the procession … For without exception the cultural treasures he surveys have an origin which he cannot contemplate without horror. They owe their existence not only to the efforts of the great minds and talents who have created them, but also to the anonymous toil of their contemporaries (256).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mark’s Gospel responds to its hermeneutical dilemma by channeling its despair into an interpretive innovation: it naturalizes dominant language, symbols and practices, translating them to its own purposes. Mark uses the resources that were at hand, and the cultural tools of Rome were exploited because they were both powerful and had a universal effect. Mark’s engagement with Roman ritual wrestles with the paradox of a rich cultural inheritance and a poverty of symbolic capital. It should not surprise us that a minority community coping with a need to make sense of their lingering hope after Jesus’ death would mine Rome’s surplus of cultural resources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0142064X13495132">33</xref></sup> Mark’s narrative demonstrates the way in which ritual made Roman power manifest to the world, but equally, and at the same time, vulnerable to imitation, appropriation and adaptation.</p>

Bourdieu acknowledges that this makes analysis of practice difﬁcult, but insists that this coherence is innate in how these symbolic systems (like those of Roman ritual and early Christian narrative) are generated.</p>

<p>For Rome to <italic>rehearse</italic> its power over the world in this way signals a central function of these kinds of rituals, namely, to actualize in performance and realize in concrete terms its imperial <italic>auctoritas</italic>. This theme is developed in Lucan’s <italic>Pharsalia</italic> 1.283-91: the brewing civil war has Julius Caesar reflecting that no triumphal procession awaits his return in Rome where the growing envy of Pompey’s supporters will force Caesar to forsake the (rightful) task of conquering foreign nations to confront Pompey in a war that will yield no triumphs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X13495132">Beard (2007</xref>: 123) points to this passage and suggests that ‘civil war could, in a sense, be deﬁned as “war that would have no triumphs”’.</p>

<p>This was either symbolically or actually achieved, depending on which narrative accounts are considered. However, two additional dynamics dictate the relationship between regal victims and the role of triumph as a shaming of kingship. The ﬁrst is the unusual reflection of triumphal shame found in Ovid’s <italic>Ars Amatoria</italic> 1.2.19-52, where Cupid is depicted as the triumphing general who is leading the author, newly captured, in his own divine triumph. This telling by Ovid is later imitated in a lost poetic depiction of the capture of Jupiter described in Lactantius, <italic>Divinae Institutiones</italic> I, 2. The other is termed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X13495132">Beard (2007</xref>: 114) as the ‘Cleopatran solution’, for the way in which rulers on the brink of defeat might kill themselves rather than suffer the indignities of being led as a captive in the triumph. Horace (<italic>Carmina</italic> 1.37.29-32) narrates this in his ‘Cleopatra Ode’: ‘Fiercer she was in the death she chose, as though / She did not wish to cease to be a queen, taken to Rome / On the galleys of savage Liburnians / To be a humble woman in a proud triumph (<italic>deliberata morte ferocior: / saeuis Liburnis scilicet inuidens / priuata deduci superbo, / non humilis mulier, triumpho</italic>).’</p>

<p>That this word is construed in Aramaic may suggest the signiﬁcance of the term as a signal or intentional sign among the readers of the Gospel of Mark.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142064X13495132">Chronis (1982</xref>: 110) has suggested that the phrasing of this passage itself implies a ritualistic posture. He writes, ‘Mark’s description of the position of the centurion vis-à-vis the dying Jesus, ἐξ ἐναντίαϛ αὐτου (15.39), may possess a subtly cultic force. It utilizes, at any rate, one of the idiomatic expressions for entering the temple, for standing “in the presence” or “before the face” of God.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0142064X13495132">Yarbro Collins (2007</xref>: 765) criticizes Chronis’s analysis by pointing out that ‘many of the usages of the phrase in the LXX occur in narrative contexts describing battles. So the spatial description of the centurion … if it has any symbolic or metaphorical force at all, may well signify the initial role of the centurion as an enemy of Jesus or as one who afflicts him’. In light of my reading, these two senses of the confrontation between enemies in a ritualistic setting serve to situate Golgotha-cum-Capitolium as a cult setting.</p>

What they all share is a discursive process by which the excess or slippage produced by the ambivalence of mimicry (almost the same, but not quite) does not merely “rupture” the discourse, but becomes transformed into an uncertainty which ﬁxes the colonial subject as a “partial” presence.’ See the discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0142064X13495132">Moore 2006</xref>, especially his chapter on Mark.
