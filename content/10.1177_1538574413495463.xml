<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Moyamoya disease is a rare cerebrovascular disorder that is characterized by progressive stenosis of the distal portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and its main branches. Typical angiographic findings include bilateral occlusive lesions at the terminal portion of the ICA, anterior cerebral artery (ACA), or middle cerebral artery (MCA) and an abnormal vascular network at the cerebral base with a puff-of-smoke appearance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413495463">1</xref>
</sup> The natural history of moyamoya is variable.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413495463">2</xref>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>In October 2003, a 37-year-old woman was admitted with a history of transient paresthesia on the left side of her face and upper extremity, which lasted for several minutes. Four years before the current admission, she had undergone mitral valve replacement for mitral valve stenosis and tricuspid valve annuloplasty for tricuspid valve regurgitation. After the heart operation, she was treated with about 5-10 mg of Coumadin. At admission, the results of her neurological examination were unremarkable. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a relatively increased intensity in the right cerebral hemispheric leptomeningeal vascular collaterals and possibly in the basal collaterals that was related to the hidden vasoocclusive disease. There was no acute stroke or mass findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413495463">Figure 1A</xref>). The MR angiography revealed an occlusion at the terminal portion of the right ICA and a vascular luminal irregularity and narrowing in the left A1 and M1 segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413495463">Figure 1B</xref>). Technetium-99m-hexamethyl-propylene-amineoxime single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with an acetazolamide challenge revealed that perfusion and vascular reserves were intact. The patient underwent conservative therapy and was discharged after 7 days with no neurological deficits.</p>

<p>After 3 weeks, she was admitted again because of transient speech disturbance and dizziness, which had developed after exercise. The ICA angiography revealed a diffuse and severe stenoocclusive lesion in the right M1 segment with an abnormal basal vascular network, which is typical of moyamoya. Although the vasculature of the left distal MCA territory was intact, diffuse luminal narrowing at the left M1 segment was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574413495463">Figure 2A</xref> and B). Vertebral angiography revealed occlusion at the proximal portion of the basilar artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574413495463">Figure 2C</xref>). The patient underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis with urokinase (1 400 000 units). Follow-up brain computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography that were conducted after 7 days revealed a low-density infarction in the right cerebellum and complete recanalization of the occluded basilar artery with normal visualization of both the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and superior cerebellar artery (SCA). The patient was discharged with no neurological deficits, and she continued to take Coumadin and clopidogrel.</p>

<p>The patient’s clinical condition remained satisfactory until November 2006, when she presented with transient dizziness and general weakness. The MR imaging of brain revealed no abnormal acute findings except for the previous chronic infarction in the right SCA territory. The ICA angiography revealed an occlusion at the portion of the origin of both M1 segments. Although the small, fine collateral vasculature was observed at the right basal brain area, it was not observed at the left basal brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574413495463">Figure 3A</xref> and B). There were no stenoocclusive lesions of the vertebrobasilar artery or the transdural collaterals from both external carotid arteries (ECAs). The SPECT of brain revealed diffuse perfusion decreases in the left MCA territory and multifocal decreases in the right cerebral cortex with preserved vascular reserve capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574413495463">Figure 3C</xref>). The patient underwent conservative therapy and was discharged with no neurological deficits.</p>

<p>Although she was not having any ischemic symptoms, follow-up angiography was performed in July 2012.

Vertebral angiography revealed diffuse leptomeningeal collaterals in both MCA territories from ipsilateral cortical branches of the PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1538574413495463">Figure 4D</xref>). She is currently taking medications, including Coumadin and clopidogrel, and is doing well without neurological deficits.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By definition, the pathognomonic angiographic findings are bilateral in moyamoya disease, even though the severity can differ between sides.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413495463">5</xref>
</sup> Patients with unilateral lesions are diagnosed with probable moyamoya disease. When an underlying cause is found, a diagnosis of moyamoya syndrome is made.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574413495463">6</xref>
</sup> Pathological criteria may also be used for determining the diagnosis. Main arteries (ACA, MCA, and posterior communicating artery) of the circle of Willis show thinning of median, widening of internal elastic lamina, and intimal fibrous thickening. However, a pathological analysis has revealed that the affected vessels do not show inflammatory or arteriosclerotic changes that lead to occlusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574413495463">7</xref>
</sup> Rather, vessel occlusion results from a combination of the hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells and luminal thrombosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413495463">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Medical therapy has been used in patients with moyamoya, particularly when surgery is considered to present a high risk or if the patient has a relatively mild disease, but there are scarce data showing its short-term or long-term efficacies. Kuroda et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574413495463">8</xref>
</sup> reported that the rate of disease progression is high, even among asymptomatic patients, and that medical therapy alone does not halt disease progression. Antiplatelet agents have been used to prevent emboli from microthrombi that form at sites of arterial stenosis, and these agents, although not used universally, are used routinely in inpatients in many operative series.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413495463">3</xref>
</sup> Anticoagulants, such as warfarin, are rarely used, but there has been some experience with the use of low-molecular-weight heparin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413495463">2</xref>
</sup> The spontaneous recanalization of an acutely occluded ICA is not uncommon, and it can occur in up to 33% of patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574413495463">9</xref>
</sup> The MCA is more likely than the ICA to recanalize spontaneously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574413495463">10</xref>
</sup> Acute recanalization is thought to occur as a result of spontaneous fibrinolysis or the lytic capabilities of the endothelium, intraplaque hemorrhage, temporary edema of the arterial wall, or simply missed segmental occlusions or pseudo-occlusions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574413495463">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574413495463">11</xref>
</sup> However, it is generally believed that once an ICA is chronically occluded, late spontaneous recanalization is virtually impossible.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574413495463">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413495463">12</xref>
</sup> Although the mechanisms underlying the recanalization of a chronically occluded ICA remain unknown, very few reports of the spontaneous recanalization of a chronically occluded ICA have been documented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574413495463">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574413495463"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574413495463">15</xref>
</sup> Lammie et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574413495463">14</xref>
</sup> suggested the possibility of occlusions that result from ulcerated plaque thrombosis presenting as long-term recanalization by thrombolysis. Colon et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574413495463">13</xref>
</sup> described hypertrophy of the vasa vasorum, which caused reperfusion distal to the occlusion. Another possible mechanism is that, in the case of myointimal hyperplasia or atherosclerotic disease, neovascularization is induced, which in the long term can allow perfusion distal to a vessel occlusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413495463">12</xref>
</sup> The persistence of some embryonic vessels can also account for the complete nonocclusion of the whole ICA segment, which allows for the action of varied mechanisms of vessel recanalization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413495463">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the present case, we were concerned as to why the recanalization of the occluded MCA occurred in our patient who had a progressive disease, moyamoya. Our patient was admitted with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in October 2003, and a right M1 occlusion and left luminal narrowing of A1 and M1 were identified. After 1 week, she was admitted again with a TIA, and she underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis for occlusion of the basilar artery. After 3 years, she was diagnosed with both M1 occlusions. Since then, she has been doing well without any ischemic symptoms. Follow-up angiography that was conducted 6 years later showed recanalization of the left M1. Because there were no symptoms or signs during the 6 years from the left M1 occlusion until recanalization, we do not know exactly when the recanalization of the left M1 occurred. It is very difficult to draw conclusions about the possible mechanisms for the correlation between moyamoya and the recanalization of an occluded M1 segment; some possible pathogenetic mechanisms have been postulated for the development of recanalization in moyamoya and are presented below.</p>
<p>First, because the angiography that was conducted in July 2012 revealed that there were no moyamoya-related abnormal vascular collaterals on the left side, our patient could be classified as a probable moyamoya disease. Therefore, there was the possibility that the left M1 occlusion was caused by an embolus due to heart disease. This possibility of an occlusion by an embolus is divided into 2 types: acute or chronic occlusions. However, because our patient’s symptoms were so minor and there were no abnormal acute lesions found in the radiological examination, we could rule out the possibility of an acute occlusion of a major artery. Therefore, we could consider recanalization of a chronically occluded M1 segment by an embolus. Colon et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574413495463">13</xref>
</sup> suggested that, when advanced atherosclerosis causes carotid artery occlusion, the vasa vasorum may serve as a means of revascularization by providing collateral recirculation after carotid artery occlusion. However, unlike the extracranial carotid artery, the ICA has little chance of hypertrophy of the vasa vasorum or revascularization within a plaque because of the nature of the intracranial artery, including the lack of a vasa vasorum and the smaller caliber.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413495463">12</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, a pathological analysis of moyamoya has revealed that the affected vessels do not show arteriosclerotic or inflammatory changes that lead to occlusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574413495463">7</xref>
</sup> Second, our patient had been taking Coumadin for 13 years and clopidogrel for 9 years. We cannot rule out the possibility that long-term treatment using antiplatelet drugs could affect the recanalization of a left M1 occlusion during the progression of moyamoya disease because contralateral disease eventually develops in up to 40% of patients with moyamoya who initially present with unilateral findings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413495463">2</xref>
</sup> Platelet-mediated occlusion of the vasa vasorum could be related to the pathogenesis of moyamoya in the patient reported. Several platelet-derived growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-β, have been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of moyamoya.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574413495463">16</xref>
</sup> Although some data have shown that medical therapy alone does not halt disease progression,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413495463">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574413495463">8</xref>
</sup> further research is warranted to clarify the relationship between Coumadin and moyamoya progression.</p>
<p>We thought that our patient more likely had probable moyamoya rather than moyamoya disease on the basis of some of the abovementioned reasons. Lee et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413495463">12</xref>
</sup> described a case of late spontaneous recanalization of a chronic MCA occlusion in a 53-year-old woman. They proposed that her recanalization was a gradual thrombolysis that was related to antiplatelet therapy. We also thought that the occlusion and recanalization were caused by an imbalance between repeated embolic formation and accumulations caused by heart disease and repeated thrombolysis by Coumadin. This imbalance might have induced repeated embolic formation and accumulations to slowly progress to a complete occlusion in the left M1. Then this imbalance might have gradually induced thrombolysis for the spontaneous recanalization.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a spontaneous recanalization of the MCA that occurred after a diagnosis of moyamoya. Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, spontaneous recanalization in moyamoya could be considered a possible phenomenon. Thus, the neurosurgeons should always pay attention to the pathological variety of dynamic changes in the cerebrovascular structure in moyamoya. Further studies are warranted to clarify this rare phenomenon.</p>
