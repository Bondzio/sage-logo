<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This study compared postpartum depression and parental self-efficacy between married immigrant women from Vietnam and native Korean mothers. <bold>Method:</bold> The participants were 72 native Korean mothers and 69 immigrant Vietnamese mothers living in a suburban city in South Korea. The instruments used were the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Parent Expectation Survey. <bold>Results:</bold> There were statistically significant differences in age, education, employment, income, husband’s age, and family structure between the two groups. Immigrant Vietnamese mothers experienced higher levels of postpartum depression (<italic>t</italic> = −3.466, <italic>p</italic> = .001) and had lower parental self-efficacy (<italic>t</italic> = 5.607, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) than native Korea mothers. Postpartum depression was negatively correlated with parental self-efficacy in native Korean mothers (<italic>r</italic> = −.349, <italic>p</italic> = .003), but there was no significant correlation in the immigrant Vietnamese mothers (<italic>r</italic> = .011, <italic>p</italic> = .936). The mothers’ country of origin, whether immigrant or Korean, was a significant factor in postpartum depression (β = .338, <italic>p</italic> = .040; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .091). The mothers’ country of origin had no effect on parental self-efficacy (<italic>p</italic> = .957). Instead, significant differences were found for the age, education level, and family structure of the participant (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .036). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of this study demonstrated that postpartum depression was more prevalent among married immigrant women from Vietnam than among native Korean mothers. Accordingly, a postpartum depression intervention program for married immigrant women should be developed and implemented.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the 1990s there were more than 600 marriages between foreign women and Korean men in Korea, and the number of international marriages increased significantly from 7,304 in 2000 to 38,491 in 2007. Before 2000, marriages between Korean men and Japanese or Chinese women were the most common, but since then the number of marriages involving Vietnamese and Cambodian women has increased dramatically, with the rate of marriage with Vietnamese women increasing significantly from 134 in 2001 to 5,822 in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434057">Korean National Statistical Office, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The recent deterioration in economic conditions has led to many Korean women not wanting to marry low-income men, which has made it difficult for low-income men to marry native women. Also, the cost of an international marriage is lower than the cost of marriages between Koreans. Thus, international marriage is becoming an attractive alternative for low-income men in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611434057">Hong, 2002</xref>). It has been reported that immigrant foreign women often use international marriage as a means to improve their lives and help poor family members at home. This new trend in marriage may cause problems because they are not based on love, as many Korean marriages are, and the cultures of the immigrant women differ markedly from Korean culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611434057">Lee, Chung, Yoo, &amp; Kim, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Immigrant women not only have to adapt themselves to new roles as wives in a transcultural marriage, but they also face the challenge of adapting to a new living environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611434057">Y.A. Kim, 2008</xref>). These women must also go through childbirth and caring for a new infant in a foreign culture. The postnatal period is always a transitional and stressful time, during which a woman needs to face the new maternal role and changes in her body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611434057">Affonso, De, Horowitz, &amp; Mayberry, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Postpartum depression can follow childbirth, and is characterized by despondent moods, feelings of inadequacy as a parent, sleep and appetite disturbances, and impaired concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611434057">Miller, 2002</xref>). Postpartum depression is more common in immigrants who are experiencing stress because of a move to a new country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611434057">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 2006</xref>). Postpartum depression may be associated with marital discord, inadequate social support, and maladaption to the new role of parenting. It is also associated with a past history of depression and with the stress of adapting to the new parenting role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611434057">Hung &amp; Mathers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043659611434057">Verkerk, Denollet, Van Heck, Van Son, &amp; Pop, 2005</xref>). Postpartum depression reportedly weakens the mother–infant attachment, and it is also harmful to the mother’s health, in part because depressed women tend to have poor nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611434057">Nagata et al., 2000</xref>). These factors make the early detection and prevention of postpartum depression very important.</p>
<p>Parental self-efficacy is the confidence a new mother has in her ability to meet the demands of the new parent role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611434057">Reece, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611434057">Bandura (1986)</xref> was the first to describe self-efficacy as one of the important components of social cognitive theory, defining it as one’s belief in his or her capability to organize and execute the courses of action required to perform a certain task. Bandura identified how the affective states of a person can induce or enhance self-efficacy. Positive mood states increase the sense of parental self-efficacy during the partum period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611434057">Leahy-Warren &amp; McCarthy, 2010</xref>). It has been found that parental self-efficacy is associated with positive parenting behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611434057">Coleman &amp; Karraker, 2003</xref>), while early parental self-efficacy is negatively associated with maternal depression. Furthermore, postpartum depression is a mediator between parental self-efficacy and children’s developmental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659611434057">Weaver, Shaw, Dishion, &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>). More research into this association is necessary because postnatal depression is often left untreated in immigrant mothers.</p>
<p>Recent research on postpartum depression has focused on the general population, without taking into account the needs and issues specific to ethnic-minority women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611434057">Bostock, Marsen, Sarwar, &amp; Stoltz, 1996</xref>). In Korea, few studies have been conducted on early parental self-efficacy and postpartum depression in married immigrant women, who are more likely to experience health problems after childbirth. The present study therefore compared postpartum depression and parental self-efficacy between married immigrant women from Vietnam and native Korean women and to use the findings as data for developing basic nursing interventions for the treatment of married immigrant women in the postpartum period.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1043659611434057">
<title>Participants and General Procedures</title>
<p>The targets of this study were native Korean mothers and married immigrant mothers from Vietnam who live in medium-sized areas of South Korea, and who gave birth less than 3 months prior to the time of data collection. A convenience sample of postpartum mothers was taken by a trained research assistant. Data were collected using a self-reported questionnaire between May 2008 and June 2009. All mothers were within 12 weeks of giving birth. They were recruited through 2 public health centers and 2 obstetrics hospitals with a total of 200 to 300 beds. To maintain consistency, researchers and assistants were trained in the research procedure and the questions being used before the participants were recruited. The participants selected for inclusion had no history of depression, no prenatal or postpartum complications (e.g., preterm labor, hypertension, or postpartum bleeding and infection), and they signed a written consent form.</p>
<p>Anticipating a medium effect size, an alpha of .05, a beta of .80, and using multiple regression, a power analysis determined that 102 subjects were needed for an adequate sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611434057">Cohen, 1992</xref>). Of the 160 participants who were contacted, 19 were excluded because of missing data, resulting in 141 women (72 native Korean mothers and 69 immigrant Vietnamese mothers) being analyzed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1043659611434057">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>In Korea, there is no requirement to seek the approval of an ethics committee for a questionnaire-based study of this kind. However, we explained the purpose of the study to the women and informed them that they were not obligated to participate. Written permission was obtained from the relevant hospital administrators and each participant. This process was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. During the data analysis, confidentiality was maintained by data coding to eliminate any identifying data. All participants were given a small gift, such as baby lotion, in appreciation of their participation.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1043659611434057">
<title>Postpartum depression</title>
<p>The Korean version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611434057">Cox, Holden, &amp; Sagovsky, 1987</xref>) was used as a screening test for postnatal depression in Korean mothers. The EPDS was translated into Vietnamese and back-translated by bilingual professionals and comparisons made with the original version before being applied to the immigrant Vietnamese mothers. Although the EPDS does not diagnose postnatal depression, high scorers have an increased probability of depression. The EDPS comprises 10 questions and a 4-point Likert-type response scale (0-3), resulting in a score from 0 to 30, with higher scores denoting higher levels of depressive symptoms. A score of 13 or higher shows a high likelihood of postpartum depression. The Korean version of the EPDS has shown high validity and reliability in several studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611434057">J. I. Kim, 2006</xref>). In the present study, Cronbach’s alpha values for the Vietnamese and Korean versions of the EPDS were .70 and .81, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043659611434057">
<title>Parental self-efficacy</title>
<p>Parental self-efficacy was measured using the Parent Expectation Survey (PES) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611434057">Reece (1992)</xref>. The PES was translated into Vietnamese and Korean by a professional interpreter. The instrument was then back-translated by bilingual professionals and comparisons made with the original version. The PES comprises 25 questions scored on Likert-type scales from 0 (<italic>completely impossible</italic>) to 10 (<italic>definitely possible</italic>) points. The total score is then divided by the number of questions. A higher score indicates that the respondent’s sense of self-efficacy is higher. The reliability of the PES has been reported to be .91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611434057">Reece, 1992</xref>). In this study, Cronbach’s alpha values for the Vietnamese and Korean versions of the PES were .95 and .96, respectively.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1043659611434057">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 12.0). The general characteristics of the participants were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The homogeneity of the general and obstetric characteristics of participants was analyzed by a chi-square test. Differences in postpartum depression and self-efficacy between native Korean mothers and immigrant women were examined by independent-samples <italic>t</italic> tests. In addition, the distribution of the postpartum depression scores of the participants was analyzed using frequencies and percentages. The correlations between postpartum depression and parental self-efficacy among native Korean mothers and immigrant Vietnamese mothers were analyzed based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. Simultaneous multiple regression using the “enter” method was used to identify significant factors influencing postpartum depression and parental self-efficacy in native Korean mothers and immigrant Vietnamese mothers, because simultaneous multiple regression revealed that the high explanatory power for the most appropriate model can be found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434057">Huh, 2002</xref>) and the general characteristics, which showed significant differences (e.g., age, education, employment, income, husband’s age, and family structure), were controlled throughout.</p>

<title>Demographic Characteristics</title>
<p>The general characteristics are compared between native Korean mothers and immigrant Vietnamese mothers in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043659611434057">Table 1</xref>. The native Korean mothers were older (mean age = 30.7 years) than the immigrant Vietnamese mothers (mean age = 24.1 years). Of the native Korean mothers, 72.2% had finished an undergraduate college degree, whereas 91.3% of the immigrant Vietnamese mothers had only finished high school. Unemployment was more prevalent among the immigrant Vietnamese mothers (92.8%) than among the Korean mothers (69.4%). As for family income, 58.3% of native Korean mothers had a household income of more than $2000/month, whereas 92.8% of the immigrant Vietnamese mothers had a household income of $2000/month or lower. The mean age of the husbands was 33.2 years for native Korean mothers and 40.0 years for immigrant Vietnamese mothers. Whereas 90.3% of the native Korean mothers lived with their nuclear family, 53.6% of immigrant Vietnamese mothers lived with an extended family.</p>

<p>Participants were studied at a mean of 4.01 weeks after giving birth. The rate of vaginal deliveries was 69.4% for native Korean mothers and 60.9% for immigrant Vietnamese mothers. The pregnancy was stated as being wanted by 84.7% of the native Korean mothers and 88.4% of the immigrant Vietnamese mothers. Most native Korean mothers (86.1%) did not attend prenatal classes, 54.2% were primipara, and 54.2% gave birth to a male newborn; these corresponding figures for the immigrant Vietnamese mothers were 89.9%, 66.7%, and 49.3%. Of the native Korean mothers, 34.7% chose to breast-feed; overall, 30.4% of the participants chose to breast-feed. The mean birth weight of the child was 3.20 kg for native Korean mothers and 3.11 kg for immigrant Vietnamese mothers. Most of the women in both groups (97.2% of native Korean mothers and 88.4% of immigrant Vietnamese mothers) said that their husbands were “supportive.”</p>
<p>The results show significant differences in general characteristics between native Korean and immigrant Vietnamese mothers. The immigrant mothers were significantly younger than their native Korean counterparts (χ<sup>2</sup> = 66.306, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Compared with native Korean mothers, immigrant Vietnamese mothers received less education (χ<sup>2</sup> = 58.723, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), were more likely to be unemployed (χ<sup>2</sup> = 12.365, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and had a lower family income (χ<sup>2</sup> = 41.380, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), whereas their husbands were significantly older (χ<sup>2</sup> = −52.183, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and more of them lived with an extended family (χ<sup>2</sup> = 31.632, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>There were no statistically significant differences in the number of weeks after giving birth, delivery type, planned pregnancy, prenatal classes, gravida, newborn gender, breast-feeding, birth weight, and husband support between the groups (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>

<title>Factors influencing postpartum depression and parental self-efficacy</title>
<p>Simultaneous multiple regression analysis using the enter method was used to identify significant factors influencing postpartum depression and parental self-efficacy in native Korean mothers and immigrant Vietnamese mothers. The general data were entered into the regression because the general characteristics differed significantly between the two cohorts in this study (e.g., age, education, employment, income, husband’s age, and family structure).</p>
<p>Nominal variables that differed significantly between the two groups (<italic>native Korean mothers</italic> = 0, <italic>immigrant Vietnamese mothers</italic> = 1) in this study included education (<italic>high school education or less</italic> = 0, <italic>college education or more</italic> = 1), employment (<italic>employed</italic> = 0, <italic>unemployed</italic> = 1), income (<italic>up to $2,000</italic> = 0, <italic>more than $2,000</italic> = 1), and family structure (<italic>nuclear family</italic> = 0, <italic>extended family</italic> = 1). Other continuous variables such as the ages of the mothers and their husbands were also entered into the regression model. The results are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043659611434057">Table 3</xref>. No problems of multicollinearity were identified. The range of tolerance was 0.262 to 0.743, which is more than 0.1. The variance inflation factor ranged between 1.396 and 3.819, and hence did not pass the standard point of 10.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Compared with native Korean mothers, married immigrant Vietnamese mothers were younger and had a lower education level (most had no more than a high school education). Most immigrant Vietnamese mothers were unemployed, and their monthly income was less than that of native Korean mothers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611434057">Hung and Mathers (2008)</xref> showed that most married women who had immigrated to Taiwan were between 19 and 24 years old. Most were also reported to be jobless and with a high school education or less, an outcome similar to that found in our research.</p>
<p>In the present study, the husbands of immigrant Vietnamese mothers were mostly older than the husbands of native Korean women, and the international couples tended to live with an extended family. In the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611434057">Sung (2007)</xref> on family stability and social adaptations of married immigrant Vietnamese women, the mean age of mothers was 24.4 years and that of the husbands was 41.6 years, there was a similar distribution in our research, with mean ages of 24.1 and 40.0 years, respectively.</p>
<p>In summary, there are significant differences in age, education, employment, income, the age of the husband, and family structure between married immigrant and native Korean mothers. Married immigrant women also tend to live with a large family, which they may become dependent on because they lack education and income. In addition, the significant age difference between married immigrant women and their husbands is often a source of conflict between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611434057">Sung, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Immigrant Vietnamese mothers had a significantly higher rate of postpartum depression than native Korean mothers in our research. Immigrant Vietnamese mothers with a depression score of 13 points or more (representing serious depression) made up 34.3% of the subjects, and this is significantly higher than the 18.1% of native Korean mothers with the same scores. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611434057">Hung and Mathers (2008)</xref> studied postpartum depression in immigrant mothers from Southeast Asia living in Taiwan and found that the rate of immigrant women with a depression score of 13 points or more was 25.5%, a slightly lower rate than in our research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611434057">J. Y. Kim (2004)</xref> performed a screening test of postpartum depression in native Korean mothers and found that 19.5% were seriously depressed, similar to our findings. However, the rate of postpartum depression in immigrant women in our research was significantly higher than in other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611434057">Hung &amp; Mathers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611434057">Inandi et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659611434057">Patel, Rodriquez, &amp; DeSouza, 2002</xref>). Thus, management guidelines and potential solutions for postpartum depression are urgently needed.</p>
<p>In our research, the parental self-efficacy scores were higher for native Korean mothers than for immigrant Vietnamese mothers, but regression analysis that controlled for the commonality of general characteristics revealed no significant differences; the effects of age, education level, and family structure were found to be more significant. These results contrast with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611434057">Oh (2001)</xref>, who found no relationship between mothers’ ages and education levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659611434057">Bryanton, Gagnon, Hatem, and Johnston (2008)</xref> researched parental self-efficacy after 1 month of motherhood in 652 mothers. They found that age was the most significant predictive factor, with education level being irrelevant. Clearly, the findings in the literature remain inconclusive.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that parental self-efficacy can change for new mothers over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611434057">Oh, 2001</xref>). However, since we did not follow subjects over time, such comparisons are not possible in the present study.</p>
<p>Our research found no significant difference in parental self-efficacy between native Korean and immigrant Vietnamese mothers. Unlike postpartum depression, parental self-efficacy can be developed through education. Therefore, parental self-efficacy education programs for pregnant women and mothers at various stages must be developed, allowing for practice and continuous learning.</p>
<p>Mothers are often mentally stressed because of the need to adapt to their new role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611434057">Ha et al., 2003</xref>), and previous research has shown that this stress can cause postpartum depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611434057">Kramlinger, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611434057">Chae (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611434057">Oh (2001)</xref> argued that postpartum depression decreases as parental self-efficacy increases. Our research shows a significant correlation between postpartum depression and parental self-efficacy in native Korean mothers, but not in immigrant Vietnamese mothers. This finding for native Korean mothers is similar to those of the other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611434057">Chae, 2005</xref>). Other researchers have reported that one of the main difficulties faced by immigrant women is language and communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043659611434057">Yang &amp; Wang, 2003</xref>). Immigrant mothers experience difficulties communicating with their husbands—Korean not being their native language—and we suppose that this can contribute to postpartum depression. However, since we did not examine the relationship between postpartum depression and language difficulties in our study, future research should explore the relationship between the language difficulties experienced by immigrant mothers, and the rates of postpartum depression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1043659611434057">
<title>Implications for Future Research and Practice</title>
<p>Our findings can be used to develop postpartum management programs for immigrant mothers. Based on the results of this study, follow-up research is required to identify the factors that may increase postpartum depression among married immigrant women and to develop and apply nursing intervention programs to reduce its prevalence. Furthermore, this study determined that the parental self-efficacy of married immigrant women was influenced by factors including age, education, and family structure. The results suggest the necessity for customized programs for improving parental self-efficacy using social support systems such as married immigrant support centers in each region in Korea.</p>
