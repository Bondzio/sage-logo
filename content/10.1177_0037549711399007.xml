<p>Dr Tomasz Barszcz completed a PhD in 1997 in the field of vibration monitoring systems and a DSc in 2009 in automation and robotics. Since 2000 he has been employed at the Department of Robotics and Mechatronics at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, Poland. His main field of research combines development of monitoring systems architectures with development of advanced FDI algorithms. He is the author of four books and over 80 papers in this field. Dr Barszcz has been involved in numerous industrial projects with companies from Poland, Switzerland, Germany, UK, China, and France. The advanced monitoring and diagnostic technologies developed by the author have been implemented in various industries, including power generation (steam, gas, and wind), oil and gas, printing, railway transport, and automotive.</p>

<abstract>
<p>This work aims to present and discuss the architecture and application aspects of the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) environment, a tool created for the purpose of the modeling, simulation, data management, and visualization of power plant systems. The VPP environment is based on a general-purpose simulation package that provides a framework for incorporating a broad variety of models, ranging from real-time models to detailed models that require off-line execution. The VPP, as a tool, opens up the possibility to develop, test, and validate the feasibility of new software and hardware components within simulated operational scenarios. An original approach to tuning a first-principle model using the example of a feedwater heater by means of a parameter estimation technique is presented, along with a case study of modeling a 225 MW coal-fired power unit. The objectives are as follows: (i) develop a tuning method for this model; (ii) propose key indicators of feedwater heater performance using a model-based approach; and finally (iii) automate the calculation process of the indicators.</p>
