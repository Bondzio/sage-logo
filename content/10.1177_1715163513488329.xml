<p>The Université de Moncton is partnering with the University of Ottawa on a plan to provide pharmacy education in New Brunswick for the first time.</p>
<p>The 2 universities are working to develop a French-language Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program that would accept 12 students each year. The degree would be granted from the University of Ottawa but most of the studies would take place in New Brunswick.</p>
<p>The project is aimed at helping New Brunswick deal with a shortage of pharmacists, says Edgar Robichaud, associate vice-president, academic, with the Université de Moncton. “The deficit is particularly acute for francophone pharmacists, especially in the more rural areas.”</p>
<p>Currently, half a dozen francophone students from New Brunswick can enrol each year in pharmacy programs at Quebec universities, but as Mr. Robichaud explains, “every year, a percentage of them decide to remain in Quebec once they graduate. The idea of having a program in New Brunswick would be to increase the retention rate so that more graduates remain to practise in the province.”</p>
<p>Many of the details of the program are still being worked out but at this stage, the plan is to have the pharmacy students do 2 years of a pre-pharmacy program primarily in New Brunswick, and also spend the final 2 years of the 4-year PharmD program in the province. Discussions are also taking place with the Université de Montréal on the options for distance-learning components from that institution’s PharmD program.</p>
<p>The partnership between the University of Ottawa and the Université de Moncton has been formed under the National Consortium for Health Science Education (NCHSE), a mechanism for applying for funding support from Health Canada.</p>
<p>Provided that funding comes through, the partners are hoping the new program could be launched no later than the fall of 2015.</p>
<p>The Université de Moncton has a model for this type of collaborative program; in 2006, it began a similar joint partnership with Quebec’s Université de Sherbrooke, for medical students.</p>
<p>“The retention rate for graduates of this medical program is at least 90%,” Mr. Robichaud says. “That experience has shown that it is a good way of keeping more of our young health professionals here in New Brunswick.”</p>
