<title>I</title>
<p>Almost forty years ago I published an article about the date of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> in which I suggested that it was written at the end of the third century <sc>bce</sc>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0951820712439831">1</xref></sup> Since then, a number of articles and books on the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> or relating to it have been published. Some of these have supported positions similar to mine, while most have supported dates somewhere in the second century <sc>bce</sc>. However, the disagreement mainly centers not on the century in which the author of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> flourished, but on who ruled over Eretz-Israel at that time: the Ptolemies (= third century <sc>bce</sc> [all dates are <sc>bce</sc> if not stated otherwise]); the Seleucids (approx. 200–150) or the Hasmoneans (approx. 150–63/40).</p>
<p>Among those who suggest a Ptolemaic date for the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> are such early twentieth-century scholars as Vincent and Schürer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0951820712439831">2</xref></sup> and, more recently, A. and D. Wasserstein.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0951820712439831">3</xref></sup> A date in the second century was proposed by, for example, Bickermann, Van't Dack<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0951820712439831">4</xref></sup> and, more recently, Goodman and Bar-Kochva.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0951820712439831">5</xref></sup> The arguments for and against a date around 200 are of various kinds and degrees of importance. In the present study I will review the various arguments and try to evaluate their significance for the dating the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>.</p>
<p>It is commonly agreed upon that the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> is a pseudepigraphon by an unknown Jewish author. The <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> hardly contains any authentic historical information,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0951820712439831">6</xref></sup> yet this does not mean that the work has no value for the historian interested in the aims, ideas and the <italic>Sitz im Leben</italic> of its author and the community to which he belonged. Since it is commonly agreed that the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> pertains to the Jewish-Hellenistic literature, and more specifically to that which was produced in Alexandria, a correct dating will necessarily contribute to our knowledge of the Egyptian/Alexandrian Jewry at the period when it was written, shedding light especially upon: the attitude of this Jewish community towards the society amid which it was living, as well as its culture; its relations with its Ptolemaic rulers and their government; its conception about its own national and religious identity. To get any sound comprehension of these the right dating of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> is crucial. Such events as the Syrian wars (especially the fourth and the fifth) and the final conquest of Eretz-Israel by the Seleucids or the religious persecution by Antiochus IV and the Maccabean revolt might have changed drastically the position and the attitudes of Jews, in general as well as those in Egypt. No less important is the question under which king and circumstances were the Egyptian Jews living when the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> was written. Their situation in Egypt under the Ptolemies, who ruled there for almost 300 years, changed from time to time, as did their attitude towards their Jewish subjects. Clarifying the date of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> may help us comprehend the situation of Egyptian Jewry at a specific stage of its history.</p>
<p>The author of a pseudepigraphon usually tries to present a picture that corresponds to the identity he has assumed. In an apocalyptic pseudepigraphon, in which the visions of the pseudonymous author are detached from his present time, it is easier to detect the date of his writing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0951820712439831">7</xref></sup> But the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> belongs to a different genre. It is a Hellenistic book, written in Greek; its literary form serves as a framework for a variety of sections that belong to other various genres: a banquet that includes a lengthy series of questions and answers; letters; journey report; apologetic explanation of the Jewish laws, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0951820712439831">8</xref></sup> In a work of this kind there can be found traces of the real time of the author's actual life behind the purported time of his story, but there is not a point of time between past and future that is the present time, which is the time of the author's life and the (approximate) date of the composition. So the question before us is: When did the author, who pretends to live and to take part in the story in the days of Ptolemy II,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0951820712439831">9</xref></sup> truly write his book?</p>
<p>First, we should be aware that most of the arguments arising in the discussion on the date of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> are based on details that abound within the composition, and I would dare to say that no one element is conclusive. Quite often an argument based on a certain detail, be it a term, a geographical or topographical description, or a place name, may be contradicted by another detail carrying the same weight—and so we are brought back to the starting point. In surveying some of these arguments, we will try to check also their relative importance for the dating of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>.</p>
<p>Let us begin with a detail that is meaningful for the dating of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>. In the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> 115 there is a list of harbors that serve the needs of Eretz-Israel:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0951820712439831">10</xref></sup> ‘It also has harbors well situated to supply its needs, those at Ascalon, Joppa, and Gaza, and likewise Ptolemais, which was founded by the king’ (M. Hadas’ translation). If we compare this list to an earlier one, included in the periplus of Pseudo-Skylax,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0951820712439831">11</xref></sup> we find various differences between them: Akko is not yet called Ptolemais; Gaza is not mentioned,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0951820712439831">12</xref></sup> and some places not mentioned in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> are mentioned there. To be sure, this is not surprising given that the date of the periplus is a decade or two before Alexander's conquest of the Persian Empire, but it clearly demonstrates that such a list can reflect a real situation at a particular time. How, then, does the list found in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> reflect a specific period and accord with the situation of the harbors in other sources?</p>
<p>For the Ptolemaic period we have at our disposal the Zenon papyri, through which we can get a glimpse at the relative importance of the active harbors of the Ptolemaic province of Syria and Phoenicia around the middle of the third century. Most of those papyri that are relevant to Eretz-Israel are dated to the years 259–258, and some of them deal with activities related to the harbors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0951820712439831">13</xref></sup> Gaza and Ptolemais are the most prominent among them. Gaza is mentioned there seven times and Ptolemais six. Then Joppa is mentioned three times and Ascalon and Straton's tower only once each. The importance of Gaza is well known and the city prospered as a transit harbor for the international trade in perfumes and spices. The importance of Ptolemais is shown by its being named after Ptolemy II, though it nourished before and after this time because of its strategic location and its fertile territory (its <italic>chora</italic> that included the Zebulun Valley) and the Galilee as its hinterland. The matching of our list with the one that comes out of the Zenon papyri points to a date in the third century for the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>. This correspondence is not only in the number of times each harbor is mentioned, but also in the reverse order of importance by which each harbor is placed in the list of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas:</italic> Ascalon-Joppa-Gaza-Ptolemais. It is clearly not a geographical order. The least important is mentioned first; then Joppa, which was of somewhat more importance; then Gaza, the most important southern harbor; and, last but by no means least, Ptolemais, which was of major importance and about which there is an additional detail—its being named after the king.</p>
<p>The situation of the coastal cities of Coele Syria and Phoenicia was changed in the second century. Gaza declined in importance by comparison to Ascalon. This is the opposite situation to the one in the Persian and Ptolemaic periods, when Gaza was dominant in this part of the coast. It is reflected not only in the literary sources but also by the decline of the activity of its mint by comparison to that of Ascalon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0951820712439831">14</xref></sup> Under the Seleucids also two other cities are mentioned more often, Azotus (Ashdod) and Iamnia (Yabneh), the second one is probably also mentioned in a royal letter of Antiochus V.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0951820712439831">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Comparing the situation of the harbors on the coast of the Ptolemaic province of Syria and Phoenicia with that of the Seleucid province of the same area (and evidently under the Hasmoneans) indicates that the list in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> could have been written between the years 246 (the death of Ptolemy II) and 200 (the loss of Syria and Phoenicia to the Seleucids).</p>
<p>Proposals to date the list in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> 115 to the time of the Hasmoneans are not convincing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0951820712439831">16</xref></sup> The Hasmoneans never ruled over Ptolemais, nor over Ascalon. Gaza ‘enjoyed’ belligerent relations with the Hasmoneans and was destroyed by Janneus, and the most important port of Hasmonean Judea was Jaffa.</p>
<p>There are additional considerations that strengthen the probability that the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> was written at the end of the third century, that is, the end of Ptolemaic rule over Syria and Phoenicia. The geopolitical situation of both Egypt and Eretz-Israel was one of a united political entity, which fits well with its situation under the Ptolemies. This impression is not to be taken as definitive proof—only as a positive consideration that supports our suggested dating. Yet it is not the only one. The free and easy movement between Judea and Egypt, the taking for granted that both are part and parcel of one and the same kingdom, looks authentic and does not seem to be an attempt to fabricate a situation of the past to impress an audience living in another period. It is true that the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> is a ‘legend’, as Wasserstein and Wasserstein put it (see n. 6 above). The legend's virtual time is that of Ptolemy II, and the atmosphere/<italic>Sitz im Leben</italic> of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> is about half a century later.</p>
<p>The apologetics of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> are also different from those of latter periods. In his defense of the Jewish laws and the ‘profound logic’ (oύ) in them (143), the author provides an explanation of the Jewish alimentary laws (144–47). Curiously enough, mice and weasels are mentioned as non-<italic>kosher</italic> food prohibited to Jews. Pigs, the most abominable and impure animals in Jewish eyes, at least since the time of the religious persecution by Antiochus IV, are not mentioned at all (see below). As the news about Antiochus’ persecution was well known among the Egyptian Jews,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0951820712439831">17</xref></sup> it seems probable that the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> was written before this traumatic event (167–64). In sum, the apologetics in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> are much more ‘philosophical’ and relaxed, even somewhat ironic,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0951820712439831">18</xref></sup> and do not suit a post-Epiphanian period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0951820712439831">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>This consideration applies also to the first quarter of the second century, that is, the early Seleucid period in Eretz-Israel (approx. 200–175). Nevertheless, I think that this it is less probable than the last quarter of the third century because there is not the slightest sign that the author was aware of the expulsion of the Ptolemies from Syria and Phoenicia. It must be admitted that this is an <italic>argumentum e silentio</italic>, but it is also inconceivable that a book that admires the Ptolemies and written after 200 will be completely indifferent to such a dramatic change for both the Ptolemies and the Jews, especially as the plot is being played out both in Egypt and in Eretz-Israel.</p>

<title>II</title>
<p>The most influential research on the dating of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> is currently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0951820712439831">Bickerman's 2007</xref> article. Nevertheless, it is advisable to review his arguments for dating the work to the second half of the second century, a line of reasoning based methodically on details of style and terminology.</p>
<p>Bickerman deals with the opening formulas <italic>(formulae valetudinis)</italic> in two fictional letters included in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> and compares them to similar formulas found in the extant papyri. His mastery of the papyrological documents is astonishing (especially considering that his work appeared before the creation of the papyrological database hosted at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.papyri.info">www.papyri.info</ext-link>), but is his argumentation methodically sound?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0951820712439831">20</xref></sup> The formulas under discussion are short and simple,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0951820712439831">21</xref></sup> but the texts that are compared, namely, the letters in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> and the formal papyrological documents, are not similar. On the one hand, we have letters in literary and fictional framework, on the other hand, we have authentic letters on papyri. Do the common stylistic features between the sources provide an absolute criterion for dating the <italic>Letter of Aristeas?</italic> Almost all the papyri under discussion are products of the Ptolemaic bureaucracy. Is the writer of a work of literature/imagination obliged to know and to adapt exactly the bureaucratic style of his day or may he write more freely? It should be clear that scrutiny of stylistic details in the letters mentioned above is not intended to verify their authenticity, about which there is a consensus that they are not authentic. Similarly, the intention in not to compare various papyrological and epigraphic texts in order to date un-dated or incomplete documents of the same kind. Rather, the objective is to date a literary work by comparing it to formal bureaucratic style. So, for instance, though the opening of the letter of Eleazar the high priest to Ptolemy II is historically and stylistically unacceptable, literarily and apologetically it is reasonable. ‘Eleazar the High Priest to his true friend (ί ί) King Ptolemy, greeting’ (M. Hadas’ translation). Considering respectfully Bickerman's arguments to show this formula to go against third-century Ptolemaic bureaucratic usage, it should be also admitted that it serves well the author's intention of stressing and manifesting the grandeur of the Jewish high priest side-by-side with, and not inferior to, the illustrious king, and to emphasize their friendship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0951820712439831">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>For other differences of formulaic style it should also be considered that some idiomatic formulas could be the product of copyists' work; the copyist, intentionally or unintentionally, may have written in the style prevailing at his time. Bickerman himself brings examples for this.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0951820712439831">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Much of Bickerman's dating depends also on the use in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> of the term ‘Aoύ (‘chief of the bodyguard’). He dates the earliest use of this word as an honorary title to the year 138.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0951820712439831">24</xref></sup> From this time, in the reign of Ptolemy VI, it is clear that there existed among the court classes of the Ptolemies, a rank of ‘Aoύ which, in name only, were ‘chief bodyguards’. But does this prohibit the use of the <italic>Genitivus partitivus</italic> in its elementary meaning in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> 40 (ἀά ὲ ὶ oύ Aέ  'Aouά)? All that is said there is that Andreas was not the one and only chief bodyguard of the king. This is evident from his being mentioned with Sosibius, and the fact that both bear the same title (<italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> 12). When Andreas is mentioned a second time, what was more exact, both grammatically and logically, than to refer to him as one of those two, or simply as one of a number of real chiefs of the bodyguard.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0951820712439831">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Why was Andreas ever described as a chief of the bodyguard in our ‘legend’? Clearly in a court tale<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0951820712439831">26</xref></sup> the heroes are expected to be intimates of the king, as we see with the historical cupbearer Nehemiah, Ahiqar, the vizier of the king of Assyria, judaized in the book of Tobit (1.21–22), the fictitious Daniel and his friends, Zerubbabel (the Jewish bodyguard of Darius) and his colleagues (the non-Jewish bodyguards),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0951820712439831">27</xref></sup> or some of the good non-Jewish personae in the book of Esther.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0951820712439831">28</xref></sup> Similarly, the individuals mentioned in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> were close associates of Ptolemy II: Demetrius of Phalerum, Sosibius, Aristeas himself (<italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> 40), and so also Andreas, an emissary of the king. Consequently, though Bickerman is right about the honorary meaning of the ‘Aoύ which arose during Ptolemy VI's time, it does not perforce mean that our author used the plural form, and not the <italic>Genitivus partitivus</italic>, in order to tell his readers/audience that Andreas was an idle bearer of an empty title<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0951820712439831">29</xref></sup> rather than a real distinguished chief bodyguard, a member of the inner circle of the court of Ptolemy II.</p>
<p>It would be tedious to review all the arguments for and against a dating of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> shortly before 200. Bickerman reviewed some of them and refuted some that he considered to be valueless as date markers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0951820712439831">30</xref></sup> Thus, we will seek to strengthen our suggested dating only with some subsidiary arguments of detail.</p>
<p>A somewhat curious passage in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> that was mentioned above is the one concerning the abstention from the meat of certain animals (144–51). What is astounding there is that pork is not mentioned at all, though pig is the most repulsive animal for Jews, as was well noticed by pagans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0951820712439831">31</xref></sup> It seems to me that it can be taken as an indication of pre-Epiphanian dating of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0951820712439831">32</xref></sup> as explained above.</p>
<p>It is also striking how serene and self-confident is the atmosphere reflected in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> concerning the Jews' position under the Ptolemies both in Egypt and in Eretz-Israel. They are admired, accepted, and portrayed achieving their aims. Their community functions freely, has its own leaders (ήoύo, 309) and enforces rules for its members (310–11). At most, their dietary laws are lightly ridiculed by means of humorous comments made by strangers (144), but there is no hindrance to an open theological/philosophical dialog with non-Jews, and the Jews are seemingly not threatened from any quarter. Comparison of the intellectual, religious, and political atmosphere in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>, on the one hand, and in <italic>3 Maccabees</italic>, on the other hand, shows a gap between them that puts the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> in the third century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0951820712439831">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among those who date the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> to the second century there are some who suggest a relatively early date within this century, that is, a pre-Epiphanian date. Orlinsky suggests a pre-Epiphanian date (the year 170) for various reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0951820712439831">34</xref></sup> Accepting an early second-century date of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> raises the question ‘Why not a late third century date instead?’ Seleucid rule over Syria and Phoenicia is not mentioned, in fact not even hinted at in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>. Many of the arguments based on words and terms are far from being conclusive for the dating, and the cultural and political setting better suits a date preceding the year 200.</p>
<p>An objection to this dating was raised in 1996 by Bar-Kochva. His main argument for a date at the end of the second century (118/116–113) rests on the description of the citadel in Jerusalem. He relates to the citadel as a realistic edifice in the generally unrealistic and unhistorical legend of Pseudo-Aristeas. A similar approach to the citadel as reflecting ‘contemporary conditions’ of the author's time is adopted by Goodman, though he derives from it a date around 200.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0951820712439831">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>But why should the citadel be a better date pointer than other details in the story, especially the harbor list? According to Bar-Kochva, the citadel stood on the site of the <italic>Baris</italic> and of the future location of the Antonia. He emphasizes the statements in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> that tell that the soldiers that served in the citadel were all Jews and under the command of the high priest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0951820712439831">36</xref></sup> But is the description of the citadel distinguished by ‘the absence of parallels’ as Bar-Kochva pleads?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0951820712439831">37</xref></sup> In the book of Nehemiah a citadel and its governor/commander are mentioned (‘Hanania <italic>sar HaBira al Yerushalaim’</italic>, Neh. 7.2 and 2.8), and the soldiers there, as they were in Nehemiah's time, were also Jews. Why then not maintain that the author of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> described Jerusalem and its citadel under the influence of such reminiscences? The books of Ezra and Nehemiah were indeed well known to him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0951820712439831">38</xref></sup> It is unknown whether this <italic>Bira</italic> was higher than the temple, but considering the Greek word <italic>acropolis</italic> (100, ῎ A  ;  ἄ), ἄo means ‘highest’, and the necessity to find a way for the king's emissaries, forbidden as non-Jews to enter the temple's precincts, to describe the temple to the readers of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>, required of the author to put them on a roof from where they could observe the temple and describe it and what was going on within it. What was more suitable for a high observation post, in the framework of a stereotypic Hellenistic city, than the real or virtual acra/acropolis of Jerusalem?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0951820712439831">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reference in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> to the high priest as the commander of the citadel and to Jewish soldiers stationed there reminds of the <italic>Bira</italic> under Hananiah <italic>Sar HaBira</italic> (Neh. 7.2) and of the <italic>ne'arim</italic>, the armed servants of Nehemiah that guarded the builders of the wall of Jerusalem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0951820712439831">40</xref></sup> This part of the story has an additional function—to enhance the reputation of the Jews as faithful, devoted, disciplined and efficient soldiers in the Hellenistic armies. Service as mercenaries and military settlers was an important occupation for Jews in the Hellenistic period, and depicting Jews as potentially good soldiers served a common Jewish interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0951820712439831">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>To sum up: the description of the citadel does not contradict any date at the end of the third century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0951820712439831">42</xref></sup> As for Goodman's statement that ‘allusions to the fortress are compatible with a date around 200 B.C.’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0951820712439831">43</xref></sup> I tend to agree with him and suggest that ‘around’ could be very short time before 200.</p>
<p>Bar-Kochva adds some other details, following earlier scholars, to strengthen his dating of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>. One of them is the argument that the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> was written later than 1 Maccabees on the basis of the similarity between the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> 13 (of the Jews emancipated by Ptolemy II, 30,000 were armed and settled in garrisons in the country [i.e. Egypt]) and 1 Macc. 10.36–37 (from the letter of Demetrius II: ‘30,000 Jews shall be enlisted in the forces of the king… Some of them shall be stationed in the great royal fortresses…’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0951820712439831">44</xref></sup> Goodman's reservation about the weight of this similarity is rejected by Bar-Kochva but I think that it should be carefully considered. The similarity between the two cases is partial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0951820712439831">45</xref></sup> The date of 1 Maccabees is only agreed upon in general terms, around 100 <sc>bce</sc>, so are we to suppose that it was read in Egypt in its original Hebrew version, or more reasonably in its Greek translation, which is surely later, as early as 118?</p>
<p>As for the arguments concerning the regions of Samaria/Samaritis and the land of the Idumaeans,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0951820712439831">46</xref></sup> the painstaking scrutiny of these passages does not establish the late dating of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>. The Ptolemaic province of Syria and Phoenicia was one geographical-administrative unit. It included all the regions, cities and rivers mentioned in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> and—admitting that the author did not have sound knowledge of the country or conscientiously attempted to depict a biblical or ideal/utopic holy land—all of them, including Samaritis and the land of the Idumaeans, could have been written at the end of the third century <sc>bce.</sc></p>
<p>There are further arguments for and against the early date—that is, shortly before 200—that can be proposed for the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>. Several of these depend on the date of other writings and on whether each one of them preceded or succeeded the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0951820712439831">47</xref></sup> Many of these dates and the relationship between them and the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> are not conclusive; as a result, while there is no decisive information, the balance of the evidence, as examined and presented above, supports the dating of the composition of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> to the late third century. Only new evidence or a completely new kind of argument can undermine it.</p>

<title>Addendum</title>
<p>The following comments are intended to account of publications that have appeared in the interval between the present work's writing/submission and its publication.</p>
<p>In her detailed treatment of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0951820712439831">Rajak (2009</xref>: 34, 50) concluded that the work was not a historically authentic reflection of Jewish aspirations, culture and social standing in Ptolemaic Egypt. Despite the fact that she refers to the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> as ‘one of the earliest’ Hellenistic-Jewish writings, nevertheless she dates the work only in general terms: ‘A mid-second-century date looks likely on literary grounds’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0951820712439831">48</xref></sup> Taking account of her two excellent chapters on the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>, it seems to me that the end of the third century better suits her depiction of Egyptian Jewry. Her discussion of the Septuagint's origin and its importance are less relevant to our argumentation, but the general agreement that the translation of the <italic>Torah</italic> into Greek began in the time of Ptolemy II (280–246) leaves enough time for the creation of the ‘myth’ about the translation in the collective memory of Egyptian Jewry that is preserved in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>.</p>
<p>Recently I also became aware of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0951820712439831">Goldstein's 1991</xref> discussion of ‘strange features’ in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> that deserves consideration: The basic conception behind the cases brought by Goldstein is that the positive depiction of the Ptolemies is a polemic against the Seleucid regime in Eretz-Israel and against the Hasmonean regime (p. 10). But is there any reason to reject the obvious intention of the author to praise the Ptolemies for their own sake? There were various good reasons for Egyptian Jews to cherish sympathy to their ruling dynasty, which they served as officials, soldiers and policemen and to be satisfied to refer to its benevolence toward them. Besides, in this time (218–202 <sc>bce</sc>) there was something of a pro-Seleucid tendency among the Jewish aristocracy in Judea, a tendency that can explain pro-Ptolemaic propaganda, if such an explanation is necessary.</p>
<p>The ‘strange features’ (p. 10), as Goldstein defined several stories in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>, cannot be understood as either strangeness or polemic. The liberation of the Jewish slaves by Ptolemy II could have been a historical memory nourished among Jews in Egypt. It is not, however, an isolated detail that crops up in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> without a specific reason and from an unknown source. We can cite other reminiscences, such as the mines of copper and iron in the Arabian mountains (119–20) or the Jewish soldiers in Egypt under the Persians and even earlier (13, within the digression about the liberation of the Jewish slaves, discussed by Goldstein). This last detail is historically sound, yet how it came to be known by the author of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> remains uncertain. The geographical descriptions of Samaria and parts of Idumaea, as well as the references to the harbors, tend, in Goldstein view, to show ‘that the author's point is precisely the difference of conditions in Judea under the Ptolemies from those of his own time’ (1991: 22 n. 35). But if according to Goldstein the conditions described are those that existed under the Ptolemies, why not ascribe the date of the <italic>Letter</italic> to their period? It is also more reasonable to date it to a contemporaneous writer than to one who wrote in the 130s, about 70 years after these conditions were changed. More impressive is the comparison made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0951820712439831">Goldstein (1991</xref>: 13–17) between the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> and 1 Maccabees. Yet, Goldstein's argumentation faces two obstacles to be used as criteria for dating the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic>. One is that the similarities between the two books are trivial (the use of ‘sideboard’ [uo] in both books; the references to 100 and 1000 talents, which may simply be round/conventional figures), and the other is that if the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> was written, as Goldstein maintains, in the 130s, how could it be a response to 1 Maccabees, which was written, according to most scholars, around 100 (as agreed by Goldstein himself, who dates it to the 90s in the time of Janneus [see his commentaries on 1 and 2 Maccabees [1976: 63; 1984: 83, respectively]). Besides, one should consider the span of time that likely passed before 1 Maccabees was translated into Greek.</p>
<p>In general terms the positive description and attitude towards the Ptolemies should not be turned into a polemic against someone else. As for some of Goldstein's ‘puzzling aspects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0951820712439831">Goldstein 1991</xref>: 6), ‘strange aspects’ (p. 7), and so on, I suggest we look to the creativity of our author. He chose to include passages and digressions that suited his own taste, even if sometimes they may be tedious to the modern reader (p. 5). The author was fascinated by the biblical (Septuagint) description of the temple's utensils and enjoyed describing them; he thought the ‘tedious’ and long symposium of the translators and the king to be illuminating and relevant to his own interests and to those of his audience; he may have had a better writing talent than an editorial one. We should regard his book not as a polemic disguised so well that no reader in antiquity could uncover its secret intentions without reading its modern interpretations. Consequently, I am not convinced that the author of the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> intentionally wrote a foundation story of Egyptian Jewry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0951820712439831">Hacham 2005</xref>); quite simply, it does not disclose any indication that ill-feeling was felt towards those Jews living outside Judea. It contains various stories entwined around its backbone as a letter/<italic>diegesis</italic>, and there is no need to look for a single motive or objective of the book. ‘The Letter of Aristeas possesses richness and complexity that cannot be captured in a brief formula’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0951820712439831">Gruen 1998</xref>: 214; cf. also 212–22).</p>

From their listings it is evident that Gaza's mint was the most active in Philistia (50 coins of Azotus are recorded; 55 coins of Ascalon and 1231 coins of Gaza [pp. 76–143]—Gaza has also the most prolific coins types [p. 74, list 4.D]). For the mint of Ascalon in the second century, we should note the hoard of 25 tetradrachms minted there between the years 122/121 to 113/112 found at Marisa (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0951820712439831">Barkay 1992–93</xref>).</p></fn>

Bar-Kochva's statement is correct and the list of these four harbors responds well to these methodological criteria. Its sources are neither biblical nor Hellenistic and perfectly realistic. It is not, as Bar-Kochva states, ‘traditionally known’. Pseudo-Skylax does not mention Gaza, which was south of the Phoenician zone. This is clear from Pseudo-Skylax, who signifies Ascalon as the most southern Phoenician city, and from Herodotos 3.5. When Alexander besieged Gaza it was defended by Arab troops (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0951820712439831">Schürer 1973</xref>–87: II, 99 n. 63, for the sources).

It is true that anti-Semitism (or preferably, anti-Judaism) existed in Egypt well before the Ptolemies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0951820712439831">Schäfer 1997</xref>: 121–35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0951820712439831">Yoyotte 1963</xref>); nevertheless' it is very dubious that the events in Elephantine were held as such in the collective memory of the Alexandrian Jews. In the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> (13), if there is any shred of historical reality preserved, it is of the service of Jews as mercenaries centuries before the establishment of the Ptolemaic rule in Egypt. This fact was preserved in the collective memory and for good reason. It could serve the Jewish reputation as soldiers in the service of the Ptolemies, but there is no hint of any awareness to the ‘pogrom’ in Elephantine, neither in the <italic>Letter of Aristeas</italic> nor in any other Jewish-Alexandrian work. Note the argument between Schäfer and Mélèze-Modrzejewski about the impact of the Elephantine event; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0951820712439831">Schäfer 1997</xref>: 265 n. 73.</p></fn>

As much as this preference depends on the ‘Philo-Semitism’ of Ptolemy Philometor (his second period of rule 164–145 <sc>bce</sc>), I wonder if indeed the letter could not be written even at the time of a ruler who did not show sympathy for his Jewish subjects. At such a time the exemplary benevolent attitude of a former king, as Philadelphus, could serve Jewish interests much better (Philo presents the positive politics of Augustus towards the Jews as exemplary precisely in the somber days of Caligula, 37–41 <sc>ce</sc>).</p></fn>
