<title>Methods</title>
<p>Organ of Corti explants dissected from 3-day-old rats were cultured in control media, TNFα, and TNFα + Bax siRNA at 0, 48, and 72 hours in vitro.

<sec id="section5-0194599813477631">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The TNFα-damaged explants demonstrated significant decreases in viable HCs in the basal turn with corresponding increased levels of Bax gene and protein expression, compared with control explant levels. The levels of viable HCs and Bax gene and protein expression in TNFα + Bax siRNA-treated explants approached levels measured in control explants. Immunolocalization studies showed increased Bax protein expression in basal turn HCs in TNFα-treated explants, whereas control explants and TNFα + Bax siRNA–treated explants had low levels of Bax expression.</p>

<sec id="section6-0194599813477631">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>TNFα initiates the programmed cell death of auditory HCs in OC explants through upregulation of proapoptotic Bax gene and protein expression. Bax siRNA blocks TNFα-induced apoptosis of HCs by decreasing the TNFα-induced levels of Bax mRNA and protein expression in treated explants. Bax siRNA is an effective treatment for TNFα-induced ototoxicity in OC explants in vitro and has great potential to be a therapeutic agent against trauma/inflammation-induced hearing loss.</p>

<p>Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is released into the cochlea following various traumas to the inner ear, including noise-induced hearing loss (HL), vibration-induced HL, hypoxia, cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, sensorineural HL associated with bacterial meningitis, and autoimmune inner ear disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813477631">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813477631"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813477631">8</xref></sup> This cytokine can initiate apoptosis of auditory hair cells (HCs) through activation of transcription factor c-Jun, Bax protein, and the caspase cascade in rat organ of Corti (OC) in vitro. Recently, several drug therapies have demonstrated protective effects against TNFα-induced HC loss in vitro by altering the expression levels of a number of cell death and survival molecules involved in apoptosis (eg, Bax).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813477631">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813477631"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813477631">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Blocking the expression of specific cell death molecules following trauma or inflammation to the inner ear can potentially protect against apoptosis of auditory HCs and associated HL. Bax expression is linked to the initiation of apoptosis in several cell types, is associated with TNFα-induced auditory HC death in vitro,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813477631">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813477631">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813477631">14</xref></sup> is reduced in HC survival in the same animal model, and is a reasonable and specific target for ameliorating trauma/inflammation-induced HC death and HL.</p>
<p>RNA interference has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of inner ear disorders by targeting specific genes responsible for particular disease phenotypes and HC death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813477631">15</xref></sup> Short interfering RNA (siRNA) is a double-stranded RNA molecule that is approximately 21 to 25 nucleotides in length and has 2-nucleotide 3′ overhangs and 5′-phosphate termini that exist endogenously in a cell or can be synthesized and introduced into the cytoplasm using various viral, protein, or lipid-based vectors. In the cytoplasm, the siRNAs are incorporated into a multicomponent nuclease called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC will unwind the duplex siRNA and use it to identify its complementary sequence on a target mRNA substrate. When the target mRNA is identified by RISC-siRNA, the mRNA will be marked for degradation and cleaved by endonucleases, thereby preventing the translation of the mRNA strand and specifically blocking protein synthesis of that particular target gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813477631">16</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-0194599813477631" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>To assess the effects of siRNA targeting Bax on native and TNFα-damaged OC explants, fluorescence microscopy for viable hair cell counts (n = 36 OC), real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Bax gene expression (n = 96 OC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Bax protein expression (n = 27 OC), and immunofluorescence for Bax localization (n = 12 OC) were performed. A total of 171 OC from 86 rats were used.</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599813477631">
<title>Cell Cultures</title>
<p>The animals were treated in compliance with the published Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publications No. 80-23), revised in 1996. The study was performed in accordance to the University of Miami Internal Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocol (11-086). Three-day-old Sprague-Dawley laboratory rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Massachusetts) were anesthetized on ice for 45 minutes. The OC explants were dissected en bloc and subsequently placed in serum-free media consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with glucose (6 g/L), N-1 supplement (1%), and penicillin-G (500 U/mL). The explants were then cultured in (1) culture media without treatment—control, (2) Bax siRNA (various concentrations, 0.05-1.5 µM; #4390815; Ambion, Life Technologies, Grand Island, New York), (3) Negative siRNA (1 µM; #4611G; Ambion), (4) HiPerfect transfection agent (0.5% or 1.0%; #301704; Qiagen, Germantown, Maryland), (5) recombinant rat TNFα (2 µg/mL; Cell Sciences, Canton, Massachusetts), (6) TNFα + Bax siRNA (1 µM), and (7) TNFα + HiPerfect (0.5%). Concentration of TNFα is based on a dose-dependent response study that resulted in &lt;20% viable HCs at 96 hours in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813477631">13</xref></sup> The concentrations of Bax siRNA (1 µM) and HiPerfect (0.5%) are based on results from dose-dependent response studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813477631"><bold>Figures 1</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813477631"><bold>2</bold></xref>).

<title>Transfection</title>
<p>To create transfection complexes prior to culture, siRNA was incubated in a lipid-based HiPerfect transfection reagent per the manufacturer’s protocol (Fast Forward Transfection) using serum-free culture medium for 10 minutes at 25°C. The siRNA mixture was then added to the culture media containing OC explants to achieve a desired final concentration of siRNA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599813477631">
<title>Hair Cell Viability</title>
<p>After whole OCs were dissected, they were cultured for 72 hours for conditions 1, 2, and 4 to 7. They were subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours, then permeabilized and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–labeled phalloidin (P5282; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri). They were then mounted on a glass slide with antifade mounting medium and coverslipped. Using a ×40 lens fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), the number of viable inner HCs (IHCs), outer HCs (OHCs), and total hair cells (THCs) was counted for 100 µm (most susceptible area of HC loss) to assess the effect of transfection reagent on HC survival of native OC explants or 300-µm lengths (representative area) of the basal turn of the basilar membrane of each explant to evaluate the treatment effect of Bax siRNA on TNFα-damaged OC explants. The OC explants were considered viable if they possessed an intact cuticular plate and stereociliary bundle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599813477631">
<title>Quantitative Real-Time PCR</title>
<p>For quantitative RT-PCR, OC explants were cultured in conditions 1 to 3, 5, and 6 for 0 and 48 hours. Total RNA was isolated from the middle-and-basal turns using the animal tissue protocol provided with the RNeasy Protect Kit (Qiagen), and contaminant DNA was removed with DNase (RNase-Free DNase Set; Qiagen). Following RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis was completed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California) and the Eppendorf thermal cycler. Primers were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, Texas). Real-time PCR was performed using the CFX96 PCR detection system and Bio-Rad C1000 thermal cycler with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). PCR was completed using primers for GAPDH (housekeeping gene) and Bax genes. The following sequence specific primers were used: GAPDH forward (fwd), 5′-GCCTCGTCTCATAGACAAGATGGTG-3′; GAPDH reverse (rev), 5′-GATCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATG-GTGA-3′ (257 base pair [bp]; NCBI reference sequence: NM_017008.3); Bax (fwd), 5′-AACTTCAACTGGGGCCG-CGT-3′; and Bax (rev), 5′-AGAGGAGGCCTTCCCAGC-CAC-3′ (178 bp; NM_017059.2). Real-time PCR was carried out to 45 cycles at 95°C, 60°C, and 72°C, for 50 seconds each. To ensure primer specificity and evaluate contamination, melting curves were also performed. The 2<sup>–ΔΔCT</sup> method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599813477631">22</xref></sup> was used to calculate mean fold changes (MFCs) in Bax mRNA levels. The MFCs are normalized to housekeeping gene GAPDH and expression levels of control explants.</p>

<sec id="section12-0194599813477631">
<title>Bax ELISA</title>
<p>The OC explants were cultured in conditions 1, 5, and 6 for 48 hours in vitro for ELISA. Subsequently, the apical turns of the explants were carefully removed, and remaining middle-and-basal turns of the explants were placed in chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts), lysed with a Microson XL-2000 Sonifier (Misonix, Farmingdale, New York), centrifuged for 10 minutes, and then stored at −80°C until all samples were collected. Samples were subsequently thawed on ice and concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay technique and rat Bax ELISA Kit (R6995; TSZ ELISA, Waltham, Massachusetts) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Then, 10 µg of protein was used for each ELISA reaction. Absorbances were measured using the ELx800 Absorbance Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, Vermont) at 450 nm.</p>

<title>Bax Protein Localization</title>
<p>The OC explants were cultured in conditions 1, 5, and 6 for 48 hours in vitro for Bax localization studies. The explants were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 1% methanol in 0.1M PBS for 48 hours at 4°C and then incubated in 5% normal goat serum (NGS; Invitrogen, Camarillo, California) and 1% Triton X-100 (Shelton Scientific, Shelton, Connecticut) in PBS for 60 minutes at 25°C. Subsequently, explants were incubated with primary polyclonal rabbit anti–rat-Bax (ab69643; Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts) at 1:200 dilution in 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1% NGS in PBS for 24 hours at 4°C, followed by secondary antibody tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)–labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (T2769; Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) at 1:200 dilution for 60 minutes at 25°C, followed by FITC-labeled phalloidin for 45 minutes at 25°C, and finally with 300 nM 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution (D1306; Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) for 5 minutes at 25°C. The explants were then transferred to a glass slide with antifade mounting medium, coverslipped, and observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope using a ×40 oil immersion lens (Leica SP5 inverted, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany; NEI Core Center Grant P30 EY014801). Z-stack images of the basal turn were acquired using the following settings: DAPI, excitation 400 nm, emission 430 to 470 nm; FITC, excitation 488 nm, emission 500 to 550 nm; and TRITC, excitation 562, emission 580 to 660 nm.</p>

<title>Suppression of Bax mRNA Expression</title>
<p>To introduce synthetic siRNA against Bax into cultured cells, HiPerfect was used. The OC explants were initially cultured in the following conditions (n = 4/condition): control media, HiPerfect (0.5%), and HiPerfect (1.0%) for 72 hours in vitro to determine potential for transfection reagent ototoxicity. After explants were stained with FITC-phalloidin and observed with a fluorescent microscope, viable HCs were counted for 100 µm of the basal turn—the portion of the basilar membrane that is most susceptible to injury. There were no significant differences in the numbers of IHCs, OHCs, and THCs between all 3 treatment conditions (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813477631"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Based on these findings, HiPerfect (0.5%) was used for the remainder of the siRNA experimentation.</p>
<p>To quantitate Bax suppression by Bax-targeting siRNA, RT-PCR was performed using 50 ng of total RNA for specimens cultured in control media or Bax siRNA (0.05-1.5 µM) after 72 hours in vitro (n = 6/condition). There was an inverse dose-dependent response seen with increasing concentrations of Bax siRNA in vitro at 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813477631"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>).

<p>The number of viable IHCs, OHCs, and THCs that contained an intact cuticular plate and stereociliary bundle was counted over 300 µM of the basal turn of the basilar membrane. Data analysis was performed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc testing. There were significant decreases in the number of viable IHCs, OHCs, and THCs at 72 hours in TNFα-treated explants (n = 6/condition; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) when compared with both control and TNFα + Bax siRNA groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599813477631"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). There was a significant but small increase in the number of THCs in the TNFα + Bax siRNA–treated group when compared with the control group, likely representing a respective increase in the number of viable IHCs. This finding may be due to suppression of basal levels of Bax protein, which is seen in Bax protein expression studies; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. There were no significant differences between the number of OHCs between the TNFα + Bax siRNA group and control explants. When TNFα + HiPerfect explants were compared with TNFα explants, no difference between the number of IHCs, OHCs, and THCs was found (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599813477631"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>), and thus Bax gene and protein expression for the TNFα + HiPerfect condition was not pursued in efforts to limit the number of animals used extraneously.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The molecular mechanisms behind apoptosis of auditory HCs are not completely understood but have been shown to involve multiple factors, including TNFα, oxidative stress, pro-death mitochondrial proteins, JNK signaling, and Bax activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813477631">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813477631"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813477631">14</xref></sup> Bax, or Bcl-2-associated X protein, is a 21-kD protein that belongs to the family of Bcl-2–related proteins important for regulation of programmed cell death. The majority of Bax lies in the cytoplasm, and when activated by an apoptotic signal, it undergoes a conformational change and attaches to the outer mitochondrial membrane, resulting in activation of mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels. The end result of Bax activation is the release of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins into the cytosol, activation of caspases, and apoptosis of a cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599813477631">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>RNA interference is an emerging and novel therapeutic modality that has been used in prior studies to protect against hearing loss from GJB2 mutant protein expression and cisplatin ototoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813477631">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813477631"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813477631"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813477631">20</xref></sup> Bax expression has been demonstrated in TNFα-initiated apoptosis of HCs in vitro,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813477631">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813477631">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813477631">14</xref></sup> and theoretically, HC death can be prevented in TNFα-induced ototoxicity by using siRNA that specifically targets Bax mRNA for degradation.</p>
<p>This present study demonstrates that TNFα can initiate apoptosis of HCs in vitro through upregulation of Bax mRNA and protein levels within the basal turn of the basilar membrane in rat OC explants. Treatment with a siRNA targeting Bax protects against HC loss from TNFα ototoxicity by specifically and effectively decreasing expression levels of Bax mRNA and protein within the HCs of the basal turn, as demonstrated by RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunolocalization studies. Bax siRNA has great potential as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of hearing loss associated with TNFα expression. However, in vivo studies using Bax siRNA are needed to elucidate the effects of Bax siRNA on auditory brainstem response thresholds following trauma/inflammatory insult to the inner ear.</p>
<p>RNA interference offers great advantages in the treatment of hearing loss as it has the ability to identify and specifically block desired drug targets. This study has demonstrated that the sensory cells of the OC are sensitive to the effects of siRNA in vitro and that siRNA, particularly Bax siRNA, can have great potential in the treatment of trauma/inflammation-induced hearing loss in vivo.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>TNFα, a cytokine released during trauma/inflammation to the inner ear, can initiate apoptosis of HCs through alterations in the levels of Bax mRNA and protein, which can be mitigated by treatment with a siRNA that targets Bax expression. Bax siRNA is capable of reducing Bax mRNA and protein expression in OC explants and decreasing Bax expression within auditory HCs in vitro that have been exposed to TNFα. Bax siRNA has the potential to block HC loss in trauma/inflammation-induced hearing loss; however, more studies are needed to assess its objective and functional value in an in vivo model.</p>
