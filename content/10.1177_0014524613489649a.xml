<p>This latest Brueggemann offering is a compendium of articles previously published in the periodical <italic>Journal of Preachers</italic>. Each offering is a relatively short, self-contained piece, but they all share an interest in encouraging the preacher in the homiletic task, and specifically in the call to be ‘truth-tellers’, those charged with ‘the enactment and conveyance of this Person who is truth’ (p. xiii). Focused around discussions as to what comprises truth, Brueggemann addresses the preacher’s task of setting forth an alternative, subversive way of living, one that challenges contemporary ideas and values and that presents a discourse of alternative, dissident truth. As such his ‘readers’ become his congregation – the articles adopt something of a homiletic tone, and the rhythmic and lively prose deserves to be <italic>heard</italic> as much as read. The sermonic style is not, though, at the cost of academic or scholarly interaction, and there are frequent footnotes offering further comment on the matter in hand.</p>
<p>The volume comprises eight chapters or articles; each takes a different shape/tone, but they share a common aim. The essays are not dated, except for one written the day after the attack on the Twin Towers, but contemporary references (for example, to the Truth &amp; Reconciliation commission in South Africa) suggest that they cover a relatively wide spectrum of time (though still, for this reader at least, remain relevant and contemporary). Attempting to encourage and nurture what Brueggemann terms an ‘evangelical faith’ (p. 18), familiar biblical concepts or motifs are explored in the proclamation of a radical, subversive truth. Unsurprisingly perhaps, he draws on core Hebrew Bible images as the focus for his ‘truth-telling’ exploration; he revisits the Exodus and Sinai as focal points for the proclamation of good news, and considers the Mosaic mission as a framework for Lenten exhortation. The sixth chapter (which shares the title of the whole book) has a particular engagement with the ninth commandment, and particularly the fact that false witness is not to be offered to one’s <italic>neighbour</italic>, and its implications, therefore, for how one speaks of God and the world. Elsewhere, Brueggemann offers some useful insights into how themes develop within the biblical tradition; for example, in a piece seeking to hold to both the non-negotiability of the Decalogue and equally the need for interpretive openness in its application, he plots the development of the Sabbath commandment and its varying usage within the Hebrew Bible tradition.</p>
<p>This set of essays does not expand significantly on ideas found in other parts of the Brueggemann portfolio, and one would probably not expect them to do so. There are significant echoes here of his articulation elsewhere of the ‘prophetic imagination’. But the articles form a succinct, readable set, particularly for the exhortation to challenge hearers as to their capacity for self-deception.</p>
