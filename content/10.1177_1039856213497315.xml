<p>I imagine I speak for many of us when I say that my memories of the 2013 Congress are tinted in gold. With more than 1400 delegates, Congress was a superb celebration of 50 years of the College and a wonderful introduction to the next 50 years. Attendance at events and sessions was high, which is a great demonstration of the engagement and commitment of our members and is a credit to the scientific program. Some new initiatives were especially well received: the medical student program which supported more than 20 junior doctors and medical students to attend, and the Asia-Pacific Mental Health Forum at which 15 experts from South East Asia and the Pacific discussed regional partnerships.</p>
<p>For me a special highlight was the launch of the <italic>Supporting carers in the mental health system</italic> position statement. With more than 120 consumers and carers in attendance it was another significant milestone in the life of the College as we celebrated the important contribution of our community committee, and recognised the contribution carers of all sorts make to mental illness treatment and recovery, as well as the need for us to attend to the needs of carers. Kali Paxinos, a member of the Community Collaboration Committee since 2010, spoke movingly about her role as carer and her relationships with psychiatrists over many years, while mental health advocate Craig Hamilton spoke about his experience of becoming unwell with bi-polar disorder. A common theme, of which psychiatrists are regularly reminded, was how unexpected mental illness is and the profound impact this has on people close to those affected.</p>
<p>Other highlights included the Gala Dinner, which was attended by nearly 400 people, the College Ceremony where 156 new Fellows joined our ranks and the opening and closing ceremonies. Personally I also valued the cultural elements present in these events. Recognising and respecting our indigenous cultures and incorporating these elements into our practices within the College are essential components of our responsibilities as an organisation interested in furthering the mental health and well-being of the communities of which we are a part.</p>
<p>Immediately after Congress we also convened the first meeting of the College’s elected Board of Directors. This was a historic event for the College and the culmination of years of work by Fellows. Initially the Board will focus on supporting the governance structures which oversee College operations: the framework for the Members’ Advisory Council (MAC) is in development while the membership of the constituent committees of the Board is close to being finalised. A thorough review of the Board election process is also about to commence. Later this year we plan to begin reviewing the strategic plan for 2015–2017.</p>
<p>While the Board will have a full plate of work in coming months we are keen to hear from members about their thoughts and priorities. Each Director has been assigned a portfolio and will be attending Committee meetings, and we intend for the Board to meet in multiple locations across Australia and New Zealand.
