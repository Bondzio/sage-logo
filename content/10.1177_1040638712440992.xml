<abstract>
<p>Canine <italic>Influenza A virus</italic> subtype H3N8 (H3N8 CIV) was recognized in 2004 as a novel respiratory pathogen for dogs. To date, infections have been diagnosed in thousands of dogs in 38 U.S. states. Diagnostic techniques such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation may yield false-negative results if samples are collected after virus shedding has ceased. Therefore, serology is often necessary to confirm diagnosis. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is the test of choice for serological diagnosis of influenza infections in animals. However, discrepancies exist between diagnostic laboratories and research groups in some of the test parameters for the H3N8 CIV HI assay and the cutoff antibody titer for seropositivity. The objectives of the current study were 1) to assess the diagnostic performance of a H3N8 CIV HI assay using field sera from canine infectious respiratory disease outbreaks and 2) to evaluate the effect of test parameter variations on test performance, including the use of different red blood cell (RBC) species, serum treatment methods, and virus isolates. Based on a receiver operating characteristic analysis using serum microneutralization assay titers as the gold standard, the H3N8 CIV HI assay described in the present study is highly sensitive (99.6%) and specific (94.6%) when the cutoff antibody titer for seropositivity is 32. Evaluation of parameter variations determined that the sensitivity and specificity of the H3N8 CIV HI assay depend on serum pretreatment with a receptor-destroying enzyme or periodate, use of 0.5% turkey or chicken RBCs, and use of antigenically well-matched H3N8 virus strains.</p>

A variety of factors can influence the sensitivity and specificity of the HI assay, including the matching of the sialic acid (SA) receptor type on the RBC surface to that preferred by the viral hemagglutinin protein, the presence of nonspecific hemagglutinins and/or nonspecific inhibitors of hemagglutination in serum, and the binding specificity of serum antibodies for the particular hemagglutinin subtype of the test virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1040638712440992">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1040638712440992">33</xref></sup> Although test conditions may require modification for the detection of novel viruses or viruses that have undergone antigenic drift due to point mutations in the hemagglutinin protein,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638712440992">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1040638712440992">28</xref></sup> standard HI conditions have been generally established for endemic influenza viruses in avian species, pigs, horses, and human beings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1040638712440992">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1040638712440992">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the first reports on H3N8 CIV infection of dogs, an HI assay was utilized for documentation of viral infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712440992">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440992">22</xref></sup> The HI antibody titer cutoff for seropositivity was set based on testing sera from uninfected specific pathogen–free (SPF) dogs and SPF dogs experimentally inoculated with an H3N8 CIV isolate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712440992">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440992">22</xref></sup> As H3N8 CIV has continued to spread through the U.S. canine population, reference and research laboratories have used different versions of the originally reported HI assay for diagnosis or disease surveillance, resulting in discrepancies between laboratories in the HI cutoff antibody titer selected for seropositivity as well as the test parameters used. Unless the diagnostic performance of the different HI assays has been defined, such discrepancies can lead to misdiagnosis of dogs, interlaboratory variability, and unreliable disease surveillance data. Therefore, the first objective of the current study was to assess the diagnostic performance of the HI assay described in the initial reports for H3N8 CIV infections in dogs using a panel of field sera collected during canine infectious respiratory disease outbreaks. The second objective was to evaluate the effect of test parameter variations on the diagnostic performance of the H3N8 CIV HI assay, including the use of different RBC species, canine serum pretreatment methods, and different virus isolates.</p>

<p>—Prior to evaluating the effect of using different RBC species in the HI assay, the RBC binding preferences of the CN/FL/04 isolate were assessed in HA assays. Serial 2-fold dilutions of MDCK supernatant containing infectious H3N8 CN/FL/04 were incubated with an equal volume (50 µl) of 0.5% chicken, 0.5% turkey, 0.5% goose, 1% horse, 1% dog, 1% sheep, and 1% cow RBCs prepared in PBS or PBS containing 0.5% BSA (PBS/BSA). Incubations were performed in V-bottom microtiter plates for 30 min or 1 hr at 23°C and 4°C. The HAU, defined as the reciprocal of the last virus dilution that completely agglutinated RBCs, were compared for the different RBC species and incubation conditions. The RBC binding preferences were evaluated based on the HAU and known SA receptors for each RBC species. The RBC species with the highest HAU for H3N8 CN/FL/04 were selected for use in subsequent HI assays.</p>

All samples were tested in duplicate for the determination of end-point antibody titers. For each serum sample, antibody titers generated by HI assays with different parameters were compared to the antibody titers determined by the HI assay performed as described above in the section on diagnostic performance assessment. Because titer differences of 1 dilution (i.e., 2-fold) are recognized as an acceptable margin of error, HI titers that differed by 2 or more dilutions (i.e., 4-fold or more) were considered indicative of altered sensitivity or specificity.</p>

The titers for periodate-treated sera were 2-fold lower than RDE-treated samples from the infected dogs, but there were no false-negative results.</p>

<p>Serial dilutions of the untreated or RDE-treated sera were incubated with H3N8 CN/FL/04 isolate prior to the addition of 0.5% turkey or chicken red blood cell (RBC) suspensions. All serum samples were tested in duplicate. H3N8 CIV infection status was verified in both the HI and serum microneutralization assays. HI antibody titer = reciprocal of the last serum dilution that inhibited RBC agglutination by H3N8 CIV. The cutoff titer for seropositivity in the H3N8 CIV HI assay is 32.

<title>Use of different virus isolates in the H3N8 CIV HI assay</title>
<p>—Sera from 14 H3N8 CIV-infected and 14 uninfected dogs were tested in the HI assay with infectious H3N8 CN/FL/04 or virus inactivated with BEI. The HI antibody titers were equivalent or 2-fold lower when inactivated CIV was used (data not shown). The lower titers with the inactivated virus resulted in false-negative results for 3 of 4 samples from infected dogs that had HI titers near the cutoff for seropositivity.</p>
<p>To evaluate consistency in antibody titers when different H3N8 CIV isolates were used in the HI assay, sera from 46 dogs infected with H3N8 CIV between 2004 and 2005 were tested using 5 H3N8 CIV isolates (CN/Jax/05, CN/CO/06, CN/CO/07, CN/CO/09, CN/PA/09) acquired from dogs in different geographic regions from 2005 to 2009 (data not shown). The HI antibody titers for these samples ranged from 32 to 1,024 when tested with the CN/FL/04 isolate. The HI titers with the 5 other isolates were equivalent to or 2-fold lower than the titers with the CN/FL/04 isolate, but there were no false-negative results.</p>
<p>To determine whether H3N8 EIV isolates could be substituted for canine isolates in the HI assay, sera from 46 infected dogs were tested with 4 H3N8 EIV isolates (EQ/KY/91, EQ/KY/95, EQ/NY/99, EQ/OH/03) acquired from horses in different geographic regions from 1991 to 2003 (data not shown). The HI antibody titers to EQ/OH/03 were equivalent to or within 1 dilution of those obtained with the CN/FL/04 isolate, but no dogs were false negative. The HI titers to EQ/NY/99 were 2- to 4-fold lower than those with the CN/FL/04 isolate, resulting in misclassification of 4 infected dogs (8.7%) as uninfected. The HI titers to EQ/KY/95 and EQ/KY/91 were 4- to 8-fold lower than those for the CN/FL/04 isolate, and 8 infected dogs (17.4%) were misclassified as uninfected.</p>

<title>Interlaboratory H3N8 CIV HI assay comparison</title>
<p>—A panel of 32 canine sera tested at UF was also evaluated in a blinded fashion by H3N8 CIV HI assays at CU AHDC and CSU (data not shown). The laboratories differed in the use of chicken or turkey RBCs, serum treatment with periodate or RDE, and the source of H3N8 CIV. Of these samples, 20 were identified as seronegative and 9 were identified as seropositive at all 3 laboratories. The HI titers were equivalent or within 1 dilution for all but 1 of the 9 seropositive samples; however, the titer difference did not result in misclassification. For 3 samples, the HI titers were 16 or 32 depending on the laboratory, suggesting that samples with titers near the seropositivity cutoff may be classified as negative or positive by different laboratories.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a panel of field sera collected during canine respiratory disease outbreaks, the present study demonstrated a high correlation between H3N8 CIV antibody titers determined in MN and HI assays performed as described in previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712440992">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440992">22</xref></sup> The ROC analysis results determined that the H3N8 CIV HI assay is highly sensitive and specific when the cutoff antibody titer for seropositivity is 32. The precision of the HI assay was demonstrated by %CVs &lt;5% for intra-assay and interassay replications. Based on the evaluation of test parameter variations, the optimal sensitivity and specificity of the HI assay depended on 1) treatment of serum samples with RDE or periodate, 2) use of 0.5% turkey or chicken RBCs, and 3) use of infectious H3N8 CIV isolates or contemporary H3N8 EIV isolates that are closely related to CIV.</p>
<p>The HI assay is considered the WHO/World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) test of choice for serological diagnosis of influenza A infection in animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1040638712440992">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1040638712440992">33</xref></sup> The seropositivity cutoff titer of 32 for the H3N8 CIV HI assay described in the current study provides the highest sensitivity (99.6%) and specificity (94.6%). Lower cutoff values increased the number of false-positive findings and decreased specificity. Sensitivity and specificity are fixed characteristics of diagnostic tests, whereas the predictive values of a positive or negative test result are affected by the prevalence of the tested parameter. However, a benefit of ROC analysis is that it allows an estimate of diagnostic accuracy that is independent of prevalence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638712440992">11</xref></sup> Therefore, in locations where H3N8 CIV is known to circulate, the HI assay described in the present study is a reliable and sensitive diagnostic test as long as the test antigen is representative of contemporary circulating viruses and sera are collected at proper time points. When a single serum sample is tested, seronegative results may be true negative due to lack of infection or false negative if the sample was collected prior to the appearance of antibodies. Seropositive results are most likely true positive, indicating infection at some time in the past. For large-scale serological surveys to determine H3N8 CIV seroprevalence, especially in populations where virus circulation is unknown, the HI assay is recommended as a sensitive and specific confirmatory test of high-throughput screening assays such as competitive nucleoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638712440992">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638712440992">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Use of RBC species other than the turkey or chicken in the H3N8 CIV HI assay decreased sensitivity. Turkey and chicken RBCs provided comparable results for most samples tested, but nearly one third of the samples had a 2-fold lower titer with chicken RBCs. While this is within the acceptable margin of error (i.e., 1 serum dilution), samples with antibody titers near the seropositivity cutoff may test false negative with chicken RBCs. In this situation, it may be prudent to test another sample collected 2 weeks later before declaring the infection status.</p>
<p>A variety of nonspecific hemagglutinins and inhibitors of HA have been identified in animal and human sera, and limited studies with few samples have shown that canine serum may have low levels of nonspecific hemagglutinins for avian RBCs and nonspecific inhibitors of HA for some influenza viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712440992">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1040638712440992">30</xref></sup> The presence of nonspecific agglutinins to avian RBCs was not specifically addressed in the current study; however, based on the reported comparison testing between the 3 laboratories, HI antibody titers were comparable (i.e., equivalent or within 1 serum dilution) whether or not sera were preadsorbed with turkey RBCs. This suggests that nonspecific agglutinins do not appear to be a significant concern with canine sera. The present study did demonstrate, however, that serum treatment is required to inactivate nonspecific inhibitors of agglutination in canine serum. Nonspecific inhibitors of HA were demonstrated by higher antibody titers in untreated sera from infected dogs compared to titers obtained after RDE or periodate treatment and heat inactivation. Nonspecific inhibitors of HA were particularly evident when untreated sera were tested with chicken RBCs rather than turkey RBCs: chicken RBCs resulted in false-positive reactions for nearly all of the truly uninfected dogs tested. Therefore, to maintain high specificity, canine sera should be treated with RDE or periodate and heat inactivation prior to testing in the H3N8 CIV HI assay.</p>
<p>Although use of inactivated H3N8 CIV in the HI assay would be advantageous to reduce biosafety risks to laboratory personnel and generation of biohazardous waste, BEI-inactivated virus reduced the sensitivity of the HI assay when testing sera from infected dogs with antibody titers near the cutoff for seropositivity. In addition, RBC streaming was at times more difficult to interpret than with infectious viruses. Binary ethylenimine treatment is supposed to preserve viral proteins; however, it is not known if this alkylating treatment induces hemagglutinin protein folding or cross-linking that could reduce exposure to antigenic epitopes. Further analysis of viral inactivation methods, such as use of β-propiolactone, is warranted before inactivated H3N8 CIV could be reliably substituted for an infectious virus in the HI assay.</p>
<p>The use of multiple H3N8 CIV isolates recovered from dogs in 2005 to 2009 did not alter the sensitivity and specificity of the HI assay. Molecular and serological analyses indicate that significant antigenic change has not occurred in H3N8 CIV isolates to date.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712440992">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440992">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1040638712440992">24</xref></sup> If antigenic drift does occur in the future, then use of earlier isolates in HI testing of sera from dogs exposed to drifted viruses will compromise the sensitivity of the assay, leading to misdiagnosis of truly infected dogs. This underscores the value of continual molecular monitoring of new isolates to maintain diagnostic test accuracy.</p>
<p>Many diagnostic laboratories have H3N8 EIV isolates in storage for serological diagnosis of influenza-infected horses, and some have attempted to use these isolates for diagnosis of H3N8 CIV infection. Phylogenetic analyses of H3N8 CIV and EIV isolates have shown that the canine viruses are most closely related to contemporary H3N8 EIV isolates of the Florida sublineage (clade 1) recovered from horses since 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712440992">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638712440992">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440992">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1040638712440992">24</xref></sup> This genetic relatedness likely explains why use of a 2003 clade 1 Florida sublineage EIV isolate (EQ/OH/03) in the CIV HI assay did not affect sensitivity and specificity, but use of earlier American lineage H3N8 EIV isolates resulted in decreased sensitivity and misdiagnosis of truly infected dogs. While avian, swine, and human H3 isolates were not evaluated in the present study, it is assumed that their use in the HI assay would not identify dogs infected with H3N8 CIV based on the genetic disparity between the H3 proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712440992">4</xref></sup> A previous report demonstrated that HI antibody titers for dogs truly infected with H3N8 CIV were &lt;16 when tested with human H3N2 viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712440992">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The binding preferences of H3N8 CIV were assessed in HA assays with a variety of avian and mammalian RBCs. This is important not only to selection of the best RBCs for use in the HI assay to maintain diagnostic accuracy, but the agglutination patterns for RBCs from different species can also provide insight into viral specificities for SA receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638712440992">16</xref></sup> The current study demonstrated that H3N8 CIV preferred avian and canine RBCs, which primarily have SAα2,3-Gal and SAα2,6-Gal receptors with <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) as the SA species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638712440992">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638712440992">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638712440992">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1040638712440992">35</xref></sup> The greater agglutination of chicken or turkey RBCs compared to canine RBCs may be due to a relative altered density of these SA receptors on canine RBCs. There was less viral agglutination of horse and ruminant RBCs, which primarily express SAα2,3-Gal receptors with <italic>N</italic>-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) as the SA species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638712440992">16</xref></sup> H3N8 EIV binds both Neu5Acα2,3-Gal and Neu5Gcα2,3-Gal receptors, but Neu5Gcα2,3-Gal receptors are required for viral entry and subsequent replication in the equine epithelial cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1040638712440992">29</xref></sup> The RBC agglutination patterns of H3N8 CIV suggest that the canine H3 protein prefers Neu5Acα2,3-Gal receptors over Neu5Gcα2,3-Gal receptors. This supports the findings of a 2010 report showing reduced binding of H3N8 CIV to Neu5Gcα2,3-Gal receptor analogs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1040638712440992">34</xref></sup> Although more sophisticated methods such as glycan microarrays have been developed for assessing viral SA receptor preferences, results from the current study also suggest that the altered SA preference of CIV compared to EIV may be an important adaptation of the horse virus to the dog. This adaptation may be associated with the predictable amino acid substitutions near the H3 receptor-binding pocket that have become the molecular signature for H3N8 CIV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712440992">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712440992">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1040638712440992">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the HI assay described in the present study is a highly sensitive and specific assay for serological diagnosis of H3N8 CIV infection in dogs. Misdiagnosis of H3N8 CIV-infected dogs will be minimized by using 0.5% turkey or chicken RBCs, serum treated with RDE or periodate and heat inactivation, infectious H3N8 CIV isolates, and a seropositivity cutoff titer of 32. The precision of the HI assay was demonstrated by %CVs &lt;5% for intra-assay and interassay replications. The best diagnostic approach for a recent active infection is to perform the HI assay on paired serum samples, with the first sample collected during the first week of illness or known exposure followed by another sample 2 to 4 weeks later, to document seroconversion as defined by at least a 4-fold increase in titer over time. Moving forward, it will be important to continue monitoring for antigenic drift in the CIV H3 protein to ensure that the H3N8 CIV isolate used in the HI assay is closely related to that in circulation. In addition, accurate knowledge of vaccination history is now imperative to accurately interpret H3N8 CIV HI test results because the assay cannot differentiate antibodies induced by an infection from vaccination with the inactivated whole H3N8 CIV vaccine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712440992">7</xref></sup> This limits the use of the HI assay in future epidemiological studies of H3N8 CIV prevalence in the United States if vaccination status is unknown.</p>
