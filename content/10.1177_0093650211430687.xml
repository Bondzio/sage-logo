<abstract>
<p>The social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) predicts individuals in depersonalized settings associate with those with whom they share a salient social identity and disassociate from others. We challenge the strict ingroup/outgroup bifurcation used in prior research and posit that ingroup perceptions differ across distinct (i.e., moderate and extreme) outgroups. A 2 (high cues vs. low cues) × 3 (ingroup, moderate outgroup, extreme outgroup affiliation) experiment utilized 128 subjects to examine how members of an ingroup view individuals belonging to various outgroups. Findings expand SIDE research by addressing the interaction between the valence of social cues to a social group and the strength of those cues. The interaction demonstrates that ingroup members with stronger social cues are more socially identifiable than ingroup members who provided few cues to their ingroup membership, while extreme outgroup members who minimize cues to their identity are more socially identifiable to ingroup members than outgroup members who provide numerous cues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Communication scholars have long been interested in how groups—and individual group members—interact. Diverse research has focused on how geography and physical proximity enable individuals to associate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211430687">Allport, 1937</xref>), the process of attitudinal and behavioral influence among members of a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211430687">Frank &amp; Yasumoto, 1998</xref>), and the amelioration of conflict among oppositional social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211430687">Amichai-Hamburger, &amp; McKenna, 2006</xref>). However, fundamental to these studies has been the conceptualization of groups and how their definitions (both self-concepts and articulation of other groups) affect intragroup and intergroup communication. Recent studies regarding intergroup perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211430687">Tanis &amp; Postmes, 2003</xref>) and interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093650211430687">Walther, 2009</xref>) call for a reexamination of our understanding of how individuals identify and perceive members of other social groups.</p>
<p>The present article explores the nuances of ingroup members’ perceptions of outgroup members to, in part, help retrospectively account for some inconsistencies manifest in earlier research. In contrast to previous research, which has conceptualized members of all outgroups as homogeneous (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211430687">Douglas &amp; McGarty, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211430687">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211430687">Tanis &amp; Postmes, 2003</xref>), we suggest an individual’s perception of outgroup members is a function of both the perceived dissimilarity from the ingroup (i.e., how different the outgroup is perceived to be from the ingroup) and the strength of the affiliation with said group (i.e., number of cues used to signal group identity). By considering group membership as gradations of these properties, rather than as a bifurcated classification, we redress erred assumptions in research using the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) model and address the nature of outgroup membership both as a theoretical and empirically testable construct.</p>
<sec id="section2-0093650211430687">
<title>Defining and Theorizing Outgroups</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211430687">McLeod and DiDario (2007)</xref> defined the ingroup as “the group of people that individuals perceive themselves to be a part of” (p. 3). Contrarily, outgroup members are those not in the ingroup—those who have some contextually relevant difference to the ingroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211430687">Douglas &amp; McGarty, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211430687">Rubin &amp; Badea, 2007</xref>). Conceptually, these definitions bifurcate identification with group members: Others are either ingroup members or, by nature of not being ingroup members, part of the outgroup. Moreover, by classifying all who are contextually different from the ingroup as part of the outgroup, the definitions guiding previous outgroup research cluster all noningroups into a single category of “an outgroup.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211430687">Rubin and Badea (2007)</xref> suggested that individuals use stereotypes to distinguish between ingroup and outgroup members, though they primarily use ingroup stereotyping to define group affiliations. In their research, subjects first defined the ingroup, and then defined the outgroup in relation to the ingroup. Definitions of the ingroup can be established through relatively banal means, such as wearing different colored shirts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211430687">Patterson &amp; Bigler, 2007</xref>), so that those in similarly colored shirts are a part of the ingroup and those wearing shirts of any other color are part of the outgroup. For individuals focusing on identifying ingroup members with similar social identities, simply knowing who is not like them is enough to establish and guide interactions with outgroup members.</p>
<p>How ingroups and outgroups—and their individual members—interact has been researched from several perspectives, with each conceptualizing the conditions and effects of intergroup dynamics differently. For example, subjective group dynamics (SGD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211430687">Abrams, Marques, Bown, &amp; Henson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093650211430687">Marques, Abrams, Paez, &amp; Martinez-Taboada, 1998</xref>) explores how interactions between members of different groups result in the establishment and vulcanization of group norms related to the norms of other groups. Alternatively, social information processing (SIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211430687">Walther, 1992</xref>) theory considers how individuals use social identities to facilitate dyadic, interpersonal relationships. Although these (and other) theories are helpful in addressing how groups and their members perceive one another, most require some degree of interactivity between participants to facilitate norm development or form impressions. To help frame and operationalize our discussion of ingroups and outgroups, we turn to SIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211430687">Reicher, Spears, &amp; Postmes, 1995</xref>), which affords a useful framework to explore the nature of social identification in the absence of interaction between group members. SIDE has been rigorously applied to exploring intergroup dynamics to ascertain how people form impressions of others based on group membership and social identification, and the theory affords a rich literature from which to draw.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0093650211430687">
<title>SIDE</title>
<p>SIDE emerged as a theoretical framework to help explain how individuals relate to others in deindividuated settings—a common state for online communication at the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211430687">Postmes, Spears, &amp; Lea, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211430687">Spears &amp; Lea, 1994</xref>). At its core, SIDE posits that <italic>deindividuated</italic> individuals are unaware of themselves as individuals and of personal consequences to actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211430687">Deiner, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211430687">Zimbardo, 1969</xref>), instead relying on social cues to guide affiliative pattern interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211430687">Reicher et al., 1995</xref>). Recent research has shifted the emphasis from deindividuation to the role of <italic>depersonalization</italic> in governing group affiliation and SIDE effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211430687">Wang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211430687">Wang, Walther, &amp; Hancock, 2009</xref>). Whereas deindividuation focused on the increased role of social identity, depersonalization focuses on the reduced role of the individual identity—the extent to which others can identify a person as an unique individual. Findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211430687">Douglas and McGarty (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211430687">2002)</xref> suggest SIDE’s two requisite antecedents are a depersonalized condition and a salient group identity, refocusing SIDE’s predictions toward situations in which idiosyncrasies may be attributed to an individual but are disregarded as irrelevant or unnecessary to guide the interaction. For example, in a chat forum discussing the implications of a recent G8 Summit, one’s country of origin—a social identity—may be used to guide the interaction; however, personal characteristics such as one’s favorite music genre would likely to have little effect on the interaction.</p>
<p>Although SIDE has guided significant research over the past three decades, some research has failed to demonstrate the predicted SIDE outcomes (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211430687">Hancock &amp; Merola, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211430687">Walther &amp; Carr, 2010</xref>). One potential cause of inconsistent results has been scholars’ strict bifurcation between ingroup and outgroup memberships when applying SIDE, assigning subjects into mutually exclusive social categories without concern for gradation in social identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211430687">Carr, 2010</xref>). As social categorization plays an integral role in SIDE processes, explicating the relationship between ingroups and outgroups represents a means by which inconsistencies in findings may be resolved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0093650211430687">
<title>Social Categorization in SIDE</title>
<p>Most SIDE research has conceptualized the separation of group affiliation as arbitrary and absolute. In early experiments on salient social identities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211430687">Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, and Flament (1971)</xref> found that when self-categorizing, individuals perceive two fundamental types of social identities: ingroup members and outgroup members. In their experiment, participants distributed a reward to other individuals, based on irrelevant classifications, maximizing the reward to their own group but demonstrating no preference or discrimination among members of the various other groups.</p>
<p>In a direct test of SIDE, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211430687">Tanis and Postmes (2003)</xref> conducted a series of studies using university students who were shown profiles of potential interactants. Potential interactants were members of either the ingroup or outgroup, operationalized as affiliation with the same or a different university than the study participant, respectively. Results were mostly consistent with the SIDE model. However, the researchers’ hypothesis that individuals should perceive members of the outgroup (Free University) more negatively than members of the ingroup (University of Amsterdam) was unsupported. In discussing this surprising finding, the authors admitted that the relationship between the two universities chosen for the study’s ingroup and outgroup may have confounded these findings, as many students dual-enrolled at both institutions and participants may not have perceived a unique ingroup and outgroup.</p>
<p>The notion that ingroups and outgroups are inherently oppositional has been further examined in studies exploring ingroup members’ interactions with outgroup members. Through content analysis of ingroup and outgroup communication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211430687">Postmes, Spears, and Lea (2000)</xref> found that ingroup norms did not govern outgroup interactions. Were ingroups and outgroups oppositional, ingroup norms should lead ingroup members to seek distance from members of the outgroup, likely precluding interaction save for antagonistic purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211430687">Dixon, Durrheim, &amp; Tredoux, 2005</xref>). However, the ingroup/outgroup boundary seems permeable and identification with outgroup members may more closely resemble a gradation of identification than a strict divide—a significant departure from research having drawn on SIDE.</p>
<p>The relative malleability (and therefore strength) of “ingroup” and “outgroup” distinctions has been suggested empirically. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211430687">Sherif, Harvey, White, Hood, and Sherif (1961)</xref> manipulated the random assignment of summer campers to two arbitrary groups, first experimentally creating intergroup discord and later bringing groups together for mutually beneficial tasks. By the end of camp, intergroup conflict had been reduced, and qualitative reports suggested that groups had been subsumed into a superordinate group. However, in a critical test of these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211430687">Tyerman and Spencer (1983)</xref> found that when groups were formed from individuals who had previously interacted (i.e., a Boy Scout troop), intergroup solidarity did not increase as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211430687">Sherif et al.’s (1961)</xref> zero-history groups experiment. Consequently, discord exists within the literature with regard to the malleability of social identification, suggesting that one’s social identity may also be impacted by personalized interactions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211430687">Bigler, Jones, and Lobliner (1997)</xref> further illustrated the malleability of groups, demonstrating that students randomly assigned to wear either blue or yellow T-shirts began to favor socializing with students wearing like-colored shirts, even when the groups were not made explicit to the students. However, the authors also noted that socializing was not exclusive to like-shirted children and that in some instances students interacted with those clad in unlike colors. These findings, taken into account with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211430687">Tyerman and Spencer’s (1983)</xref> research, indicate that outgroups may not be simple bifurcations, but rather that identification of outgroup members may be multifaceted to take into account other idiosyncratic or social characteristics of interactants.</p>
<p>The gradation of group affiliation may not necessarily be incommensurate with previous SIDE research. Recalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211430687">Douglas and McGarty’s (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211430687">2002)</xref> findings, not only may the nature of the outgroup affect social identification, the salience of a group to an individual also governs adherence to group norms, thereby enabling SIDE-based effects. It therefore seems logical that a more accurate way to test SIDE predictions regarding outgroups is not as strictly bifurcated from ingroups, but rather as an interaction between cues addressing the target individual’s dissimilarity from the ingroup and strength of cues to outgroup affiliation in relation to the ingroup and its members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0093650211430687">
<title>Perceived Dissimilarity from the Ingroup</title>
<p>An individual’s social identity may affect social identification and perceptions of both ingroup and outgroup members. Consequently, we initially address the potential effects of an individual’s perceived dissimilarity from the ingroup (i.e., how different the target’s cued social identity is from the individual’s own social identity). Departing from SIDE research’s traditional conceptualization of group membership as dichotomous, we suggest that not all outgroups are the same, such that ingroup members may perceive varying degrees of dissimilarity, and therefore affiliation with outgroups, reflecting varying degrees of dissimilarity from the ingroup. In other words, a particular social identity may influence social interactions and perceptions of others based on the relationship between social groups, so that ingroup members perceive differing degrees of identification across multiple outgroups.</p>
<p>Many SIDE studies have tested how intergroup differences are addressed and explored as a result of social identification and depersonalization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211430687">Postmes, Spears, and Lea (2002)</xref> looked at how international students interact online in either identified (individuated) or unidentified (deindividuated) conditions, finding that deindividuated conditions lead to more polarization between groups based on national and cultural differences. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211430687">Postmes and Spears (2002)</xref> found significant gender differences between participation and domination of conversations depending on the stereotype being activated by a discussion topic; males contribute more frequently to stereotypically masculine topics than females, and vice versa. These studies illustrate one of SIDE researchers’ underlying assumptions about affiliations across different social identities—the polarization of ingroups and outgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211430687">Wallace, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211430687">Rubin and Badea (2007)</xref> suggested that individuals use stereotypes to distinguish between ingroup and outgroup members, though they primarily use ingroup stereotyping to define group affiliations. In their research, subjects first defined the ingroup, and then defined the outgroup in relation to the ingroup. Therefore, if individuals are focusing on identifying ingroup members with similar social identities, simply knowing who is not like them is enough to establish and guide interactions with outgroup members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093650211430687">Sassenberg (2002)</xref> further relied on this strict ingroup/outgroup delineation, noting that common identity is used as a polarizing mechanism so that shared traits equate shared identity. This polarization of salient group bonds results in the separation of ingroup and outgroup members, without additional thought toward the identity or personality of outgroup members. Based on this research in social identity, SIDE research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650211430687">Bigler, Brown, &amp; Markell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211430687">Bigler et al., 1997</xref>) often conceptualizes social identity as summarily leading to disaffiliation with the outgroup and its members, without further consideration for the idiosyncrasies of each outgroup member or the nature of the outgroup itself. These traditional considerations of the manner in which individuals form impressions can be formally hypothesized so that:</p>
<list id="list1-0093650211430687" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (H1)</italic>: The dissimilarity of a target individual’s group affiliation from the ingroup is negatively related to the perceiver’s social identification with the target individual.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Specifically, SIDE would predict that ingroup members perceive themselves most like other ingroup members, and would therefore report higher social identification with others who share the ingroup identity:</p>
<list id="list2-0093650211430687" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1a (H1a)</italic>: Ingroup members experience greater social identification with other members of the ingroup than with outgroup members.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>H1a reflects the traditional conceptualization of outgroups in SIDE research and its predictions of interactions in depersonalized settings. However, given research addressing the malleability of group affiliation, it seems prudent to extend earlier conceptualizations of SIDE to account for the effect of the distance of an outgroup from the ingroup on the degree of social identification perceived by an individual.</p>
<p>If individuals in depersonalized interactions form perceptions based not just on outgroup membership but also on differences in the nature of the outgroups with which individuals are affiliated, only testing ingroup versus outgroup relationships may disguise nuances within the nature of outgroups. As exemplified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211430687">Sherif et al. (1961)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211430687">Bigler et al.’s (1997)</xref> findings, if these ingroup/outgroup distinctions are malleable yet noticeable, it could logically be expected that individuals affiliate differently with members of different outgroups. Such an expectation could be empirically tested by a more nuanced analysis of affiliation toward different outgroup members. More formally:</p>
<list id="list3-0093650211430687" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1b (H1b)</italic>: An ingroup member’s social identification with an outgroup target will vary such that the dissimilarity from the ingroup is negatively correlated with the ingroup member’s social identification with the target.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0093650211430687">
<title>Moderation of the Effect of Group Distance by Strength of Group Cues</title>
<p>The strength of a target individual’s displayed social identity may influence the magnitude of identification with and affiliation toward the individual. Particularly online, individuals can indicate group affiliation through multiple cues: User profiles, handles, images, and other cues in varying magnitudes. Beyond understanding the main effect of the dissimilarity of group affiliation on social identification, it is important to consider the moderating effect of the strength of cues to group affiliation on that relationship (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0093650211430687">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0093650211430687-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The effect of the strength of cues to group affiliation on social identification has received empirical support in face-to-face environments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211430687">Mlicki and Ellemers (1996)</xref> found that Polish and Dutch subjects in different conditions highlighted their nationality rather than their “European” common identity, particularly when the stereotypes of the national identity were intensified by being perceived as positive or desirable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211430687">Mummendey, Otten, Berger, and Kessler (2000)</xref> provided further evidence in situations where the valence (positive-negative) and/or strength (high-low) of stimuli were manipulated and effects on social categorizations were measured. Their results supported previous category-based findings, as participants tended to report increased association with positive, high salience stimuli and also tended to distance themselves from negative, low-salience stimuli.</p>
<p>Recalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211430687">Tanis and Postmes’ (2003)</xref> minimal support and small effects size for SIDE-based hypotheses of social cues and interactions between Free University and University of Amsterdam students, an alternate explanation emerges. The researchers posited that the weak support they found for their hypotheses may have emerged because many University of Amsterdam students were dual-enrolled at Free University, consequently blurring the social identification between the two groups. Conceptualizing ingroup/outgroup membership to take into account that participants were unable to perceive relatively weak cues to an outgroup identity (operationalized by a single profile graphic of the school’s logo) could provide greater explanatory power for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211430687">Tanis and Postmes’ (2003)</xref> findings. A lack of strong cues to clearly identify a subject’s group affiliation may have ameliorated social identification effects; had subjects been more aware of their interactants’ social groups, larger effects and statistical support for hypotheses may have been obtained.</p>
<p>The sheer quantity of cues to a group identity may enhance the effect of group affiliation on social identification, as has been demonstrated in several studies of sports fandom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211430687">Dionísio, Leal, &amp; Moutinho, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211430687">Fiske, 1992</xref>). For example, imagine attending a sporting event wearing a hat in support of the home team. Other fans may perceive you as a team supporter (i.e., part of the ingroup), but not a strong fan. Alternately, imagine you attended the same sporting event with numerous cues to your fandom: a hat, a jersey, matching socks and shoelaces, a foam finger, and your mobile phone’s ringtone all supporting the home team. In this second case, other fans would still perceive you as a team supporter, but now perceive you as a ‘real fan,’ resulting in stronger social identification.</p>
<p>A similar process would predict different outcomes with regard to outgroup members. While at this sporting event, you see an individual bedecked in the opposing team’s apparel. With numerous cues to that individual’s identification with the outgroup, social identification would be weakest, as that individual is clearly unlike your salient social group. However, you may somewhat identify (or alternately disaffiliate to a lesser degree) with another fan only sporting a scarf bearing the opponent’s logo, as the reduced amount of cues to that social identity may signal a weaker connection with that social group. While illustrative of the hypothesized effect in fandom, these hypothetical situations do not address the theoretically driven causes of varying levels of social identification.</p>
<p>A potential explanation for the effect of the strength of group affiliation on social identification was offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211430687">Kelley (1955)</xref>, who proffered that the more salient a target’s outgroup identity is when presented to an ingroup member, the more that outgroup member is perceived as a threat to the individual’s ingroup affiliation, and the more vehemently the individual identifies as an ingroup member in order to compensate for the potential threat to social identity. In this causal chain, Kelley suggests that the strength of a group identity (and particularly an outgroup identity) should affect the social identification with the target. In keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211430687">Wilder and Shapiro’s (1984)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211430687">Kelley’s (1955)</xref> suppositions that the strength of group affiliations interact with the dissimilarity of group affiliation to magnify social identification with target individuals, we offer the following hypotheses:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 128<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093650211430687">1</xref></sup>) were drawn from undergraduate courses in the telecommunication department of Michigan State University in November 2008. Participants (40 women) ranged in age from 16<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0093650211430687">2</xref></sup> to 30 (<italic>M</italic> = 19.84, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.15), were of diverse academic standings (49 freshmen, 34 sophomores, 22 juniors, and 23 seniors), and 60% reported living in on-campus residence halls. Developing a sampling frame from a single institution was done so that a single, salient social identity could be used as an effective referent ingroup.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0093650211430687">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were directed to a website that randomly assigned them to one of six experimental conditions using a randomizer script developed and applied in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211430687">Tong, Van Der Heide, Langwell, &amp; Walther, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211430687">Walther, Van Der Heide, Westerman, &amp; Tong, 2008</xref>). All participants were asked a series of questions purportedly to determine how much they represented the “typical Spartan”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0093650211430687">3</xref></sup> student at Michigan State University, which, according to the survey instrument, ‘previous research has shown [that they] were uniquely situated to make insightful and accurate judgments about other individuals’.” In reality, participants’ responses to these initial questions were not tabulated, and all participants were told that they were “typical Spartans” both to prime the strength of the school social identity and to provide participants with additional cues to activate their social identities as Spartans. Using the phrase quoted above, all participants were told that their social group could make accurate assessments in order to prime them to carefully evaluate their target and make assessments on which to base instrument responses. A manipulation check for this social identity priming used a single item immediately following the priming, asking participants how much they felt they represented a “typical Spartan” on a 5-point Likert-type item with 1 indicating <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 5 indicating <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The priming appeared to be effective, as participants reported a mean ingroup identification of 3.46 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.18), which is significantly different from the midpoint (<italic>t</italic> = 4.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), identifying themselves as above-average ingroup members, that is, MSU students.</p>
<p>After completing the priming, participants were instructed that they were taking part in a study about online identity formation and that they would be looking at a Facebook profile and asked to form impressions about the individual presented in the profile. Following these instructions, participants viewed one of six Facebook profiles (<italic>n</italic> ≈ 20), all of which were of the fictitious individual “Chris Mayburn” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0093650211430687">Figure 2</xref> depicts an example of an actual stimulus used for this research). A second manipulation check was employed at the conclusion of the study to ensure that participants had carefully examined the profile and noted the target’s social identity by asking participants to identify the institution with which Chris Mayburn was affiliated. The manipulation of the profile network appeared effective, as 86% of participants identified the correct school affiliation among seven options: the three universities used for the study and four additional institutions. While the profiles included fabricated “personal information” that was common to all six stimulus profiles, all conditions presented a depersonalized target as no photographs of Chris Mayburn were used in any condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211430687">Lea, Spears, &amp; deGroot, 2001</xref>). Instead, an anthropomorphic art mannequin was displayed in the low-cues conditions and the respective university mascot was displayed in the high-cues condition. All information in the profiles (save for the manipulated group cues) was held constant between profiles, and thus any individuating effects would not have varied between conditions.</p>

<p>After viewing the profile, participants completed measures indicating their perceptions of Chris Mayburn, particularly how close they felt to both Chris Mayburn’s individual and social identities. These measures are described more fully in the next section. On completing the survey measures, participants completed demographic items and manipulation checks and were then debriefed about the nature of the experiment and thanked for their time and participation.</p>

<sec id="section10-0093650211430687">
<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>This research sought to understand how the dissimilarity from ingroup and amount of cues to social status affect group identification. To manipulate and cross these independent variables, six experimental stimuli were developed. Experimental stimuli took the form of nonhyperlinked Facebook profiles that were identical across all conditions with the exception of experimental variations.</p>
<p>To manipulate the dissimilarity of social identity from the ingroup of the target individual, we altered Chris Mayburn’s educational affiliation. Educational affiliation reflected an appropriate and effective social identification as participants were college students, and the experimental priming activated social identification via educational institutions. Stimuli artifacts were manipulated to be assigned to either the “Michigan State University” (MSU; ingroup), “Washington State University” (WSU; moderate outgroup), or “University of Michigan” (UM; extreme outgroup) network. These affiliations were pretested by asking individuals from Michigan State University a single item measuring their general attitude toward each of the three institutions (measured using a 7-point Likert-type scale where 1 = <italic>hate it</italic> and 7 = <italic>love it</italic>). Pretest participants (<italic>N</italic> = 34) acknowledged that they liked MSU (<italic>M</italic> = 6.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.10); differed from, but generally apathetic toward, WSU (<italic>M</italic> = 3.59, <italic>SD</italic> = .82); and disliked UM (<italic>M</italic> = 2.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.78). A series of <italic>t</italic> tests indicated that participants liked Michigan State University significantly more than Washington State University, and liked WSU significantly more than University of Michigan. Although the pretest did not directly measure social identification, previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211430687">Wang, 2007</xref>) has indicated affinity and homophily are strongly associated with identification, and as such the pretest was used to determine social identities with which study participants could relate. Based on affiliatory perceptions toward each institution, MSU, WSU, and UM were used to manipulate social identities in each experimental condition in the study.</p>
<p>To manipulate the strength (operationalized as the amount of cues to social identity) of Chris Mayburn’s social group identity, low-cues and high-cues conditions were created by altering the number of cues to social identity displayed in the stimuli. In low-cues conditions, profiles contained references to school affiliation only in the Facebook network affiliation. Profiles in high-cues conditions contained multiple references to school affiliation (profile picture of the school mascot, belonging to “groups” associated with the school, friends’ profile photos changed to reflect institution affiliation, and the presence of applications on the profile referencing the university). By holding other cues constant and providing more cues to social identity, the high-cues conditions reflected more total cues and a higher ratio of cues to Chris Mayburn’s social identity than in low-cue conditions. The ingroup/outgroup and low-/high-cues treatment conditions were then crossed to create stimuli enabling a 3 (group) × 2 (cues) analysis.</p>

<sec id="section11-0093650211430687">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Because of the complexity of individual and social identification inherent in this research, multiple scales were used, increasing both the reliability of the results and the certainty that constructs were being measured validly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211430687">Wang’s (2007)</xref> 14-item Interpersonal Identification scale (α = .89) was utilized to measure attraction to the individual. Sample items included “I would enjoy working with this person” and “This person could be a friend of mine.” A 6-item subset of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211430687">Wang’s (2007)</xref> Group Identification scale (α = .84) was utilized to measure attraction to Chris Mayburn’s group. Items in this measure loaded at .6 levels or greater in its development and included items such as “I would be pleased to be a member of this person’s group” and “I feel loyal toward this person’s group.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211430687">McCroskey and McCain’s (1974)</xref> 6-item Social Attraction scale (α = .70; e.g., “This person would be pleasant to be with” and “I would like to have a friendly chat with this person”) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211430687">McCroskey, McCroskey, and Richmond’s (2006)</xref> 6-item Interpersonal Attraction scale (α = .83; e.g., “This person is sociable with me” and “This person is easy to get along with”) measured the desirability of having a relationship with Chris Mayburn. Participants responded to all survey items using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>); therefore, higher scores represented increased levels of our dependent variable, social identification/attraction.</p>
<p>A parallel reliability analysis between scales indicated high interscale reliability among measures, χ<sup>2</sup>(11) = 2404.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The first set of hypotheses predicted that subjects would affiliate differently with targets based on the target’s social identity. To test H1, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted comparing the group identification respondents reported toward targets of all three social groups. A significant difference was found among the three types of groups, indicating a main effect of group affiliation, <italic>F</italic>(2, 121) = 4.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, η<sup>2</sup> = .07. To assess H1a, which predicted that subjects would report higher identification with ingroup targets than outgroup targets, a contrast test was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211430687">Rosenthal &amp; Rosnow, 1984</xref>) to determine the nature of the differences between ingroup and outgroup targets. This revealed that ingroup targets (<italic>M</italic> = 2.97, <italic>SD</italic> = .71) were perceived as more socially attractive than targets from the combined outgroups (<italic>M</italic> = 2.58, <italic>SD</italic> = .67), <italic>t</italic>(125) = 2.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = .49. Therefore, H1a was supported. H1b, which predicted differences in subjects’ identification with members of various outgroups, was not supported, as there was no significant difference between social attraction for targets in extreme outgroups (<italic>M</italic> = 2.51, <italic>SD</italic> = .72) and for targets in moderate outgroups (<italic>M</italic> = 2.68, <italic>SD</italic> = .61), <italic>t</italic>(125) = 1.15, n.s.</p>
<p>The second set of hypotheses predicted specific interactions between the dissimilarity from ingroup and strength of group cues on subjects’ social identification with a target. A two-factor ANOVA test of the interaction effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211430687">Hayes, 2005</xref>) between social group status (operationalized as an ordinal variable based on ingroup, moderate outgroup, and extreme outgroup conditions) and the number of cues to social affiliation (operationalized as a categorical variable of low or high amount of cues) demonstrated significant results, <italic>F</italic>(5, 122) = 3.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .13. The model revealed a significant moderating influence of the strength of cues to a group affiliation on the effect of the dissimilarity of group affiliation from the ingroup on social identification with a target individual, <italic>F</italic>(2, 122) = 1.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, partial <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0093650211430687">

<p>Given the significant interaction effect between amount of cues and perceived dissimilarity, two additional tests were conducted to determine the validity of specific a priori subhypotheses. First, a one-way ANOVA was used to assess the main effect of cue strength within specific groups. Across targets affiliated with the ingroup, subjects evaluating targets with more cues reported higher levels of social attraction (<italic>M</italic> = 3.19, <italic>SD</italic> = .72) than when evaluating targets with fewer group cues (<italic>M</italic> = 2.73, <italic>SD</italic> = .64), <italic>F</italic>(1, 35) = 4.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, η<sup>2</sup> = .11, two-tailed, supporting H2a. Next, a second ANOVA testing H2b revealed a significant difference for the social attraction between targets in the extreme outgroup based on strength of cues, <italic>F</italic>(1, 52) = 3.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, one-tailed, η<sup>2</sup> = .12. Participants in high-cues condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.37, <italic>SD</italic> = .72) reported less social attraction toward the target than targets in the low-cues extreme outgroup condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.73, <italic>SD</italic> = .68). For the moderate outgroup, there was no significant difference for the social attraction toward members in the high-cues condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.71, <italic>SD</italic> = .61) compared with low-cues (<italic>M</italic> = 2.65, <italic>SD</italic> = .62) condition <italic>F</italic>(1, 35) = 1.05, n.s., one-tailed. Therefore, H2b that high cues will result in lower social attraction for more extreme outgroups was partially supported, with significant differences in the dependent variable for targets in the extreme outgroup (UM) condition but not in the moderate outgroup (WSU) condition.</p>
<p>Controlling for amount of cues to group identity, participants reported higher social attraction with ingroup members than either outgroup memberships. Individuals evaluating an ingroup target in the high-cues condition reported higher levels of social identification with the target than individuals evaluating an ingroup target in a low-cues condition. However, for subjects evaluating an outgroup target, altering cues to outgroup status significantly affected social identification with the target only in the extreme outgroup condition, so that extreme outgroup targets in low-cues conditions resulted in greater social identification than extreme outgroup targets with more cues to social identity. This interaction, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0093650211430687">Figure 3</xref>, indicates that a neutral ground for outgroup status may be possible.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study sought to expand our understanding of group identity by focusing on the nature of outgroups and individuals’ perceptions of outgroup members, particularly as framed by SIDE. The first hypothesis—specifically H1b—sought to establish that not all outgroups (or their members) are perceived identically by illustrating that members of an extreme outgroup are less socially attractive to ingroup members than members of a more moderate outgroup. Although the main effect predicted in H1b was not supported, we should be cautious in interpreting this nonsignificant finding given the significant moderating effect demonstrated in tests of H2.</p>
<p>Significant differences in social identification with the target were found in the expected directions for both the ingroup and extreme outgroup targets. Participants identified with ingroup targets with strong cues to social identity at greater levels than with ingroup targets with weak cues to social identity; conversely, they identified with extreme outgroup targets with weak cues to social identity more than with extreme outgroup targets with strong cues to social identity. Only in the moderate outgroup was there no differences in participants’ social identification with the target based on strength of cues. Consequently, the data support our hypothesized moderating effect of cue strength on the effect of dissimilarity from ingroup on social identification with a target.</p>
<p>Our findings empirically demonstrate the previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211430687">Kelley, 1955</xref>) impact of cues to outgroup and degree of group affiliation on social identification, additionally extending implications to online depersonalized settings. First, when an ingroup target’s membership is highlighted—in this case through the use of the MSU Spartan mascot as the profile picture and numerous additional textual cues—social affiliation is strongest. Conversely, when an extreme outgroup target’s membership is highlighted (through similar cues reflecting UM membership), social affiliation is weakest. These findings are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211430687">Kelley (1955)</xref> and carry high-face validity; just as with the earlier example of a baseball team, a college student is likely to most strongly identify with someone who is clearly similar and express significant disaffiliation with an individual who highly identifies with the university’s biggest rival (in this case, University of Michigan).</p>
<p>Examining the interaction effect more closely, we find that social affiliation is statistically identical for the low-cues ingroup target and low-cues extreme outgroup target. In other words, a stranger who belonged to the MSU network but presented no other cues to that social identity would be perceived similarly to a stranger who belongs to the UM network but does not otherwise highlight that group membership. This finding is in stark contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211430687">Mummendey et al.’s (2000)</xref> finding that individuals distanced themselves from outgroup targets, even when the salience of that outgroup identity was low. It is also important to note that the mean affiliation for these two groups was below the midpoint (2.73), as was the mean for the moderate outgroup (2.65), meaning that participants had a relatively low degree of affiliation with any target that did not strongly signal membership in a specific group.</p>
<p>We found no significant main effect of cue strength on perceptions of the moderate outgroup, WSU. Washington State University was selected as the moderate outgroup because there was little chance for any type of preexisting relationship between participants (MSU students) and a target from WSU—MSU is predominantly comprised of in-state students and WSU is both geographically distant and in a different athletic conference. Contrary to a traditional SIDE interpretation of social affiliation, which would predict that ingroup members would perceive similarly low levels of affiliation with all outgroups, careful analysis of H2b revealed that cue strength had no impact on social identification with the moderate outgroup target and that affiliation was generally low (2.71 for high-cues condition and 2.65 for low-cues condition), but cue strength significantly impacted social identification with the extreme outgroup target (2.37 for high-cues condition and 2.73 for low-cues condition).</p>
<p>From a communicative perspective, the lack of significant differences toward the moderate outgroup highlights an important function of sites like Facebook. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211430687">Ellison, Steinfield, and Lampe (2011)</xref> argue that social network sites (SNSs) serve as a social lubricant by providing users with identity-based information that can facilitate future interactions and convert latent (i.e., technically possible but not yet realized) ties into weak ties. In other words, when individuals view a profile on Facebook, they look for cues that would signal affiliation (e.g., shared interests, background, location). In the case of WSU, neither the low-cues condition nor high-cues condition contained any relevant cues that would lead to affiliation or disaffiliation; therefore, respondents viewed these targets with a general disinterest but did not feel strongly enough toward them to disaffiliate, as was the case in the extreme outgroup when the profile provided strong cues toward disaffiliation (i.e., membership in the rival team’s group).</p>
<p>Several theories may help interpret these findings. Specifically, the metacontrast ratio and the SGD model—both of which are also derived from self-categorization theory—should be considered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211430687">Turner (1987)</xref> defined metacontrast as a “ratio of perceived intergroup differences to perceived intragroup differences” (p. 52). In essence, metacontrast ratio views group affiliation as a Venn diagram, whereby attributes of different social groups may overlap and an individual’s own idiosyncrasies either lie wholly in one of the two distinct social groups or fall in areas where the groups overlap so that individuals identify with the group with whom they share the most characteristics. Likewise, SGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211430687">Marques, Paez, &amp; Abrams, 1998</xref>) proposes that individuals differentiate between members within an ingroup or outgroup based on pronormative versus antinormative behavior of an individual during intergroup interactions. Following this, an individual may identify more strongly with an outgroup member who demonstrates ingroup norms, which contrasts SIDE-based predictions. While the present research only focused on a university-based affiliation, future research could incorporate norms into the model to determine if such an extreme outgroup as the one tested here could experience similar levels of affiliation as posited in the SGD model.</p>
<p>The interaction of quantity of cues and outgroup affiliation offers insight into the nature of intergroup interaction which may benefit intergroup communication and conflict. For example, the interaction effect between the amount of cues and group affiliation may be utilized in conflict resolution between disparate groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211430687">Amichai-Hamburger and McKenna (2006)</xref> address the contact hypothesis—the notion that meaningful contact between individuals of different groups may lead to the dissipation of prejudice against their representative groups. In interactions such as those between opposing political factions or business units, individuals forced to interact with minimal cues to group affiliation may be able to interact interpersonally rather than being guided and stigmatized by group affiliation and outgroup antagonism.</p>
<p>The lack of a main effect of social identity in the low-cues condition may be an artifact of a superordinate social identity activation rather than the social identities intended to be activated by the experimental condition and may also explain the similarity in means within the low-cues condition. Recalling the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211430687">Mlicki and Ellemers (1996)</xref>, subjects typically seek to identify at more nuanced levels of social identity, particularly when such identities have been primed. While the manipulation check showed that the priming successfully heightened students’ perceptions of their ingroup identity, it is alternately possible that low-cues conditions—in which a specific institution-based social identity was not highlighted—resulted in participants identifying with broader social categories.</p>
<p>With few cues to a specific institutional affiliation, participants in the low-cues condition may have identified via alternate cues available in the stimuli material. Rather than identifying as a Spartan, Wildcat, or Wolverine, participants observing stimuli material may have alternately activated a higher level social identity, such as “study participant,” “college student,” or “Facebook user.” This superordinate identity could have caused the similar levels of affiliation across the ingroup and outgroups. This problem in multiple identities is reminiscent of the problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211430687">Tanis and Postmes (2003)</xref> encountered in their study of students at two universities; because the universities allowed dual enrollment, students may have identified with both universities.</p>
<p>Future research may seek to identify alternate institutions to stimulate social identities that present fewer prior opportunities for subjects to interpersonally engage outgroup members, as previous interactions may mitigate negative outgroup perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211430687">Sherif et al., 1961</xref>). In addition, the suitability of using college students for both the ingroup and outgroups should be assessed, as participants and targets shared a common identity based on their identity as students, which could have adversely influenced the results of this study. Research needs to explore not only whether experimental subjects may be relating at a macrogroup level such as college student but also if there is an upper boundary to salient group identity even beyond educational affiliation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>SIDE research has been used to explore self-categorization and group affiliation along the lines of a salient social identity, historically conceptualizing the ingroup/outgroup relationship as a strict bifurcation. On the basis of previous work, this study sought to explore the validity of that bifurcation and determine whether a more nuanced analysis of ingroup/outgroup affiliation may be better suited to explain the nature of these group relationships. Results generally supported previous work in SIDE theory, finding that participants’ identification did not significantly differ between two outgroups when analysis was solely based on outgroup dissimilarity. However, the observed interaction effect of dissimilarity from ingroup and salience of group cues suggests increased complexity in SIDE’s stimuli and psychological processes, illustrating that outgroup status and amount of cues to that outgroup are both determinants in a target’s degree of separation from a perceived ingroup. Future research should seek to understand the particular nature of the construct of an “outgroup” to better determine how the interaction of the social identity and cues to that identity are used to form impressions about an individual and whether a true moderate outgroup can be discovered.</p>
