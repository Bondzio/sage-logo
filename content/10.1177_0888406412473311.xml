<abstract>
<p>Through a mixed-methods study, teacher educators investigated recent graduates’ perceptions of their preparation program. Beginning special education teachers completed surveys and indicated (a) their level of preparation and confidence associated with 25 core competencies, (b) the most beneficial components of their preparation program, (c) suggestions for improving the program, and (d) current training needs. The highest levels of preparation and confidence were found in the areas of professionalism, behavior management, and instruction. The lowest levels of preparation and confidence were noted in transition and teaching students whose first language was not English. Participants reported that early clinical experiences and student teaching were the most beneficial components of the program. Furthermore, they offered suggestions for adding breadth and depth to courses and desired to learn more about timely issues.</p>

<body>
<p>The first few years of teaching present numerous challenges for special educators. For example, providing noncategorical services; acclimating to diverse caseloads; adjusting to changing expectations from administrators, families, and general educators; and implementing new mandates negatively affect the novice teacher’s sense of efficacy and satisfaction with teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0888406412473311">Whitaker, 2003</xref>). Unfortunately, there is little indication that recent graduates of special education programs are well prepared to assume these responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0888406412473311">Wasburn-Moses, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we should not be surprised that novice teachers report a disconnection between practices learned in their preparation program and their current assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0888406412473311">Bay &amp; Parker-Katz, 2009</xref>), and often operate in “survival mode” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406412473311">Jones, 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0888406412473311">Wigle and Wilcox (2003)</xref> found, clearly the “differential patterns of self-reported competency among practicing teachers may be a source of concern to teacher education programs” (p. 31).</p>
<p>These concerns come at a time when teacher education programs are facing criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0888406412473311">Darling-Hammond, Bransford, LePage, Hammerness, &amp; Duffy, 2005</xref>), shrinking budgets, and greater accountability from public and private entities. Also, personnel shortages and inadequately prepared special education teachers are among the most pressing and chronic problems facing the field, and beginning special educators are more vulnerable than others for an early departure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406412473311">Brownell, Hirsch, &amp; Seo, 2004</xref>). Therefore, teacher educators have been asked to identify and promote aspects of pre-service preparation that help prepare and retain beginning special educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0888406412473311">Connelly &amp; Graham, 2009</xref>). Given these challenges and issues, an important question to pose seems to be the following: What do beginning special educators say about their preparation, and how can teacher educators use the voice of beginning teachers to improve teacher education?</p>
<p>Findings from individual case studies and small group qualitative studies have revealed that beginning teachers were expected to manage students with severe and wide-ranging behavioral and academic challenges, provide instruction with limited resources, co-teach and consult with general educators, and provide individualized or small group instruction in pull-out settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0888406412473311">Conderman &amp; Stephens, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0888406412473311">Kilgore, Griffin, Otis-Wilborn, &amp; Winn, 2003</xref>). Teachers from these studies desired assistance with the interpersonal and collaborative aspects of the job (Conderman &amp; Stephens), struggled using evidence-based practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406412473311">Jones, 2009</xref>), and felt that administrators were uninterested in their work.</p>
<p>Several researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0888406412473311">Billingsley, Carlson, &amp; Klein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0888406412473311">Griffin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0888406412473311">Whitaker, 2003</xref>) completed large-scale studies involving beginning special educators. After surveying 156 first-year special educators in South Carolina, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0888406412473311">Whitaker (2003)</xref> discovered that teachers (a) needed assistance with policies, paperwork, guidelines, and district expectations; (b) appreciated emotional support from colleagues; (c) desired information about the “unwritten rules” of the school; and (d) needed support with acquiring instructional materials and resources. Whitaker concluded that beginning teachers needed significantly more assistance in all areas than what they received. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0888406412473311">Billingsley et al. (2004)</xref> surveyed 1,153 beginning special educators nationally who indicated that they taught three or more disability groups, had limited access to materials, assumed diverse job responsibilities, were concerned about excessive paperwork, had administrators who did not understand special education, and did not feel included in the school. About half of the teachers indicated that they planned to remain in teaching. These authors discussed mismatches between pre-service preparation and actual working conditions. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0888406412473311">Griffin et al. (2009)</xref> surveyed 596 first-year, full-time special education teachers in Florida and Wisconsin. Respondents taught students representing a range of disabilities and indicated that student learning and behavior management were their two top accomplishments, and time, behavior management, and curriculum were distinct challenges. Furthermore, this research reported that communication and collaboration were pressing issues and that relationships with general educators affected their success with collaboration.</p>
<p>Researchers have also studied self-efficacy, or self-confidence, in novice and experienced teachers. Teachers with self-efficacy believe that their teaching skills result in positive student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0888406412473311">Viel-Ruma, Houchins, Jolivette, &amp; Benson, 2010</xref>). Consequently, teacher self-efficacy has been associated with student achievement, motivation, and confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0888406412473311">Tschannen-Moran &amp; Woolfolk-Hoy, 2001</xref>); job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0888406412473311">Viel-Ruma et al., 2010</xref>); a stronger commitment to teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406412473311">Coladarci, 1992</xref>); and a greater likelihood to remain in the teaching profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0888406412473311">Burley, Hall, Villeme, &amp; Brockmeier, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these and other studies indicate that the number and types of students with disabilities served, teacher’s responsibilities, workload manageability, the extent to which school personnel were caring and supportive of students and staff, and the quality of the teacher preparation program effect the special education teacher’s confidence and intent to stay in the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0888406412473311">Robertson &amp; Singleton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0888406412473311">Rock et al., 2009</xref>). Researchers have not yet examined beginning teachers’ views of their preparation and confidence associated with specific competencies as well as ways for teacher educators to use that feedback to make programmatic changes. Therefore, we wanted to examine the reflections of beginning special educators regarding their preparation and consider their input for program improvement.</p>

<sec id="section2-0888406412473311">
<title>Background Information</title>
<p>The context for this study was a large Midwestern university with a K-12 cross-categorical initial special education certification program graduating approximately 80 to 90 candidates annually. Alumni follow-up surveys, completed by the university’s assessment office, resulted in a very low return rate of less than 5%. Faculty desired a higher return rate as they prepared for state-based and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) reviews. The authors received a small internal assessment grant to support the project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0888406412473311">
<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>Our intent was to gather a sufficient sample size from recent graduates to triangulate other data such as candidates’ state test scores, course-related artifacts, early clinical and student teaching evaluations, and dispositions. These sources do not indicate candidates’ perceptions of their preparation after they accrued some teaching experience and had sufficient time to reflect upon their strengths, needs, and level of confidence in fulfilling job responsibilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0888406412473311">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 64 recent graduates participated in this study (i.e., 55 females and 9 males). Sixty-one were Caucasian, 1 African American, 1 Asian, and 1 Hispanic. All spoke English as their primary language. Seventeen percent indicated that they taught Grades K-2, 21% taught Grades 3-5, 23% taught Grades 6-8, and 39% taught Grades 9-12. Eleven percent noted that their primary instructional setting was inclusion in the general education classroom, 25% indicated resource room, and 64% indicated that they taught mostly in a self-contained special education classroom. All candidates were licensed to teach K-12 cross-categorical special education and taught full- or part-time for 1 or 2 years at the time of the study. Ninety-two percent planned to remain in the field teaching special education for more than 5 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0888406412473311">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>We developed a three-part survey in which candidates were requested to answer 25 forced-choice questions (Part 1), five demographic questions (Part 2), and three open-ended questions (Part 3). The survey was reviewed by two master’s-level special education candidates and three special education professors from universities external to the research team’s university setting. Minor alterations and wording edits were conducted on the survey based on reviewers’ feedback.</p>
<p>To develop questions for the first part of the survey, we contacted professors within our department who were teaching methods, management, assessment, collaboration, and transition courses. We explained the study’s purpose and requested no more than seven core competencies associated with their course(s), which were stated explicitly as course outcomes and were matched to the Council for Exceptional Children initial standards. After collecting these competencies, we eliminated identical outcomes, edited them for clarity and parallel structure, and added a competency on laws and professionalism to ensure that these topics were included. Our final list included 25 items arranged into nine clusters: One outcome related to implementing laws (Item 1), one related to developing Individualized Educational Plans (IEPs; Item 2), three affiliated with assessment (Items 3-5), two associated with behavior management (Items 6-7), four related to planning and providing instruction (Items 8-11), seven pertaining to collaboration (Items 12-18), five affiliated with transition (Items 19-23), one related to working with students whose primary language is not English (Item 24), and one concerning professionalism (Item 25). The number of questions in each cluster was determined by faculty interest. For example, both the transition and collaboration courses were fairly new to the program, so we desired more feedback regarding these outcomes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0888406412473311">Figure 1</xref> indicates how prepared (first column) and confident (second column) candidates felt regarding the previously noted competencies using a 4-point Likert-type scale: (1) <italic>not prepared/not confident</italic>, (2) <italic>somewhat prepared/somewhat confident</italic>, (3) <italic>prepared/confident</italic>, and (4) <italic>very prepared/very confident</italic>.</p>

</fig>
<p>In Part 2, candidates provided demographic information. In Part 3, candidates indicated which components of their program were most beneficial, offered suggestions for improving the program, and reported current training needs. Using the most recent permanent addresses from university files, we mailed surveys to all 103 candidates who graduated during the fall and spring semesters in 2011. After a second mailing, follow-up phone calls, and locating candidates on the Internet or Facebook, we secured responses from 64 candidates for a 62% response rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0888406412473311">
<title>Measures and Data Analysis</title>
<p>Items from the scale were examined by computing internal consistency estimates of reliability via Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (α). A recommended cutoff value for score reliability derive from survey research and/or used in applied settings is α ≥ .80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0888406412473311">Henson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0888406412473311">Nunnally, 1978</xref>). The score reliability for the two domains that comprised the survey, preparation and confidence, were α = .893 for preparation and α = .889 for confidence, which signified that there was high internal consistency and the items that encompassed each domain shared a large percentage of the variance.</p>
<p>Using the software program Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (v. 19.0), we used descriptive and correlation statistics to summarize results from Parts 1 and 2 of the survey. Part 3 responses were independently read, analyzed, and coded for each open-ended question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0888406412473311">Creswell, 2011</xref>). After reading comments several times, we used an inductive process of open coding to establish emerging themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0888406412473311">Mertens, 2010</xref>) and formed initial categories by looking for regularities and phrases sentence by sentence to represent topics and patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0888406412473311">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007</xref>). If two or more responses within a question were similar, we coded them into a category. We scrutinized data by noting interrelationships and connections between categories and subcategories. We communicated twice to share categories and responses within each category and initially coded 268 comments into 20 themes with 88% agreement. After discussions, we reached 100% consensus pertaining to open coding themes. We then used axial coding (Mertens) and combined similar categories and coded all comments into 10 major themes with 100% agreement.</p>

Candidates’ confidence mean ranged from 2.61 related to working with students with language differences to 3.85 pertaining to professionalism. The strongest confidence scores were noted in displaying professionalism, developing IEPs, providing positive behavioral supports, planning and providing individualized instruction, collaborating with colleagues in making accommodations and modifications, using effective communication skills, and participating as an effective team member. Candidates provided the lowest confidence scores in areas related to transition and working with students with language issues. The correlation coefficient between the preparation domain and the confidence domain was (<italic>r</italic> = .988, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), which indicated a statistically significant, strong positive relationship.</p>
<p>A closer analysis revealed differences within a cluster. For example, within the assessment cluster, candidates’ mean preparation scores ranged from 2.83 in interpreting scores from formal assessments to 3.37 in using individualized grading criteria. Similarly, in collaboration, candidates’ mean preparation scores ranged from 2.97 in supervising paraprofessionals to 3.66 in using effective communication skills.

<title>Most Beneficial Aspects of the Program</title>
<p>Candidates overwhelmingly noted that student teaching and clinical experiences had the greatest impact on their preparation. Specifically, candidates noted that student teaching provided the opportunity to understand the realities of the profession and their future roles and also try various instructional methods with a supervising teacher before using them in their own classroom. Representative statements included, “Student teaching was the most beneficial because it involved real life experiences, real behavior plans, I saw kids daily to gain their respect and develop authority, and I developed student–teacher professional relationships and collaborated with many professionals” and “Student teaching helped me understand the expectations and workload of a special education teacher as well as responsibilities and time management skills.” Candidates also noted the importance of early clinical experiences by writing, “Being in the classroom early in my program confirmed that I wanted to be a special education teacher.” They indicated that they gained considerable knowledge observing many different teachers and observing methods they now use. One candidate wrote, “I was able to work with a variety of populations, and I feel that I could work any job in special education and feel confident.”</p>
<p>Candidates also wrote about specific courses that they felt were especially relevant to their current position. They noted the value of behavior management courses “because so many students have behavior issues,” the collaboration course that helped them prepare for teaming and co-teaching responsibilities and assistive technology courses that “provided real life pieces that I still currently use.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0888406412473311">
<title>Suggestions for Improvement</title>
<p>Foremost, candidates offered specific recommendations for adding breadth and depth to courses. For example, they suggested adding science, social studies methods, and additional reading courses and offered specific recommendations for more in-depth course topics such as working with resistant colleagues, managing and scheduling a paraprofessional, using computerized IEPs, grading students with disabilities, and teaching in a multicategorical classroom. They summarized, “My courses touched on these subjects, but I would have appreciated more time spent on them.” Similarly, candidates reflected on their preparation in IEP writing and wrote, “Students should have detailed information and practice writing IEPs every semester. This part of the profession is so overwhelming the first year.” Several candidates desired more coursework on working with students with low incidence disabilities. They wrote, “Although they are the smallest population of students, they are the most complicated to work with, and I feel I could have benefitted from learning more strategies to differentiate for that population.” Candidates also acknowledged the importance of learning school politics and culture and desired more about the job search process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0888406412473311">
<title>Current Training Needs</title>
<p>Candidates acknowledged needing additional skills in classroom management, reading, collaboration, teaching students with autism, and transition planning. Candidates also offered specific topics and issues such as response to intervention (RtI), crisis prevention intervention, applied behavior analysis, life space crisis intervention, and specific progress monitoring systems. Two candidates indicated they were discontinuing in the field due to an unsatisfactory experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0888406412473311">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We acknowledge several limitations regarding this study. First, our candidates were from a very similar geographical area, were not culturally diverse, and represented one university preparation program. Therefore, findings may not be broadly generalizable to other teacher preparation programs. More than 60% of our candidates taught in self-contained classrooms, which may not reflect the setting of most novice teachers. Finally, our instrument was tailored to our specific needs in gathering data regarding certain outcomes. Purposefully, the instrument did not contain an equal number of items per cluster. Therefore, although the instrument was tailored to our needs, the items did not equally reflect all professional competencies. Thus, future researchers would need to modify the survey to reflect specific program needs and research questions.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section12-0888406412473311" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main purpose of this study was to gather information from recent graduates after they had some experience teaching, so we could honor their voices. Throughout the study, we were impressed that beginning teachers were able to thoughtfully reflect upon their preparation program and articulate their current training needs. They also indicated that they were happy to hear from a familiar person who genuinely cared about them.</p>
<sec id="section13-0888406412473311">
<title>Preparation and Confidence</title>
<p>This study was unique because we asked candidates to rank their level of preparation and confidence with program competencies. Candidates were confident in areas that they were well prepared in and vice versa. At a time when traditional teacher education programs are facing strong competition from online programs, alternative programs, and reduced state funding, it may be tempting to adjust admission and program standards to attract a large pool of candidates to ensure a steady revenue stream. Teacher education faculty, on the other hand, should not compromise quality to maintain an active applicant pool. Doing so only places candidates and their future students in serious jeopardy. Furthermore, teachers who receive better pre-service preparation are less likely to leave teaching in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406412473311">Billingsley, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Candidates felt well prepared and confident in the area of professionalism, likely due to the heavy emphasis we place on professional behavior. Numerous dispositions posters adorn our hallways as reminders of appropriate behavior, and our conceptual framework includes a component regarding professionalism that candidates are required to read. From their first special education class, and including student teaching, we remind candidates about professionalism by articulating appropriate and inappropriate behaviors through statements noted on each course syllabus. In addition, we evaluate each candidate’s professional behavior every semester and if we observe unprofessional behavior, we intervene with the candidate. If the issue continues, the candidate meets with a faculty committee to develop a corrective action plan. In these ways, we believe that candidates receive a clear and consistent message regarding the importance of professionalism.</p>
<p>Candidates also felt well prepared and confident regarding managing students’ behaviors, planning and providing individualized instruction, writing IEPs, and collaborating with others. These outcomes may also be due to the heavy emphasis we place on these skills repeatedly throughout the program via coursework and authentic-based clinical-related projects. Our program reflects embedded design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0888406412473311">Bain, Lancaster, Zundans, &amp; Parkes, 2009</xref>) by frequently exposing candidates to evidence-based practices at more sophisticated levels and applications. This developmental progression, including sequenced coursework, clinical experiences, and opportunities for candidate reflection represents new NCATE standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0888406412473311">NCATE, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Candidates felt less well prepared and less confident with skills related to transition assessment and planning and teaching English language learners (ELL). Some candidates were admitted to the program before we required the transition course. Also, we do not have a stand-alone course related to working with ELL. We mistakenly assumed that required coursework from a different department adequately prepared candidates in this area. Clinical and student teaching data revealed that some candidates graduated without teaching this population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0888406412473311">
<title>Program Strengths</title>
<p>Candidates indicated that clinical experiences and student teaching were the most beneficial program components. Field-based experiences provide opportunities for candidates to learn the profession, and thus, reduce their anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0888406412473311">Rice, 2003</xref>). Our candidates liked the practical aspect of bridging theory to practice as they implemented projects associated with coursework.</p>
<p>Instruction designed to bridge theory to practice is grounded in Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0888406412473311">D. A. Kolb, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0888406412473311">A. Y. Kolb &amp; Kolb, 2005</xref>). Kolb asserted that (a) learning is an interactive, collaborative process requiring direct experiential encounters within authentic learning contexts; (b) students need direct experiences to attain and relate content, skills, and dispositions; and (c) the learner’s comprehension of that experiential encounter results in new knowledge. In addition, Kolb noted the critical role that feedback plays in the synergistic learning cycle and experiential encounter between the student and the learning environment (Kolb &amp; Kolb). The feedback component emerges via comments from a supervisor as well as the student’s own ongoing reflections on the process and experience. The critical dimension of active learning is thus reinforced through reflection and feedback. Making strong connections between coursework and clinical experiences, providing quality feedback to candidates throughout their program, and teaching candidates how to purposefully reflect are necessary components in teacher education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0888406412473311">NCATE, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0888406412473311">
<title>Areas for Improvement</title>
<p>Candidates provided thoughtful feedback regarding their preparation. Generally, they offered (a) program-specific suggestions such as offering different courses or modifying existing ones or (b) suggestions associated with current challenges or responsibilities related to curriculum, collaboration, or knowing what to do in specific situations. Although teacher educators cannot anticipate every situation that beginning teachers may encounter, they should continuously ask what they can do to make the transition from candidate to teacher as seamless as possible. One concern with cross-categorical preparation is that because candidates are being prepared generically, courses typically do not emphasize highly specialized methods suited for a particular disability. Therefore, teacher educators, clinical supervisors, and first-year mentors need to help candidates make connections and apply their skills in novel situations and with various student groups. Clearly, the extent to which a beginning teacher’s preparation program matches first-year expectations and responsibilities is an area for further research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0888406412473311">Billingsley et al., 2004</xref>). Individualized staff development and mentoring programs also play a significant role in providing focused and intensive support while improving teacher attrition and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0888406412473311">White &amp; Mason, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0888406412473311">
<title>Current Needs</title>
<p>After teaching on their own, candidates seemed better able to assess what they do not know. They articulated the need for additional professional development in areas in which they were asked to assume leadership roles such as designing RtI systems, using evidence-based methods, and consulting with general educators. Teacher candidates face a changing school environment and an ever-evolving future. Thus, current trends in school reform include the changing role of educators from classroom managers to accountability partners for student performance with leadership surfacing as a focal point to enhance student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0888406412473311">Whitsett &amp; Riley, 2003</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412473311">Barth (2001)</xref> asserted, “All teachers harbor leadership capabilities waiting to be unlocked and engaged for the good of the school.” (p. 444). Teachers prepared as leaders are more apt for dialogue, group problem-solving, and collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0888406412473311">Silva, Gimbert, &amp; Nolan, 2000</xref>). Therefore, teacher educators should increase candidates’ awareness of the role of teacher–leader and provide skills and experiences that instill qualities of collaboration and leadership.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section17-0888406412473311">
<title>Using Surveys</title>
<p>Although the process of disseminating surveys and following up with phone calls was time-consuming, we obtained a much higher response rate than the university’s assessment office possibly because we (a) followed-up with second surveys and phone calls; (b) researched using the Internet, the state employment roster, social networking systems such as Facebook, and asked candidates if they knew how to locate other classmates; and (c) disseminated surveys from the candidates’ home department with a personalized note from familiar faculty members. We agree that many candidates establish close relationships with their major professors and may benefit from maintaining that mentoring relationship into their 1st year of teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0888406412473311">Whitaker, 2003</xref>). Even so, due to the time demands of locating candidates, we recommend that projects like this be completed by several colleagues.</p>
<sec id="section18-0888406412473311">
<title>Closing the Assessment Loop</title>
<p>The promise of follow-up surveys is in the rich data that they provide from candidates who reflect upon their program within the authentic context of current working conditions. As part of a teacher education program’s assessment plan, follow-up surveys involving recent graduates provide especially useful data because connecting with beginning teachers helps identify specific supports and work contexts that develop and sustain special educators’ commitment and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0888406412473311">Billingsley et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Survey data provide unique information that can inform faculty in teacher education programs as they make programmatic and curricular changes. To honor the voices of our recent graduates, during regularly scheduled faculty meetings, we shared themes from this project along with data from state test scores, clinical artifacts, student teaching evaluations, and surveys from employers of recent graduates. For example, employers’ comments reinforced the finding that recent graduates displayed strengths in professionalism but needed more support with working in a diverse environment and teaching ELL. After reviewing and discussing data from these sources, faculty initiated several curricular changes. Specifically, based on our data, we now (a) require the transition course, (b) infuse methods for teaching ELLs in all methods courses, (c) include more information about teaching students with autism, (d) require readings, discussions, and role-plays regarding supervising paraprofessionals, and (e) examine clinical and student teaching placements for opportunities for candidates to teach ELLs. We also looked for unnecessary duplication in the program and eliminated a general reading methods course and a basic technology course. In these ways, we are closing the assessment-instruction loop and honoring our candidates’ feedback. Clearly, we agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0888406412473311">Whitaker (2003)</xref> who emphasized that teacher educators need to know the areas in which novice special educators feel least prepared as the answer helps determine the curricular changes for pre-service teachers.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section19-0888406412473311" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Concluding Thoughts</title>
<p>The first few years of teaching provide numerous opportunities for educators to learn about teaching; understand children; collaborate with other adults; reflect upon their preparation program; and analyze their knowledge, skills, levels of confidence, and dispositions for becoming a master teacher. Even with the best preparation programs, this transition is challenging. As one data source, follow-up surveys provide valuable feedback regarding the preparation program. Candidates may be able to more accurately reflect on their level of preparation and confidence with various competencies only after teaching on their own.</p>
<p>Gathering and analyzing candidate data are just the first steps in improving teacher preparation. Faculty need to engage in a meaningful dialogue to determine how they will honor the voices of candidates for continuous program improvement.</p>
