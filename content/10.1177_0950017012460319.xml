<p>This article explores public house (pub) employees’ relationship to alcohol, its service and consumption using data drawn from an ethnographic study of workers in a chain of pubs. These workers experience a particularly complex relationship between their work and their leisure; they belong to a culture in which drinking in public is the norm for consumers and, as employees, they are responsible for enforcing drinking rules within their workplace – which is also where much of their own leisure takes place. The concept of partial consumer is used to analyse the fluidity of the work–leisure and service–consumption divides in this context. The drinking norms that develop within the pub enable these workers to construct contextually variable behavioural norms around drinking behaviour, allowing them to behave differently behind and in front of the bar, the symbolic barrier between work and leisure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A number of researchers have investigated work-related drinking, often focusing on its health implications. Much of the literature considers the physiological dangers associated with excessive alcohol consumption (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460319">Frone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012460319">Roman and Blum, 2002</xref>). This sort of concern is particularly significant for organizations providing alcohol for paying customers, especially in host/hostess operations where employees are actually obliged to drink as part of their job (such as in the cantineras described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012460319">Fernández-Esquer, 2003</xref>). Of course, even where such consumption is not compulsory, the simple availability of alcohol in workplaces could be a cause for concern. For example, in one factory study almost 70 per cent of respondents reported that they knew of colleagues who drank alcohol at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012460319">Delaney and Ames, 1995</xref>). However, drinking is not a wholly problematic practice in relation to work. It has been argued that alcohol plays a symbolic and ritual role in drawing boundaries between activities or in marking the beginning of new relationships. For example, the Social Issues Research Centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460319">SIRC, 2000</xref>: 12) showed how the use of intoxicating drink can mark ‘everyday transitions … from work to play’ and suggested that drinking can be ‘associated with recreation and irresponsibility, and regarded as antithetical to working’. This article investigates the experience of work in the public house sector, particularly by exploring employees’ relationship to alcohol, its service and consumption. It uses the idea of ‘partial consumer’ to analyse work–leisure and service–consumption divides in this context, discussing how workers develop behavioural norms of drinking behaviour that allow them to behave differently behind and in front of the bar, the symbolic barrier between work and leisure.</p>

<title>Alcohol, employees and working space</title>
<p>The use of food and drink and smoking in providing ritual (play) time away from work has been commented on frequently in studies of work behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460319">Gusfield, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460319">Lee, 2001</xref>). However, for those employed in serving food and drink to customers at leisure, the boundaries between work and leisure in terms of activity, physical space and time are less clear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012460319">Stone (1958)</xref> suggested that, far from there being a polarization of work and leisure marked by transitional rituals, there was increasingly a blurring of the lines as
<disp-quote>
<p>more and more we work at our play and we play at our work … our play is disguised by work and vice versa. Consequently, we begin to evaluate our leisure time in terms of the potential it has for work – for us to ‘do it ourselves’, and we evaluate our work in terms of the potential it has for play. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012460319">Stone, 1958</xref>: 285)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>If having a drink after work marks the transition from work to play for many employees, less is known about the symbolic meaning and use alcohol has for pub employees whose role as worker includes supporting and enforcing social drinking norms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012460319">Sosteric (1996)</xref> discussed after-hours drinking by employees in nightclubs and he suggested that, in addition to drawing a line between work and play, alcohol plays a role in establishing and cementing relationships between colleagues. Thus after-session drinking can provide a buffer zone between work and leisure where employees are no longer working officially, but drink together in the workplace after hours, discussing the evening’s work.</p>

<title>Employees as partial consumers</title>
<p>Public houses present a conceptual challenge, especially if employees live on the premises and spend much of their leisure and disposable income in the place of work. One helpful theoretical approach to the issue introduces the idea of ‘partial employees and consumers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460319">Manolis et al., 2001</xref>: 225). Customers can be seen as partial employees when participating in service delivery (e.g. collecting and clearing food in a fast food restaurant), while employees are partial consumers when engaging in ‘the production and consumption of the service as a symbolic act that includes the production of themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460319">Manolis et al., 2001</xref>: 226). However, surprisingly little literature engages with the idea of employees as partial consumers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460319">Manolis et al.’s (2001)</xref> meaning of the term, although attention has been paid to the idea of employees as internal <italic>customers</italic>. The managerialist concept of internal customer ‘views all employees and departments as being simultaneously internal customers of, and internal suppliers to, other employees and departments in the firm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012460319">Lings, 2004</xref>: 407) and is seen as an internal marketing tool used to manage employees’ interactions and relationships with colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012460319">Balain and Sparrow, 2009</xref>: 27).</p>
<p>Employees have also been analysed as actual customers of their organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012460319">Lusch et al., 1996</xref>: 185). This is somewhat akin to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460319">Fleming’s (2009</xref>: 107) suggestion that ‘Google blurred its consumers and employees into one figure, following the principle that many IT [information technology] geeks are most attracted to companies from which they purchase products (and vice versa)’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017012460319">Watson (2000</xref>: 11) showed how working for leisure providers, such as pubs, is often seen as a way for people to experience some benefits of the leisure environment when otherwise they might not be able to afford it, ‘being paid as opposed to spending yet … able to enjoy the company and the atmosphere’. However, the role of paid server can never be the same as the paying ‘served’ customer. More explicitly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012460319">Dabholkar and Abston (2008)</xref> conceptualized some customer contact employees as <italic>external</italic> customers who purchase products from their employer. Their conceptualization differs from more traditional ideas of internal marketing, raising additional questions regarding the relationship between work and non-work or work–life balance, the latter being increasingly seen as simplistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012460319">Warhurst et al., 2008</xref>: 6). This view of employees as external customers suggests a somewhat instrumental focus on employees purchasing their employer’s product. The idea of <italic>external</italic> is here used as differentiation from the internal marketing concept mentioned earlier, whereby employees are encouraged to treat colleagues as customers or suppliers in the context of their actual work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460319">Manolis et al.’s (2001)</xref> work took the concept of external customer further than simply purchasing the product or service, but rather seeing employees as ‘consuming their roles and duties’ in their broader self-development, a more postmodern twist on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012460319">Marx’s (1973</xref>: 90) assertion that
<disp-quote>
<p>production is also immediately consumption. Twofold consumption, subjective and objective: the individual not only develops his abilities in production, but also expends them, uses them up in the act of production, just as natural procreation is a consumption of life forces.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although this clearly has implications for power relations within work organizations and labour process theory, this article is more concerned with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460319">Manolis et al.’s (2001)</xref> idea of employee consumers, which explored the symbolic nature of the interactive production and consumption by service providers and customers of a service, in effect ‘our ways of being-in-the-world [which would here include working and consuming at work] … enable us to make sense of ourselves, others and things that we use, deal with and encounter in our everyday activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012460319">Sandberg and Dall’Alba, 2009</xref>: 1354).</p>
<p>Of course, this consumption is more visible in some types of work than others, for example bartending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017012460319">Watson, 2000</xref>), tour representatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460319">Guerrier and Abid, 2003</xref>) or aerobics instructors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460319">Felstead et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460319">Küpers’ (2000</xref>: 297) concept of ‘prosumer’ helps to situate the potential importance of such an idea for organizational theorists and managers when understanding service delivery. This focused on how ‘the embodied subjectivities of the “producer” and the “consumer” of the service are fundamentally interrelated’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012460319">Cova and Dalli (2009</xref>: 316) reiterated this in their idea of ‘working consumers’, based on the assumption that ‘post-modern individuals are on a never-ending identity quest, a quest to define the meaning of their lives’ – implying a position for the apparently inevitable and balancing idea of consuming workers.</p>
<p>Consuming products or services that one has also produced seems likely to contribute to further blurring of boundaries between work and non-work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012460319">Nippert-Eng, 1996</xref>). Thus employees are unlikely to behave as non-employee customers would, if only because they already have an employment/service-based relationship with the organization, its customers and its product/service which will inevitably influence their approach to their custom. For this reason, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460319">Manolis et al.’s (2001)</xref> partial consumer is more helpful when seeking to understand their role than ‘external’ customer, which seems more likely to blur meaning with non-employee customers.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>This article draws from an ethnographic study of an English chain of public houses. The chain here tends to focus on pubs in relatively rural settings (villages and small towns) that offer overnight accommodation. The participant pubs had a mixture of local and non-local staff (the latter generally living on the premises), which has particular implications for the employees’ experiences at work. Most managers had considerable experience in catering while their service staff were normally much younger than them, with a mixture of those in their late teens and 20s (including students) and slightly older workers in their 30s. Most colleagues clearly saw their pub work as temporary in nature, with younger ones working to support their studies or while looking for a more permanent position. Older participants also explained they did not intend staying long, often seeing live-in work as a relatively easy way of saving for travel or other expenses. Even some of the managers saw their positions as relatively short term, often coming from hotel or restaurant careers and openly seeking similar positions. In post-fieldwork visits very few colleagues could be found working in any of the pubs a few months after fieldwork was completed.</p>
<p>One of the authors (the fieldworker) conducted participant observation in five pubs of the chain. The fieldworker worked as a full-time member of staff for six weeks in each pub. Each of these fieldwork phases included about a week to settle into the new position, followed by increasingly focused observations of service work in action. Field notes were normally prepared after work. These tended to be rather descriptive during work days, given the limited time available (after all, working as an employee and socializing with colleagues and customers was certainly time-consuming). More reflective entries were possible during time off from work and between fieldwork periods. The last two weeks of each phase also included a small number of more formal, in-depth interviews with key informants (19 in total) – these included unit managers, assistant managers (though this title was often used loosely to include what would normally be seen as general assistants), full-time and part-time bar staff, some of whom lived-in on the premises. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0950017012460319">Table 1</xref> lists the interviewees, although they are anonymized. Observing and participating in a number of the after-work drinking sessions helped to better understand the behaviours and interactions of colleagues, although it was often more difficult to separate observer and participant roles when drinking with colleagues after work. An example of this sort of participant research was presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012460319">Gough and Edwards (1998)</xref> who analysed audio-recorded dialogue during a drinking session in which Edwards took part. As in the current study, they did consider whether the fieldworker should have more of an observer role, ‘abstaining from alcohol with a view to taking field notes as the session progressed’ but decided against this as it would seem ‘artificial and unrealistic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012460319">1998</xref>: 413). This does present ethnographers with a further challenge: participation calls for shared consumption (of drink) while observation is likely to be impaired with intoxication. As much as anything, the reflective nature of the field notes helps an ethnographer keep in touch with the researcher self/role in reminding him/her of the research purpose as participation develops over time.</p>

<p>The nature of the research raises important ethical issues, not least of which is informed consent. Although the research focused on employees, where such consent was more readily obtainable, the involvement of customers did require consideration. Unlike in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460319">O’Connell-Davidson’s (2008)</xref> study, contact with customers was not always ‘fleeting’, but was in a ‘public space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460319">2008</xref>: 51). The area of interest – employee consumption – did focus on their interactions with customers, though specific and key encounters tended to be when drinking with customers which were hardly fleeting and gave ample opportunities for openness about the research. In the case of other customers the fieldworker is responsible to ‘anticipate potential harms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460319">2008</xref>: 64) to subjects which, in the case of pub customers who were neither key subjects nor reported on individually, seems extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>Data were analysed following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012460319">Spradley’s (1980)</xref> data-led approach and resulting in increasingly focused observation and questioning. This is exemplified by the development, over time, of a field diary, with daily descriptive field notes built into an increasingly reflective account of the experiences, observations and discussions. Time away from the field gave further opportunities for analytic reflection on the data at the same time as the more formalized procedures of ethnographic analysis following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012460319">Spradley’s (1980)</xref> model.</p>
<p>In the following sections of the article the key themes that emerged from the data are explored. An introductory overview of colleagues’ perceptions of the social position of alcohol and pubs leads to a more focused account of their personal and professional identification with alcohol at work and their consumption of it. This also leads to a brief account of what participants saw as the more negative and problematic issues around their own and colleagues’ consumption of alcohol associated with work. The heterogeneous nature of the public house sector limits the generalizability of the findings; this issue is further explored in the conclusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0950017012460319">
<title>Employee experiences of the rituals and meanings of alcohol consumption</title>
<p>Participants often held clear views about drinking norms and their customers. Pat, an Irish participant employed in pub 3, discussed his perception of the position of alcohol in England: ‘The old thing is “I never drink indoors” and the impression that they’re trying to give you is that anybody who drinks indoors is a secret alcoholic, you know, or some kind of deviant’. Certainly, his view may represent an example of the different norms governing drinking in and out of the home in different class cultures. In their study of the village pub, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012460319">Hunt and Satterlee (1986</xref>: 68) identified different types of pub clientele, possessing distinctive norms about drinking. The more working-class customers tended to view the pub as the main place to meet, ‘rather than their own homes’, whereas their more middle-class subjects would engage in both pub society and home entertaining. Both this and Pat’s observation support the suggestion that alcohol consumption is almost always normatively reinforced as a group and public activity rather than a solitary or individual one.</p>
<p>Pat stressed the dangers of alcohol from a social order rather than medical perspective. His view of pub work raised the challenge facing commercial operations selling intoxicating drink – notably, the dichotomy of the need to provide welcoming service while maintaining control in order to satisfy legal, business and ethical constraints (such as not serving alcohol to drunk customers and maintaining harmony among customers). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012460319">Roberts (2004)</xref> pointed out, brewers and pub managers want a large customer base of customers drinking regularly but this is only likely to be achieved if drinking is contained within relatively prescribed boundaries. Thus what is often seen as ‘getting merry’ receives social approval whereas public drunkenness is not well tolerated. Indeed, one of the most mentioned pub rules (from a service perspective) was the refusal to serve drunk customers, although observational data suggested that this was more likely to be enforced if the drunk customer behaved aggressively or in another unacceptable manner. People seen as happy or funny drunks were often provided with more drinks if required.</p>
<p>The norms and practice of round-buying were important to workers as well as customers. The field notes included many examples of the fieldworker and other colleagues being purchased drinks during working hours. Although this would rarely be an alcoholic drink while working, it would often lead to joining the round after work. It was just assumed that it was good practice to include the server in a round, at least by some customers. In some of the smaller pubs employee reciprocation was rare as bar staff would normally work until closing time. In the larger pubs, with more staff and more opportunities to finish work before closing time, it was quite common for an employee to simply move to the other side of the bar and continue within a round.</p>
<p>The position of being bought drinks by customers within the informal reward structure is also interesting. Unlike the bar staff in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012460319">Sosteric’s (1996)</xref> Canadian nightclub, in none of the pubs from the present study were financial tips a significant part of bar employees’ rewards. Tipping, although it may contribute substantially to income, is often associated with norms of servility and low status. For these bar staff, the absence of tipping together with their participation in rounds seemed to symbolize an egalitarianism similar to that noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012460319">Hunt and Satterlee (1986)</xref>. Pat suggested this helps when maintaining order, given the nature of alcohol and its potential for modifying the behaviour of customers.</p>
<p>Dealing with problem customers and situations is of considerable importance in licensed premises. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460319">Smith (1985a</xref>: 32) stressed ‘the requirement imposed on the publican to “maintain social order”, in a context which has the potential for unconstrained behaviour’, although, as the pub managers were not always present during opening hours, this role was often necessarily delegated to other bar staff. In the current study bar staff empowered themselves through a sort of egalitarian sharing of the product (alcohol), often within the actual customer groupings, something that many other branches of the hospitality industry would simply not allow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012460319">Mars and Nicod, 1984</xref>).</p>

<p>The nature of pub work is often seen as an important attraction for workers despite the relatively low pay offered. The availability of alcohol and sociability helps to make pub work an occupation where the dual roles of server and served have a particular significance. As suggested earlier, social drinking by staff was common in all of the participant pubs, an observation that is not surprising in itself given the nature of pubs. However, there were considerable variations in the practice from unit to unit. Peter provided live-in staff with limited free drinks after each shift – a practice quite rare elsewhere in the company. In another pub staff would often drink together after closing the bar and the manager would only join them occasionally, while in a third, staff would socialize with each other rather less, but the manager would drink much more (while working) with customers. The idea that alcoholic drinks could be considered part of the reward package does complicate the idea of employee as external customer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012460319">Dabholkar and Abston, 2008</xref>) if the employee is not actually purchasing her/his drink, although it fits well with the slightly different view of ‘partial consumer’ given the broader conceptualization of employee and emphasizes the ‘porous boundaries for the production/consumption experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460319">Manolis et al., 2001</xref>: 234). There was certainly little to let the casual observer know that these after-work drinkers were actually employees, given their attire, demeanour and behaviour, whether or not they paid for their drinks, so they experienced the socio-identity benefits of consumption of the pub experience.</p>
<p>If such consumption is also culturally symbolic of the boundary between work and leisure, as suggested by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460319">SIRC (2000)</xref>, this highlights a potential blurring of the work/non-work divide for employees and also presents a possible starting point for analysis of the partial consumer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460319">Manolis et al., 2001</xref>). The idea that an employee consumes the product/service could also be seen in reverse, effectively contributing to the ‘establishment of its [a brand’s] authenticity for consumers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460319">Land and Taylor, 2010</xref>: 407). Thus external customers could see employees’ authentic selves as central to their evaluation of the brand/service provider, so their view of ‘employees’ activities outside the workplace reframes leisure and labour, life as work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460319">2010</xref>: 408).</p>
<p>Even in the pub where free drinks were available for staff, this privilege rarely seemed to be taken to excess and abused. Live-in staff would spend more ‘leisure’ time in the bar than other colleagues, but would often pay for drinks after one or two ‘freebies’, and would join in rounds with colleagues and customers. However, although such reciprocity could be seen as evidence of employee-as-consumer, the divide between server and served was rarely obscured totally. Most participants were very aware that they needed to be aware of their status as employees even when not actually working. As Dave explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>you can have a bit of a laugh with … regulars – people you know – you can sort of have a joke with them, tell them jokes, mess around with them, but, you know, you have to judge the type of person it is before you start being silly.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This shows the essential partiality of employee roles and the need to be aware of the essential sovereignty of <italic>fully</italic> external customers, who are not also employees.</p>
<p>An often mentioned, the attraction of working in pubs is ‘working with people’, an idea that could develop into a perception of socializing while working. A small number of participants went further and claimed they did not really think of work as work at all but as an unusual mixture of work and leisure, echoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017012460319">Watson’s (2000)</xref> respondent’s experience of working in city-centre bars. Similar to Watson’s interviewee Manda, Dave had originally worked in pubs as a second job, although he had recently resigned from his main job so that he could work full-time in pubs. He explained that:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve always worked as a barman since about 18, 19, and I … don’t enjoy (I know it sounds silly), I don’t enjoy going to pubs. What I enjoy is working [there], I enjoy being in the environment [when] I am working … I don’t consider this as work.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One of his colleagues, Hugh, came to a similar conclusion, asserting that:
<disp-quote>
<p>I enjoy working here more than anything, because, I mean, all my friends come in here, so I don’t mind working of a Saturday night because I can save money, plus I see my friends – I can go out with them afterwards … I work here; it’s become a way of life for me, for a long, long time now.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460319">Guerrier and Adib’s (2003</xref>: 1415) suggestion that some ‘tour reps become tour reps because they have learned to be good holidaymakers’; in a similar way employees such as these became pub workers because they had learned to be pub users and are able to integrate leisure and work to some extent.</p>
<p>The feeling that work is indistinguishable from a form of leisure-based socializing (or at least that the boundaries are blurred, akin to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012460319">Nippert-Eng’s [1996]</xref> overlapping boundaries) requires the employee to maintain a perception of social equilibrium with customers which must then be balanced against the reality that bar staff do actually <italic>serve</italic> food and drink. There was also a danger of some colleagues taking the socializing further and spending more time talking to customers than working. Mike described how he became increasingly frustrated by a colleague ‘munching on some crisps, talking to his mates’. Thus it was not uncommon for some colleagues to take the work-as-leisure approach rather too far during work hours. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012460319">Smith (1985b</xref>: 295) described the criticism of a publican for being ‘behind the bar less often than in front of it’, mingling, drinking and gambling with favoured customers.</p>
<p>After-work socializing was also important as there were rarely opportunities for colleagues to meet together at other times of the day or week. The nature and timing of the work means that it is highly unlikely for even a small group of colleagues to take a break together during work hours as is normal in other occupations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460319">Lee’s (2001)</xref> work on formally scheduled tea-breaks showed the importance often given to such breaks as an opportunity to discuss work and non-work issues. Occasionally during the fieldwork staff would eat breakfast together, but rarely would more than one person have a break at the same time during service. Starting and finishing at different times during the day was also a challenge, even when organizing after-work socializing. However, the relatively clear closing time provided a focus for colleagues. Those who finished early might stay in the bar area until closing and people not working could return after a day out. This is not to suggest that every night saw a drunken party of colleagues, and some units would have a far smaller number of such sessions, as suggested earlier. There was often considerable mixing of employee and customer during these sessions both during and after opening hours (offering overnight accommodation enabled registered guests to consume alcohol after hours and most of the pubs would occasionally unofficially relax the opening hours for some of the regular customers too).</p>
<p>For these workers, the work <italic>place</italic> association with alcohol was inextricably tied into leisure <italic>time</italic> (and work <italic>time</italic> with leisure <italic>place</italic>). Thus they would be working in a place of leisure and often spent leisure time in their place of work. Even during this leisure, much of their conversation was about work. This seemed to lead to a close identification with their pub. There certainly was evidence of a feeling of ownership of the workplace among both live-in and live-out staff. Hugh did explain that:
<disp-quote>
<p>when I walk in here as a civilian and not a person that works there, I’m thinking to myself ‘I really want to go upstairs now and walk through the kitchen, chat to people in the kitchen … I guess it’s my pub – [although] it’s not the pub I would go to, to have a drink at all.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>So here he pointed out that he felt comfortable and involved in the pub, even though it would not be the sort of pub where he would drink if he was not working there. This was during his vacation from university and was his first pub job. He, like a number of the other participants, felt that working in the pub had made him more socially confident, losing a lot of his earlier shyness and explaining that ‘it’s brightened up my life, because … it lubricates the brain talking all the time, to customers and having to talk to your colleagues’. This strong identification was often discussed with participants, although it could be seen as strange given the transitory nature of employment in pubs for many of them. Within a few months most colleagues and managers were no longer employed at the same pub, suggesting that these feelings, though often intense, were perceived as temporary. Pat explained that he did not like to stay too long in any job so that he did not lose his ‘freshness’.</p>
<p>After-hours drinking seemed to be experienced by some workers as almost mandatory, although less explicitly than the compulsion to drink with customers explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012460319">Fernández-Esquer (2003)</xref>. The bonding resulting from drinking together was often stressed and was explicitly linked to job performance during a discussion with two colleagues. John asserted that drinking together helped develop bonds much like a community of coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012460319">Korczynski, 2003</xref>). He suggested that colleagues who drank together socially were more likely to ‘get you out of the shit or you get them out of the shit and you’ll work as a team with them’. Such an acceptance of a bond between ‘drinking-buddies’ – a phrase frequently used by Pat – was common. When asked to explain why this relationship was so important explanations revolved around the idea that drinking reduces inhibitions and loosens tongues so as to help colleagues get to know each other better. However, as shown earlier, not everyone would drink together regularly. The different pubs did have different patterns of such socializing and not everyone would join in all the time. Kris had recently had her first baby, and mentioned how:
<disp-quote>
<p>there’s quite a few nights when I finish here and I think ‘I would like to stay now and just have a few drinks. And not worry about going, just go upstairs or something’ … but, yes I do miss it.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When asked to explain why she missed the socializing she raised practical rather than purely social or fun concerns:
<disp-quote>
<p>at the end of every night I think it’s healthy to have a drink. A tea or coffee or beer … and just get things off your chest … And, so I think it’s important to talk to colleagues after work. But, I think you learn to support each other as well, all day – you’d go insane otherwise. Because only people in catering can understand what it’s like.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Pat summarized the ideas that came from many of the other colleagues thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>OK, the job might not be well paid, but sit down and have a drink together; it’s a bit of courtesy, a bit of respect. And then it gets a few things out, you know, and it does. And you can solve a lot of things late at night over a boozy old drink.</p>
</disp-quote>

<title>More problematic alcohol consumption?</title>
<p>As shown earlier, the question of drinking while working or within the workplace was often discussed. For live-in employees, access to public areas of the pubs was especially important, especially after work in order to enable after-work sociable drinking. Charlie echoed the explanations of many when he suggested that for
<disp-quote>
<p>live-in staff it’s important [social drinking], because they need to have a release to go somewhere as well, at the end to the night, because normally by the time they finish work everywhere else is closed. Where do they go?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>He recalled a time before when he had worked under other management regimes:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve worked in operations where 11.30, 12 o’clock at night, that’s it; manager went to bed, and everybody else had to go to bed. That was quite frustrating … I mean, nobody liked going to bed, so obviously they were like, well frustrated because they didn’t even have a drink, you know, it’s like ‘You don’t appreciate us, we’ve worked hard all day, and now you’re telling us to go to bed. Is there any chance we could get a late drink?’ It was like we were begging the manager to give us something that we thought, as live-in staff, that ‘Hey this is normal. You should be able to let us sit back and have a drink’.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Talk of normality frequently included the issue of deviance and drunkenness, especially on occasions when alcohol consumption was seen as problematic. Most of the participants were aware of problems associated with drinking at work, such as health damage associated with heavy and prolonged drinking and more psychological issues. For example, John had previously worked for the Official Receiver (as a temporary pub manager) and explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I was doing relief management … there were two main reasons that I actually got work for the whole of that period – either the VAT man or divorce – and both of those were drink related as far as the actual staff side of it goes. Either the landlord or landlady were drinking too much and not declaring it or the landlord or landlady were drinking too much and splitting up as a result, or the staff were not being regulated enough and drinking too much.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Throughout the fieldwork there were few examples of inappropriate (violent or abusive) behaviour towards staff that could be related to drinking alcohol. However, such problems were discussed, often demonstrating rather ambivalent employee attitudes towards drunkenness – drinking and drunkenness were popular topics of conversation. Participants would often criticize people, both customers and colleagues, who, in their opinion, drank to excess. John would regularly criticize his manager (who was younger than managers in any of the other units) in a rather off-hand manner. For example, when he was explaining the team-building value of eating breakfast with colleagues to plan the day’s activities, he explained that room cleaners would discuss accommodation bookings, the chef restaurant bookings, himself stock orders and deliveries ‘and as far as he [manager] was concerned, he’d just get drunk’. However, later in the discussion he described how he, himself, would ‘get wasted’ with colleagues after work. When this was discussed further he became a little self-conscious and explained that it would not happen very often. Perhaps the key issue relates to other behavioural expectations as much as the drinking itself. He considered the professionalism of remaining in control at work, while being able to drink heavily, to be very important and took some pride in the quantity of alcohol that he could consume.</p>
<p>Damian was also perceived by his staff to have a drink problem, regularly drinking with customers while serving them and often displaying aggressive behaviour towards his employees. The field notes had numerous references to this, as his behaviour made working there (and conducting research) more problematic than the other pubs. He was also the only employee to experience a physical attack from a customer during the fieldwork. He did not receive a visible injury, but the fact that he was attacked was seen by his staff as indicative of his losing control of the situation. Later Josh discussed this with the fieldworker:
<disp-quote>
<p>In pubs you can get the feeling that someone’s got negative vibes – you’ve got to anticipate and sense trouble, and then you make contact with the person to find out what’s wrong and then make a decision to prevent trouble. No manager should ever be assaulted by a customer – that’s a sign of poor management.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This raises again the issue of the publican’s role in social control referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460319">Smith (1985a)</xref>, who noted the potential significance of alcohol consumption in relation to maintaining order and policing customers. Bar staff must maintain a careful – and not always obvious – balance between serving and drinking sociably with customers and staff, while avoiding any alcohol-induced loss of control of the sociable situation. This also ties in with comments made by Charlie. He discussed the social gatherings after work which would often involve him drinking a bottle of vodka. Despite these long drinking sessions he pointed out that he was always careful to maintain some distance from his staff. He explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t get too close – as much as I sit up and have a drink with the staff at the end of the day, we’ve all got a job to do, and the next morning, when we’ve finished having a drink, we’re back to work. Because we sat down and had good fun last night doesn’t mean to say we’re going to have it tomorrow, because tomorrow something might go wrong, and if you’re to blame, you get the brunt.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>He felt that his workers might take advantage if they became too complacent in their relationship – he had earlier said the same thing about customers too – a cautionary proviso to the alcohol bonding discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Although such problem drinking was not the primary focus of this research, it seemed appropriate to briefly explore it here given the centrality of alcohol to pub work and the considerable exposure staff have to it, especially those living-in. Actual and perceived pressure to participate in round-buying behaviour and the use of alcohol by some managers and customers as a reward for staff also contribute to make this a challenging phenomenon for employees to deal with. Some colleagues clearly had problems, such as Damian, who showed signs of drunkenness almost every night, and Charlie’s periodic vodka consumption, and almost everyone would ‘let their hair down’ from time to time. However, differentiating social from problem drinking is not easy, especially given the fieldworker’s participation. The field notes include many references to ‘having a drink/pint/half’ with colleagues or customers or even alone – one entry explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>At the moment I’m sitting in the ‘Fox’ pub. It’s ironic that I find a quiet pub the best place for reflections (with a couple of beers). Alcohol is so important for pub workers and lots of wind-ups take place with the 14-year-old waitresses – they never tire of asking for a drink, but Paul and Peter are very good at saying no! Drinks at the end of a shift are a major ritual.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Again, the idea of partial consumer may help make better sense of this, especially given the centrality of alcohol to the social validation of individuals, whether server or served.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has explored pub workers’ relationship to alcohol, its service and consumption. Drinking alcohol away from the home is embedded in leisure cultures in British society and contributes significantly to consumer spending. Pub workers experience a complex relationship between their work and their leisure time. The drinking norms that develop in this occupational context enable these workers to construct contextually variable behavioural norms around drinking behaviour, allowing them to behave differently behind and in front of the bar, the symbolic barrier between work and leisure. The idea of employees as partial consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460319">Manolis et al., 2001</xref>) offers potential illumination of this idea whereby pub workers consume the identity building sense of belonging to (<italic>consumption of</italic>) a public house and participation in its social rituals both while working and outside of work hours, as well as sharing in the actual consumption of alcohol.</p>
<p>This analytical context is slightly unusual when seen in relation to much of the literature on partial employees/consumers. Here, the partial consumer is explicitly consuming the employing organization’s tangible product (particularly alcohol) in their workplace, albeit outside of work hours, and sharing in the ritual and symbolism of this consumption as a social individual. The <italic>partiality</italic> of this consumption is highlighted by the tendency, at least in the participating pubs, to keep such (tangible) consumption separate from an individual’s actual work hours, although the symbolic consumption of sociability and ritual was present during work as well; it was also present in after (opening) hours drinking when employees would, by necessity, serve themselves, each other and any customers still remaining. Other contexts, often related to leisure activities, demonstrate similar phenomena (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460319">Guerrier and Abid’s [2003]</xref> tour reps, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460319">Felstead et al.’s [2007]</xref> aerobics instructors and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460319">Land and Taylor’s [2010]</xref> sports fashion workers). These often explore work–life balance issues, especially in relation to the idea that organizations can take advantage of such consumption, effectively extending ‘value productive activities – in work <italic>and</italic> life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460319">Land and Taylor, 2010</xref>: 408). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460319">Manolis et al.’s (2001)</xref> conceptualization of partial consumption is more about the employees’ use of such consumption to contribute to the production of themselves. This perspective does not seem to be much considered in the organizational literature, although it is not really a rare thing, even beyond the pub, hospitality and tourism sectors. In service organizations such as pubs this is rather more visible given the nature of the service/product that contributes to the postmodern experience of work and consumption. This sort of research can lead the way and help illuminate the concept of partial consumption, and encourage similar analyses in other types of occupation where its symbolic contribution to employees’ self-production is less obvious due to less visible product/service consumption.</p>
<p>Work-related drinking norms derived mainly from the need to maintain a level of control over customer behaviour. The discretion that pub workers have to serve or deny alcohol contributes to their positive perceptions of their self image, status and standing in the workplace. Drinking while on duty is controlled precisely because it might lead to difficulties in maintaining the harmony of social relations within the pub and thus damage their image of themselves as equal to their customers in terms of social status. Thus employee perceptions of the normative rituals and symbolic meanings of alcohol were seen as crucial to their management of the service encounter and their role within its ritualized consumption in a similar way to that of the bar staff in Sosteric’s research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012460319">1996</xref>). However, many of the participants in the present study were relatively mature and experienced in service work. This is not always the case in the different sectors of the hospitality industry, which employs large numbers of younger workers. This raises the question of how drinking norms can be maintained by less mature and empowered bar staff.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the consumption of alcohol and pub culture played a role in pub workers’ experience of their work, their relationships with other workers and their leisure time. Employees who provide leisure services for other people frequently find themselves, as in the present case, having very little free time when they can themselves enjoy leisure services, especially live-in workers with little private leisure space. For these workers, much of their leisure time was spent drinking in the workplace itself when not working, with people who they serve and being served by people who they work with, slipping from the role of employee to customer and vice versa on a regular basis. In particular, drinking with colleagues after work was seen as an important part of the work experience, providing the bonds necessary for providing support to one another during periods of service. It also provided an important source of attraction to the job since the blurred boundaries between work and social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012460319">Nippert-Eng, 1996</xref>) allowed employees to construct a shared view of work as somehow not really being work due to its sociable nature. As pointed out earlier, this study should not be seen as necessarily representative of all pubs, focusing as it does on a relatively small part of this large and diverse sector. As such, it would be useful for further studies to explore the idea of partial consumers in other types of pub and, indeed, in other commercial settings. Likewise, although the <italic>English</italic> pub is often seen as somewhat unique internationally, it would be worthwhile to widen the scope of this work to a more international setting, where pubs, or their equivalent, serve many and different clienteles.</p>
<p>Postmodern interpretations of social change suggest that there is a shift from a society organized around values of production to one organized around values of consumption, and that leisure services, particularly those concerned with eating and drinking away from the home, play an increasingly important role in the economy. Further research on the relationship leisure workers have with the products they provide seems likely to provide valuable insights into changing attitudes and values surrounding both leisure and work.</p>
