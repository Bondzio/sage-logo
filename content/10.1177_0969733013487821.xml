<p>Society has increasingly accepted lethal injections as a humane way to execute prisoners. Lethal injections, which require medical knowledge and skill, place correctional nurses in compromising situations. Nurse participation in executions is an important issue to explore because the death penalty creates ethical dilemmas for nurses. Ethical conflicts arise when nurses participate in activities that conflict with personal beliefs and values. The debate regarding nurse participation in executions will continue as long as the United States has the death penalty. The fact that capital punishment is currently practiced in the United States does not override the obligations of nurses to abide by the ethical and moral mandates of their profession.</p>
<p>Nurses face many challenges and ethical dilemmas when participating in the execution of prisoners. Several states excuse medical personnel from participating in executions, while other states do not. This poses a potential legal conflict for nurses if they do not fulfill their job expectations. Nurses are supposed to alleviate patient suffering, help people maintain/restore health, and ensure patients have a dignified death. Nurses’ participation in capital punishment is contrary to fundamental goals and ethical traditions of the nursing profession.</p>
<p>Adding to the ethical dilemma of nurses’ role in prisoner executions are the differing opinions about correctional nursing. Correctional nurses, compared to the community and hospital nurses, face additional barriers because of the societal stigmatization associated with the correctional healthcare system. Correctional nurses receive criticism from many in society who feel capital punishment and assisting in executions conflict with the qualities that the profession of nursing represents.</p>
<p>In 1977, Medical Examiner Dr Chapman developed a three-drug protocol for lethal injections that is in use today. The first drug induces unconsciousness, a paralytic is then given to paralyze the prisoner, and potassium chloride is then given to stop the heart. Dr Chapman’s theory was prisoners would fall into a deep sleep and would not awaken. He never considered any ethical dilemmas lethal injections would cause nor did he conceive untrained personnel would inject the medication. Johnson affirms that due to the lack of expertise, sometimes multiple attempts are made (up to 30) to gain venous access for the lethal injection of prisoners. Since 1977, out of approximately 1000 executions, at least 40 prisoners have experienced unnecessary complications. The one commonality in those executions is untrained personnel obtaining venous access.<sup>

</sup> Because of the errors associated with lethal injections, the law turned to the medical profession for solutions to make lethal injection humane. New Jersey is the only state to name registered nurses (RNs) as one of the persons qualified to participate in the lethal injection process.<sup>

</sup> Nurses and medical personnel should not be mandated to participate in executions. However, they may have a professional obligation to participate on the moral grounds of duty and mercy.</p>
<p>The main issue facing the nursing profession today concerns the nurse’s participation in ending someone’s life. Nurses must remember that the justice system has imposed the death penalty on the prisoner, not the nurse. The prisoner will be put to death with or without the assistance of the nurse. The death of the prisoner is more humane if a nurse provides the technical expertise to start the intravenous line and emotional support for the prisoner as he/she leaves this life. Nurses must have the autonomy to decide for themselves whether participation in capital punishment is congruent with their own beliefs and values.</p>
<p>The decision not to participate in capital punishment has direct and indirect implications for the correctional nursing profession. The positive implication is the nurse does not jeopardize the therapeutic relationship with the prisoner. The negative implication surrounds the skill set of the person providing the lethal injection if the nurse refuses.</p>
<p>Correctional nurses are required to care for every inmate equally and without prejudice, regardless of their crime. Some ethical principles related to the death penalty are the obligation of the nurse to do no harm and to form a trusting relationship with their patient. Many correctional nurses form a trusting therapeutic relationship with the prisoner years before the execution takes place. Therefore, if a nurse is prohibited from participating in a prisoner’s execution, even if they want to do so, then the standards set forth by the nursing organizations’ ethical codes force the nurse to violate the principle of fidelity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the controversy on the subject of executions and the involvement of nurses is not easily resolved. The question of whether a nurse should participate in the death penalty is often associated with the question of whether the death penalty is itself justified. The professional integrity of the nurse must be grounded in the basic fact of the patient’s deep vulnerability and the importance of maintaining the patient’s and the public’s trust. The correctional nurse’s participation in executions may be the difference between a humane death of a prisoner and a death that involves cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
