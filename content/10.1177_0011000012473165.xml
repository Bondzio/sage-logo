<abstract>
<p>The predoctoral relationship that counseling psychology programs have had with master’s programs over the decades is being challenged in current times. A model that is developing is one that provides greater responsibility for program definition and then full faculty engagement from doctoral program faculty. With change occurring in training models, economics, and political events, strategic planning and relevant mission development is essential for the viability of counseling psychology doctoral programs.</p>

<p>The presidential theme for the Society of Counseling Psychology for 2012-2013 is “Addressing Tomorrow’s Needs Today: Promotion, Prevention, and Beyond in Counseling Psychology.” The emphasis of the theme is to look ahead to understand the social-physical-emotional well-being needs of the future and to identify ways of preparing counseling psychologists to address those issues. Historically, counseling psychology has been identified as a doctoral-level specialty within the broader field of psychology. Today, though, it is clear that we, as counseling psychologists, working with other mental health providers such as counselors, psychiatrists, social workers, marriage and family therapists, and other psychological providers, will never have sufficient resources to provide for all of the mental health needs of all the persons in need in our nation, let alone in the world. Therefore, to meet the mission we have established of assisting others in healthy lifestyles, effective personal problem management, and managing stress and conflict, we need to examine our training and service delivery systems. This has to be undertaken as we recuperate from the worst economic recession of our lives and as we engage in public demands for greater assessment of our work and training and intensified levels of accountability for what we do. Thus, the need to examine our training models and how the models direct us in the future is paramount at this time, as “business as usual” is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Thanks to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012473165">Jackson and Scheel (2013)</xref> for their article examining the issues, assessing the current situation, and recommending directions for our field. My response to their article comes from two perspectives. First, as a member of the field, and second as a dean of a large college of education in a land-grant, research-extensive university.</p>
<p>I have been a member of the counseling profession since 1967, having been a member of the American Personnel and Guidance Association (APGA), which became the American Association for Counseling and Development (AACD), which then evolved into today’s American Counseling Association (ACA). I have also been a member of the counseling psychology profession, joining Division 17 in 1973. During those years, I have served in the role of counselor, therapist, training director, researcher, but with my strongest identity as an educator of counselors and counseling psychologists at the master’s and doctoral levels. I’ve seen a lot, and most has been good. We have had strong interprofessional alliances and engagements between counseling and counseling psychology and we have mutually gained through the years from the overlap of interests, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012473165">Jackson and Scheel (2013)</xref> have discussed in their article. We have traditionally had more similarities than differences, and the differences were generally handled in a collegial and professional manner. In the last few years that relationship has felt more challenging to me as the two professional areas have attempted to establish clearer professional identity recognition and greater autonomy and independence. Of course, we have enough critical need in the world for several mental health specialties to ply their professional efforts, but we seem to be in a period where a considerable amount of effort is going not to the service sector, but to conflicts between or among the professional groups. That serves as a loss to all, but particularly the populations we claim to care for and want to serve.</p>
<p>The developing Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) model that requires faculty members to be graduates of CACREP programs has been a major concern to me. While a number of counseling psychology programs preferred their faculty be from accredited counseling psychology programs, it was not an institutionalized policy of the accreditation process for American Psychological Association (APA). In fact, the three counseling psychology faculties on which I have served all had a collaborative mix of counseling psychology and counselor education faculty, and in each case it was professional, engaged, harmonious, and inviting. The exclusionary direction being taken—as an accreditation policy—by CACREP runs contrary to what has seemed to work so well for a long time. I personalize this because an area of focus for my career has been working to reduce violence and aggression in schools and families, and my doctoral students have traditionally been in the public K-12 schools from the beginning of their programs until the dissertation was completed. Many of them took positions in master’s programs—CACREP accredited—preparing counselors. Because our doctoral program is APA accredited, not CACREP, that occupational opportunity is closing for my students, and I am both regretful and angry about that development.</p>
<p>The second perspective, that of a dean of a large college (4,500 students), is influenced by the dramatically changing economy, political climate, and growing expectations about accountability. The budgets of most colleges have been impacted intensely in the last 5 years; mine has experienced more than 27% of state budgetary reductions and the cuts continue. Many faculty take the position that the economy is problematic but that we will “return to normal” in the near future when the economy is again robust. I’m convinced that is not going to happen, that what we are experiencing is likely to be the “new economy” for some years to come. There are a number of reasons, including increased social needs in other areas, such as health services, prison expansions, and local and national infrastructure needs, as well as the development of increased competition from alternative education models such as private and online academies, and even a questioning of the value of higher education as it has been practiced in recent years.</p>
<p>If this is the new era, and we are not going to have the opportunity of replenishing the budget to the former level in the near future, we have to examine whether to begin downsizing across the board—all programs receive the budgetary cuts as they come along—or if we are going to be strategic and begin reducing programs based on characteristics of the program. We have explored these questions, and it is becoming clear that with such dramatic cuts as have been sustained in recent years, it is critical that we consider reducing programs. But then how is that done? Is it by enrollments? By how many faculty may be retiring, thus opening the opportunity for program closure? Is it by a strategic plan based on visioning of the future and goals to accomplish the vision? By the college mission statement? In the case of counseling psychology doctoral programs, there can be several considerations:</p>
<list id="list1-0011000012473165" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Mission. Does the program’s mission correspond to the mission of the college? This requires consideration of the breadth of the college (teacher education emphasis? Broad educational emphasis, including adult, outreach, alternative, technology?) as well as the emphases of the program (psychotherapy? School counseling/engagement? Measurement/research?). A doctoral program with a mission incompatible with the goals and strategic plan of the college is unlikely to survive the current and ongoing financial crises.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Faculty–student ratio. Doctoral programs, particularly with an applied/clinical emphasis, are by nature quite expensive. The low faculty–student process requires extensive time in supervision and other engagement that is costly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Professional. Professional programs that go beyond educator preparation require engagement with professional organizations, accreditation, and commitment to supporting students for activities such as internships and licensing. There are also additional liability issues related to doctoral counseling psychology programs that are often not present with other programs. History of education majors seldom need professional liability insurance to do their academic work.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Quality. Is the program one of the best in the nation, and is it unique to the area? If not, the college has to examine the costs of supporting an expensive program that may not result in the national leadership required of doctoral programs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Research. Is the research current, viable, contributing to the research mission of the college? Is it fundable/funded? If a Research I institution, are grads placed in peer or aspirant research universities?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Students. Are students truly excited about the program, including having faculty serve as valuable role models and mentors? Is the program “climate” positive and one of collaboration and shared learning? Do students engage across programs to share their expertise?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Alumni. Do they support the continuance of the program?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Contribution to the state or community. If the institution is a public entity, does the program provide substantiation of the value of educating students in counseling psychology programs relative to the resources the state provides for salaries, graduate assistantships, and other educational perks?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reputation on campus. Is this a program that the campus cites as a model for academic/research programs on the campus?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012473165">Jackson and Scheel (2013)</xref> have pointed out that master’s degree programs may alleviate some of the issues listed. For example, most master’s programs enroll substantially more students than doctoral programs, and the programs are shorter in matriculation, thus allowing more students to go through the program more quickly. Also, most master’s programs do not provide the level of financial support—graduate assistantships—that doctoral programs do, and they do not require the intensity of research experiences and productivity expected of doctoral programs.</p>
<p>Master’s programs that are complementary to doctoral programs definitely may generate the counseling psychology program support that is needed. However, if master’s programs are not connected, engaged, or with a common core of orientation, philosophy, and clinical mission, then not only are they not complementary but they may also become competitive for resources and faculty.</p>
<p>Given the state of the situation today—the development of CACREP’s accreditation requirement of faculty being graduates of CACREP programs, the economy which has greatly reduced college budgets, a call for greater accountability of all programs and college graduates, and policy developments by legislators and public agencies—the importance of moving forward in the direction proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012473165">Jackson and Scheel (2013)</xref> is evident. While on one level, the creation and implementation of a new model for master’s degree program development, operation, and accreditation seems to be a distraction from the importance of doing the teaching, research, and service that is our mission, on another level, the time is right to examine how what has worked in the past no longer seems as relevant and functional and determine the most effective ways of remedying the problems. The time seems appropriate to consider seriously whether the development of a new model of master’s degree that complements the doctoral program is not only needed but is imperative as we move into newer models of training in counseling psychology.</p>
<p>The education and training standards of the Council of Applied Master’s Programs in Psychology (CAMPP) include training at the master’s level in the foundations in individual, biological, learned, and socio/cultural/systemic bases of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012473165">CAMPP, 1993</xref>). They have worked with other organizations to promote the Master’s in Counseling Accreditation Council (MCAC) and the Master’s in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council (MPCAC). The availability of an alternative accreditation process combined with a standards-based model for assessing the quality and effectiveness of a master’s program may provide counseling psychology with the direction needed to address the emerging crisis of master’s training. The new programs may also be more aligned with the requirements and expectations of doctoral programs, thus possibly making the process of moving from the master’s into the doctoral programs more efficient.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012473165">Jackson and Scheel (2013)</xref> pointed out that all 50 states now license master’s level counselors as independent practitioners. Many of those states indicate CACREP accreditation is desired for licensure, but many also allow other alternatives. As CAMPP and the MCAC/MPCAC become more prominent, better defined, and positively received by the profession, they are likely to serve as a major influence on counseling psychology program development over the coming years.</p>
<p>While it is critical that the master’s program educational experience and the relationship to doctoral programs be defined and developed, it is also equally important that we continue to explore the health and viability of our doctoral programs. The development of robust master’s programs that provide greater engagement with doctoral studies will be beneficial, but unless we also attend to the strength of our doctoral training, we could win support for a new master’s degree approach and still lose our doctoral emphasis unless we are certain that the programs meet the criteria of their respective colleges and universities and provide excellent complementarity. To accomplish this, we need to have effort put forth to explore the risk and protective factors relevant to each of our doctoral programs. This includes systematic review and revision, engagement of other interested parties, including deans, other program faculty, and constituents who use our graduates, to be certain we are viable and robust in these challenging times.</p>
<p>I suggest that we also extend our examination of possible complementary programs to the undergraduate level. Many doctoral program faculty offer some undergraduate preparation opportunities, ranging from a course or two to certificate programs, to undergraduate degrees in related areas, such as Life and Social Development. The more connected a doctoral program is to other programs—master’s, undergraduate, other college programs— the more relevant and necessary they will be to administrators.</p>
<p>Thanks to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012473165">Jackson and Scheel (2013)</xref> for their stimulating introduction to where we need to be going with our programs.</p>
