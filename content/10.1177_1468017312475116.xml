<p>This is a collection, published in the Contemporary Social Work Studies series, of some of Ian Shaw’s writings on social work research since 1976. The Introduction is new, and the final chapter of the 25 that follow it has not previously been published; all the rest, some co-authored, have appeared as academic journal articles or chapters in edited books. The 25 chapters are organised into five parts, each with a brief introduction. Five chapters appear under ‘Perspectives on social work research’, four under ‘Evaluation’, six under ‘Qualitative research’, and five each under ‘Research, theory and practice’ and ‘Service users and research’. The book is presumably intended as a ‘Best of Ian Shaw, 1976–2010’. Anyone interested in social work research will learn something useful from it, though more sign-posting would have helped them: it is difficult to imagine that anyone will read it from cover to cover, but it is not tightly enough indexed to serve as a reference book.</p>
<p>The interesting, frank and modest Introduction outlines Shaw’s career, which includes not only an impressive list of publications but entrepreneurial and organisational activity, including the co-founding of the journal <italic>Qualitative Social Work</italic> in 2002 and involvement in efforts to define social work research for the Economic and Social Research Council. Shaw declares himself ‘epistemologically constructivist and ontologically realist’ (p. 9), giving a brave and unfashionable justification in Christianity for the latter position. He argues that we should be wary of prioritising either research or practice, that practice is not easily separable from policy or from research, and that evaluation should be built into all social work practice. He wants ‘to decolonise the subordinate relationship of social work to social science, and hence liberate social work by placing it in an egalitarian and reciprocal relationship with sociology and cognate social science disciplines’ (p. 16).</p>
<p>Something of what this might mean is illustrated in Chapter 4 on ‘Re-reading <italic>The Jack-Roller</italic>’. This is one of the few chapters (the others are in Part 4) that present the substantive results of research rather than reflecting on how research might be conducted. The balance is deliberate: Shaw says in the Introduction that the pieces collected are about ‘position-taking’ rather than presenting research findings. But I found it a relief when, instead of discussions of social work research methodology or commentary on others’ discussions of the topic we were given some actual research results – in this case, a very interesting, and continuing, study of the status of sociology and social work in the writings of Chicago School scholars such as Clifford Shaw and Ernest Burgess. They assumed – contrary to what has sometimes been asserted in discussions of their pioneering sociology – that the two disciplines were necessarily interdependent. It is this kind of complementarity that Ian Shaw is interested in re-establishing.</p>
<p>Throughout, he writes clearly and organises his material helpfully. The classic pattern of his chapters is a statement of intent, followed by a presentation of the arguments, a statement of the ground covered, and a conclusion. He typically occupies the middle ground of debates, and in arguing for his positions he displays the considerable virtues of rationality, balance and scholarship. He disavows philosophical competence but is clearly widely read – enviably so – in relevant philosophy. All the same, he is content to regard some epistemological questions as not fully resolvable and to leave them to specialists to argue about, more than once citing Becker in this context – to the effect that ‘there’s nothing tragic’ about epistemological conflicts, and that they do not have to be resolved before any useful research can be done. I wish that PhD students in social work and related disciplines would heed Becker’s and Shaw’s advice on this, instead of worrying to excess about such issues, as in my experience they often do. With his practical, policy-oriented stance, Shaw could be expected to attend to postgraduate research in social work, and he does, but not (judging by this collection) as closely as he might have done. A great deal of the qualitative social work research done in this country is by PhD students, and it would have been interesting to read Shaw on what should be expected of them, and especially what they ought to write about in their ‘Methodology’ chapter.</p>
