<abstract>
<p>Family enterprise advisors work on complex and unique problems for their family enterprise clients. Little attention has been given to these professionals and their abilities to provide innovative solutions. In this study, our aim is to understand more about family enterprise advisors (<italic>N</italic> = 231). To achieve this objective, we hypothesize that the effects of advisor goal orientation (i.e., learning orientation, proving orientation, and avoidance orientation) on adaptive behaviors (i.e., personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior) are mediated by the quality of feedback received from clients. The results indicate that quality of feedback partially mediates the relationships between goal orientation and these behaviors. We conclude by providing a practitioner model explaining how advisors may adapt to different family enterprise client role environments.</p>

<body>
<p>Family enterprises are different from other businesses. Likewise, advisors and consultants who serve family enterprises face challenges that are distinct from those faced by other advisors and consultants. Though it is widely accepted that advisors play a crucial role within family enterprises (for an excellent overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486513484351">Strike, 2012</xref>), there is a dearth of academic research that focuses on the behavior and functioning of this group of stakeholders. This is curious given the valuable contributions advisors and consultants make to the sustainability of the vast family enterprise sector in countries across the globe. We address this shortcoming using survey data gathered from members of the Family Firm Institute (FFI). In particular, we are interested in understanding how FFI member advisors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0894486513484351">1</xref></sup> who work with family enterprises in a “formal” (rather than informal) capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486513484351">Strike, 2012</xref>) are able to adapt to the needs of these unique clients through the creative orchestration of personal resources (i.e., personal bricolage) and through the development of innovative responses (i.e., individual innovative behavior).</p>
<p>The roles played by advisors to family firms are complex and fluid for several reasons. First, the complex interaction of family, ownership, and management systems needs to be assessed, interpreted, and responded to appropriately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894486513484351">J. M. Goodman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0894486513484351">Mitchell, Morse, &amp; Sharma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486513484351">Strike, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0894486513484351">Tagiuri &amp; Davis, 1996</xref>). Second, the multigenerational involvement in some if not all of these systems adds an additional layer of complexity not found in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894486513484351">Bammens, Voordeckers, &amp; van Gils, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0894486513484351">Upton, Vinton, Seaman, &amp; Moore, 1993</xref>). Third, there is often an omnipresent founder, some who have long passed, whose powerful influence over the family and the business needs to be understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894486513484351">P. S. Davis &amp; Harveston, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486513484351">Jaffe &amp; Lane, 2004</xref>). Fourth, a culture of privacy and a tradition of secrecy within the family create barriers to trust that are difficult to penetrate in the short run and require higher levels of social skill in the long run as advisors engage with multiple stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894486513484351">Lester &amp; Cannella, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894486513484351">Levinson, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486513484351">Strike, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>For these reasons, creative uses of resources and personal innovative behaviors are likely to be very important for successful performance among family firm advisors. This group operates within a distinctively different client context, as indicated in a preponderance of the family business literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894486513484351">Chua, Chrisman, &amp; Sharma, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486513484351">Strike, 2012</xref>). Because of the intricate and varying role environment faced by these advisors, a “have-solution-will-travel” consulting model will often be inappropriate for servicing the needs of their clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894486513484351">Levinson, 1983</xref>). That is, because of the additional complexity introduced by the family system, each assignment has the potential to be vastly different and nuanced. Given the multifaceted role environment these advisors face, their assignment is likely to be changing and ambiguous, even more so than it would be in “mainstream” client–consultancy relationships. Accordingly, we suggest that the need for adaptation and innovation is greater in these environments than in traditional work settings and in traditional advisor–management relations.</p>
<p>Despite the acceptance that family firm advisors operate in a uniquely dynamic environment, there has been little research to determine how they manage this environment. In this article, we argue that family enterprise advising and consulting professionals need to generate high-quality feedback from clients and then use feedback as a resource for personal adaptability and innovation. Feedback is vital to any advisor–client relationship. Given the complicated nature (e.g., because of the concurrent interaction of family systems and business systems) of their family enterprise clients, advisors are likely to work in feedback environments that are more intricate and/or vague than in traditional job settings where feedback is provided by either supervisors or formal organizational reporting systems. We propose the success with which they generate feedback will affect how well they creatively combine and recombine resources, and the extent to which they are able to innovate their own roles.</p>
<p>To further enrich our understanding of how family enterprise advisors adapt to their complex role environment, we look to individual differences in goal orientation that have the potential to explain how diverse advisors take differing approaches to their work. Comprising three relatively stable dimensions (i.e., <italic>learning</italic> orientation, <italic>proving</italic> orientation, and <italic>avoidance</italic> orientation), goal orientation is an established construct that distinguishes how individuals develop or demonstrate ability in achievement settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894486513484351">DeShon &amp; Gillespie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486513484351">VandeWalle &amp; Cummings, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Our research question, therefore, can be stated in two parts:</p>
<list id="list1-0894486513484351" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>In the context of family enterprise advisors, (a) how do individual predispositions toward goal accomplishment (goal orientation) affect the acquisition of quality feedback from clients and (b) how does this in turn affect adaptive behaviors such as personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Our motivation in this research is not to compare the community of family enterprise advisors with other advisors. Rather, we intend to use the constructs of goal orientation, feedback environment, personal bricolage, and individual innovative behavior to appreciate how family enterprise advisors function.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows: We explain how personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior are adaptive behaviors useful for coping with complicated role environments. We then describe the importance of feedback as a valuable resource that advisors often seek in environments that require adaptation. We link advisor goal orientation to the acquisition of quality feedback from clients and hypothesize that quality feedback mediates the relationships between the three dimensions of advisor goal orientation (learning, proving, and avoidance) and advisor adaptive behaviors (personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior). Next, we report our empirical examination of how individual differences in goal orientation affect the acquisition of quality feedback from clients, and subsequent advisor adaptive behaviors (personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior), as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894486513484351">Figure 1</xref>. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of our results and avenues for further research.</p>

<title>Literature Review and Hypothesis Development</title>
<p>To answer our research questions, we draw from broader theoretical perspectives used by scholars to study how individuals proactively manage their own work roles. For instance, recent perspectives on work design emphasize that individuals can be proactive in defining the nature and boundaries of their work roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894486513484351">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>). In many work settings, individuals are required to adapt to rapidly changing role requirements. Accordingly, research on individual performance has evolved such that researchers are interested in not only task performance but also how individuals self-manage, creatively use, reconfigure, and recombine available resources and are innovative in their approach to personal role management.</p>
<p>A separate but related stream of literature asserts individuals can proactively manage the feedback environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894486513484351">Ashford, Blatt, &amp; VandeWalle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894486513484351">Ashford &amp; Cummings, 1983</xref>). From this viewpoint, feedback is not something that is simply provided by supervisors and organizational reporting systems. Rather, individuals make conscious decisions about which feedback resources are needed and proactively monitor and/or seek feedback from others. Advisors to family enterprises work in environments that encourage, and likely require, them to manage their own feedback environment and to innovate their personal work roles.</p>

<title>Personal Bricolage, Individual Innovative Behavior, and the Role of Feedback</title>
<p><italic>Personal bricolage</italic> involves creatively combining and recombining existing resources for the purpose of goal accomplishment. More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894486513484351">Baker and Nelson (2005)</xref> define bricolage as “making do by applying combinations of the resources at hand to new problems and opportunities” (p. 334). These authors identify three primary elements of bricolage. First, bricolage represents a bias toward action and active engagement with problems or opportunities. Pivotal to bricolage is a willingness to experiment with new ways to accomplish goals without worrying about whether they have the “right” tools, resources, or skills at hand. Put simply, bricolage involves trying to find ways of addressing new challenges. A second element of bricolage is a reliance on “the resources at hand,” which includes resources already controlled and those that are freely or cheaply available. Finally, bricolage involves “the combination of resources for new purposes,” which is more than simply conserving resources and reusing resources for their original purposes. Rather, it involves the creative recombination of resources toward purposes for which they were not originally intended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894486513484351">Hmieleski &amp; Corbett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486513484351">Senyard, Baker, &amp; Davidsson, in press</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Individual innovative behavior</italic> occurs when individuals purposefully introduce and implement new ideas, procedures, products, or processes in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0894486513484351">Yuan &amp; Woodman, 2010</xref>). Innovation has similarities with creative behavior in that it involves the creation of new ideas. However, it is distinct in that it also involves the <italic>implementation</italic> of new ideas. Implementation may require a number of related behaviors, such as acquiring resources, applying new work methods, altering work routines, or persuading other actors within an organization to alter their behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0894486513484351">Scott &amp; Bruce, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0894486513484351">Yuan &amp; Woodman, 2010</xref>). In our study, we investigate the role that feedback plays as a personal resource useful for adaptation and the role that personal goal orientation (i.e., learning, proving, avoidance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894486513484351">Brett &amp; VandeWalle, 1999</xref>) plays in the acquisition of the feedback resource. We argue that high-quality feedback from clients is a personal resource that advisors can use for personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior.</p>
<p><italic>Feedback quality</italic> is the extent to which feedback provides information to its recipient that is helpful for (a) understanding how well one is doing one’s work and (b) improving performance. Feedback in work settings is vital to optimum performance. As such, the feedback environment in which work is conducted can be one of the most powerful factors affecting how individuals react to performance situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486513484351">Cusella, 1987</xref>). In the context of our research, quality feedback can be a useful personal resource for advisors for several reasons. First, feedback signaling a gap between current performance and performance goals can lead to greater motivation and more focused efforts to achieve goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894486513484351">Locke &amp; Latham, 1990</xref>). Second, it provides information useful for correcting inappropriate task strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486513484351">Ilgen, Fisher, &amp; Taylor, 1979</xref>), especially when it is more specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894486513484351">W. D. Davis, Carson, Ammeter, &amp; Treadway, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894486513484351">J. S. Goodman, Wood, &amp; Hendrickx, 2004</xref>) and of higher quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0894486513484351">Steelman, Levy, &amp; Snell, 2004</xref>). Third, feedback reduces uncertainty about how well (or poorly) one is performing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894486513484351">Ashford, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894486513484351">Ashford &amp; Cummings, 1983</xref>). Because uncertainty can often distract individuals from performing their duties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894486513484351">Kanfer &amp; Ackerman, 1989</xref>), quality feedback that reduces uncertainty can lead to more efficient strategies for accomplishing goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894486513484351">Kanfer &amp; Ackerman, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that feedback is an important personal resource for accomplishing work-related tasks and for fulfilling work role expectations, individuals are often motivated to seek feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894486513484351">Ashford, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894486513484351">Ashford et al., 2003</xref>). Individuals are proactive managers of their feedback environment and can seek or generate their own feedback when it is not provided by some external source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894486513484351">Ashford &amp; Cummings, 1983</xref>). In other words, individuals do not just passively wait to receive feedback from their environment, but rather they proactively pursue performance-related information. Feedback seeking can be accomplished by simply observing the reactions of others or by actively inquiring from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894486513484351">Ashford, 1986</xref>). The quality of feedback is becoming increasingly important, as many work environments lack immediate and specific feedback while requiring individuals to rely on their own judgment to determine the requirements of the job and how these requirements can be fulfilled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0894486513484351">Neck &amp; Manz, 1996</xref>). We argue that feedback plays a significant role in the adaptive behaviors of family firm advisors.</p>

<sec id="section3-0894486513484351">
<title>Goal Orientation, Feedback Quality, and Adaptive Behavior</title>
<p><italic>Goal orientation</italic> comprises three dimensions: <italic>learning</italic> orientation, <italic>proving</italic> orientation, and <italic>avoidance</italic> orientation. These are relatively stable predispositions toward developing or demonstrating one’s own ability in achievement settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894486513484351">DeShon &amp; Gillespie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486513484351">VandeWalle &amp; Cummings, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Learning</italic> orientation arises from a belief that increased effort can lead to learning, increased ability, and better performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894486513484351">Dweck, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486513484351">VandeWalle, Cron, &amp; Slocum, 2001</xref>). Persons high in learning orientation are motivated to learn new competencies in a task, and focus their attention on the refinement of existing skills or the development of new skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894486513484351">Brett &amp; VandeWalle, 1999</xref>). In work environments that require a great deal of self-management, learning orientation is often a strong predictor of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894486513484351">Fisher &amp; Ford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0894486513484351">Porath &amp; Bateman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0894486513484351">Seijts, Latham, Tasa, &amp; Latham, 2004</xref>). Importantly, the positive impact of learning orientation on performance is likely because of (a) its effect on feedback seeking and (b) its effect on task strategies.</p>
<p>Persons high in learning orientation place a high value on feedback and are more proactive feedback seekers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486513484351">VandeWalle &amp; Cummings, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486513484351">VandeWalle et al., 2001</xref>). They engage in feedback seeking because they see feedback as useful for developing skills and improving performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486513484351">VandeWalle &amp; Cummings, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486513484351">VandeWalle et al., 2001</xref>). They not only seek out more information but also are more likely to seek the type of feedback information that will help them develop new skills. On receiving feedback, these individuals are likely to stay focused on task learning rather than focused on their own performance relative to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486513484351">VandeWalle et al., 2001</xref>). There is also evidence that persons high in learning orientation are actually less dependent on the provision of feedback from external sources such as supervisors, coworkers, or formal feedback systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894486513484351">W. D. Davis et al., 2005</xref>). They are likely to be better able to generate their own feedback and take a more proactive approach in acquiring feedback that is actually useful to them as a resource, which subsequently can be used for adaptation. Thus, we expect that even when there is little feedback available from others, family firm advisors with high learning orientation are better able to compensate for this by generating their own insight and will ultimately have higher quality feedback available to them.</p>
<p>Family businesses provide additional challenges to gathering feedback, as they operate at the complex intersection of family, ownership, and the business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486513484351">Strike, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0894486513484351">Tagiuri &amp; Davis, 1996</xref>). Given the close association of the family with the firm built over many years, even decades, family members have strong deep-rooted perspectives, which manifest in emotional commitment and the use of a distinctive communication medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894486513484351">Aldrich &amp; Cliff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894486513484351">Arregle, Hitt, Sirmon, &amp; Very, 2007</xref>). This form of social bonding is distinctive to each family and is a key contributor to the development of unwritten, but shared, understanding among actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894486513484351">Danes, 2011</xref>). As much of the knowledge is protected by the family, and is intentionally difficult to access, we suggest that family enterprise advisors will often find it more difficult to acquire high-quality feedback from their clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486513484351">Strike, 2012</xref>) and will need to be more proactive in their approach to gathering feedback. Advisors high in learning orientation will distinguish themselves in their willingness to proactively learn the unique nuances of the family enterprise client context by acquiring high-quality feedback.</p>
<list id="list2-0894486513484351" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: For family enterprise advisors, learning orientation is positively related to feedback quality.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Learning orientation also affects the approach that individuals take toward improving work performance. Persons high in learning orientation are more likely to observe and analyze their own task strategies and to experiment with alternative ways in order to improve these task strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894486513484351">Steele-Johnson, Beauregard, Hoover, &amp; Schmidt, 2000</xref>). In situations where the development of new skills is necessary to improve work performance, learning-oriented individuals engage in more “elaboration” of task strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894486513484351">Fisher &amp; Ford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894486513484351">Steele-Johnson et al., 2000</xref>). Elaboration is an effort to develop new schemas for accomplishing work. New schemas are developed by experimenting with new ways of doing things. This elaboration or experimentation leads to the development of new task strategies and learning from failures in an attempt to adjust task strategies. In the long run, elaboration explains why persons high in learning orientation often perform better in learning and training settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894486513484351">Fisher &amp; Ford, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Family business advisors function in complex role environments, which have their origins in relationship conflicts among members of the owning family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894486513484351">Eddleston &amp; Kellermanns, 2007</xref>). In such complex role environments, learning orientation is likely to lead to more innovation of one’s work role, as well as more creative use of existing resources (i.e., personal bricolage). Evidence to support this is presented in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894486513484351">Hirst, Van Knippenberg, and Zhou (2009)</xref>, which found that learning orientation was positively related to creativity. We propose that quality feedback also plays an important role in the processes of personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior. In other words, persons high in learning orientation are better able to engage in personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior because they acquire higher quality feedback. Accordingly, we propose that the effect of learning orientation on personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior is mediated by the quality of feedback family advisors receive from their clients.</p>

</list>
<p>Research indicates that advisors often choose different approaches to managing their relationships with clients (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486513484351">Strike, 2012</xref>). For example, some family advisors attempt to avoid interpersonal relationships with the family in order to not become entangled in family dynamics, such as being an intermediary among conflicting members of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486513484351">White, 2007</xref>). This may enable the family advisors to focus more on completing the business-related assignment than having their efforts distracted by family members competing for their time. In our study, we argue that personality traits, such as proving and avoidance orientation, may play a role in determining advisors’ decisions about how they engage with family enterprise clients, especially with respect to the feedback they acquire from clients.</p>
<p><italic>Proving</italic> orientation and <italic>avoidance</italic> orientation arise from a personal belief that personal ability is unlikely to change because it is relatively stable and perhaps even innate. Thus, personal ability is difficult to develop via learning new task strategies or through increased effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894486513484351">Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894486513484351">Elliot &amp; Harackiewicz; 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486513484351">VandeWalle et al., 2001</xref>). Persons high in <italic>proving</italic> orientation attempt to demonstrate task competence and gain favorable judgments from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486513484351">VandeWalle, 1997</xref>). Persons high in <italic>avoidance</italic> orientation seek to avoid the demonstration of low ability and the unfavorable judgments that might arise from poor performance. These attributes of proving and avoidance orientation are likely to affect how advisors acquire feedback from clients.</p>
<p>Because persons high in proving and avoidance orientations tend to believe that performance is based on innate ability, they often view feedback as simply an evaluation of that innate ability. They are interested in feedback that tells them how well they are performing relative to others (i.e., outcome feedback) rather than feedback that tells them how to improve their performance (i.e., process feedback). Accordingly, these individuals may be more self-focused than task-focused following feedback—concerned more with how they perform relative to others than with using the feedback as a resource for performance improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486513484351">Kluger &amp; DeNisi, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486513484351">VandeWalle et al., 2001</xref>). We would not expect them to acquire the type of high-quality feedback needed for personal bricolage or individual innovative behavior. Thus, we anticipate family advisors who have a proving or avoidance orientation will be less likely to seek out feedback from their family enterprise clients.</p>
<list id="list4-0894486513484351" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: For family enterprise advisors, proving orientation is negatively related to feedback quality.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: For family enterprise advisors, avoidance orientation is negatively related to feedback quality.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Proving and avoidance orientations also affect the approach individuals take to performance improvement. Proving and avoidance orientations often lead to “rehearsal” of task strategies rather than elaboration of task strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894486513484351">Fisher &amp; Ford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894486513484351">Steele-Johnson et al., 2000</xref>). Rehearsal simply involves practicing an existing task strategy rather than trying to learn new task strategies. Rehearsal is a simpler learning strategy that involves less cognitive effort. It is unlikely to lead to the learning of new procedural knowledge. As persons high in performance orientation view high effort as a reflection of low ability, they will use rehearsal strategies to minimize effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894486513484351">Fisher &amp; Ford, 1998</xref>). If the existing task strategy is appropriate, then rehearsal will likely lead to performance improvement over time. On the other hand, if the existing task strategy is incorrect or needs refinement, then rehearsal will simply reinforce an inappropriate approach to task accomplishment.</p>
<p>When work strategies need adjustment, elaboration is required to gain new procedural knowledge. In complex role environments, which are the purview of family business advisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486513484351">Strike, 2012</xref>), persons high in proving orientation or avoidance orientation are less likely to engage in innovation and less likely to creatively use or recombine resources. Furthermore, expected image risks associated with innovative behavior are likely to lead to lower personal innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0894486513484351">Yuan &amp; Woodman, 2010</xref>). As persons high in avoidance or proving orientation tend to be more concerned with personal image, it seems likely that they would perceive innovative behavior as more risky, and would in turn be less likely to engage in such behavior. Advisors high in avoidance or proving orientation may be concerned about the impact of failure on their professional reputation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0894486513484351">Nicholson, Shepherd, and Woods (2010)</xref> discovered that professional reputation was one of the key attributes considered by families when hiring a family enterprise advisor. Adaptive behaviors such as bricolage and innovation carry greater risks, as they may lead to failure, resulting in a diminished professional reputation. To avoid these risks, family enterprise advisors who are high on either proving or avoidance orientation may be more likely to implement existing approaches to solving a client’s problem rather than engaging in new and more effective approaches. Furthermore, these advisors may also be reluctant to seek feedback for fear of injuring their professional reputation. Accordingly, we expect advisors high in proving or avoidance orientation will be less likely to acquire feedback for the purposes of bricolage or innovative behavior:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0894486513484351">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data were collected through an online questionnaire following the procedures articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894486513484351">Dillman, Smyth, and Christian (2009)</xref>. In association with the FFI, we drew on a potential sample of 1,700 FFI members. According to the FFI website, “The Family Firm Institute is the leading membership association worldwide for professionals serving the family enterprise field. It provides a global forum for practitioners, academics and others to acquire multidisciplinary knowledge while engaging in collaborative opportunities.” Invitations to participate in the study were disseminated to members via a weekly newsletter and personalized e-mail. Of the approximately 1,700 invitations delivered, we received 314 mostly completed responses, for a response rate of approximately 18.5%. Testing for the effects associated with nonresponse bias, we found no differences between the responses of early (first-wave) respondents and late (last-wave) respondents for any of the study’s hypothesized variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894486513484351">Kanuk &amp; Berenson, 1975</xref>). The FFI serves practitioners who specialize in working with family enterprises, as well as academics studying family enterprises. Our interest is in the role of practitioners who engage primarily in an advisory practice with family enterprises. As such, our hypotheses were only tested using the subsample of self-identified family advisors (<italic>n</italic> = 253).</p>
<p>Of the 253 mostly completed responses, 159 (63%) were from males and 93 (37%) were from females. The mean age of respondents was 53 years, with the youngest being 22 and the oldest 79. Whites/Caucasians was the largest reported ethnic group (<italic>n</italic> = 205), followed by Hispanics (<italic>n</italic> = 33). Overall, respondents were very well educated, with a majority having a master’s degree (<italic>n</italic> = 129), closely followed by bachelor’s degree (<italic>n</italic> = 62) and doctoral degree (<italic>n</italic> = 52). Respondent’s primary occupation consisted of being a family enterprise consultant (<italic>n</italic> = 96), a family enterprise advisor (<italic>n</italic> = 66), a family wealth advisor (<italic>n</italic> = 28), a family wealth consultant (<italic>n</italic> = 15), and other (<italic>n</italic> = 42). Most respondents were self-employed (<italic>n</italic> = 135), with an average of 14 years of work experience with the same company or being self-employed.</p>
<p>The use of a single questionnaire to measure both our independent and dependent variables at one time leads to the potential for common method bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0894486513484351">Podsakoff &amp; Organ, 1986</xref>). To alleviate concerns regarding common method bias, we implemented certain procedures in our research design, and we conducted analyses to gauge common method effects. First, we offered our respondents anonymity/confidentiality to diminish the probability of socially desirable responding. Second, respondents were informed that there were no right or wrong answers and were asked to answer the questions truthfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0894486513484351">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>). Third, in our questionnaire design, we proximally separated the independent and dependent variables to reduce the potential effects of common method bias, as well as self-generated validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894486513484351">Lee &amp; Sukoco, 2010</xref>). Third, we subjected all items in our study to a factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0894486513484351">Podsakoff &amp; Organ, 1986</xref>), testing for the dimensionality of the data. If a general factor accounting for more than half of the variance emerged, then this could suggest common method bias might affect our results. Using an unrotated principal components factor analysis, the factor analysis produced nine factors, with the first factor accounting for only 23% of the 65% explained variance. Last, with guidance from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0894486513484351">Podsakoff et al. (2003)</xref>, a two-phased confirmatory factor analysis was employed to gauge the differences in explained variance between (a) an analysis with the studied latent constructs and (b) the studied latent factor, along with a latent single common method factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486513484351">Carlson &amp; Kacmar, 2000</xref>). The factor analysis with the common method factor accounted for only 5.8% additionally explained variance compared with the latent factor model consisting of only of the studied constructs—5.8% is well short of the critical threshold of 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0894486513484351">Williams, Cote, &amp; Buckley, 1989</xref>). These results indicate that the effects of common method bias were limited in this study.</p>

<title>Measures</title>

<title>Personal Bricolage</title>
<p>Bricolage is creatively combining and recombining existing resources for the purpose of goal accomplishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894486513484351">Baker &amp; Nelson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894486513484351">Hmieleski &amp; Corbett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486513484351">Senyard et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486513484351">Vera, 2002</xref>). In our study, the individual’s ability to accomplish goals through creatively combining and recombining existing resources is of interest. To investigate this, we modified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486513484351">Senyard et al.’s (in press)</xref> bricolage scale to the individual level of analysis. This eight-item scale was selected over other scales (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894486513484351">Hmieleski &amp; Corbett, 2006</xref>), as it exclusively focuses on the indicators of bricolage behaviors.</p>

<sec id="section9-0894486513484351">
<title>Individual Innovative Behavior</title>
<p>We used a six-item innovative behavior scale adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0894486513484351">Scott and Bruce (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0894486513484351">Yuan and Woodman (2010)</xref>. In their research, these scholars asked supervisors to rank their subordinates on this scale.

<sec id="section10-0894486513484351">
<title>Quality of Feedback</title>
<p>We selected a five-item scale capturing feedback quality drawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0894486513484351">Steelman et al.’s (2004)</xref> broader feedback environment scale. The feedback environment scale originally captured feedback quality from supervisors and coworkers. As we were solely interested in the quality of the feedback being derived by the respondent from the family enterprise client, we modified this scale to include phrasing such as “<italic>My clients</italic> give me useful feedback about my job performance” or “I value the feedback I receive <italic>from clients</italic>.” A high score on this scale indicates that the feedback received from clients was viewed by the advisor as helpful for understanding and improving performance. Lower scores indicate that the advisor did not perceive feedback from the clients to be as useful.</p>

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>To validate the scales through confirmatory factor analysis and test the hypothesized relationships, structural equation modeling (SEM) using LISREL 8.52 was used. Although the primary statistical approach to test for mediation is hierarchical regression modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486513484351">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>), this study followed the logic and recommendations of other scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894486513484351">James, Mulaik, &amp; Brett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894486513484351">MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, &amp; Sheets, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0894486513484351">Schneider, Ehrhart, Mayer, Saltz, &amp; Niles-Jolly, 2005</xref>) and used SEM to test Hypotheses 3, 7, and 9. When applying SEM to mediation, two models (i.e., a partially mediated model and a fully mediated model) must be individually tested and the resulting chi-square values compared to indicate whether full mediation occurs. If no statistical difference exists between the resulting chi-square values, the more parsimonious, fully mediated model would be selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0894486513484351">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>For the second part of the confirmatory process, an unconstrained six-factor model was compared with a six-factor constrained model (i.e., baseline model), in which the paths in the Φ matrix were set to 1. A series of sequential chi-square models revealed that the unconstrained model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 849.87, degrees of freedom [<italic>df</italic>] = 449; CFI = .95; Δ<sup>2</sup> = .95; RMSEA = .062; SRMR = .068) demonstrated a significantly better fit than the constrained six-factor model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2933.17, <italic>df</italic> = 464; CFI = .77; Δ<sup>2</sup> = .77; RMSEA = .15; SRMR = .13) based on the chi-square difference test (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 2083.30, <italic>df</italic> = 15; <italic>p &lt;</italic> .05<italic>)</italic>.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the loadings ranged from a low of .51 to a high of .87 and were all statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), indicating convergent validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894486513484351">Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894486513484351">Gerbing &amp; Anderson, 1992</xref>). Discriminant validity would reveal evidence of the squared intercorrelations between constructs being less than the average variance extracted (AVE) for each construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894486513484351">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>). Squared intercorrelations were less than the AVE for the respective constructs supporting discriminant validity. Although the AVE for personal bricolage (AVE = .48) was slightly less than the recommended .50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894486513484351">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>), the AVEs for the remainder of the measures were at or greater than .50, which was greater than the recommended threshold.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to hypothesis testing, we considered the impact that the respondent demographic characteristics may have on the results. Specifically, we tested for differences in personal bricolage, individual innovative behavior, learning orientation, proving orientation, avoidance orientation, and quality of feedback based on the demographic variables of respondent gender, age, ethnicity, education, and advisory/consultant role. We found no significant relationships between the demographic variables and the measurements in our model, suggesting that these demographic attributes should not confound our results.</p>
<p>The model fit statistics for the partially mediated model (i.e., fully saturated model) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894486513484351">Table 3</xref>. The chi-square statistic was significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 633.52, <italic>df</italic> = 411; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) suggesting that the data did not fit the model well, though this measure is often influenced by sample size and larger correlations in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894486513484351">Kelloway, 1998</xref>). Given these concerns, we considered other model fit indices, such as CFI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486513484351">Bentler, 1990</xref>), Δ<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894486513484351">Bollen, 1989</xref>), RMSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894486513484351">MacCallum, Browne, &amp; Sugawara, 1996</xref>), and SRMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894486513484351">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1998</xref>). Based on these fit indices, the model fits the data well (CFI = .97; Δ<sup>2</sup> = .97; RMSEA = .049; SRMR = .062), and the individual paths of the structural model may be examined. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894486513484351">Figure 2</xref>, Hypothesis 1, which stated that learning orientation should be positively related to quality of feedback, was supported (γ = .27; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). For Hypothesis 4, support (γ = −.20; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) was found for proving orientation to be negatively related to quality of feedback; however, Hypothesis 5 was not supported (γ = .06; <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), with avoidance orientation not being negatively related to quality of feedback. A summary of the results for each hypothesis can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0894486513484351">Table 4</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Hypotheses 2a and 2b articulated a direct and positive relationship from learning orientation to the dependent variables of personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior. Support was found for an effect of learning orientation on personal bricolage (γ = .37; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and on individual innovative behavior (γ = .47; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Contrary to Hypotheses 6a and 6b, proving orientation was positively related to personal bricolage (γ = .20; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and to individual innovative behavior (γ = .16; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). For Hypotheses 8a and 8b, the findings were mixed, with Hypothesis 8a (i.e., avoidance orientation is negatively related to personal bricolage) accepted (γ = −.20; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and Hypothesis 8b (i.e., avoidance orientation is negatively related to individual innovative behavior) rejected (γ = −.07; <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>Hypotheses 3a, 3b, 7a, 7b, 9a, and 9b posited that the quality of feedback would mediate the relationships between the dimensions of goal orientation (learning, proving, avoidance) and adaptive behaviors (bricolage and innovative behavior). For mediation to be present, the goal orientation subdimensions of learning orientation, proving orientation, and avoidance orientation should have a direct linkage to the quality of feedback construct. With the exception of avoidance orientation, learning and proving orientations had significant relationships to quality of feedback. However, the goal orientation subdimensions should not have a statistically significant direct relationship to the corresponding variables of personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior, only an indirect significant relationship through quality of feedback.</p>
<p>To test this approach, a partially mediated model (i.e., fully saturated model; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894486513484351">Table 3</xref>) was compared with a fully mediated model through a chi-square difference test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486513484351">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894486513484351">Brown, 1997</xref>). In the partially mediated model, the goal orientation subdimension of learning orientation had a direct and significant positive relationship with personal bricolage (γ = .37; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and with individual innovative behavior (γ = .47; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Similarly, proving orientation had a significant positive relationship with both personal bricolage (γ = .20; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and individual innovative behavior (γ = .16; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Avoidance orientation did have a significant negative relationship with personal bricolage (γ = −.20; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), though it did not have a significant relationship with individual innovative behavior (γ = −.07; <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>The fully mediated model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 691.69, <italic>df</italic> = 417, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; CFI = .96; Δ<sup>2</sup> = .96; RMSEA = .054; SRMR = .12) did not fit the data as well as the partially mediated model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 633.52, <italic>df</italic> = 411, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; CFI = .97; Δ<sup>2</sup> = .97; RMSEA = .049; SRMR = .062). The chi-square difference test (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 58.17, <italic>df</italic> = 6 <italic>p &lt;</italic> .05) indicated that the partially mediated model fit the data better than the fully mediated model.</p>
<p>Though full mediation is not present, the results do imply the possible presence of partial mediation, with significant relationships from learning orientation to feedback quality and proving orientation to feedback quality. To test for partial mediation, the indirect effects of learning orientation to personal bricolage quality of feedback were assessed. The results indicate that learning orientation (γ = .09; <italic>t</italic> = 2.73; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) had a significant indirect relationship to personal bricolage through quality of feedback, supporting partial mediation. Similarly, learning orientation (γ = .09; <italic>t</italic> = 2.60; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) had a significant indirect relationship to individual innovative behavior through quality of feedback.</p>
<p>Evidence of negative partial mediation through quality of feedback was found for proving orientation to personal bricolage (γ = −.06; <italic>t</italic> = −2.21; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and to individual innovative behavior (γ = −.06; <italic>t</italic> = −2.15; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In effect, quality of feedback only partially mediated the relationship of learning orientation to personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior. Comparably, proving orientation to personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior relationships were negatively partially mediated. Given these findings, quality of feedback does not fully mediate the goal orientation to individual innovative behavior or personal bricolage relationships, so Hypotheses 3a, 3b, 7a, and 7b were partially supported, with 9a and 9b not supported. Though the hypotheses for full mediation were rejected, empirical support was found for the direct relationship of quality of feedback to personal bricolage (β = .26; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and to individual innovative behavior (β = .24; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<p>Professional family enterprise advisors assist families in dealing with a range of complex problems, many of which are unique to the family enterprise sector. Given the existence of, and the influential role played by, the family system, most problems are, to an extent, idiosyncratic to the particular family enterprise client. As such, these professionals are required to operate differently than they would in the nonfamily business arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894486513484351">Levinson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486513484351">Strike, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, given the nature of the family stakeholders with whom they are dealing, it is likely that family enterprise advisors work in environments where the quality of the feedback from their clients is variable, which increases the potential for task (and outcome) uncertainty. This study attempted to facilitate a better understanding of this vital support group to family enterprises. Our findings enable us to offer several observations.</p>
<p>First, the results of our study suggest that family enterprise advisors who have a strong learning orientation will be more likely to acquire feedback from their family enterprise clients. Likewise, these family enterprise advisors are more likely to exhibit behaviors of personal bricolage and individual innovativeness. Importantly, the generation of quality feedback from clients positively enhances how advisors are able to adapt by innovatively recombining their resources. However, an interesting finding of this study is that there was a direct relationship between learning orientation and the individual behaviors of personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior. This would suggest that although feedback is important, the effect of learning orientation on these behaviors is not completely explained by quality feedback.</p>
<p>Second, proving orientation did not exhibit a negative link with adaptive behaviors. The literature would suggest that there should be a negative relationship between proving orientation and the behaviors we examined. Instead, a positive relationship was observed. This positive relationship is surprising, as the proving orientation was negatively linked to the quality of feedback, as theory would suggest. The quality of feedback acted as a partial negative mediator to advisors’ adaptive behaviors. Advisors high in proving orientation who received quality feedback reported diminished ability to adapt by innovatively recombining resources. Conversely, with less feedback, advisors who are proving oriented were positively linked with increased behaviors associated with being bricoleurs and innovators. This finding may be a function of the type of feedback acquired. For instance, persons high in proving orientation often seek out outcome feedback and not process feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486513484351">VandeWalle et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, our results indicated that advisors with either a learning orientation or a proving orientation are more likely to engage in adaptive behaviors compared with those high in avoidance orientation. For avoidance orientation, an interesting finding was observed. Although advisors high in avoidance orientation did in fact engage in less adaptive behaviors, this effect could not be explained by the quality of feedback they acquired, as there was no relationship between avoidance orientation and feedback quality. Avoidance orientation is the desire to avoid the demonstration of low ability and the resulting unfavorable judgments associated with poor performance. Persons high in this orientation often avoid challenging roles out of a desire to avoid being critiqued. A similar process may explain why they were less likely to engage in adaptive behaviors, as adaptation involves some risk that the newly adopted behaviors will be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Overall, this research provides multiple contributions to what we know about family enterprise advisors. Our findings advance the bricolage literature at the individual level and integrate this with other individual level theories of work performance. For instance, the work design literature increasingly emphasizes that individuals can be proactive in defining the nature and boundaries of their work roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894486513484351">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>). The literature on feedback seeking emphasizes that individuals often seek out performance-related information as a personal resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894486513484351">Ashford et al., 2003</xref>). In this project, we proposed that personal bricolage may be based in part on individuals’ ability to acquire and to use feedback in order to be more innovative as they design their own work roles. The results of our study support existing literature showing that feedback plays an important role in work performance, and advance our understanding of how feedback is used in work environments that require adaptivity. In addition, this research extends our understanding of how individuals are able to work on their own. Specifically, our results provide a better appreciation of how individuals self-manage, creatively use, reconfigure, and recombine available resources through personal bricolage and how individual innovative behaviors are applied to personal role management.</p>
<p>In the family enterprise context, the findings from this study improve our perspective on how family enterprise advisors respond to feedback from family enterprise clients. Put simply, advisors who have a learning orientation are more likely to generate quality feedback that enhances their ability to recombine their resources innovatively. Conversely, an advisor who exhibits a proving orientation may seek a minimum amount of feedback, which would increase the importance of feedback that is actually provided by members of the family enterprise.</p>
<p>Also, family enterprise advisors who have a proving orientation may still be effective, even in family enterprises that have a culture of privacy or a tradition of secrecy. Family enterprises have often been characterized as having barriers that are difficult to penetrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894486513484351">Lester &amp; Cannella, 2006</xref>). Family enterprises that consider their enterprise to be “closed” may be better served by advisors who are more proving oriented than learning or avoidance oriented. Advisors who have a proving orientation are often characterized as attempting to demonstrate task competence and to gain favorable judgments from their clients. They may desire little quality feedback to strengthen their ability to be innovative and to use the existing resources around them.</p>
<p>Advisors who have a learning orientation may be less dependent on quality feedback from their family enterprise clients. Advisors with a learning orientation are more likely to observe and to analyze their own task strategies, as well as to experiment with alternative ways to improve task strategies through personal bricolage and individual innovative behaviors. However, family enterprises that engage advisors should strive to provide high feedback quality by engendering trust with family enterprise executives and greater inclusion in family enterprise decisions. If a family enterprise is seeking adaptive problem solving from their advisor and willing to provide quality feedback, then they should focus on hiring advisors with a learning goal orientation.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The results of our study indicate that both feedback and goal orientation can have a positive role to play in the advisor–client relationship and that feedback may be the mechanism that links learning and proving orientation to adaptive behaviors. Although our study treated goal orientation as a relatively stable personality trait, there is evidence that individuals can adopt one goal orientation or another depending on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894486513484351">Stevens &amp; Gist, 1997</xref>). Individuals may be predisposed to have one orientation or the other, but advisors are often adept at choosing their own approaches to goal accomplishment. Advisors may choose to pursue either a learning approach or a proving approach to meeting client needs. From a practitioner standpoint, the following questions may arise: (a) When and how might an advisor choose to adopt a learning orientation as opposed to a proving orientation? (b) What kinds of feedback-seeking behaviors are more likely to lead to the high-quality feedback needed to successfully execute an advising relationship?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions are likely to depend on the complexity of the advising assignment and the “openness” of the family client. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0894486513484351">Figure 3</xref> presents a model of desired advisor approaches to goal orientation and feedback seeking that depend on task complexity and client openness. As discussed earlier, complex tasks require active learning and the acquisition of more complex procedural knowledge for performance to be optimized in the long run. Other tasks, those that are well learned or relatively simple, would be better accomplished with a proving orientation. The “openness” of the family client will determine the extent to which the client provides (or withholds) feedback that might be needed by the advisor. Some clients will be “open” in that they are able and willing to provide feedback about their needs. On the other hand, some clients will be either unwilling or in some cases even unable to provide the advisor with needed feedback. These feedback environments can be viewed as more “closed” in nature.</p>

</fig>
<p>There is considerable evidence from the goal orientation literature that learning orientation has its greatest effects on goal accomplishment when tasks are complex and require greater procedural knowledge. In this type of setting, advisors may benefit from taking an approach where they seek to experiment with new ways of serving client needs and take the time to learn from mistakes. This may be especially helpful in longer term advisor–client relationships. Presenting clients with an array of potential solutions to family firm needs, and allowing time for evaluation of these alternative solutions, may lead to more useful feedback and more innovative solutions in the long run. In relatively simple assignments of a shorter duration, a proving orientation might be more appropriate. Here, the advisor is more concerned with delivering a relatively simple solution to a problem as quickly as possible, without a need to learn much more about the problem.</p>
<p>As for actually acquiring feedback when it is needed, a couple of different approaches might be used, and the efficacy of these approaches might vary depending on the willingness of the client to provide information. In an “open” environment, where the family client is freely offering feedback and information to the advisor, it may be more appropriate to simply monitor the feedback environment—or, in other words, to focus on listening to the cues sent by the family client. Active questioning of the client might not be necessary, as the client may already know what information the advisor needs, and provides it freely.</p>
<p>In a “closed” environment, where the family client is reluctant to provide information, or is for some reason shy about providing feedback about the advisor’s performance, the advisor may need to be more direct in seeking feedback. Here, an experienced advisor will know the right questions to ask the client and feel comfortable asking those questions directly. Advisors may also need to assess the reasons why a client is “closed.” The lack of feedback from a client might not always reflect a “closed” organizational culture or climate but may simply reflect the inexperience of the client or the uncertainty that the client may experience with respect to the information the advisor needs. If the client does not know what feedback to provide, the advisor will need to be proactive in acquiring this information.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>Although the study was useful for establishing links between goal orientation subdimensions and adaptive behaviors, the hypotheses were not fully supported. Future research should investigate other potential mediating mechanisms that could explain the relationship between goal orientation and these types of behaviors. As noted in the introduction, prior research found that goal orientation is related not only to feedback seeking but also to “elaboration” and “rehearsal” of task strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894486513484351">Fisher &amp; Ford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894486513484351">Steele-Johnson et al., 2000</xref>). Scholars engaged in future research on personal bricolage and innovative behaviors may wish to pursue a more fine-tuned analysis of how elaboration and rehearsal might facilitate (or hinder) adaptive behavior.</p>
<p>Another potential limitation of this study is the use of only family enterprise advisors, while not sampling their family enterprise clients. In the future, scholars may wish to examine the advisor–client relationship through a dyadic research design to consider the complexities associated with family enterprises (e.g., succession planning, parent–child dynamic, family-centered noneconomic goals). This research would extend the findings presented here by providing a greater understanding of how feedback quality will influence personal bricolage when certain client conditions are prevalent. Likewise, the collection of longitudinal data would provide greater understanding of the process by which these behaviors unfold, as well as provide more valid inferences regarding causality.</p>
<p>Although our study focused on family enterprise advisors as a whole, there may be important differences between advisors that could moderate the relationships observed in this study. Differences in educational background, specialization, and client segments may ultimately lead to different feedback environments, more or less complex advising assignments, and varied opportunities to engage in adaptive behavior. For instance, future research may need to consider the size of the client organization in their research design. The nature of the advisors role in a large family enterprise may result in different complexities than in a small family enterprise. As another example, family legal advisors are likely to face much different task and role environments than family enterprise advisors, and these different environments may lead to very different feedback. Theoretically meaningful distinctions among different advisor groups may be discovered that ultimately lead to a more sophisticated understanding of how different advisors acquire feedback and subsequently use such feedback for adaptation.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study is the lack of a direct comparison between family enterprise advisors and advisors who serve nonfamily firms. An assumption, based on the existing family business literature, made in this study is that family enterprise advisors encounter more complexity in their job because of the overlap of family, management, and ownership systems. Scholars may wish to test this assumption, as the extent and nature of this complexity were not established empirically in this study. Furthermore, the nature of the feedback environment encountered by family enterprise advisors also needs further study. Finally, though diagnostic tests indicated little evidence of common method bias, future research may wish to conduct qualitative interviews through field research or the inclusion of secondary data to further increase confidence in the inferences we make here.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, we have endeavored to understand family enterprise advisors by examining how their goal orientation is linked to personal bricolage and individual innovative behavior. Our findings indicate that quality of feedback can play an important role in this process. Though it does not fully mediate the goal orientation to behavior relationship, it does partially mediate these relationships. As family enterprises seek out family enterprise advisors for future endeavors, both parties should be cognizant of how the two parties are interrelated and the nature of their interdependent relationship affects the adaptivity of the advisor to client needs. Given the heterogeneity of the family enterprise sector and the variety of the tasks and environments that advisors undertake, advisors and clients may choose different approaches to their relationship depending on the complexity of the assignment and the openness of the client. Interactions with family stakeholders, and the subsequent openness to provide feedback, would likely vary by assignment. This may determine the choice of advisor, have a bearing on the relationship, and, ultimately, affect the outcome.</p>
