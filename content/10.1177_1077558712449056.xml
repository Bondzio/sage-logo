<abstract>
<p>Despite the substantial amount of useful prior work on turnover among nurses, our understanding of the causal mechanisms explaining why nurses voluntarily leave their jobs is limited. The purpose of this article is to promote the development of stronger conceptual models of the causes of voluntary turnover among nurses. The author compares the nursing-specific literature to research on voluntary turnover from the general management field over the past 30 years and examines the evolution of key theories used in the nursing literature. Results of this review comparing nursing research with that in the broader field suggest that, over time, nursing research has not kept pace with conceptualizations from general management explaining why people either remain at or quit their jobs. The author argues that conceptual models of turnover among nurses can benefit significantly from drawing more effectively on particular models and concepts available in general management studies of turnover.</p>

<p>National data indicate that more than 40% of hospital nurses are dissatisfied with their jobs and the national average for voluntary nurse turnover is an estimated 21% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712449056">Kovner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1077558712449056">Pellico, Brewer, &amp; Kovner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1077558712449056">PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Health Research Institute, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1077558712449056">Waldman, Kelly, Arora, and Smith (2004)</xref>, the cost of hospital employee turnover at one academic medical center represented 3.4% to 5.8% of the annual operating budget or $17 to $24 million dollars, with the loss and replacement of nurses representing the largest proportion of these costs. Depending on the clinical specialty, the cost of replacing one registered nurse is estimated to be between $10,000 and $60,000 (Advisory Board Company, 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712449056">Jones, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Turnover among nurses has negative economic consequences, including lost productivity, decreased efficiency, and lost human capital for work units and hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712449056">Hatch &amp; Dyer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712449056">Jones, 2005</xref>). In addition to the economic costs, high levels of job dissatisfaction and turnover among nurses threaten the quality of care and system performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712449056">Aiken, Clarke, Sloan, Sochalski, &amp; Silber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712449056">Jones &amp; Gates, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1077558712449056">Stone et al., 2007</xref>). Because turnover among nurses is related to the quality and safety of patient care, reducing avoidable nurse turnover is gaining prominence on the national quality agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712449056">Institute of Medicine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712449056">Joint Commission, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077558712449056">2010</xref>). For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077558712449056">National Quality Forum (2004)</xref> nurse-sensitive indicators include nurse turnover as a system-level measure of hospital performance, and the Center for Medicare Service’s pay for performance initiative will reimburse hospitals for patient outcomes that are directly related to the quality of nursing care. By including nurse-sensitive measures in hospital pay for performance and public quality-reporting initiatives, policy makers are emphasizing the important role that a stable nurse workforce plays in improving the quality of health care.</p>
<p>Given the importance and chronic nature of voluntary turnover among nurses, researchers have focused on understanding its causes for the past four decades. Prior empirical research has produced important insights into the causes of job dissatisfaction and turnover among registered nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712449056">Borda &amp; Norman, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712449056">Cavanagh, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712449056">Coomber &amp; Barribal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712449056">Hinshaw &amp; Atwood, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712449056">Irvine &amp; Evans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1077558712449056">Tai, Bame, &amp; Robinson, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1077558712449056">Wagner, 2007</xref>), as well as nurses’ intentions to leave the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712449056">Flinkman, Leino-Kilpi, &amp; Salanter, 2010</xref>), or participate in the nursing workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712449056">Black, Spetz, &amp; Harrington, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712449056">Kovner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1077558712449056">Skillman, Palazzo, Hart, &amp; Keepnews, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the impressive amount of prior work on nurse turnover, our understanding of the causal mechanisms explaining why nurses voluntarily leave their jobs is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712449056">Chen, Chu, Wang, &amp; Lin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712449056">Irvine &amp; Evans, 1995</xref>). One key reason for relatively weak results found in prior empirical studies of voluntary turnover among nurses may be that the conceptual models developed to account for the causes of turnover are not as strong as they could be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712449056">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712449056">Griffeth, Hom, &amp; Gaertner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712449056">Irvine &amp; Evans, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077558712449056">Price and Mueller’s (1981)</xref> causal turnover model is the dominant theoretical perspective used to understand the voluntary turnover of registered nurses in the nursing-specific research literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712449056">Irvine &amp; Evans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1077558712449056">Tai et al., 1998</xref>). The early adoption and persistent use of the causal turnover model over other rival models advanced in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom, Mitchell, Lee, &amp; Eberly, 2008</xref>) may be due, in part, to the fact that Price and Mueller tested their model on an all-nurse sample, thus improving its legitimacy in the eyes of nurse researchers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712449056">Hinshaw &amp; Atwood, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077558712449056">Lake, 1998</xref>). Although studies based on Price and Mueller’s model provide important insights about the role of individual differences, job design, and workplace experiences in nurses’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions, the predictive power of the model in explaining <italic>actual</italic> turnover remains low (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712449056">Chen et al., 2008</xref>, for a recent test of the general model), suggesting the need for new theoretical approaches in the field.</p>

<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>The purpose of this review is to promote the development of stronger conceptual models to better account for the causes of voluntary turnover among nurses. To do so, I review the theoretical perspectives used in the nursing and the health care management literature to explain voluntary turnover among registered nurses. Extending <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al.’s (2006)</xref> recent integrated review of the nursing turnover research, I trace the conceptual history of the field over the past 30 years. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al. (2006)</xref> identify the theoretical models used in the extant body of research, the primary purpose of their review was to synthesize empirical findings with a particular emphasis on the outcomes associated with nurse turnover. To complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al.’s (2006)</xref> work, this review focuses on the theoretical perspectives that nurse researchers use to explain why nurses leave their jobs.</p>
<p>I draw on the research literature from general management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al., 2008</xref>) as a reference point for comparing the conceptual evolution of nursing-specific models of voluntary turnover to those advanced in the broader field of study. Specifically, I draw on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al.’s (2008)</xref> comprehensive framework that summarizes the predictors and consequences of voluntary employee turnover that researchers have advanced over the past 40 years to appraise the theoretical evolution of the nursing-specific research over approximately the same period of time. In mapping the nursing research onto the broader body of research from the general management field, I assess conceptualizations that the two fields of study share and those that may be useful for nurse researchers to integrate into their studies to better explain voluntary turnover among nurses. I argue that a stronger integration of theoretical approaches across fields holds promise for developing deeper insights about the causes and consequences of voluntary turnover among registered nurses.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al.

<p>While the field is rich in explanations for why people leave their jobs, a unified view of the causes of, and processes involved in, turnover has not emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, Holtom et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">2008</xref>) summative model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712449056">Figure 1</xref>) represents a roadmap of the field rather than a specific conceptual model explaining why people voluntarily leave their jobs. For the purpose of my review, the summative model serves as a starting point for identifying areas of convergence and divergence between the two fields of study.</p>
<p>The first stage of the model includes predictor concepts describing individual differences and the nature of the job. The individual differences domain accounts for characteristics that a person brings to a particular job, including demographics, education, prior work experience, and personality. These individual characteristics affect the ease with which individuals can move from an existing job to a new job. Ease of movement into and out of an organization is a critical mechanism in voluntary employee turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077558712449056">March &amp; Simon, 1958</xref>). For example, individuals with advanced education or specialized skills can move to a new job more easily than individuals with lower levels of education. The second conceptual domain, the nature of the job, takes into account variations in job design, autonomy, variety, work role, and role states that are antecedents to individuals’ work attitudes, including organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and intentions to turnover. For example, in the nursing-specific research autonomy over practice is a well-documented and consistent predictor of job satisfaction among nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712449056">Irvine &amp; Evans, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The next stage of the model focuses both on the nature of work environments and individuals’ perceptions of, and attitudes about, their work environments at the individual, group, and organizational levels of analysis. Over time, researchers have developed an understanding that voluntary turnover is a multilevel phenomenon and have accounted for this in conceptualizations of the turnover process. The nature of the work environment, including characteristics such as organizational size, culture, and climate, shapes individuals’ attitudes about an organization, their job satisfaction and willingness to stay in the job or the organization. Focusing on the stressful and dynamic nature of workplaces, researchers have included variables related to individuals’ psychological reactions to workplace stressors, such as barriers to completing a work assignment or an individual’s ability to accept change, as important factors that influence turnover decisions.</p>
<p>The third stage of the summative model describes individuals’ thoughts of leaving and the search for job alternatives. In this phase, individuals make the decision to leave their current job by considering the costs and benefits of leaving, examining available job alternatives, and developing a plan for leaving the current job. The availability of acceptable job alternatives is shaped, in part, by the dynamics of the labor market and individuals’ human capital. Once an individual has decided to leave his or her current job, the fourth phase of the leaving process is characterized by withdrawing from the current job by actively looking for a new job. Active job search includes behaviors such as sending resumes to prospective new employers and going on job interviews.</p>
<p>As individuals progress in the search for a suitable job alternative, withdrawal behaviors such as tardiness, absenteeism, or leaves of absence as well as changes in individuals’ performance attributable to the decision to leave can be observed as described in the fifth stage of the model. At this stage of the turnover process, individuals may also experience a trigger that propels an immediate job search or decision to quit. Triggers, as described in more detail below, involve a shock or particularly jarring event, which can be either positive or negative, that sparks a psychological analysis of leaving a current job. In the summative model, triggers are placed in close proximity to actual turnover because, for some people, a triggering event is followed by an impulsive decision to quit the job. The overall rate of turnover within the work unit may influence an individual’s decision to quit his or her job.</p>
<p>Finally, the sixth stage of the turnover process concludes with the actual turnover event and results in outcomes for both the individual and the organization. Individual outcomes of turnover include both the strain and satisfaction at the new job. Organizational outcomes associated with voluntary turnover include human and social capital losses and changes in organizational performance including subsequent turnover rates at the unit or organizational level.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>I examine the theoretical underpinnings of research on voluntary turnover behavior of registered nurses for the period 1981 to 2010. I selected 1981 as a starting point for two main reasons. First, Price and Mueller’s causal turnover model was published in 1981, representing a major theoretical advance in understanding why people leave their jobs. Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1077558712449056">Price’s (1977)</xref> earlier work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077558712449056">Price and Mueller (1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1077558712449056">1986</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1077558712449056">Price (1989)</xref> incorporated variables from previous turnover models into a comprehensive model to explain voluntary employee turnover. The unique contribution of their work was to identify the antecedents of job satisfaction and intent to leave adding organizational commitment as a mediator between the two variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al., 2008</xref>). Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077558712449056">Price and Mueller (1981</xref>, 1986) tested their general turnover model on a sample of nurses working at a large Midwestern hospital, laying the foundation for much of the subsequent work on understanding the determinants of nurse turnover (see, e.g., the review articles by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712449056">Cavanagh, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712449056">Coomber &amp; Barribal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712449056">Irvine &amp; Evans, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>I conducted searches of the CINAHL and MEDLINE electronic databases using the combination of the terms turnover, intention to leave, intention to stay, and retention with nurse(es)(ing) to generate the initial set of citations. This search strategy produced nearly 900 citations. This initial set of citations was further narrowed to empirical studies examining turnover and intent to stay or intent to leave as the dependent variable that were published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. This narrowed the pool to 210 articles. As a second step, I cross-referenced the studies included in the previously published integrative reviews of the turnover research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al. (2008)</xref> to ensure that key studies were included.</p>
<p>With a team of three research assistants, I read through each of the 210 articles. Articles were included in this review if they explicitly proposed or tested a conceptual model explaining why nurses voluntarily leave their jobs. Of the initial set of 210 articles, 75 did not include a specific theory or conceptual framework and were excluded. Another 73 articles focused on the broader topics of the nursing workforce shortage, nurse job satisfaction, and organizational commitment, which fall outside the scope of this review, and were excluded. Thirty-six articles used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077558712449056">Price and Mueller’s (1981)</xref> general model as the organizing conceptual framework without proposing theoretical refinements. Because the goal of this review is to trace the conceptual development of the field, these articles were also excluded. We identified six distinct conceptual models of turnover in the nursing literature, presented in 26 published articles.</p>
<p>Because voluntary employee turnover has been conceptualized at the individual, work unit, and organizational levels, we included articles at all three levels of analysis that researchers have used to explain nurse turnover. Except for the models proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712449056">Alexander (1988)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712449056">Bloom, Alexander, and Flatt, (1988)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712449056">Alexander, Bloom, and Nuchols, (1994)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077558712449056">Leveck and Jones (1996)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077558712449056">Lake (1998)</xref>, the conceptual models of voluntary nurse turnover included in this review focus on the individual level of analysis.</p>

<title>Models of Voluntary Turnover</title>
<p>In this section, I review the key concepts and the causal mechanisms for each of the six identified turnover models published in the nursing and health care management literature.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077558712449056">Price and Mueller’s (1981)</xref> causal turnover model is the dominant conceptual approach used to explain registered nurses’ decision to voluntarily leave their jobs. The causal turnover model and its variants follow in the tradition established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077558712449056">March and Simon (1958)</xref>, who viewed voluntary turnover as a rational linear process by which an individual decides to leave his or her current position based on job satisfaction and the availability of suitable employment alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712449056">Hulin, Roznowski, &amp; Hachiya, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077558712449056">Lee &amp; Mitchell, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077558712449056">Price and Mueller’s (1981)</xref> model integrated 11 determinants identified in prior studies drawn from economics, psychology, and sociology that were associated with variation in voluntary employee turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712449056">Irvine &amp; Evans, 1995</xref>). The major theoretical breakthrough of this model was the hypothesized moderating effect of organizational commitment on intent to leave and voluntary turnover. Distal predictors in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077558712449056">Price and Mueller’s (1981)</xref> causal model include demographic characteristics, the nature of the job, and perceptions of fair treatment at work. The first-stage predictors characterizing the nature of the work and work environment are hypothesized to influence job satisfaction. In turn, job satisfaction effects an individual’s commitment to the organization. The extent to which an individual is satisfied with his or her job and committed to the organization affects thoughts of leaving, and ultimately, quitting.</p>
<p>A number of researchers have proposed refinements to Price and Mueller’s general turnover model including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1077558712449056">Weisman, Alexander, and Chase (1981)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712449056">Curry, Wakefield, Price, Mueller, and McCloskey (1985)</xref>; Alexander and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712449056">Alexander, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712449056">Alexander, Lichtenstein, Oh &amp; Ullman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712449056">Bloom, Alexander, &amp; Flatts, 1988</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077558712449056">Liou (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077558712449056">Lake (1998)</xref>; and, more recently, Brewer and Kovner’s revision of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1077558712449056">Price’s 2001</xref> turnover model (reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077558712449056">Kovner, Brewer, Greene, &amp; Fairchild, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712449056">Curry, Wakefield, Price, Mueller, and McCloskey (1985)</xref> added the determinant variables of centralization, role overload, and work unit size to assess their effects on the moderating variables of job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and intention to leave. Whereas the majority of studies using Price and Mueller’s turnover model are at the individual level of analysis, Alexander and colleagues took a sociological approach by conceptualizing job satisfaction and actual voluntary turnover as an organizational-level phenomenon. In a series of studies, Alexander and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712449056">Alexander, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712449056">Alexander et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712449056">Bloom et al., 1988</xref>) examine how nurses’ power, status, and autonomy within the organization influence job satisfaction and turnover. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077558712449056">Lake (1998)</xref> integrated the profession-specific variables of burnout and clinical autonomy as predictors of nurses’ intentions to resign. More recently, the Brewer–Kovner turnover model (2009) emphasizes the economic nature of workforce participation by including a robust set of market-level and household-level variables to predict newly licensed nurses’ intentions to stay at their jobs. The Brewer–Kovner model seeks to extend understanding about how job opportunities, household income and family responsibilities mix with experiences in the work environment to affect new nurses’ intentions to stay or leave their jobs.</p>
<p>In a meta-analysis using 21 studies testing Price and Mueller’s general model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712449056">Irvine and Evans (1995)</xref> found that the model accounted for 12% of the variance in actual turnover.

<title>The Anticipated Turnover Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712449056">Hinshaw &amp; Atwood, 1985</xref>)</title>
<p>A second conceptual approach emphasizes that the work of nurses is inherently stressful and examines how personal experiences of stress at work influence registered nurses’ job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and intentions to leave. The Anticipated Turnover Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712449056">Hinshaw &amp; Atwood, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712449056">Hinshaw, Smeltzer, &amp; Atwood, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077558712449056">Lucas, Atwood, &amp; Hagaman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077558712449056">Leveck [nee Lucas] &amp; Jones, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1077558712449056">Volk &amp; Lucas, 1991</xref>) best exemplifies the stress and coping perspective on voluntary turnover in the nursing-specific research. Drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077558712449056">Price and Mueller (1981)</xref> and the work-stress literature of the era, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712449056">Hinshaw and Atwood (1985)</xref> proposed a five-stage causal turnover model incorporating organizational and individual factors influencing staff nurse job satisfaction, anticipated turnover, and actual turnover. Stage 1 variables include individual and organizational variables associated with job mobility. Stage 2 links the mobility factors to perceptions of group cohesion and job stress in the work environment. Stage 3 variables include the theorized direct and indirect effects of job mobility and individuals’ perceptions of the work environment on organizational satisfaction and professional job satisfaction. Stage 4 includes anticipated turnover and Stage 5 actual turnover. In the anticipated turnover model, job stress is viewed as an intervening variable between the work-unit variables of group cohesion, supervisor support and leadership style, work autonomy, role conflict, and control over practice. In an extension of the anticipated turnover model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077558712449056">Leveck and Jones (1996)</xref> added front-line managers’ leadership style (participative management; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077558712449056">Likert &amp; Likert, 1976</xref>) to the first stage of the model and revised the Stage 4 outcome variables to include staff retention and quality of nursing care.</p>
<p>The anticipated turnover model integrates individuals’ attitudes about work stress as a factor leading to intention of leaving and actual turnover. Empirical tests suggest that job satisfaction buffers perceptions of job stress, anticipated leaving, and actual turnover. Group cohesion among unit members is a significant predictor of nurses’ job satisfaction. Empirical tests of the revised model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077558712449056">Leveck &amp; Jones, 1996</xref>) explained 49% of the variance in staff nurse retention and 39% of the variance in process aspects of quality of nursing care. Unit manager leadership style, job stress, job satisfaction, and group cohesion had direct and indirect effects on nurse retention and the quality of nursing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077558712449056">Leveck &amp; Jones, 1996</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077558712449056">Parasuraman (1989)</xref> presented an integrated model of turnover incorporating the variables of role conflict, work overload, and managers’ leadership style (using the situational leadership model) as antecedents of nurses’ work stress, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction. In a significant methodological advance, Parasuraman used a time lag analysis to examine the relationship between nurses’ job attitudes and their actual leaving behavior. Results from the only empirical test of the model show that none of the demographic and work experience variables had a direct effect on nurses’ intention to leave or turnover. Demographic and work experience variables influenced intention to leave and turnover through the effects of felt stress, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Although the model variables accounted for between 34% and 36% of the variation in each successive variable proceeding turnover, the total variance accounted for in turnover behavior was only 6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077558712449056">Parasuraman, 1989</xref>).</p>

<title>The Unfolding Turnover Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077558712449056">Lee &amp; Mitchell, 1994</xref>)</title>
<p>Breaking from prior models that assume rational decision making and linear effects to explain how and why people leave their jobs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077558712449056">Lee and Mitchell (1994)</xref> proposed the Unfolding Turnover Model. The unfolding turnover model views the decision to stay or leave a job as a series of psychological processes. The major components of the unfolding turnover model include shocks, scripts, image violations, job satisfaction, and job search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077558712449056">Lee &amp; Mitchell, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077558712449056">1999</xref>). The unfolding process begins with individuals’ experience of a shock or a particularly jarring event that sparks a psychological analysis of leaving their current job. More often than not, the shock is a negative event such as being passed up for a promotion. However, positive personal events such as having a baby are also included as triggers for voluntarily leaving a job.</p>
<p>The experience of the shock initiates a script about a plan of how an individual would go about leaving a current job. Next, an image violation occurs when an individual’s values and career plans either do not fit those of the organization or are reflected in the shock. After evaluating one’s values and goals in context of a current job, job satisfaction decreases when an individual feels that the job no longer provides the desired level of intellectual, emotional, or financial benefits. Finally, in the face of low levels of job satisfaction, an individual starts looking for a new job and weighs alternative job opportunities against the benefits and drawbacks of an existing position.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077558712449056">Lee and Mitchell (1994)</xref> identified five distinct psychological and behavioral paths characterizing how individuals exit their jobs. Path 1: An individual suffers a shock that triggers an exit plan without evaluating possible alternatives. That is, an individual quits a current job without thinking about the consequences. Path 2: A negative shock makes an individual revaluate his or her attachment to the organization in light of the image violation brought on by the shock. An individual considers his or her alternatives, and after a short deliberation period, leaves his or her present job without securing a new job. Path 3: A shock occurs, precipitating a review of one’s job, its benefits and drawbacks. An individual engages in a job search to compare their current job with potential alternatives. Leaving in this path includes a job search, a job offer, and the weighing alternatives. Path 4: Low levels of job satisfaction, rather than a shock, triggers the decision to leave. An individual conducts a job search, obtains a job offer and evaluates alternatives (4a) or leaves his or her position without conducting a job search (4b).</p>
<p>Empirical tests of the unfolding turnover model support the notion that a shock or triggering event initiates the leaving process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al., 2008</xref>). In a sample of 350 nurses working in the U.K. National Health Service, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077558712449056">Morrell (2005)</xref> categorized nurses’ reasons for leaving their jobs into three distinct clusters. About half of the nurses in the sample who quit their jobs experienced a shock that prompted their decision to leave. Of these, more than one third (<italic>n</italic> = 103) experienced a negative, unanticipated work-related event. The remainder of the respondents followed the conventional turnover process of decreasing job satisfaction, gradual withdrawal, and exit from the organization.</p>
<p>In a follow-up study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077558712449056">Morrell, Loan-Clarke, Arnold &amp; Wilkinson (2008)</xref> tested the predictive capabilities of the unfolding turnover model to classify nurse leavers working in the U.K. National Health Service. Of the 352 nurses participating in the study, 77% could be categorized into one of the five leaving pathways that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077558712449056">Lee and Mitchell (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077558712449056">1999)</xref> hypothesized. But, results from logit analyses showed support for only three of six hypothesized relationships among shock, image violation, and leaving. Significant coefficients had medium effects sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712449056">Cohen, 1992</xref>). In post hoc analyses, leavers were more likely to be classified into one of the five hypothesized unfolding pathways if they had no dependents and described their quitting as avoidable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077558712449056">Morrell et al. (2008)</xref> suggest more work is needed to refine the image violation construct and its operational definition in the unfolding turnover survey. Furthermore, they argued that the search construct does not fully capture the tight nursing labor market and relative ease that experienced nurses have in securing new positions. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077558712449056">Morrell et al.’s (2008)</xref> sample had a higher proportion of women than other studies testing the unfolding turnover model, suggesting that the leaving process for women may originate from nonwork responsibilities or events not accounted for in the theory.</p>
<p>Pellico and colleagues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1077558712449056">Pellico, Brewer, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077558712449056">Pellico, Djukic, Kovner, &amp; Brewer’s, 2009</xref>) qualitative analyses of the work experiences of newly licensed registered nurses revealed that many suffered mistreatment by coworkers and experienced conflicts between their values about nursing and their actual experiences of working as a nurse. Although the researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1077558712449056">Pellico, Brewer, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077558712449056">Pellico, Djukic, et al., 2009</xref>) did not explicitly test the unfolding turnover model, many of the work experiences reported by the novice nurses fit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077558712449056">Lee and Mitchell’s (1994)</xref> concepts of shocks and image violations that trigger the beginning of the turnover process.</p>
<p>Extending these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712449056">Brewer, Kovner, Green, Tukov-Shuser, and Djukic (2012)</xref> incorporated the concept of shocks, operationalized as work-related injuries including sprains, strains, and back injuries, into the Brewer-Kovner turnover model. In a survey of 1,653 newly licensed registered nurses, approximately 40% of respondents experienced a work-related injury during the first year of employment; 19% of whom left their job by the second year of employment. New nurses who worked full-time (<italic>p</italic> = .037) and who had more sprains and strains, including back injuries (<italic>p</italic> = .026), were more likely to leave their employer. Though these coefficients were significant, they accounted for only a small percentage of the variance in turnover. Nonetheless, these results suggest that work-related injuries are a type of unplanned, negative event leading nurses to reconsider their attachment to the organization that are well within the control of managers to avert.</p>

<title><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712449056">Borda and Norman’s (1997a)</xref> Absence and Turnover Model</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712449056">Borda and Norman’s (1997a)</xref> model of absence and turnover of registered nurses proposes relationships among the variables job satisfaction, absence, intent to stay, kinship responsibilities, pay, and opportunity for other employment. In one of the few studies to examine gender differences in absences and turnover among nurses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712449056">Borda and Norman (1997b)</xref> showed different patterns of correlations among the model variables for men and women. For example, one important finding of the study was that job satisfaction is a stronger determining factor of intent to stay for men (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .63). In contrast to other studies examining voluntary turnover among registered nurses, no relationship was found between kinship responsibilities, pay satisfaction, and employment opportunities and intent to stay for either men or women in the sample. Borda and Norman did find that kinship responsibilities accounted for 29% of the variance in the total number of absence spells for female nurses and 14% of the variance for the total sample, suggesting that women bear more of the responsibility for child and elder care. Taken together these findings can be explained in part by government policies and cultural norms associated with the empirical context of Malta, where the researchers tested their turnover and absence model. The nurses in the study cited the lack of child care facilities and flexibility in working hours as the greatest sources of job dissatisfaction associated with employment at the state-owned hospital.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, among the models included in this review, Borda and Norman’s model is the only one to examine the correlation between job satisfaction and family responsibilities and nurses’ volitional absences from work. Absenteeism is used as a proxy for psychological withdrawal from the job. The study results suggest that for some individuals, high absenteeism rates may be a symptom of competing work–family demands rather than a sign of decreasing job satisfaction and withdrawal. This is an important source of variation that should be examined further in turnover studies using measures of withdrawal to predict voluntary employee turnover.</p>

<p>Taking research on turnover in a new direction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077558712449056">Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski, et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712449056">Holtom and O’Neill (2004)</xref> proposed the job embeddedness model to explain why people stay at their jobs. Drawing on ideas from social network theory, and building on the finding that family responsibilities influence turnover behavior, job embeddedness is viewed as a key mediating construct between specific on-the-job and off-the-job factors promoting employee retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712449056">Holtom &amp; O’Neill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077558712449056">Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski, et al., 2001</xref>). The job embeddedness model identifies accumulated affective and nonaffective reasons to explain why individuals stay at their jobs. Job embeddedness has three dimensions: links, fit, and sacrifice. Links are the formal and informal connections an individual has to others in the organization and the community. Fit is an individual’s perceived compatibility within the organization, the community, and the geographic environment. Sacrifice captures the perceived material and psychological benefits that would be forfeited if the individual person left his or her organization.</p>
<p>In the nursing literature, the job embeddedness model has been used in three empirical studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712449056">Holtom and O’Neill (2004)</xref> first introduced the job embeddedness model into the nursing literature; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1077558712449056">Stroth (2010)</xref> advocates the job embeddedness model as a framework to understand the retention behavior of nurses working in rural locations; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1077558712449056">Reitz, Anderson, and Hill (2010)</xref> tested the model using an all-registered-nurse sample. In an empirical test of the job embeddedness model using an all-registered-nurses sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1077558712449056">Reitz et al. (2010)</xref> found that job embeddedness accounted for 24.6% of the variance in nurses’ intentions to stay at their jobs.</p>
<p>Results suggest that job embeddedness predicts actual turnover more accurately than measures of job desirability and ease of movement. Additionally, and as expected, older nurses with longer tenure and stronger ties to the organization and in the community are more likely to stay in their jobs than individuals without established work and social networks (Wright &amp; Bonnet, 2001). These findings point to interesting new variables to understand why nurses stay at their jobs, as well as new retention strategies to enhance nurses’ lives on and off the job based on the concepts of links, fit, and sacrifice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, I trace the evolution of the theories and conceptual approaches used to study voluntary turnover of nurses in the nursing-specific and, as applicable, the health care management literature over the past 30 years. Results of this review show that prior conceptual models account for only low to medium levels of variance in turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712449056">Cohen, 1992</xref>). These results suggest that we should integrate key variables and relatively new conceptual approaches from the general management literature to guide future studies of nurse turnover. I offer suggestions for how these conceptual approaches can inform understanding of why nurses voluntarily leave their jobs. I conclude by discussing new research designs and methods to test these new conceptual approaches to advance theory and practice.</p>

<title>Two Conceptual Models to Emphasize</title>
<sec id="section13-1077558712449056">
<title>Unfolding turnover model</title>
<p>Current evidence suggests that dissatisfaction with aspects of job design and the work environment influence the voluntary turnover of nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712449056">Aiken, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712449056">Coomber &amp; Barribal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>). The unfolding turnover model provides a framework for deepening understanding about nurses’ psychological reactions to, and analysis of, the work environment that motivate leaving. These results point to fruitful areas for theory development to untangle how professional identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712449056">Ashforth &amp; Mael, 1989</xref>) and image violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077558712449056">Lee &amp; Mitchell, 1994</xref>) affect organizational commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077558712449056">Mobley, 1977</xref>). Advances in theory in this area would be particularly useful in light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712449056">Copper-Hakim and Viswesaran’s (2005)</xref> finding that individuals do not distinguish between organizational commitment and occupational commitment. This is, new nurses may leave the profession unnecessarily because they had an unsatisfactory job experience in one nursing unit, in one organization. There also is an opportunity to integrate labor market variables into such studies to determine if the likelihood of leaving the profession hinges more on available opportunities in fields other than nursing than on dissatisfaction with a nursing job in a particular organization.</p>
<p>The unfolding turnover model provides a theoretical lens for understanding the specific dynamics of the practice environment that cause nurses to leave. For example, which shocks are part of the life and death nature of nurses’ work that may be considered “occupational hazards,” not under managers’ control to avert? What types of shocks and image violations do nurses experience that are directly related to the organizational culture and management practices regarding the value of nurses and nursing care that are under managers’ control to avert (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712449056">Brewer et al., 2012</xref>)? Which types of triggers do nurses experience at work or in their personal lives that could be addressed by comprehensive retention programs including the use of realistic job previews or career transition programs tailored to the needs of a predominately female workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712449056">Eagly &amp; Carli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712449056">Jones &amp; Gates, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077558712449056">Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, &amp; Graske, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1077558712449056">Park &amp; Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1077558712449056">PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Health Research Institute, 2007</xref>)? Do leaving pathways vary for nurses with different levels of education, experience, practice specialty or job performance?</p>
<p>Finally, the unfolding turnover model is well suited for developing understanding about the role of alternative job offers in individuals’ leaving decisions. A central feature of the unfolding turnover model is the active review of both the benefits and limits of a current job in fulfilling an individual’s intellectual, emotional, and financial needs, particularly after experiencing a shock that begins the quitting process. Because individuals typically need a new job to go to after voluntarily leaving an existing job, the attractiveness of alternative job opportunities is an important, and somewhat overlooked, aspect of the turnover phenomena in nursing research. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077558712449056">Price and Mueller (1981)</xref> include market opportunity in their causal turnover model and the Brewer-Kovner model (2009) emphasizes labor market characteristics and household income as predictors of nurses’ leaving intentions, relatively little is known about how job opportunities “pull” nurses out of organizations. For example, what aspects of a job are most important to individuals who are actively searching for a new job in nursing? Do nurses with different levels of work experience or education take different aspects of a new job into account when evaluating a particular position or job offer? What organizational, professional, or personal factors motivate nurses to create a leaving plan and actively search for a new job?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1077558712449056">
<title>Job embeddedness model</title>
<p>Studies using the job embeddedness model would deepen understanding about factors on and off the job that promote nurse retention. In addition to learning more about the specific factors in the job embeddedness model that anchor nurses at their jobs, studies based on the job embeddedness model could provide more information about nurses’ career trajectories. For example, what factors both on and off the job lead some nurses to spend their entire careers at one organization in several direct care positions or, in contrast, to move from the front line to the senior management team over an extended period of time? What is the effect of organizational and community networks on keeping nurses in their jobs, particularly for nurses working in rural locations who may have fewer job opportunities than nurses working in suburban or urban locations? What role, if any, does job embeddedness play in the turnover decisions of younger nurses, or those with shorter organizational tenure, who are most likely to leave their jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712449056">Campion, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077558712449056">Pellico, Djukic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1077558712449056">Wright &amp; Bonnet, 2002</xref>)? Furthermore, the job embeddedness model specifically addresses the role of family responsibilities as a factor that keeps people in their jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077558712449056">Mitchelle, Holtom, Lee &amp; Graske, 2001</xref>). Given that the majority of registered nurses in the United States are female, married, with children living at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1077558712449056">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>), the job embeddedness model is particularly well suited for developing new knowledge about the role of family responsibilities in nurse turnover and retention. For example, how does the sacrifice construct of the job embeddedness model related to home ownership, spouse’s employment, and child care or school enrollment, anchor nurses to a current job or a geographic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077558712449056">Kovner, Corcoran, &amp; Brewer, 2011</xref>)? Results from job embeddedness studies would provide additional information for developing comprehensive, and creative, retention programs that support work–life balance, overall quality of life, or recreational and community activities to anchor nurses to a particular organization or geographic location.</p>

<title>Testing Alternative Theoretical Models</title>
<p>To advance theory and practice, nurse researchers should launch new programs of research, including using new variables, study designs, data collection methods, and analytic techniques, to test the relevance and validity of alternative theoretical approaches that management researchers have advanced to explain voluntary turnover among nurses.</p>
<sec id="section16-1077558712449056">
<title>New variables</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712449056">Table 1</xref> summarizes the extent to which key constructs and variables from the Integrated Turnover Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al., 2008</xref>) are included in the six major models of voluntary turnover advanced in the nursing-specific literature. In addition to including variables associated with the unfolding turnover and the job embeddedness models in nursing-specific studies, a number of other new variables merit attention. Here are three examples.</p>
<p>First, nursing-specific studies that examine the effects of the person–environment context tend to explain turnover by emphasizing distributional justice and the instrumental communications of nurse managers. Variables such as procedural justice, the quality of RN–MD relationships, or organizational socialization have not been systematically examined to understand how nurses’ perceptions of their work environment influence turnover.</p>
<p>Second, nurse researchers use the variables of job stress and work overload to assess nurses’ job attitudes. Adding key variables from the hindrance and challenge stressors model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1077558712449056">Podsakoff, LePine, &amp; LePine, 2007</xref>) could enhance this line of research; these variables include the types of stressors nurses that face in their work stemming from job design, scope of practice, or professional role expectations.</p>
<p>Finally, the role of individual performance as a predictor of turnover is largely absent from the theoretic models of turnover used in the nursing-specific research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712449056">Alexander, 1988</xref>). Studies including measures of individual work performance would provide information about the career mobility of nurses functioning at the high and low ends of the work-performance spectrum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1077558712449056">
<title>Longitudinal studies</title>
<p>Because turnover is a time-dependent process, longitudinal studies are the most appropriate study design for developing knowledge about why people voluntarily leave their jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712449056">Edmondson &amp; McManus, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1077558712449056">Steel, 2002</xref>). As identified in previous reviews of the nursing turnover research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712449056">Cavanagh, 1989</xref>; Hayes et al., 2007), the dearth of longitudinal studies has hampered progress in the field. Kovner and Brewer’s Newly Licensed Registered Nurse Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1077558712449056">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2011</xref>), a 10-year panel study, helps fill this gap in longitudinal studies examining turnover among nurses.</p>
<p>At a minimum, new studies of nurse turnover should collect data at multiple points to assess changes in participants’ workplace perceptions, job attitudes, and withdrawal behaviors over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712449056">Campion, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077558712449056">Kammeyer-Mueller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1077558712449056">Steel, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712449056">Campion (1991)</xref> discusses the role of time in the measurement and meaning of voluntary turnover. Traditionally, researchers assess employee’s work attitudes and perceptions to establish a baseline and then again, usually 1 year later, to assess changes in perceptions and attitudes with the goal of predicting which employees are most likely to leave. Another common approach is to survey employees and to retrieve additional information about the reasons for leaving from personnel files. Though these survey approaches are pragmatic for researchers, they are neither fine-grained enough for measuring changes in key attitudes, perceptions or behaviors, nor do they account for the extent to which a turnover event is truly voluntary or avoidable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712449056">Campion, 1991</xref>). Additionally, nurse researchers have not agreed on the recommended study length or measurement intervals to accurately track nurses’ job attitudes and behaviors related to turnover. This research methods issue should be addressed to improve the quality of the evidence base.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1077558712449056">
<title>Intervention studies</title>
<p>We also need intervention studies to advance both theory and practice. A well-documented and consistent set of variables (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712449056">Table 1</xref>) describing the organizational and person–-environment context of nurses and turnover among them exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>) for developing and testing unit-level management interventions using experimental and quasi-experimental designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712449056">Cook &amp; Campbell, 1979</xref>). Intervention studies would contribute significantly to understanding the most effective and cost-efficient combination of changes in work design and practice environments to improve the quality of nurses’ work life, which is an important determinant of job satisfaction and, ultimately, retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>). Although intervention studies are difficult to conduct, a few well-designed studies using multiple work units located in one organization or one geographic area would provide important new knowledge regarding the best use of scarce resources to guide management practice. This is particularly true as senior nurse leaders adopt national programs to improve the work environment of nurses (e.g., the Magnet recognition program or the Positive Practice Environment Campaign). It will be important to more fully understand how different interventions effect job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and work engagement of nurses.</p>
<p>Evidence-based management interventions to promote nurse retention could include (a) changes in registered nurse job design to promote full scope of practice and clinical autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712449056">Institute of Medicine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1077558712449056">Pfeffer,1982</xref>), (b) work redesign to reduce system failures that are a common part of nurses’ daily work experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1077558712449056">Tucker &amp; Spear, 2006</xref>), (c) leadership development for front-line managers to more effectively manage a professional workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712449056">Gilmartin &amp; D’Aunno, 2007</xref>), (d) team training to improve group cohesion and collaboration among nurses and other providers involved in patient care activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1077558712449056">Salas, Wilson, Murphy, King, &amp; Salisbury, 2008</xref>), and (e) human resource and talent management programs to promote nurse retention throughout different career and family lifecycle phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712449056">Eagly &amp; Carli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077558712449056">Kovner, Brewer, Wu, Cheng, &amp; Suzuki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1077558712449056">Pfeffer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1077558712449056">PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Health Research Institute, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1077558712449056">
<title>Multilevel studies</title>
<p>In the broader field of management studies, researchers conceptualize voluntary turnover at the individual, work group, and organizational levels of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712449056">Holtom et al., 2008</xref>). As this review reveals, nurse researchers have mainly focused on explaining voluntary turnover at the individual-level of analysis. A revival of large-scale organizational-level studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712449056">Alexander et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712449056">Bloom et al., 1988</xref>) or unit-level studies of nurse turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712449056">Alexander, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077558712449056">Lake, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077558712449056">Leveck &amp; Jones, 1996</xref>) that conceptualize and measure the role of organizational factors in job satisfaction and turnover would provide important new knowledge about the differential effects of organizational characteristics, management practices, and job market on RN turnover and retention. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712449056">Castle’s (2008)</xref> recent national study of turnover rates for chief nurses, registered nurses, and nursing assistants working in nursing homes reported results at both the state and facility levels. The results showed wide variation in actual turnover rates between organizations and among different levels of nursing personnel that the author attributes to differences in organizational characteristics.</p>
<p>Studies employing multilevel designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712449056">Klein, Dansereau, &amp; Hall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077558712449056">Klein &amp; Kozlowski, 2000</xref>) would provide new information on how individual characteristics and perceptions of the work environment interact with the structural, cultural, political, and technical characteristics of both work units and organizations to influence nurses’ turnover decisions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712449056">Alexander (1988)</xref> demonstrated variations in voluntary nurse turnover rates among units within individual hospitals were larger than the variation in the voluntary turnover rates between hospitals, suggesting that nurse turnover is a unit-level phenomenon.</p>

<sec id="section20-1077558712449056">
<title>Use of survival (hazard) models</title>
<p>Many empirical studies of turnover included in this review do not use statistical models to take into account the so-called right censoring of the data. In other words, prior work may have produced bias results because study time periods were relatively short and nurses may have left their jobs after the study observation period had ended. Survival analysis models (also known as hazard models or event history analysis) are designed specifically to address these issues. These statistical techniques should become the standard in this area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712449056">Cho, Lee, Mark, &amp; Yun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077558712449056">Lake, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077558712449056">Morita, Lee, &amp; Mowday, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1077558712449056">Steel, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Use of dynamic modeling methods</title>
<p>Wagner has recently introduced the cusp catastrophe modeling method, based on principles from chaos theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1077558712449056">Thom, 1975</xref>), into nursing-specific research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1077558712449056">Wagner, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1077558712449056">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1077558712449056">Wagner &amp; Huber, 2003</xref>). The power of a nonlinear perspective for understanding voluntary turnover is that individuals often respond to their environments with abrupt changes in behavior that may be determined by past situations or stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1077558712449056">Sheridan &amp; Abelson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1077558712449056">Thom, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1077558712449056">Wagner, 2010</xref>). Thus, nonlinear modeling methods are particularly well suited for analyzing dynamic changes in job attitudes to identify individuals who are nearing a mathematically derived threshold where they are most likely to resign from their jobs and who can be retained with targeted management interventions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1077558712449056">Wagner (2010)</xref> studied the relationship between perceived job tension and organizational commitment as predictors of nurses’ turnover decisions and found the cusp model to be a more accurate predictor (59% accuracy) of turnover than the liner model (39.3% accuracy) for nurses in the sample with less than 5 years work experience. Wagner suggests that new nurses may experience more job stress than nurses with more work experience and recommends analyzing nurse turnover rates using cohorts based on respondent’s age or organizational tenure. Wagner’s finding corroborates existing evidence from the nursing and general management literature that younger workers and new employees are more likely to leave their jobs because they are less invested in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712449056">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077558712449056">Mitchell, Holtom, Lee &amp; Sablynski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1077558712449056">Tai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1077558712449056">Wright &amp; Bonnet, 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section22-1077558712449056">
<title>Comparative modeling of alternative conceptual models</title>
<p>We can significantly enhance the benefits of the research and statistical methods discussed above by designing studies that compare and contrast two or more of the conceptual models I reviewed here. For example, one innovative design would study the outcomes of intervention studies using traditional linear conceptual models and cusp catastrophe (i.e., nonlinear) models to track changes in nurses’ work attitudes and turnover over time.</p>
<p>In particular, we need designs and statistical analyses that can advance theory by showing how conceptual models relate to each other. There are at least three possibilities to examine. The first is that the models discussed above are linearly additive. In this view, the effects of the models are independent of each other. For example, the effects of variables from the job embeddedness model may add significantly to the effects of variables from the unfolding turnover model. Note that results from empirical assessments of additive statistical models may show that, though each of several variables add somewhat to accounting for turnover among nurses, some variables matter much more than others.</p>
<p>A second possibility is that the effects of focal conceptual models interact, such that the effect of one depends on levels of others, including the possibility that the effects of some models cancel the effects of others. Consider this example: low levels of job embeddedness may interact with job stress such that the two variables combined produce a very strong effect on turnover (i.e., stronger than each variable alone). In the strongest version of this view, the effects of some models completely cancel the effects of others. For example, job stress levels may become so high and intolerable for some nurses that they leave jobs in which they are highly embedded.</p>
<p>A third possibility is that variables in one or more of the models mediate the effects of variables in other models. In other words, there are some key causal pathways for turnover among nurses. For example, low levels of job stress may lead to high levels of embeddedness, which, in turn, lead to high levels of tolerance for shocks and threats to image on the job, resulting in low levels of turnover. Thus, it is important to examine the extent to which causal pathways exist among key variables in the models of turnover discussed here. In short, much prior work has examined one conceptual model per study; comparative studies are more efficient and could advance theory and practice more rapidly.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Because turnover is a central phenomenon of interest for nursing administration researchers there is an opportunity to reinvigorate interdisciplinary research efforts as one approach for advancing the field. Results of this review show that the 1980s were a vibrant time in the development of turnover research in both the nursing and general management fields. In this era, nurse researchers capitalized on both theoretical and methodological advances from the general management field to inform the development of the nursing-specific research. Over time close collaborations between nurse researchers and general management researchers have waned. With the exception of Wagner’s introduction of the cusp-catastrophe model, the alternative theoretical models advanced in the nursing specific literature have been introduced by general management researcher who either specifically study nurse turnover or included nurses in samples testing new theories.</p>
<p>Progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms as to <italic>why</italic> nurses leave their jobs has been hampered by a somewhat narrow set of theoretical perspectives used to study job satisfaction and turnover in the nursing-specific research. Many questions remain unanswered about the mechanisms that lead nurses to leave their jobs and the consequences of nurse turnover for individuals, organizations, and society. Nonetheless, new theoretical approaches have diffused into the nursing-specific research and hold promise for moving the field forward.</p>
