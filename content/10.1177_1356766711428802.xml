<abstract>
<p>High quality services and customer satisfaction are important determinants of destination competitiveness. For effectively and efficiently managing service quality and providing customer satisfaction, managers need to know how important satisfaction drivers are, and how their performance is perceived by the customers. Importance-performance analysis (IPA), in this context, is a convenient analytical technique that guides manager’s decisions. In this article, it is argued that a revised IPA using an isoline of importance and performance instead of the traditional quadrant analysis yields better results and increases the diagnostic value of IPA. This article shows empirically that market segments differ significantly within these two dimensions of the analysis, and so it is suggested that IPA should be conducted on a segment rather than an aggregate level. The empirical basis of the article is formed by a sample of 821 customers in a Turkish destination. By utilising IPA technique, determinant attributes of the competitiveness for subject destination could be identified for four market segments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In today’s competitive global marketplace, a tourist destination: <disp-quote>
<p>tends to be seen no longer as a set of distinct natural, cultural, artistic and environmental resources, but as an overall appealing product in a certain area: a complex and integrated package offered by a territory able to supply a holiday which meets the varied needs of the customers. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766711428802">Cracolici and Nijkamp, 2005</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356766711428802">Hu and Ritchie (1993</xref>: 26) conceptualize tourism destination as ‘a package of tourism facilities and services, which like any other consumer product, is composed of a number of multi-dimensional attributes’. The more varied the tourism (service) products or tourism experiences are, the greater the number of individual service providers participating in the creation of a tourism value chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356766711428802">Kunst, 2009</xref>: 135). Customers perceive a tourism destination as a whole, a fact which allows the providers in a destination to develop a joint tourism product which can, in itself, represent the attraction of a tourism destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356766711428802">Omerzel, 2011</xref>: 28). On the other hand, to achieve the social and economic objectives and to maximize the benefits from tourism, the ‘destination’ has to provide high-quality goods and services to satisfy the local, regional, and international customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356766711428802">Al-Masroori, 2006</xref>: 3). However, without knowing the customers’ most important needs and quality expectations, initiatives in this endeavour are based on guesswork. Therefore, destination authorities and managers have to identify those destination attributes that are the most important determinants of the customer satisfaction and positive post-purchase behaviour. In the existing tourism literature, numerous studies can be found about the customer satisfaction and post-purchase behaviour topics. Conversely, research attempts are quite limited about the identification of the destination attributes for various market segments in the content of micro or macro level competitiveness. For this reason, the main aim of this study is to identify those characteristics of the destination attributes which might be overestimated, might be utilized more, or need to be improved. If the destination authorities and managers understand the customer perception regarding the attributes, as well as their positions (importance and performance) in the eye of customers, they can act more strategically in the long term and may gain considerable competitive advantages against their rivals.</p>
<p>Herein, importance-performance analysis (IPA) is a suitable technique which is ‘inexpensive to administer, simple to interpret and when combined with market segmentation, produces results that can be incorporated into effective management strategies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766711428802">Bruyere et al., 2002</xref>: 82). With the help of this analysis, destination authorities and managers may understand the performance and importance of destination attributes, decide the areas or priority, and make a well-directed strategic plan. </p>
<p>This article identifies IPA as a convenient technique for determining the role of various destination attributes in destination competitiveness. In the content of the study, a literature review about destination competitiveness and IPA are presented, followed by the methodology and results sections. The article concludes with some suggestions and managerial implications in the final section.</p>

<title>Destination competitiveness and its determinants</title>
<p>In the tourism literature, many researchers attempted to identify and to classify the main destination attributes that have influenced customer satisfaction and post-purchase behaviour. While some of the research was conceptual, explanatory and qualitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766711428802">Barney, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766711428802">Crouch and Ritchie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356766711428802">Fabricius, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356766711428802">Faulkner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766711428802">Feurer and Kazem, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356766711428802">Formica, 2002</xref>), some others were empirical and quantitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766711428802">Crouch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356766711428802">d’Harteserre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766711428802">Enright and Newton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356766711428802">Hudson et al., 2004</xref>), which offer various measurement methods, depending on their research focus such as destinations’ image, price, sustainability, attractiveness and competitiveness. </p>
<p>Since the widely acknowledged model of national competitiveness developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1356766711428802">Porter (1990)</xref>, the number of studies discussing the important determinants or resources of competitiveness in the tourism sector have increased considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356766711428802">Croes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766711428802">Crouch and Ritchie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356766711428802">Dwyer and Kim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766711428802">Enright and Newton, 2004</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356766711428802">Fabricius, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356766711428802">Faulkner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356766711428802">Formica, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356766711428802">Gomezelj and Mihalic, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356766711428802">Hassan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766711428802">Heath, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356766711428802">Hu and Ritchie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356766711428802">Kayar and Kozak, 2010</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356766711428802">Kim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356766711428802">Kozak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356766711428802">Kozak and Rimmington, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356766711428802">Kunst, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356766711428802">Lee and King, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356766711428802">Omerzel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1356766711428802">Ritchie and Crouch, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1356766711428802">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1356766711428802">2003</xref>). In the existing literature, tourism competitiveness studies have generally concentrated on defining, modeling, and measuring the competitiveness of various tourist destinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356766711428802">Das and DiRienzo, 2009</xref>: 470). With this purpose, many destination competitiveness models have been offered so far that can be classified into three major categories: (1) tourism destination resources and attractors; (2) tourism destination strategies; and (3) tourism destination environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356766711428802">Lee and King, 2006</xref>: 184). </p>
<p>In this study, the authors proposed a model by adapting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766711428802">Enright and Newton’s (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766711428802">Crouch and Ritchie’s (1999)</xref> models. Enright and Newton’s and Crouch and Ritchie’s models are considered to be the most comprehensive studies in the literature, comprising micro and macro economic factors of tourism destinations in the content of competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356766711428802">Lee and King, 2006</xref>: 184). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766711428802">Crouch and Ritchie (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766711428802">Enright and Newton (2004)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356766711428802">Dwyer and Kim (2003)</xref> suggest that competitiveness is dependent on both tourism-specific factors as well as general business factors, and each offer methods and models for measuring the competitiveness of various tourist destinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356766711428802">Das and DiRienzo, 2009</xref>: 470–471). In their research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766711428802">Enright and Newton (2004)</xref> proposed an approach which gathers industry-level competitiveness attributes and conventional tourism destination attributes together. They combined tourism-specific factors of competitiveness (attractors) and generic business factors of competitiveness (business-related factors) in their empirical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711428802">Enright and Newton, 2005</xref>) and compared the competitiveness of Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Singapore as destinations. They classified and measured the tourism-specific factors of the competitiveness into four dimensions. The most beneficial side of their research was giving a classification of tourism-related factors of a destination which formed the basis of the measurement instrument in this article. Another research that inspired the authors of this article was the Crouch-Ritchie Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766711428802">Crouch and Ritchie, 1999</xref>). In their model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766711428802">Crouch and Ritchie (1999)</xref> classified the destination factors into six dimensions: (1) ‘the core resources and attractors’ which include physiography and climate, culture and history, market ties, activities, special events, and the tourism superstructure; (2) ‘supporting factors and resources’ which are infrastructure, accessibility, facilitating resources, hospitality and enterprise; (3) ‘destination management’; (4) ‘destination policy, planning, development’; (5) ‘competitive (micro) environment’; and (6) ‘qualifying and amplifying determinants’. This model has become more comprehensive over time by adding generic business-related factors, captured within the supporting factors, destination management, qualifying determinants, and destination policy, planning, and development, to the tourism-specific factors captured in the core resources and attractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711428802">Enright and Newton, 2005</xref>: 341). As previously mentioned, the authors of this study generated a three dimensional model for identifying the micro economic level determinants of a destinations’ competitiveness derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766711428802">Enright and Newton (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766711428802">Crouch and Ritchie (1999)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1356766711428802">Appendix 1</xref>). The three dimensions are named as: (1) core resources; (2) supporting factors and resources; and (3) qualifying and amplifying determinants that are explained in the methodology section. </p>
<p>Although both reference models contain micro and macro economic competitiveness of the destinations, the authors of this study limited their research to micro economic level competitiveness because of the difficulties in obtaining macro economic data for the subject destination. Therefore, the scope of this study is limited within the business-related and sector-related attributes of the destination. In addition, ‘determinant attributes’ of the subject destination are distinguished and identified according to their characteristics on an IPA matrix. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356766711428802">Myers and Alpert (1968)</xref> used the term ‘determinant’ for the attributes which exert the strongest influence on the competitiveness of tourism destinations. In this study, influence or importance of the attributes directly depend on which grid they position on IPA matrix.   </p>

<title>The importance-performance analysis (IPA)</title>
<p>A widely applied simple analysis technique to understand perceptions of the customers about the main product or service attributes (in this case destination attributes) is the importance-performance analysis (IPA). IPA was originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356766711428802">Martilla and James (1977)</xref>, ‘where importance and performance of brands, products or services are measured on a set of selected attributes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356766711428802">Breiter and Milman, 2006</xref>: 1365). This analysis technique is mostly preferred by researchers because it is easy to apply and to understand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356766711428802">Martilla and James, 1977</xref>: 79). Moreover, IPA facilitates management interpretation of the data and increases their usefulness in making strategic marketing decisions. </p>
<p>At the first stage of the analysis, product or service attributes are determined by literature review or focus group studies (by academicians and managers). Then, respondents are asked to score the importance and performance of each product or service attribute, generally on a Likert-type survey. In the last stage, ‘data from customer satisfaction surveys or service quality surveys with pre-consuming measurement of service attribute importance and perceived performance are utilised to construct a two-dimensional matrix’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356766711428802">Deng et al., 2008</xref>: 39). In this matrix, the x-axis presents attribute importance and the y-axis presents attribute performance (satisfaction or service quality) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356766711428802">Deng and Pei, 2009</xref>: 3775). When combined, the importance and performance axes intersect and produce a four quadrant matrix. Each quadrant of the matrix is named to implicitly indicate the nature of the plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356766711428802">Lee and Lee, 2009</xref>: 925). The first quadrant, ‘concentrate here,’ represents attributes that need to be improved; the second quadrant ‘keep up the good work’ points out attributes of high importance and high performance; the third quadrant ‘low priority’ represents attributes with low importance and low performance and finally the fourth quadrant ‘possible overkill’ shows attributes of low importance but high performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356766711428802">Martilla and James, 1977</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356766711428802">Figure 1</xref>). </p>

</fig>
<p>Diverse methods are used by the researchers to calculate importance and performance scores such as ‘self-stated descriptive measures’ (using mean or median values of the attributes) and ‘more sophisticated statistical measures incorporating correlation analysis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356766711428802">Crompton and Duray, 1985</xref>: 70). In addition, different forms of grid were used for locating importance and performance scores. In traditional ‘quadrant models’, the space is divided into four quadrants where the cross-point is placed in the centre of the scale that is used (e.g. 4 for importance and performance attributes in 7-point scale) while in others, cross-point is placed at the centre of the data (mean or median of the importance-performance attributes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356766711428802">Bacon, 2003</xref>: 58). </p>
<p>In the tourism literature, IPA was used for measuring the service quality, image and overall destination performance issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356766711428802">Chu and  Choi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356766711428802">Deng, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356766711428802">Deng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356766711428802">Lee and Lee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356766711428802">Oh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356766711428802">O’Leary and Deegan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1356766711428802">Smith and Costello, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1356766711428802">Wade and Eagles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1356766711428802">Zhang and Chow, 2004</xref>). For tourism destinations, the comparison between perceived importance and performance on the IPA grid allows industry managers and authorities to identify the relative features of successful destinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1356766711428802">Zhang and Chow, 2004</xref>: 82). However, many of the previous studies only classified attributes into the high, average and below performance destination attributes on an importance-performance matrix. Also, as most studies investigate importance and performance on an aggregate instead of on a segment level, segment-specific differences are not considered and the results therefore are of little use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766711428802">Bruyere et al., 2002</xref>: 82). </p>
<p>It is noticeable that ‘there is little identifiable research that: 1) links the concept of tourism destination competitiveness with the development and evolution of destinations, 2) suggests the relevance or importance of key competitiveness variables to destinations at different stages of development’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1356766711428802">Wilde and Cox, 2008</xref>: 467) in the tourism literature. In fact, numerous and integrated services, which can be observed at the tourism destinations, should be examined in accordance with their importance and their perceived performances by the customers. Herein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356766711428802">Abalo et al.’s (2006)</xref> revised IPA model has the strength in illuminating and clarifying the importance and performances of the goods and services for different market segments (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766711428802">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766711428802">Abalo et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356766711428802">Kotler et al. (1993)</xref> support to segment-based strategy as being critical for destinations that are seeking to become competitive in world markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356766711428802">Hassan, 2000</xref>: 240).</p>

<p>However, IPA technique has its own shortcomings, such as ‘focusing on an object’s own performance in terms of a particular attributes, and ignoring its performance relative to competitors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356766711428802">Burns, 1986</xref>); ‘measuring expectations which are subjects of subjectivity and formed by the market suppliers or by persuasion-based antecedents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356766711428802">Santos and Boote, 2003</xref>: 144); and ‘analyzing complexities (like the possibility of collinearity; usage of linear regression coefficients as importance measures)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766711428802">Abalo et al., 2007</xref>: 117). Therefore many researchers attempted to solve the shortcomings of the IPA model by offering revised versions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356766711428802">Burns, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356766711428802">Deng and Pei, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766711428802">Dolinsky and Caputo, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356766711428802">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356766711428802">Kitcharoen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356766711428802">Lee et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356766711428802">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356766711428802">Liljander and Strandvik, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1356766711428802">Malhotra, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356766711428802">Matzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356766711428802">O’Leary and Adams, 1982</xref>). </p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356766711428802">Abalo et al.’s (2006)</xref> approach is based on the discrepancies between importance and performance values. IPA grid is separated into two parts by a horizontal diagonal line where importance and performance values are equal (market opportunities): ‘With this partition, any attribute with an importance rating greater than the corresponding performance (importance &gt; performance) rating is a candidate for improvement efforts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766711428802">Abola et al., 2007</xref>: 116) and has a negative gap. Vice versa, attributes with higher performance values than importance (performance &gt; importance) values are satisfactory and have a positive gap. The more the negative gap between importance and performance increases, the more the dissatisfaction of the customers will be expected to increase. In this situation, all of the parts above the diagonal line should belong to ‘concentrate here’ factors. Other parts below the isoline can be commented as same with the original model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766711428802">Figure 2</xref>). This approach was preferred in this study because of its superiority in distinguishing the subject attributes.  </p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The categorization of tourism destination competitiveness determinants of this study was derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711428802">Enright and Newton (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766711428802">Crouch and Ritchie’s (1999)</xref> point of view. The three dimensional research model of the study contains: (1) core resources; (2) supporting factors and resources; (3) qualifying and amplifying determinants of the destinations (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1356766711428802">Appendix 1</xref>). </p>
<p>The first section of the questionnaire comprised six demographics and three trip-related questions to determine vacation behaviour of tourists. In the second section, respondents’ perceptions about the importance of the destination attributes were assessed on a 5-point scale respectively with endpoints of (1) ‘totally not important’ to (5) ‘quite important’. Respondents reported their perceptions about the performance of the attributes on a 5-point scale of (1) ‘really bad’ to (5) ‘very good’. Post purchase behaviours of the respondents were measured by their overall satisfaction, perceived value, intention of recommendation and re-purchase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356766711428802">Baker and Crompton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1356766711428802">Petrick, 2004</xref>). The survey instrument was initially written in Turkish and then translated into English, German, Dutch and Russian languages by fluent bilingual experts. </p>
<p>Prior to the execution of the survey, the aim and method of the research were explained to the managers of the various hotels in Side-Manavgat Hoteliers Association (Side-TUDER) who collaborated with the authors and took part in the study. The data for the study were obtained from 41 accommodation facilities in the Side-Manavgat area of Antalya. These facilities were selected by their types (holiday village, five star, four star, three star hotel), locations and capacities with convenience sampling method. The research questionnaires were distributed to each room according to the standard and capacity of the facilities. Completed questionnaires were gathered from the hotel receptionists who received them from the customers. 821 fully answered questionnaires were collected from the four major market segments (German, Russian, British and Dutch). Each data set (according to respondents’ nationalities) was analysed separately and the differences were compared. </p>

<title>General profile of the respondents</title>
<p>The majority of the German and British respondents were male (53.4% and 52.5%, respectively) whereas the majority of the Dutch and Russian respondents were female (53.9% and 67.1%, respectively). Most of the German, Dutch and British respondents were between 41–50 years old, while Russian respondents were generally between 31–40 years old.

<title>Differences of the respondents on their trip-related characteristics and perceived importance-performance of the destination attributes</title>
<p>The trip-related differences among nationalities have been examined by Chi-square analysis and statistically significant results have been obtained for all variables. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1356766711428802">Appendix 2</xref> shows that the majority of the respondents were couples with children. However, this ratio was higher for Dutch respondents than other countries (62.7%). Conversely, German respondents’ ratio of couples without child(ren) was higher than other countries (36.6%). While 19.8% of the Russian respondents preferred to travel with their friends and relatives, this ratio for Dutch respondents was only 8.0%. Reservation via internet was a more popular way of purchase for Dutch and British respondents than German and Russian respondents. Between 8 to 14 days was the most preferred duration of travel, except for the Dutch respondents who usually stay for 15 and above days (31.9%). </p>
<p>Statistically, significant differences were found regarding satisfaction, recommendation and re-purchase intention according to respondents nationalities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356766711428802">Table 1</xref>). In general, means of these three variables were lower for Dutch respondents than other countries. Re-purchase intention means of the British respondents (3.90) were lower than other countries. </p>

<p>The difference between the destination attributes importance and the perceived performances were examined by variance analysis and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1356766711428802">Table 2</xref>. Although their priorities change from country to country, respondents from the four countries agreed with the three destination attributes that are the most important criteria when they decide where to go for the vacation (hospitality, climate and safety). For all respondents, the least important destination attribute was nightlife. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1356766711428802">Table 2</xref> shows that there are considerable and statistically significant differences between the importance of the attributes at the destination for the customers and their perceived performances. For German customers, nightlife is both one of the unimportant attributes and also has the lowest performance score (perceived), if it is compared to the other customers. For the Russian customers, interesting architecture, notable history and heritage, and museums and galleries are more important destination attributes for their destination decisions than other customers. Availability of high quality accommodation facilities are neither important, nor perceived performances high, for the Russian customers than other customers. For the Russian customers, shopping is a much more important destination attribute than other customers; however, its perceived performance is lower than expected.</p>

<p>In the alternative importance-performance graphic for German customers, it calls attention that none of the attributes is located in the ‘possible overkill’ area. For Russian customers, just the interesting architecture attribute is located in this area. In both graphics of Dutch and British customers, interesting architecture, transportation facilities (in the area) and shopping attributes are located in the ‘possible overkill’ zone. In contradistinction to other respondents, for Dutch customers, natural beauty and advanced infrastructure are two attributes additionally located in the ‘possible overkill’ area. In addition, for British customers, notable history and heritage, health and wellness offers, and no language barriers are attributes in the ‘possible overkill’ area. </p>

<p>The ‘keep up the good work’ attributes for German customers are shopping, accessibility (to the area), acceptance of children and no language barriers respectively. For Dutch customers, just the cuisine (gastronomy) attribute is set to this part of the graphic.

In addition to these attributes, for German customers natural beauty, different culture, interesting architecture, notable history and heritage are also seen as the ‘low-priority’ attributes. The second most important market, following the German market, is the Russian Federation, and for Russian customers, different culture and no language barriers are the ‘low priority’ attributes of the destination.</p>

<p>Safety and price/performance ratio (value) are the attributes that should be concentrated on for all respondents. The two attributes that should be concentrated on for British customers are cuisine (gastronomy) and transportation facilities (in the area). For German customers, in addition to these two attributes, advanced infrastructure, hospitality, health and wellness offers should be considered. For Dutch customers, health, wellness offers and no language barriers are the attributes which are needed to be improved. Because the numbers of such attributes are many for the Russian customers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766711428802">Figure 3</xref> should be examined for a better clarification.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In tourism destinations, authorities and managers try to obtain the most benefit from the attributes they own. With this purpose, they measure the customer perception about the existing attributes so that they can offer satisfying services in the future. One of the most appropriate techniques for that kind of market analyses is IPA which is generally preferred for its ease of use and high diagnostic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356766711428802">Martilla and James, 1977</xref>). For many years, this analysis technique has been widely used in service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356766711428802">Ennew et al., 1993</xref>), tourism and travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356766711428802">Go and Zhang, 1997</xref>) and other research areas. However, alternative versions have been generated because of the critiques upon its shortcomings. One of the most important critiques to this technique was its potential to present inaccurate results and comparisons depending on the nonexistent average user/customer without identifying any market segmentation. Fundamentally, market segmentation gives high opportunities to researchers to compare customers importance and performance diversities. In this regard, IPA is a very useful technique which may help them to make more meaningful comparisons and easily understand sample characteristics. </p>
<p>The aim of this study was to obtain importance-performance scores for the general destination attributes in order to understand which attributes had been perceived as highly successful, low priority, over-regarded, or should be improved according to their importance and performance in the eye of customers. Thus, the authors of this article employed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766711428802">Abalo et al.’s (2007)</xref> revised IPA and examined various market segments one by one, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766711428802">Bruyere et al.’s (2002)</xref> suggestion that IPA offers limited benefits if the target groups are not homogeneous. Therefore, IPA without a segmentation component will produce results for an average user and will have minimal practical value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766711428802">Bruyere et al., 2002</xref>: 82). Moreover, misleading results can be obtained if different segments are combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356766711428802">Farnum and Hall, 2007</xref>: 67). The analysis results indicated that the importance-performance scores of the attributes for various market segments were statistically different. These findings certified that the role of attributes for customer satisfaction as well as destination competitiveness should have been examined respectively for heterogeneous market segments.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766711428802">Abola et al.’s (2007)</xref> revised IPA technique was adapted as the research method of this study. The authors computed IPA ratings and prepared separate IPA grids for four major markets (Germany, Holland, the UK and the Russian Federation) in order to obtain homogeneous market groups. In general, security and price performance were the common attributes of the destination for all market groups, although other attributes were positioned in different quadrants of the IPA grid.</p>
<p>Statistically significant differences among trip-related characteristics of the respondents were found according to their nationalities. Similarly, statistically significant differences were noticed between the importance of the attributes for destination selection and their perceived performances according to respondents’ nationalities. These results support the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1356766711428802">Turner et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356766711428802">Lee and Lee (2009)</xref> who found significant behavioural differences depending on the respondents’ nationalities.</p>
<p>Micro-level (business-related and sector-related) competitiveness variables of the destination were positioned in different quadrants according to the nationalities of the customers from the IPA results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356766711428802">Table 3</xref>). Among ‘Core resources &amp; attractors’, climate and high quality of accommodation figured between ‘concentrate here’ and ‘keep up the good work’ quadrants, which meant that these attributes were both favourable and improvable. For all nationalities, museums and galleries, and nightlife had low priority. For three countries out of four (except British customers), different culture had low priority. This finding shows that destination was perceived as a typical resort preferred by the relaxation/recreation seeking customers. As the customers were also not interested in nightlife facilities, their major motivation of holiday might have been relaxation rather than recreation. For the Russian customers only, history and heritage was a ‘keep up the good work’ attribute. </p>

<p>In the category of ‘Supporting factors &amp; resources’, accessibility (to the area) and acceptance of children were the most favoured attributes of the destination in general. This result pointed out the importance of travel comfort and child friendly facilities due to the majority of the respondents being couples with or without children (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1356766711428802">Appendix 2</xref>). While German customers were satisfied with (keep up the good work) the shopping facilities of the destination, the Russian customers needed to be more spirited up (concentrate here) for shopping by attractive goods or services. On the other hand, additional efforts for improving shopping facilities would have been a possible overkill for Dutch and the British customers, who were less interested in shopping than other customers. Transportation facilities (in the area) were favoured by German and Dutch customers. However, the Russian customers were not keen to use local transportation vehicles.  </p>
<p>In the category of ‘Qualifying &amp; amplifying determinants’, safety and value were found as the ‘concentrate here’ attributes. Therefore, destination authorities and managers should pay more attention for increasing the performance of safety and value issues, as the customers think that these attributes are important for their holiday experiences.    </p>

<title>Suggestions and managerial implications</title>
<p>In this article, a revised version of IPA has been used to identify attributes that are critical to high- perceived service quality and customer satisfaction. Instead of using the traditional quadrant analysis, an isoline where performance equals performance was applied to define priorities for customer satisfaction management. Compared to traditional IPA, this approach has two important advantages. First, traditional IPA usually uses means to distinguish between high and low performance and high and low importance, and therefore classifies the attributes in a somewhat arbitrary way. Using the isoline, the arbitrary classification is avoided. Second, the diagnostic value is greater, as by matching importance to performance, it can be more specifically determined to what extend performance of an attribute should be increased or decreased. Utilising this context, the findings of the present study could be held as evidence that the revised version of IPA analysis can give valuable insights and yield important theoretical and managerial implications. This technique offers beneficial findings to researchers and practitioners by identifying the importance and performance evaluations of different market segments about the existing destination attributes which form the whole tourism product. In this era of global competition, tourism product is no longer homogeneous or static; inversely, it is much more enhanced and complicated than ever before. Thus, in order to improve their products or services, and to generate new attraction factors (artificial or natural) for the future, destination authorities and managers need to measure the success of the attributes they offer to their customers by using contemporary statistical techniques such as IPA; this is vital if they want to compete against other destinations.  </p>
<p>A second implication derives from the segment differences. It has been shown that the attributes differ in their importance and performance among the segments studied here. This is another important managerial implication, as it shows that the application of IPA on an aggregate level does not yield any meaningful results. The most appropriate way to apply IPA is on a segment basis.</p>
<p>Finally, the results of this study showed that destination authorities and managers need to understand that various market segments might have different kinds of importance and performance perception about the destination attributes. Therefore, statistical analyses for measuring customer perception about the destination attributes should be accepted as an ongoing process. Moreover, these attributes contributing to destination competitiveness represent a dynamic category that influences, over time, the increase or reduction of the tourist destination’s competitive capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356766711428802">Kunst, 2009</xref>: 137). In this instance, strategic management perspective based on long-term planning, and measurement and assessment principles, may serve the competitiveness efforts of the destination authorities and managers. </p>
