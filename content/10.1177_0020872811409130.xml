<p>For many clients, religion is a fundamental component of their identity. Furthermore, for women, people who are poor, and minority groups, religion often plays a particularly salient role. As a powerful shaper of personal identity, religion influences a host of beliefs and behaviors of interest to social workers, from communication styles to health care practices. Put differently, religions provide adherents with a worldview, suppositional matrix, or a culturally shared narrative through with to understand and interpret existence.</p>
<p>In recognition of this reality, Furness and Gilligan offer an important new text designed to address the following three issues: 1) the impact of religion on users and practitioners of social work in the UK, 2) the degree to which the social work profession takes into account religion in the pursuit of culturally competent practice, and 3) the specific issues that often require social workers to attend to religion in professional practice and social policy in the UK. In short, the text encourages readers to become more sensitized and committed to learning about religion.</p>
<p>To set the stage, the text begins by reviewing legislation, policies, and procedures that highlight the importance of taking clients’ religious values into consideration in practice. This provides a context for a review of various models that have been developed to assist practitioners develop cultural competence in the area of religion. The authors then present their own framework, which can be integrated with existing models.</p>
<p>The Furness/Gilligan framework is then applied to real-life case examples in subsequent chapters. These chapters discuss the intersection of religion and social work with children and families; older adults; the abuse of children and adults; mental health; learning disabilities; and migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. The text concludes by discussing some of the contributions and conflicts regarding faith-based social work, offering some summary comments regarding best practices, and briefly reviewing the key tenets of six major religions.</p>
<p>This text is characterized by numerous strengths. The Furness/Gilligan framework for assessing the significance of religion in assessment, intervention, and evaluation is well conceptualized and readily applied in practice settings. The framework itself consists of eight questions that practitioners are encouraged to reflect on during service provision. Regardless of the specific assessment tool used to explore clients’ religion in practice settings, reflection on these questions will enhance service provision. The framework serves as sort of a meta-consciousness raising tool to help ensure optimal services.</p>
<p>In an innovative turn in social work discourse, the authors define religion broadly as encompassing both religious and spiritual beliefs that impact clients’ understandings, regardless of whether these understandings are expressed in more traditional forms, such as Catholicism, or more alternative forms, such as the New Age or goddess spirituality movements. In so doing, the authors place a wide range of traditional and non-traditional religions under the protection of policies that directly address religion, such as the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which bans religious discrimination and affirms religious freedom.</p>
<p>The chapters are filled with helpful precepts to guide practitioners’ interactions in the area of religion. The authors affirm the importance of the strengths perspective, the centrality of respecting cultural differences, and the notion that all belief systems are socially constructed, to list just some. Helpful case studies are used throughout the text to illustrate key points and chapters typically conclude with a list of questions that serve to drive home important ‘take away’ points in a thought-provoking manner.</p>
<p>The book is also filled with insightful information that will help practitioners provide more culturally relevant services to clients. For instance, the chapter on religious migrants, refuges, and asylum seekers contains content that can help practitioners advocate for individuals applying for asylum due to religious persecution, one of the most under-recognized human rights problems in the world. To illustrate the level of religious illiteracy among immigration judges, the authors relate a case where an asylum seeker was asked such culturally irrelevant questions as ‘how do you cook a turkey for Christmas’ to assess the depth and character of the individual’s Christian faith. Suggestions are provided to help sensitize judges to culture issues so that asylum seekers are not returned to their home countries where they may face discrimination, imprisonment, and torture.</p>
<p>Although this text is characterized by many strengths, some room for improvement may also exist in a couple of areas. For instance, future editions might benefit from additional application of the principles of anti-oppressive practice in the area of religion. Discrimination based on religion is a growing problem in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872811409130">ComRes, 2009</xref>), as seen in the recent case of a black Christian couple who were denied the right to care for foster children by the High Court solely due to their religious beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811409130">Ross, 2011</xref>), the use of government surveillance cameras in Muslim areas, the mass-mailing of anti-Semitic literature, and other incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872811409130">Christian Institute, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872811409130">US Department of State, 2010</xref>). The text might be strengthened by adding content to help practitioners oppose the root causes of religious discrimination at a structural level while simultaneously advocating for the religious rights of their clients.</p>
<p>Similarly, the text might also benefit from giving additional consideration to articulating the perspectives of various religious groups in a manner that is consistent with their understanding of reality. For example, to suggest that groups such as the Social Work Christian Fellowship (SWCF) are ‘exclusive’ because they affirm a set of values and assumptions that differ from those affirmed by the dominant secular culture is unhelpful in terms of promoting cultural competence. It is widely accepted that all worldviews tend to assume their values and assumptions about reality are correct, normal and rational. No doubt, from the perspective of the SWCF, the values and assumptions of the secular culture seem equally exclusive. To work effectively with those from different cultures, it is critical to deconstruct dominant cultural biases and develop the ability to see, understand, and articulate the world through the eyes of culturally subordinate worldviews in an empathetic manner. To be clear, the text represents a significant step forward in this regard; but some room for improvement may exist in this area.</p>
<p>In their concluding remarks, the authors state they hope they have made a compelling case for practitioners and educators to attend to religion as a part of developing cultural competency. There is little doubt that they have succeeded in this task. This is an important text that helps move the conversation forward in the UK and elsewhere. Practitioners and educations who read this text will be better situated to provide more ethical and professional services to clients for whom religion is a salient life dimension. Anyone interested in providing better services to clients can benefit from reading this book.</p>
