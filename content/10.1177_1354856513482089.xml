<p>This extended Debates section brings together a collection of articles based on papers presented at the symposium ‘Transmedia Generation: On Empowered and Impassioned Audiences in the Age of Media Convergence’, which took place on 18 June 2012 in Prague, Czech Republic. The event was sprinkled with stardust thanks to the participation of Henry Jenkins. In spite of (or rather because of) Jenkins’ appearance, we tried to avoid straightforwardly uniform reverberation of his key thesis about the creative potential of media audiences. On the contrary, the symposium – as well as this Debates section – took the appearance of Jenkins’ paradigmatic figure as an opportunity for sparking a discussion. </p>
<p>Not that there is any shortage of it. The study of media audiences’ agency has been fully saturated with polemic. The dispute over audiences’ self-determination as opposed to external structural determination has been long impersonated in the controversy between cultural studies and critical theory/political economy. Reflecting the sociological matrix of the dilemma between structure and agency, mirrored in the dichotomy of ‘structuralism’ and ‘culturalism’ in cultural studies coined by Stuart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354856513482089">Hall (1986</xref>: 33–48), revived a countless number of times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856513482089">Kellner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856513482089">McGuigan, 1992</xref>), and having survived attempts for integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856513482089">Babe, 2011</xref>), the clash between cultural studies and critical theory still shapes the field and produces an ongoing polemic.</p>
<p>Despite the long-lasting exchange, the borderline separating the two paradigmatic camps does not seem to shift – there has been no consensus and neither of the two paradigms has prevailed. It seems that the polemic between cultural studies and critical theory is showing its limits; the disparity of perspectives concentrated on structures on one hand and actors on the other is so vast that it significantly reduces chances for cross-fertilization. What looks like a polemic is in fact rather ‘the War of the Roses’ – kind of a cooking contest in preparing the most piquant pâté made out of the partner’s favourite lapdog. </p>
<p>Myra Marx Ferree et al. address the weakness of the deliberative process (with regard to deliberation in the public sphere) by pointing to the tacit assumption that ‘the participants are part of the same moral community, sharing basic values’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856513482089">2002</xref>: 303). If we apply this model to scholarly communication, we could argue that a fruitful dialogue in the humanities and social sciences is possible, providing that the two parties are at least minimally reconcilable and that they are the members of the same <italic>paradigmatic community</italic>. This Debates section of <italic>Convergence</italic> therefore grounds the criticism of the utopia of participation in a slightly different logic. It promotes criticism made from within the same paradigmatic community. This type of criticism acknowledges the legitimacy of the main concepts of both universes – and simultaneously, the more respectfully it treats the main frameworks, the more it nitpicks about the details.</p>
<p>The need to transform the logic of reciprocal criticism follows from the fact that cultural and critical views of media audiences gradually acquired the character of counter-positioned grand narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856513482089">Lyotard, 1984</xref>). Both the theory of determining the power of structure (media industry and mass culture) and the theory of the self-determining power of agency (inter/activity and creativity of audiences) are the stories of the nature of humanity and its freedom. Some of them were even explicitly formulated as monumental visions, as was the case of Nicholas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856513482089">Negroponte’s panegyric of ‘being digital’ (1996)</xref> or Pierre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856513482089">Lévy’s prognosis of ‘new cognitive ecology’ (2001)</xref>. Most of the research on the participatory nature of new media audiences has much more rigorous methodological foundations; nevertheless, it reinforces the same grand narrative. Tedious and rather unproductive debate between the two <italic>provinces of meaning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856513482089">Schutz, 1962</xref>: 230) – cultural and critical approaches to new media audiences – inspires us to propose that the grand narratives that now occupy the field of the study of new media audiences deserve a serious ‘shrinking’. </p>
<p>However distant these two issues are, we can compare the debate on participation with the development of the research of media effects. It will soon celebrate its centenary and still the field has no firm answer to the question of media effects. David Gauntlett ironically touches on this point by distinguishing ‘the question of effects and the effect of wrong questions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856513482089">2005</xref>: 13). At least four periods in which opinions on media effects varied enormously were distinguished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856513482089">DeFleur and Ball-Rokeach, 1989</xref>) – and the result is resignation to pursue a universal model of media effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856513482089">Perse, 2001</xref>: 23). The field has come to see that no all-encompassing (and intellectually monumental) explanation, but only particular cases with their validity restrained to their contexts, can be found.</p>
<p>This mirror image of the current state of the debate on participation and affordances of new media shows that it fell into a similar trap of looking for a <italic>universal model </italic>of media participation. Therefore, we wish to scale down the present grand narratives by replacing the grand question ‘Do new media have participatory potential or not?’ with more minute questions of what kind of participation is practiced by whom, under what social circumstances, for what purposes, and so on.</p>
<p>Our opening text, the conversation between Henry Jenkins and Nico Carpentier, suggests different intensities of participation matter. The dialogue, which constitutes the axis of this Debates section, follows this direction from big theoretical concepts to accounts of hands-on research and very specific examples of sites of participation (or lack thereof). While Jenkins brings in nuanced understanding of the participating actors and groups, their practices and motivations, Carpentier contributes a nuanced understanding of the normative assumptions about participation and compares them with the ideals of radical democracy. Far from a fiery showdown, the debate reveals that sweeping paradigmatic claims dissolve as soon as one focuses on the details of actual participatory practices – at that point, other essential topics like organization, leadership, and education emerge. The conversation also shows that although the theoretical and methodological tools employed by the two disciplines may differ, the underlying motivation of the two scholars that represent them in the debate is the same: to understand and to foster participation that matters. This common goal is also what made the conversation happen: having met at the symposium and taken part in the final panel discussion, Jenkins and Carpentier engaged in an intense dialogue as soon as the event ended, carried it on throughout the dinner and then, taking advantage of being ‘networked’, continued remotely.</p>
<p>Carpentier’s article, co-authored with Peter Dahlgren and Francesca Pasquali, provides a historical and theoretical context to the participation debate. Arguing that the notion of audiences fighting for and claiming a higher degree of participation in the media predates digital media, it interestingly mirrors Jenkins’ essay <italic>What Happened Before YouTube</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856513482089">2009</xref>), which demonstrated that fan video production is not an invention of YouTube. </p>
<p>Drawing theoretical inspiration from a set of audience research projects, Jakub Macek argues for a renewed interest in ‘performance’ in the study of online interaction and participation. He investigates curation of content as self-performance situated in the contexts of everyday life. Rather than assessing the process or results of curation, he focuses on what drives people to share content, identifying a dialectic of the will to conform to a group and the will to stand out as unique individuals. </p>
<p>Jaroslav Švelch’s contribution, based on a case study of fan translation practices, provides a detailed foray into the micropolitics of online participation. Looking closely at user comments on a fan subtitling website, he identifies the reasons why users tend not to participate in the critique of fan subtitles, concluding that they often remain in ‘silent gratitude’ for the free content they receive and do not wish to confront the expert translator.</p>
<p>In her article about Bollywood flash mobs, Sangita Shresthova blurs the untenable lines between online and locative performance and between ‘cultural’ and ‘political’ participation. Using an example of a 2011 flash mob in Mumbai, she finds that the implicit political meanings of an event that was (supposedly) staged ‘just for fun’ were quickly picked up by the people who circulated its recording online. Ending on an optimistic note, she shows that a pursuit of fun in a collective performance can be closely aligned with a pursuit of a more open public sphere.</p>
<p>Moving from theory to case studies, this Debates section shows how the study of participation can benefit from a dialogue between cultural and critical approaches. Rather than celebrating or dismissing the concept of participation, we need to invest it with meaning – to identify, examine, question, and critique it in its specific contexts. </p>
