<abstract>
<p>This article expands current knowledge of the impact that brief but intense religious experiences can have on routine behavior by examining the long-term effects of short-term mission travel on both volunteering and charitable giving. Existing literature addresses only the first few years after travel. Using data from the 2005 Religion and Global Issues Survey, I examine how participation in a domestic or international religious mission trip in high school influences adults’ volunteering and giving behavior. I also consider alternate explanations that may account for the relationship between high school mission-trip participation and current giving or volunteering, including demographic factors, religious beliefs and practices, and other forms of civic engagement. I find adolescent participation in a domestic short-term mission trip has a significant, positive influence on the likelihood of volunteering for either a local or an internationally focused organization as an adult. In contrast, adolescent participation in a domestic mission trip has a significant dampening effect on charitable giving to secular organizations. I find no significant associations between international high school trips and adult volunteering and giving when additional factors are taken into account. I discuss the implications of these results for the ways church leaders and scholars think about the mechanisms through which brief, transformative religious experiences influence beliefs and behavior over the course of a lifetime.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When measuring the relationship between youth experiences and adult behavior, social scientists tend to look at stable characteristics or routine, habitual actions. Youth involved in extracurriculars, who attend church regularly, or who volunteer regularly all demonstrate higher rates of voting, volunteering, and political engagement as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091829612475166">Frisco et al., 2004</xref>). Less is known about the impact that brief, intense experiences may have on future attitudes and behavior. Yet religious narratives often stress these “road to Damascus” moments: dramatic, inspirational, and brief events that shift one’s trajectory and influence future action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091829612475166">Hindmarsh, 2008</xref>). In religious communities, the conviction that brief, intense experiences can influence attitudes and behaviors can be seen in the increasing presence of short-term mission trips in the programs offered by congregations.</p>
<p>Approximately 32% of US congregations sponsor international mission trips each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091829612475166">Wuthnow, 2009</xref>). While travelers of all ages participate, travel opportunities largely target youth. Forty-one percent of US teens report participation in a mission trip or religious service project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475166">Trinitapoli and Vaisey, 2009</xref>). Religious communities invest extensive financial, programmatic, and staff resources into the transformative promise of short-term mission travel, despite a dearth of evidence either supporting or refuting the claims that brief excursions produce lifelong dividends.</p>
<p>Existing research provides clear evidence that short-term mission travel influences the beliefs and practices of adolescents and emerging adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475166">Trinitapoli and Vaisey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091829612475166">Beyerlein et al., 2011</xref>). Whether such effects last into adulthood or fade over time remains unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091829612475166">Ver Beek (2008)</xref> suggests mission trip participants are like saplings: the experience of travel may bend them in a particular direction, but without additional reinforcement, they will return to their pre-travel shape or trajectory. Research on church attendance and denominational switching appears to support this claim. Demographics and childhood socialization matter to adult religious participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091829612475166">Sherkat, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091829612475166">Hoge and O’Connor, 2004</xref>). However, studies also show that recent experiences, like current social networks or life-course milestones, matter more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091829612475166">Cornwall, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091829612475166">Hoge et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091829612475166">Regnerus and Uecker, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This article examines whether and to what extent adolescent participation in either a domestic or an international short-term mission trip is associated with higher levels of civic engagement during adulthood. The 2005 Religion and Global Issues Survey (RGIS) is currently the only nationally representative sample of church-going adults to include data about prior short-term mission trip experiences. I use these data to conduct multivariate analyses on the relationship between high school mission trip participation and five measures of adult volunteering and giving behavior among Christian respondents. These measures include three kinds of volunteering: for a charitable organization, for a local community group, and for an organization with an international focus. They also include two types of charitable giving: to one’s local congregation and to secular organizations.</p>
<p>These analyses advance our current understanding of the relationship between short-term mission travel and civic engagement in three ways. First, while the data are not longitudinal (they do not track people over time), they do allow comparisons of the civic engagement of travelers and non-travelers from multiple generations, providing the first truly long-term look at whether or not high school mission trip participation is associated with significant differences in adult volunteering and charitable giving.</p>
<p>Second, the data allow me to specify geographic contexts of travel, demonstrating differences in the influence of domestic and international trip participation on adult civic engagement. “Mission trips” is an umbrella term that captures a broad range of activities, as is “volunteering.” Here, I distinguish between domestic and international trip experiences, finding distinct effects of each kind of experience on each of five civic engagement outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, the analyses isolate the relative influence of mission trips and other important predictors of adult civic engagement. Adults who took a mission trip in high school may simply be pre-disposed to be active citizens; this life-long disposition may predict <italic>both</italic> adolescent trip participation <italic>and</italic> adult volunteering or charitable giving. Regression analyses take into account factors that might indicate such a pre-disposition, helping to distinguish the effects of trip participation from factors that influence both adolescent and adult civic engagement. Analyses also consider whether other, post-travel experiences, such as church participation, might wholly account for any remaining differences between adults who did and did not participate in a high school mission trip. I conclude by discussing the implications these analyses have for understanding the mechanisms through which a brief but formative adolescent event like short-term mission travel can influence adult behavior.</p>

<title>Studying Mission Trips</title>
<p>The extent of mission trip participation in the United States is unclear; existing counts tend to exclude certain kinds of travel or certain populations of travelers. Over 1.6 million adult churchgoers travel on international mission trips each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091829612475166">Wuthnow, 2009</xref>). Practitioners’ conservative estimates indicate two million to four million annual participants in domestic work or service projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091829612475166">Peterson et al., 2003</xref>). According to the RGIS, 14.9% of adult Christian churchgoers went on a mission trip during high school.</p>
<p>The practices and goals of mission trips are diverse, but some common characteristics can be identified. By definition, mission trips involve leaving one’s local community. Most mission trips (83%) last less than two weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091829612475166">Wuthnow, 2009</xref>). While trips are brief, they are not necessarily once-in-a-lifetime experiences. For some adults, mission trips are an annual practice. Examining the likelihood and effects of repeated trip participation is a subject future research should consider.</p>
<p>Trip goals and practices vary greatly and may include evangelism, service provision, cultural immersion, education, or social justice advocacy. The majority of trips involve some kind of service project in an impoverished community. While evangelism is the most frequently reported goal of short-term mission travel, the activity of “evangelism” is not always limited to proselytizing or conversion efforts; service projects and humanitarian aid can also be referred to as a form of evangelism. An estimated 84% of international travelers (and all domestic travelers) go to places where the Christian church is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091829612475166">Priest and Priest, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0091829612475166">
<title>Trip Outcomes</title>
<p>Missiologists and researchers have examined a wide variety of attitudes and behaviors that short-term mission trip participation is hypothesized to impact. Researchers have considered the effects of mission trips on travelers’ spiritual life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091829612475166">Jones, 1998</xref>) and their attitudes about cultural sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091829612475166">Blezein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091829612475166">Priest et al., 2006</xref>) or paternalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091829612475166">Park, 2008</xref>). Others have looked at whether trip participation is associated with increased pro-social behavior, like church attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475166">Trinitapoli and Vaisey, 2009</xref>), charitable giving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091829612475166">Purvis, 1993</xref>), or social justice advocacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091829612475166">Crabtree, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Two tangible outcomes have been most frequently discussed in the literature on short-term mission trips: civic engagement and charitable giving. Sociologists find teen participants in short-term mission travel have higher participation in political activity, informal and formal volunteering, and charitable giving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091829612475166">Beyerlein et al., 2011</xref>). Scholars of social movements argue religious travel can play an important role in recruitment, particularly for high-risk activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091829612475166">Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091829612475166">Nepstad, 2004</xref>). Here, I consider whether mission trip participation continues to have important associations with higher levels of civic engagement among adults. I examine three volunteering contexts: general volunteering for charitable or social service programs, volunteering within one’s local community, and volunteering for an organization with an international focus.</p>
<p>Several studies report increases in charitable giving among mission trip participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091829612475166">Peterson and Peterson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091829612475166">McDonough and Peterson, 1999</xref>). Critics argue these studies inadequately control for inflation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091829612475166">Ver Beek, 2009</xref>) and for changes in giving attributable to age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091829612475166">Priest et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091829612475166">Ver Beek (2006)</xref> cross-referenced reports of donations to a particular sending agency with that agency’s donor records and found no differences in pre-and post-trip giving. However, the effects of mission trip participation on charitable giving may not be so direct. Some studies measure only donations made to the mission agency that sponsored travel; others focus on changes within travelers (which are confounded by issues of inflation and aging). Here, I compare travelers and non-travelers rather than within-individual changes over time. I also examine giving to one’s local congregation and to secular organizations rather than to the specific mission agency that facilitated travel.</p>
<p>My analyses take into account both pre-trip and post-trip experiences that might account for differences in adult volunteering and giving between people who did and did not participate in a domestic or international high school mission trip. Following the literature on the relative influence of youth and adult experiences, I consider the effects of current church involvement on civic engagement. Next, I consider whether the relationship between trip participation and giving or volunteering is an artifact of being a socially active person by including measures of <italic>disengagement</italic> in civic life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091829612475166">Jackson et al., 1995</xref>). The literature strongly suggests these other factors—from demographics to more recent, habitual action—will be more powerful than any lingering direct effects that high school mission trip participation might have on adult volunteering or charitable giving behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0091829612475166">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The 2005 Religion and Global Issues Survey (RGIS) is a nationally representative survey of “active church members” who are 18 or older and was conducted by sociologist Robert Wuthnow (Princeton University). By design, the phone survey aimed to reach adults who “attend religious services at least once a month,” yielding a sample of what Wuthnow calls “active church members,” wherein 95% of respondents report monthly-or-greater church attendance. While the data set is not yet publicly available, I had access to the complete data set in conducting these analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0091829612475166">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The RGIS is designed to investigate the international outreach of its respondents and their congregations. The survey includes additional measures of religious beliefs and social outreach, including current volunteering and charitable giving and retrospective accounts of high school church involvement. As of this writing, the RGIS is one of two national surveys that includes data about mission trip participation and the only such survey that includes data about adults over the age of 28.</p>
<p>The RGIS has 2231 respondents with a cooperation rate of 68.4% and a response rate of 56.2%. In these analyses, I consider only Christian respondents, bringing the total sample to 2141 cases. Only seven of the 90 non-Christian respondents report participation in a high school mission trip. There are simply not enough cases in each category of non-Christian respondents to assess the meaning of high school mission trip participation for these groups. Like most surveys, the RGIS has missing data, particularly for questions about financial matters, including charitable giving. In these analyses, I use multiple imputation techniques to estimate missing responses to both dependent and independent variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0091829612475166">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The RGIS provides unique data, but it has a few weaknesses worth noting. First, the sample underrepresents two important populations of high school mission trip participants: younger adults and those who have disengaged from church participation. The populations most likely to participate in short-term mission trips as teens—younger Americans—are also less likely to be reached by a landline telephone survey. The underrepresentation of these persons might lead to results that underplay the strength of an association between high school trips and volunteering or giving. On the other hand, the survey also underrepresents people who may have had high church involvement in their youth but currently do not attend religious services. Thus, these data may not capture the association between trip participation and current behavior for those whose participation in religious organizations has decreased over time.</p>
<p>Second, the survey’s focus on international outreach offers imperfect measures of contemporary social networks and domestic outreach practices, two factors likely to influence charitable giving and volunteering. Finally, questions about high school experiences require respondents to recall information that is, in some cases, over 50 years in the past. The passage of time may have variable effects on participants’ abilities to accurately recall past experiences. However, inconsistent recall is unlikely to be a major concern when it comes to whether or not one participated in an activity as distinctive as a mission trip, which always involves travel to another community and often involves deliberate cultivation of spiritually or personally intense introspection.</p>
<sec id="section5-0091829612475166">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>The RGIS asks three yes or no questions about volunteering activities. The first question asks if respondents are currently involved in “any charity or social service activities, such as helping the poor, the sick, or the elderly.” The second asks if respondents currently volunteer in their local community. The third asks if respondents have volunteered for “an organization that is specifically concerned with helping people in other countries” in the past year. I model the effects of high school mission trip participation on each of these questions separately.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091829612475166">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics for each variable in these analyses. Overall, between one fifth and two fifths of respondents report volunteering, with 36.8% volunteering for a charity, 40.4% for a local community organization, and 20.5% volunteering for an organization focused on helping people in other countries.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091829612475166">Table 1</xref> reports the median and mean giving in dollars and the mean and standard deviation of the variables after they have been transformed to a scale more suitable for use in regression analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0091829612475166">5</xref></sup> Only 2.6% of respondents gave no money to their local congregations in the previous year, while nearly one third (31.6%) gave no money to secular organizations. Overall, median giving to local congregations is $1446, while median giving to secular organizations is $119. (I also calculated charitable giving as a percentage of annual income. Results of multivariate analyses were comparable to analyses of absolute giving and are therefore not shown here.)</p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<sec id="section7-0091829612475166">
<title>High school mission trip participation</title>
<p>The RGIS asks respondents, “in high school, how involved were you in church activities?” For those who report any high school church activity, a follow up question asks, “Did you go on a mission trip as part of these church activities?” Those reporting trip participation are also asked whether their experience was domestic, international, or both. A total of 320 respondents reported participation in at least one mission trip in high school, traveling either internationally (N=84), domestically (N=229) or both (N=7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0091829612475166">6</xref></sup> Here, I include those who traveled both domestically and internationally in the category of “international” trips (for a total of 91 cases). By examining the different influences of domestic and international travel on volunteer behavior aimed at either local or international communities and on either religious or secular charitable giving, I am able to test the ways the geographic contexts of mission trips may influence different volunteering and giving contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0091829612475166">
<title>Religious beliefs and practices</title>
<p>Present-day religious beliefs and practices are likely to have as much or more influence on current patterns of giving and volunteering as does an experience from the past, no matter how intense. I include several measures of current religious beliefs and practices. Measures of belief include whether or not the Bible is “to be taken literally” and whether or not respondents agree strongly with the statement “People of faith have a moral responsibility to learn about problems in other parts of the world and do what they can to help.” Measures of practices include frequency of church attendance (coded 1 for more-than-weekly attendance, 0 for weekly or less) and frequency of prayer (coded 1 for daily or more frequent prayer, 0 for less). To measure depth of congregational involvement, I include indicators of holding a leadership position in the congregation and whether or not respondents report having friends in their congregation (a dichotomous variable coded 1 for yes and 0 for no).</p>
<p>Recent mission trip participation might account for higher levels of volunteering or giving among those who also traveled in high school. The RGIS does not measure domestic mission trip participation past high school or the timing or frequency of other forms of international travel. However, it does include the question, “During the past year, have you gone to another country on a religious missions trip?” About 1 in 50 (2.1%) respondents have done so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0091829612475166">
<title>Civic engagement</title>
<p>The association between participation in a high school mission trip and giving or volunteering as an adult may be due to an underlying and long-standing tendency to be a highly engaged citizen: a “joiner” or a “do-gooder.” Or, travel may inspire greater value of active citizenship, leading to greater civic engagement. Data from the RGIS cannot be used to tease out the complicated causal links between high school travel, recent experience with civic engagement, and current volunteering or giving practices. However, the data can tell us whether a past experience continues to have an independent association with current volunteering when other recent experiences of civic engagement—or its lack—are taken into account.</p>
<p>I include two measures of civic “disengagement” or a “non-joiner” tendency to better understand the relationship between past travel, adult orientations to civic action, and current giving or volunteering activity. The first asks whether respondents voted in the 2004 presidential election. The second is a dichotomous variable measuring respondents’ lack of engagement in a variety of international outreach activities in the past year, including: donating to international relief projects; signing a petition or contacting a government official about an international issue; participating in a church meeting about “war, peace, refugees, or some other international issue”; and attending a meeting where a missionary was the main speaker. A respondent who indicates no participation in any of these four measures is coded as having “no international outreach.” This variable is intended to measure the breadth of civic involvement of respondents—their tendency to <italic>not</italic> be a “joiner” or an actively engaged citizen. Of course, these measures cannot fully account for volunteers or donors who are highly active but focused on their local communities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0091829612475166">
<title>Demographic controls</title>
<p>Previous research has found that the likelihood of trip participation is influenced by religious denomination at the time of travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091829612475166">Smith and Denton, 2005</xref>), parental religiosity, youth religiosity, and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091829612475166">Trinitapoli and Vaisey, 2009</xref>). The RGIS includes data on two of these factors: youth religiosity and age. About one sixth of respondents (16.3%) report being “extremely active” in church activities as youth. Age at time of travel varies little, since respondents all report traveling during high school. However, current age provides an indicator of the time elapsed since travel, which may affect the impact of trip participation on current civic engagement. I measure age using five cohorts of roughly ten years each: 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60 and older.</p>
<p>Other demographic features that may influence both the likelihood of adolescent mission trip participation and adult rates of volunteering and giving include gender, race (black, white, or some other race), and place of birth (the United States or some other country). Religious denomination matters to both the likelihood of travel and to current volunteering and giving rates. However, the data provide no information about religious affiliation in high school. The controls for current religious affiliation compare Catholics, Evangelicals, Fundamentalists, and other Christians to a reference group of mainline Protestants. Past research suggests Catholics give less and Evangelicals give more in charitable donations than other Christian groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091829612475166">Regnerus et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091829612475166">Bekkers and Wiepking, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional controls known to affect rates of volunteering or giving include educational attainment and income. Education is categorized as those who hold a graduate degree, a college degree, or have less than a four-year degree. Income is measured on an ordinal scale of 1–8.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>I analyze the relationship between transformative religious travel and two tangible outcomes—volunteering and charitable giving—using logit and tobit regression modeling techniques, respectively. Each statistical technique is chosen to best fit the structure of the outcome variables. Logit regression techniques are ideal for measuring binary outcomes, such as whether or not a person volunteers. A tobit regression model best fits continuous outcome variables that are censored at one or both ends, such as charitable giving, where the minimum possible value is $0.</p>
<p>Interpretation of coefficients is not directly comparable across the two modeling techniques. For the logit models in these analyses, coefficients report log odds. In reporting results, I convert log odds to odds ratios by exponentiating the coefficient. Odds ratios compare the relative odds of volunteering for two categories of respondents (such as female or male, or traveled or did not travel). As a hypothetical example, a coefficient of 0.45 for male travelers becomes an odds ratio of <italic>e</italic><sup>0.45</sup>, or 1.57. This would mean that a man would have 1.57 times higher odds of the outcome in question than would a woman. In the tobit models, there is a straightforward relationship between coefficients and the transformed outcome. A coefficient of 0.45 indicates that a one-unit change in an independent variable results in a 45% increase in the dependent variable.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091829612475166">Table 2</xref> presents bivariate analyses comparing rates of volunteering and charitable giving across three types of high school mission trip experience: domestic trips, international trips, and no participation. For each of the three measures of volunteering, respondents who participated in an international mission trip in high school (N=91) reported the highest rates of volunteering: 45.4% for charities, 49.2% in local communities, and 39.1% for international organizations. Those who did not participate in any high school mission trips (N=1821) report the lowest rates of volunteering: 35.4% for charities, 38.9% in local communities, and 18.6% for international organizations. Respondents who took domestic mission trips in high school fell between these two groups. A Pearson’s chi-square test of differences indicates that the differences in volunteering rates between these three groups of respondents are statistically significant for each of the three measures of volunteering.</p>

<p>Charitable giving to local congregations follows a similar pattern; median giving by those who traveled on an international mission trip in high school is $2636, compared to $1681 for those who traveled on a domestic trip in high school and $1349 for those who did not take a mission trip in high school. The differences in mean giving are similar, if less dramatic; those who took an international trip in high school gave an average of $1820, as compared to an average of $1104 among those who took no trip in high school. The magnitude of charitable giving to secular institutions is lower overall, and giving patterns shift. Here, non-travelers have the highest median giving ($119), followed by those who took an international trip in high school ($88), and lastly, those who took a domestic trip in high school ($32). Mean giving to secular organizations ranges from $20 (for domestic trip participants) to $37 (for those who did not participate in a high school trip). A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test indicates the differences in mean giving across the three groups are statistically significant for both measures of giving.</p>
<sec id="section13-0091829612475166">
<title>Age and the “Mission Trip Effect”</title>
<p>The likelihood of having participated in a mission trip is strongly influenced by age. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091829612475166">Figure 1</xref> shows rates of high school mission trip participation across age cohorts. For the three youngest cohorts, or from about 1975 to 2005 (the year of the survey), high school mission trip participation increased, particularly for international trips. More than one quarter (26.4%) of 18–29-year-old Christian church goers report mission trip participation, with 9.2% of that cohort taking an international mission trip. It is also worth noting that mission trips have been a part of the landscape of church practice for longer than we might think. For at least the past 50 years, more than 10% of active Christian youth have participated in some form of religious outreach they describe as a “short-term mission trip.” If mission trips matter to adult outreach behavior, then trip participation has been influencing the civic engagement of religious adults for over half a century.</p>

</fig>
<p>There are several reasons to suspect that age also influences the association between an adolescent mission trip experience and current outreach behavior. The strength of trip-participation influence might fade over time. The power of intervening experiences may increase as more time elapses. A “mission trip” for someone who graduated in the past ten years may be a qualitatively different experience than a “mission trip” for someone who graduated from high school in the 1940s. The mission trip experience has transformed in the wake of events like the founding of the Peace Corps and the evangelical group Youth With a Mission in 1960, or the rise of “solidarity” and “accompaniment” mission trips in response to Central American revolutions in the 1980s. Travelers from different generations are likely to have had different kinds of experiences, at least when it comes to international mission trips. On the other hand, “mission trip” is a concept that covers diverse experiences, from digging wells in Guatemala to visiting clandestine house churches in China to street evangelism in Newark, New Jersey. Two people who each traveled on a high school mission trip three years ago could also have had radically different experiences.</p>
<p>In analyses not presented in this article, I conducted bivariate and multivariate tests of the relationships between mission trip participation and volunteering/giving rates for each of the five cohorts depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091829612475166">Figure 1</xref>. Bivariate tests suggested that the relationship between trip participation, age, and civic engagement is not linear for each of the five outcomes measured. That is, trip participation had significant associations with volunteering or giving for some cohorts but not others. The results suggested that multivariate analyses should include an interaction term between age and trip participation.</p>
<p>After running regression analyses that included all relevant controls as well as interaction terms, I conducted post-estimation Wald tests of model fit. Wald tests ask whether including particular variables improves the “fit” of a regression model. In other words, does including those variables increase a model’s ability to explain variance in the outcome variable? For all five outcomes in this article, a Wald test on interaction terms was statistically insignificant (at the p&lt;0.05 level). This means that including the interaction terms does not improve these models’ ability to explain the association between adolescent trip participation and volunteering or charitable giving.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0091829612475166">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Due to the results of these Wald tests, I do not include interaction terms in the models of volunteering and charitable giving below. However, age and cohort remain important considerations that future research on mission trips and on the long-term effects of brief, intense religious experiences should continue to investigate.</p>

There is no statistically significant association between domestic or international high school mission travel and participation in charitable or social service activities generally. However, the association between domestic mission trip participation in high school and adult volunteering in one’s local community is both positive and significant.</p>

<p>Taking demographic and church participation variables into account, the odds of volunteering in the local community for adults who took a domestic mission trip in high school are 1.40 times (or <italic>e</italic><sup>0.34</sup>) higher than the odds that respondents who did <italic>not</italic> participate in a domestic mission trip will volunteer. When it comes to volunteering for an organization that helps people in other countries, those who participated in a high school domestic mission trip have 1.49 times (e<sup>0.40</sup>) higher odds of volunteering than do those who did not take a domestic mission trip in high school. Participation in an international mission trip in high school has no association with local or internationally focused volunteering as an adult once demographic and other factors are taken into account.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091829612475166">Table 2</xref>, an ANOVA test found significant differences in charitable giving between the three groups of respondents: domestic trip participants, international trip participants, and those who did not take a mission trip in high school. Once additional factors are taken into account (as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091829612475166">Table 3</xref>), participation in a domestic or international mission trip is <italic>not</italic> a significant predictor of differences in giving to one’s local congregation.</p>
<p>Demographic factors alone do not dampen the effect of international travel on charitable giving.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0091829612475166">8</xref></sup> However, adding any of a variety of recent predictors <italic>does</italic> account for this relationship, including being a “non-joiner,” attending church frequently or holding a leadership position, and daily prayer. Including a measure of participation in an international mission trip in the past year also helps account for the lack of a direct relationship between international high school travel and current giving. It is probable that high school travel experience (or lack thereof) influences at least some of these adult behaviors, which in turn impacts giving. Here, however, I find no evidence that domestic or international travel have continued independent direct effects on charitable giving to local congregations once these recent behaviors are considered.</p>
<p>However, high school participation in a domestic trip does continue to have a significant dampening effect on secular giving. Holding demographic factors, adult religious practices, and civic engagement constant, those who participated in a domestic mission trip in high school give about 78% less to secular organizations than do those who did not participate in a high school mission trip.</p>
<p>How do the effects of trip participation compare to other relevant predictors of volunteering or giving? One way to measure the relative impact of variables with different units of measurement is to use standardized coefficients. Unstandardized coefficients (like those in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091829612475166">Table 3</xref>) measure the effects of a one-unit change in <italic>x</italic> on the outcome. X-standardized coefficients measure the effects of a one-<italic>standard deviation</italic> change in <italic>x</italic> on the outcome. These coefficients are difficult to interpret. For example, a person cannot take one standard deviation <italic>more</italic> of a mission trip in high school than another person. Still, standardized coefficients make it possible to compare the effects of trip participation, which is measured as yes or no, to a variable like income, which is an ordinal scale from 1–8.</p>

Each figure includes all statistically significant predictors of the outcome variable in question. As the literature predicts, high school domestic mission trip participation has the lowest magnitude association with all three outcomes. However, the effect size of this brief adolescent experience is similar in magnitude to several more recent and habitual practices (such as friendships in one’s congregation) that might be expected to exert more influence on adult volunteering or giving.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This research extends and challenges current knowledge of the long-term relationships between adolescent short-term mission trip participation and adult civic engagement in several ways. First, the relationship between age and travel in these data provides a modest challenge to widely held assumptions about <italic>how</italic> mission trips matter to travelers. Many of the mechanisms used to explain the “transformational” effects of travel rely strongly on the immediacy and physical proximity of a trip experience. Culture shock, emotionally resonant encounters with hosts, and the emotional impact of witnessing dramatic poverty have all been speculated as possible mechanisms for opening travelers to changing their lives. However, the expectation of both travelers and trip planners is that both immediacy and its impact fade in the months after travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091829612475166">Ver Beek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091829612475166">Peterson et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The lack of a significant interaction between travel and current age in multivariate analyses suggests that, when other relevant predictors of civic engagement are taken into account, high school mission trips have more or less the same effect on volunteering, whether the potential volunteer is 25 or 65. More research is necessary to confirm whether these results hold true across samples and across various outcomes. With longitudinal rather than retrospective data and more detailed histories of travel and civic engagement, more refined cohort-level analyses could reveal greater age-based differences in the effects of travel.</p>
<p>Second, the geographic context of a mission trip—international or domestic—matters to its impact. I find participation in a domestic trip is associated with significantly higher rates of volunteering in one’s local community and for internationally focused organizations; it is also associated with significantly lower rates of giving to secular organizations. In contrast, high school participation in an international mission trip has no significant association with adult volunteering or giving when other factors, like recent participation in an international mission trip, are taken into account.</p>
<p>At first glance, these results are counter-intuitive. Logically, if the intensity and distinctiveness of an experience are important mechanisms of transformation, then international travel—spanning greater physical and cultural distances—would be expected to have greater impact than domestic travel. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091829612475166">Table 2</xref> seems to affirm this intuition, especially for giving to local congregations. What, then, accounts for the <italic>lack</italic> of relationship between international travel during high school and contemporary volunteering and giving in the multivariate analyses?</p>
<p>In part, data limitations may play a role. There are relatively few participants in high school international mission trips (N=91), with a large standard deviation. Data that include a greater number of international trip participants (either through a larger total sample or through over-sampling) <italic>might</italic> yield different results. However, the reasonably large sample size (N=2141) makes this unlikely.</p>
<p>Measures of recent behavior are more robust for international than for local outreach. This article makes every possible effort to isolate the specific effects of adolescent trip participation from other important predictors of civic engagement, but some measures simply are not available. It is possible more robust measures of local engagement could similarly account for the lingering influence of domestic travel. That is to say, additional measurements might reveal that the effects of both domestic and international high school travel are indirect. Current church involvement, from attendance to leadership roles to adult mission trip participation, is almost certainly influenced by high school experiences like mission trip participation. The statistical models used in this article cannot uncover these indirect relationships. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091829612475166">Beyerlein, Trinitapoli, and Adler (2011)</xref> caution that untangling the tightly interwoven threads of influence these experiences have on each other and on adult civic engagement may never be fully possible.</p>
<p>Several kinds of data not collected in the GIS could improve future models of the relationships between these factors, including: data on less religiously active individuals; more measures of adolescent church engagement; measures of religious switching; ebbs and flows of civic participation over time (particularly local engagement); and better information about respondents’ religious and secular travel experiences. With this additional data, advanced statistical methods such as structural equation modeling or propensity score matching may help further refine the complex relationships between these factors.</p>
<p>Alongside these questions about data are more substantive explanations for differences in the long-term effects of international and domestic travel. The very exoticism of international travel may undermine its lasting impact. Recruitment and fundraising efforts often highlight the novelty and adventure of such experiences. These features—novelty, intensity, “shock”—are the ones Ver Beek and others argue will fade quickly after travel. In contrast, the relatively familiar contexts of domestic travel may highlight similarities between trip activities and the kinds of civic engagement youth experience in their schools, churches, and communities. Contrary to the narrative emphasis on travel as a <italic>break</italic> from ordinary life, trip practices that highlight continuity with familiar routines may, in fact, provide the key to sustained effects of travel. Certainly, future research should move beyond measuring the <italic>fact</italic> of travel to examine the specific routines, activities, and organizational cultures that differentiate the myriad experiences that fall under the umbrella category of “mission trip.”</p>
<p>Finally, the results contradict previous claims that mission trips <italic>increase</italic> civic participation across a variety of measures. Instead, I find that people who took a domestic mission trip in high school give <italic>less</italic> money to secular institutions than people who did not take a domestic mission trip in high school. These results resonate with other research that distinguishes between religious and secular outreach. In separate, qualitative research with adult international mission trip participants, I find travelers report similarly complex reactions to travel. For instance, travel inspired some respondents to pull back from their overcommitted schedules and focus on the quality of time spent volunteering or with family. In a quantitative report, this result would translate to <italic>decreased</italic> volunteering or civic engagement, even though travelers perceived the choice as a positive step.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate a need to rethink the assumption that trips are a mechanism for increased social participation. An alternative explanation might be that travel catalyzes behavioral changes that increase personal commitment to more narrowly defined goals or causes. As attention is directed to, say, international outreach or to deeper commitment to one’s local congregation, energy may be directed away from alternate forms of outreach, like secular charitable giving.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This research fills a long-standing gap in the literature on short-term mission travel by examining the associations between adolescent trip participation and adult civic engagement. These data demonstrate that a singular event from the past can continue to be a relevant indicator of current civic engagement when compared to habitual or more recent beliefs and practices. They also indicate that claims about mission trips’ broad, positive impact on future civic engagement should be tempered by more precise statements. This increased precision can only improve understanding of the mechanisms through which brief religious experiences come to have a lasting transformative impact on people’s lives.</p>
<p>A great deal of speculation about the mechanisms through which travel transforms lives centers on the immediacy and intensity of trip experiences, particularly the opportunity to observe a community or culture not one’s own. These data suggest the focus on mission trips as discrete, intense encounters with social difference overlooks other important mechanisms by which travel inspires behavioral changes.</p>
<p>Mission trips are also part of an ongoing process of religious socialization. Like religious conversion narratives or “spiritual mountaintop” experiences, mission trips have been institutionalized as both a significant event in the life-course and as a pervasive practice of US congregations. More attention must be paid to the ways the discrete events of travel are turned into meaningful markers of personal identity. For example, storytelling is a key meaning-making practice both during and after many travel experiences. The construction of a coherent and consistent story about the meaning of a trip and repetition of this story over time may operate as a reinforcement of a particular moral identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091829612475166">Allahyari, 2000</xref>), which in turn inspires a generally higher level of civic commitment.</p>
<p>If exceptional religious experiences like travel can better be linked to the routine and reinforcing habits of religious life, religious institutions may find new ways of socializing members into supporting their congregations and communities through volunteering and charitable giving. Institutional efforts to capitalize on the transformative influence of travel may prolong pro-social behavior among travelers even in the face of increasing demands on their time and resources.</p>
<p>Strategies for making such a connection explicit will almost certainly depend on how religious leaders perceive the “transformations” of travel to take place. Do mission trips operate as inflection points in an ongoing trajectory of civic engagement? Or should we imagine them as stepladders, moving travelers into a higher baseline level of involved citizenship? Do stories about travel’s meaning become touchstones for an identity as an engaged Christian, having direct and ongoing effects on congregational and civic engagement? Or does travel influence religious engagement, which in turn increases civic involvement as an adult?</p>
<p>The current analyses make a case for the persistent, if limited, influence of adolescent short-term mission trips on adult behaviors. However, they cannot fully unpack direct and indirect effects of travel in the long-run. To better understand the role and salience of non-routine religious experiences like mission trips over the course of a lifetime, researchers need to better specify the relationship between mechanisms of change and the passage of time. Focusing on in-trip experiences of shock and exposure provides few avenues for thinking about whether and how mission trips and other discrete events set people up for sustained change. Longitudinal research (both quantitative and ethnographic) is vital to understand how experiences like travel have both direct and indirect effects on future beliefs, values, and behaviors.</p>

<p>There are many techniques for dealing with missing data, all of which have drawbacks. In this case, the variables of greatest concern are measures of charitable giving. There is strong evidence that non-response to questions about giving is <italic>not</italic> random but rather influenced by factors such as income and religious denomination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091829612475166">Brooks, 2004</xref>). Where such factors are known and can be accounted for in imputation models, multiple imputation is expected to yield less biased results than simple listwise deletion strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091829612475166">Wiepking, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>The survey also includes a measure of giving to “other religious organizations.” However, 57.1% of respondents report giving zero dollars to other religious organizations; median giving is therefore $0. This response is somewhat surprising and presents theoretical and methodological challenges. Accounting for rates of non-giving is beyond the scope of these analyses; thus, I defer analysis of this variable.</p>

<p>I use an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation, which is recommended for variables that have many cases with zero values. Except for very small values, the inverse hyperbolic sine function can be interpreted in the same way as a log transformation.</p>

<p>The survey asks first about high school church participation, then about participation in a mission trip. As a result, the 335 individuals who report no church involvement as teenagers were not asked about mission trips. It is unlikely but not impossible these individuals participated in a mission trip. I chose to code them as missing, taking high school church involvement into account during the imputation process.</p>
