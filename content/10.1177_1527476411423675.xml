<abstract>
<p>This commentary focuses on how the HBO series <italic>Treme</italic> establishes its credibility about place through the role of the outsider. <italic>Treme</italic>, through its explicit attention to place-based detail, creates a sense of authenticity that is both maintained and challenged by exchanges between those who are <italic>from</italic> here and those who <italic>come</italic> here.</p>

<body>
<p>You’ve probably seen them if not taken one yourself: those ubiquitous and ephemeral quizzes that test whether or not you <italic>belong</italic> in a place. For example, now that I live in New York City, I am curious about how my identity as a “come here” is measuring up. I’ve done pretty well when tested by such belonging barometers as “You say ‘the city’ and expect everyone to know that this means Manhattan.” When I lived, for ten years, as a New Orleanian, I was also concerned about my <italic>cred</italic>, so I was delighted to feel recognition in statements such as “You know the definition of ‘dressed’” and “You know that neutral ground is a place to park when it rains.” HBO’s <italic>Treme</italic> may also be understood as a televisual belonging quiz in that it seems to reward viewers who posses a distinctive knowledge about New Orleans history and culture.</p>
<p>As David Simon’s <italic>The Wire</italic> was also embedded in the particulars of Baltimore, so <italic>Treme</italic> is steeped in the sounds and sites of the Big Easy. Situated, moreover, in the months immediately following Hurricane Katrina’s floods, the uniqueness of <italic>Treme</italic> lies not so much in its representation of a city but in the ways it establishes its authenticity through an interplay between the from-here and the come-here characters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527476411423675">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Treme</italic> complicates, in ways that are not always unproblematic, assumptions about what it means to belong in a place, belong to a place, and also to know your place (in terms of class, race, gender, and other ideological categories). Throughout seasons one and two, the program has represented ideologies of place in ways that both consolidate and disrupt notions of authenticity and belonging. Indeed, one could say that the entire series is about the possibilities of and problems with making claims about place and authenticity in a city that was nearly destroyed. Place and authenticity are shaped by the contexts that surround them and the values that are assigned to them. And, like other kinds of social and cultural categories, conceptions of place and authenticity change over time. For example, Kevin Fox Gotham’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476411423675">2007a</xref>, 320) concept of “tourism authenticity” provides a complex sense of the ways that cultural and economic practices shape the meanings of authenticity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527476411423675">2</xref></sup> I do not wish to argue the extent to which <italic>Treme</italic> is or is not an authentic text. However, what I want to examine in this commentary are the ways that particular ideas about authenticity are produced through the shifting relationships between the come-here and from-here <italic>Treme</italic> characters. In the way that, following Walter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476411423675">Benjamin (1973)</xref>, authenticity registers meaning and value through a reliance on an original, <italic>Treme</italic> as a televisual representation constantly relies on and displaces its own claims to “the real.” Yet, in addition to a notable attention to local detail, <italic>Treme</italic> also relies on outsiders (viewers included), or those who “come here” as a way to establish its authenticity.</p>
<p>More than a mere one-off, the show uses various come-here characters throughout each of its two seasons to represent the city as both home and touristic/entrepreneurial destination. From the appearance of New York chefs such as Wylie Dufresne, David Chang, Eric Ripert, and Tom Colicchio (who play themselves) to characters like Annie, Sonnie (who have different claims to belonging and place than other come-heres), Arnie the club bouncer/reliable roofer, and his disaster capitalist cousin from Dallas, Nelson Hildago (from the second season), <italic>Treme</italic> produces its place in New Orleans and also on television through the experience of those who, via I-10 or HBO, come here. In addition, even the from-here core characters such as LaDonna, Janette, and Delmond continually move back and forth between cities. This serialized coming and going corresponds to what many thousands of New Orleanians did in the weeks, months, and years after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>While there is much to discuss in terms of belonging, place, and identity in relation to the entire series, I examine the role of the come-heres as anchors for <italic>Treme</italic>’s authenticity. This authenticity, a claim to realness and credibility that this program makes, is established through the interplay of outsider performances. Sometimes appearing as expert outsiders, most of the come-here characters and social actors embody touristic perspectives of the city and yet they also offer the potential for a critique of that position.</p>
<sec id="section1-1527476411423675">
<title>Treme, <italic>Treme</italic>, and HBO: Location, Location, Location</title>
<p><italic>Treme</italic> is not the first HBO program to attend to the details of place (whether historic or contemporary), to the twists and turns of vernacular speech, to the pleasures to be had in rewarding viewers for their discerning readings and distinguish the cable network’s quality brand from mere television. Dana Polan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476411423675">2007</xref>, 280) notes with regard to HBO and <italic>The Sopranos</italic>, that “typical HBO episodic series play to an intellectually savvy and culturally informed spectator who has been trained (or is being trained) to take cultural works to be enigmas or puzzles in which one goes beyond the text at hand to something else.” That “something else,” as Polan observes, may be “moral or philosophical meaning, but it can also be the less meaningful display of puzzles for their own sake” (ibid., 280). Surely, with <italic>Treme</italic>, not only does the series explore “moral or philosophical meaning” but also the politics of disaster and the role of television in representing its aftermath. However, Polan’s point about the ways that a television series may also engage in the “display of puzzles for their own sake” is also part of the register of <italic>Treme</italic>.</p>
<p>If <italic>The Wire</italic> used listening in actual and metaphorical ways, <italic>Treme</italic> also can be thought of as a listening text; it revels in how place sounds, from the manufactured silences of a Gentilly street in October 2005, to the ringing thrill of brass bands and the comforting pronunciations of everyday places, proper names, and place-specific signifiers like Hubig’s Pies, or Dorignac’s. Yet, <italic>Treme</italic> is a text that questions, while it also locates, place in more than territorial terms; it also folds in on itself as an invitation to think about the role television plays in a history of representational displacement, of dislocation. In other words, it is more than a coincidence that in Episode 5, “Shame, Shame, Shame,” <italic>Treme</italic> acknowledges the “too real for teevee” New Orleans–based “dramedy” <italic>Frank’s Place</italic> by casting Tim Reid in the role of Judge John Gatling. In a way, then, at least this episode of <italic>Treme</italic> offers itself as a televisual atonement for the economic (and ideological) decisions that cancelled the lease on <italic>Frank’s Place</italic>. In relation to authenticity and the <italic>place</italic> of <italic>Frank’s Place</italic>, moreover, producers Hugh Wilson and Tim Reid decided to focus that show’s narrative not in the touristic French Quarter but in a black community. Wilson’s and Reid’s on-the-ground research for the show sometimes resembled ethnographies or oral histories as they found themselves “venturing into history” to represent the authenticity of place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527476411423675">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Treme</italic> is a program that, like <italic>The Wire</italic>, has built-in rewards for close readers and for those viewers who may be familiar with New Orleans. Indeed, similar to <italic>The Wire</italic>, Simon’s <italic>Treme</italic> rewards viewers who listen to things that might at first appear baffling. Hua Hsu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476411423675">2010</xref>, 510-11) argues that <italic>The Wire</italic>’s coding of authenticity and viewer engagement is:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>a gritty, meticulous, and therefore more realistic alternative to traditional televisual representations of police work and urban turmoil—the series rewards its most careful viewers with access to what we presume to be a trustworthy, unfiltered experience of life in Baltimore. We not only understand <italic>The Wire</italic>, then, as somehow more authentic in its representation of reality, but we understand this quality in relation to other, inferior, presumably negligent attempts at the same. The viewer who can follow the series’ massive, dizzying plotlines, recognize its moments of self-referential wit, or grow fluent in Baltimore slang is flattered as an insider, an honorary citizen.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, Hsu points out that some critics of <italic>The Wire</italic> suggest that the show “transcends entertainment” as it “becomes a sort of pop ethnography” (ibid., 510). <italic>Treme</italic> has also been notable for its use of vernacular references such that <italic>Times-Picayune</italic> television critic Dave Walker has a weekly column titled “Today in <italic>Treme</italic>.” Walker’s column is a Rosetta’s stone for viewers who may not understand local codes or recognize the music, musicians, and other New Orleans politicians, chefs, etc. <italic>Treme</italic> relies on the interplay between recognition and strangeness in ways that may repel and attract different kinds of viewers.</p>
<p>While some television is generic in its denial of place specificity, other series going all the way back to <italic>Dragnet</italic>, with its focus on Los Angeles, are dependent on place, on the particularity of context, for their meaning. Place-specific television crosses all genres from various dramatic series to situation comedies. Some of these place-specific and, I would argue, temporally specific, shows include <italic>The Streets of San Francisco, Dallas, Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, Frank’s Place, Law and Order</italic> (original version), <italic>BH 90210, Homicide: Life on the Street, The OC, Rescue Me, CSI, Sex and the City, The Sopranos, Entourage, Hung, Boardwalk Empire</italic>, and others. What sets <italic>Treme</italic> apart from these other place-specific programs, with the exception, perhaps, of <italic>Rescue Me</italic> (which is about fire fighters and emergency medical personnel post-9/11), is that this show takes place in the recent past and also in a city that is recovering from disaster.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1527476411423675">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of televisual representations of New Orleans, two previous programs stand out: the short-lived <italic>K-Ville</italic> and the critically acclaimed but also short-lived <italic>Frank’s Place</italic> (both broadcast network shows). Like <italic>Frank’s Place</italic>, HBO’s <italic>Treme</italic> is about place. Indeed, as Herman Gray argues, co–executive producers Hugh Wilson and Tim Reid centered the show on a restaurant in New Orleans, Chez Louisiane. Also, Wilson “as producer, writer, and director’ of <italic>Frank’s Place</italic> wanted, according to Gray, “to get as much of New Orleans on the television screen as he possibly could” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476411423675">1995</xref>, 115). It is noteworthy that <italic>Frank’s Place</italic> focused on efforts to revive an African American–owned restaurant—Chez Louisiane—while <italic>Treme</italic> features the eventual decline of Desautel’s, an upscale, uptown establishment operated by white woman, Janette Desautel. Both Frank Parrish and Janette Desautel struggle to keep their businesses open: the former without any personal restaurant experience and the latter with plenty. Parrish, as a Boston lawyer, had inherited the restaurant from his father. Desautel, it appears, operates the restaurant herself, with some financial support from her parents and from the expert assistance of her sous chef, Jacques. Parrish’s combination of come-here and from-here qualities are a source of both dramatic tension and humor as he struggles to understand where and how he fits into his inheritance. In the remaining section, I address two examples, from one episode, “Shame, Shame, Shame,” to show how <italic>Treme</italic> uses the come-here and from-here dynamic to sustain its claims to authenticity.</p>

<sec id="section2-1527476411423675">
<title>Sounds and Tastes Real to Me</title>
<p>The discourses that surround <italic>Treme</italic> have just as much to do with the coding of authenticity and place as the program does. In terms of the show’s promotion, David Simon and Eric Overmeyer have said that they “tr[ied] to do this from the inside out” (<italic>Beyond</italic>, 2010). This inside-out-ness is documented in promotional materials such as <italic>Beyond Bourbon Street: Treme</italic>. In that short behind-the-scenes video available through the HBO <italic>Treme</italic> website, actor Wendell Pierce observes, “It’s a principle of David’s since <italic>The Wire</italic> that people of that world are placed into the depiction of that world” (<italic>Beyond</italic>, 2010). Simon’s productions are marked by his blend of professional and nonprofessional actors and/or the use of local personalities to lend authenticity to the programs. While each episode of <italic>Treme</italic> seems to take as one of its meta-themes the idea of belonging in relation to New Orleans, some episodes such as “Shame, Shame, Shame” make it more explicit than others.</p>
<p>For example, this particular episode encodes place and time by representing an actual event—the January 16, 2006, ReNew Orleans second line. This event was about homecoming while its television representation included a reunion between <italic>Treme</italic> character Davina Lambreaux and her friend Kim. During the second line, Davina looks through the dancing crowd and exclaims, “Kim!” Then, the camera cuts to show Davina’s friend, who is played by the rap artist and videomaker Kimbery Rivers Roberts, whose story, along with that of her husband, Scott, is told in the documentary film <italic>Trouble the Water</italic> (Tia Lessin and Carl Deal, 2008). Both in front of and behind the camera, the program relies on and then recasts recognition and authenticity—to evoke a feeling of realness.</p>
<p>Moreover, the use of from-here consultants such as chef Susan Spicer, writers Lolis Eric Elie and Tom Piazza, musicians such as Allen Toussaint, and script supervisor Juanesta “Winnie” Holmes function as <italic>Treme</italic>’s authenticity circulatory system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1527476411423675">5</xref></sup> However, it is not only through a reliance on the from-here characters that <italic>Treme</italic> establishes its credibility; come-here characters and celebrities also engage with New Orleanian characters in ways that both challenge and ground authenticity.</p>
<p>One of the other ways that credibility is produced in <italic>Treme</italic> is through tension between New Orleanians and come-here characters and cameo performances. “In “Shame, Shame, Shame,” two sets of come-here visitors engage with New Orleanians in ways that both challenge and stabilize ideas about authority and expertise. In parallel scenes, musician Antoine Batiste (Wendell Pierce) and Janette Desautel (Kim Dickens) are visited by expert outsiders who are represented as benefactors and also as evaluators of local music history and cuisine. As “Koichi Toyama” (Tatsuo Icikawa), a jazz fan from “Japan, Japan” arrives through Tipitina’s Musician’s Foundation to help musicians replace destroyed instruments, a quartet of famous chefs from New York, New York, pays a surprise visit, without reservations or any warning, to Desautel’s restaurant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1527476411423675">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The arrivals of the jazz fan and the chefs function as visible evidence of wide national and international concern for two of the most famous examples of New Orleans culture: music and food. Cross-cutting between scenes of Batiste and Toyama trading expert knowledge about New Orleans blues and jazz history (the Kid Ory vs. Honore Dutrey conversation) and Desautel and Jacques (Ntare Mwine) figuring out what to cook for the surprise guests, these two encounters require the musician and chef to perform their authenticity. But the sequences also show the economic and ideological role of the outsider as one who can <italic>validate</italic> authenticity and credibility. Both scenes feature moments of tension in which Batiste and Desautel are challenged to perform local expertise, in terms of accurate knowedge, taste, and conformity to a perceived standard.</p>
<p>As the debate between Toyama and Batiste rises to a pitched point in the music store and as Desautel constructs the menu for the chefs, both characters display the tension between feeling autonomous as cultural agents, as artists, while also being placed in the position of the beholden. This position, as the scenes unfold, is a complex spot to be in. While Batiste and Desautel feel honored, they are also under pressure to conform to expectations of these expert outsiders. Further, Batiste expresses surprise that Toyama and his Japanese jazz club have such detailed knowledge of New Orleans musical history while Desautel shows a sense of validation in the New York chefs’ knowledge of various ingredients in their specially prepared meal. While these encounters represent the ways that local knowledge moves beyond geographic space, they also enforce certain place-based conceptions of authenticity through mastery of the ingredients that give New Orleans meaning. For Batiste, this performance includes the “note-for-note” Kid Ory–style solo for the pleasure of Toyama (that happens in the yard of Batiste’s suburban apartment complex). For Desautel, her performance focuses on the production site of the kitchen as she decides to “low ball” the fancy chefs with rabbit kidney and crawfish, but also in the reception context in which the waitress tells her that the chefs said “she can <italic>really</italic> cook.” These scenes function as measures of recovery and possibility—Batiste gets a new trombone and Desautel receives an invitation to come to New York and cook. They also show the ways that both come-here and from-here identities shape perceptions of authenticity, place, and meaning.</p>
<p>Other examples of the “come here/from here” dynamic cut across episodes in the back-and-forth movements of LaDonna (between New Orleans and Baton Rouge), Janette (between New Orleans and New York City), and Delmond (between New Orleans and New York City). It could be said that virtually all the characters are peripatetic no matter whether they are wandering from temporary residences, gigs, or fleeting second lines. In each of LaDonna’s, Janette’s, and Delmond’s storylines, these three characters embody the tensions involved in what it means to feel at home.</p>
<p>It is in the circulation of not only core characters who go elsewhere, but also in the arrival of outsiders who come there, that produces <italic>Treme</italic>’s sense of place. Moreover, it is not enough to say that the come-here outsider reproduces a touristic gaze or understanding of New Orleans that is then repeated in <italic>Treme</italic>. To be sure, this is a critique that has merit. Yet, in foregrounding, among other things, the dynamic aspects of what it means to come here or be from here, <italic>Treme</italic> is not a straightforward touristic text that reinforces, without critique, stable categories of belonging. Attention to the multiple ways that the series’ characters and viewers engage with New Orleans and the New Orleans represented in <italic>Treme</italic> can be a starting point for understanding what it means to feel, televisually speaking, at home.</p>

<p>The belonging registers of those who “come here” or those who are “from here” are borrowed from the documentary film <italic>Brunswick, Georgia: The Quiet Conflict</italic> (Bob Squier and Andrew Stern, 1964). This film consists of a series of interviews with African American and white residents of Brunswick, Georgia, in the months following the Civil Rights Act in an attempt to determine how this southern community either was attempting to follow the law or avoid the law as it related to desegregation. One of the interviewees, an African American woman, described how the surrounding area (which includes the sea islands off Georgia’s coast), consisted of two groups of people: those who had “been here” and those who had “come here.” The been-here community had roots to the place, a sense of inherited community and belonging, while the come-here people were understood to have a different set of priorities and expectations in relation to race and class. My use of the terms <italic>come here</italic> and <italic>from here</italic> are based loosely on this observation offered in the documentary to describe place and belonging in a different southern community.</p></fn>

<p>The inclusion of Koichi Toyama, the jazz fan from Japan, is particularly significant not necessarily because of the program itself but because of external events in which the 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster in Japan make this scene of international cultural support all the more remarkable. Moreover, Kid Ory and other famous blues musicians including Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday appear in <italic>New Orleans</italic> (Arthur Lubin, 1947). Shot partially on location in New Orleans, this film features notable musical performances by the Original New Orleans Ragtime Band, Woody Herman, and others while it depicts a vision of the city where whites and blacks mingle for the love of the blues. Not necessarily a faithful depiction of the “birth of the blues” or Storyville, it does nonetheless portray some of the class and race distinctions around music as well as the regional aspects of New Orleans and Chicago as music markets.</p></fn>
