<p>In my role as both reviews editor and now as editor for this journal over the course of the past seven years, I have been struck repeatedly by a trend in theological books and articles. Theology as a large-scale, systematic, and comprehensive endeavor would appear to be on the wane if not in outright decline. Instead, more and more theologians work on reflective interrogation of particular social realities and forms of human experience. In a postmodern environment in which grand metanarratives and large-scale synthetic projects have been discredited, much contemporary thinking moves in the direction of the local, the unique, the ironic, the embedded, the embodied, and the concretely limited. Universal claims are widely and even enthusiastically disparaged as reflecting hidden power agendas or failed epistemologies—except, ironically, perhaps, for the universal claim that all universals are pernicious and dead. The current cultural environment tends to looks askance upon the very project of “systematic” theology, particularly if it aims to make claims of a universal, transcontextual nature. Could theologians like Karl Barth, Paul Tillich, Karl Rahner, and Hans Urs von Balthasar—white European males all—have been among the last specimens of a soon to be extinct breed of theologian? Depending upon one’s theological point of view and, perhaps, one’s social location, one will either celebrate or lament the end of such large-scale, comprehensive ways of doing theology. While laments of such a demise do sound forth from quarters, the multitude of enthusiastic voices for identity theology done in the mode of the particular have very nearly drowned them out. We seem to live in an era theologically in which the pendulum is swinging dramatically from the universal to the particular and from what Cornell West might call “deodorized” theology to theology done in relation to actual human bodies.</p>
<p>In reflecting on these matters, Wilhelm Windelband’s century-old distinction between “nomothetic” and “ideographic” approaches to intellectual work comes to mind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573611436226">1</xref></sup> In Windelband’s terms, a nomothetic approach to the study of some subject matter claims that universal patterns are both identifiable and hold across contexts. Nomothetic judgments can be generalized and abstracted from particulars and applied transcontextually. By contrast, an ideographic approach to subject matter stresses the unique and incommensurable character of particularly existing historical phenomena. Though Windelband’s schema was originally aimed at accounting for differences in method between the sciences and the humanities, it provides an intriguing lens for reflecting upon the seismic shifts that have taken place in the field of theology over the course of the past four or five decades. Using these terms, it would appear that the recent currents of theological reflection have shifted decidedly from the grandly nomothetic to the assertively ideographic.</p>
<p>I wonder how long it will take for the pendulum to shift back toward the nomothetic side of the pendulum’s swing. I doubt that the predominant orientation to the particular and unique in human experience evidenced in many works of theology today will hold sway ad infinitum. At some point in the future, the pendulum will doubtless swing back toward more comprehensive, systematic, universal, and perhaps less anthropologically specific approaches. While this may not occur anytime soon, the long sweep of the history of doctrine would suggest that such a shift will likely, if not inevitably, take place at some future point.</p>
<p>I see great value in both approaches to theology. The systematic vision of great thinkers of the past continues to enrich and develop my thinking. The revision and reconceptualizations that have been spurred by contextual and identity-oriented approaches have broken open theology for me in very exciting and transformative ways. I would never want to retreat from the challenging and illuminating insights yielded by such approaches to theological reflection. Rather than choosing sides, I want to find ways to hold together both approaches to theological reflection. I wonder what it might look like in theology to avoid swinging from one extreme to another by finding ways to hold together universal and particular, nomothetic and ideographic, and deductive and inductive tendencies in theology. What would developing some sort of a dynamic equilibrium between the nomothetic and the ideographic approaches to theology look like? I am not yet certain. It seems to me, however, that the central concern of theology that is Christian—namely, Jesus Christ in all of his fullness of both his universality and his particularity—calls for exactly such a dynamic, complex, and holistic approach.</p>
