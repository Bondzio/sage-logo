<abstract>
<p>Second-generation family memoirs often recount physical pilgrimages to distant homelands. While such journeys suggest a naive privileging of an essentialized, ideal origin, I argue that these visits also have the power to problematize origins by exposing the gaps between place and narrative. These journeys illuminate the dual forces of postmemory and what I term ‘genealogical nostalgia’, the longing for the times and places of one’s ancestral past. These ‘returns’ therefore can play a key role in the construction of second-generation identity. Drawing on Caterina Edwards’s 2008 memoir <italic>Finding Rosa</italic>, I show how journeys to the ‘homeland’ highlight the particularity of second-generation experience as a generation making connections between multiple forms of memory and multiple sites of belonging.</p>

<body>
<p>If we live in an ‘autobiographical age’, we may also be said to live in a ‘genealogical age’; reality TV programmes, genealogy websites, and even travel agencies have capitalized on a voracious interest in family ancestry. The family memoir is a burgeoning genre, drawing on ancestral memories and myths, tales of distant homelands and mysteries of the past. The children of immigrants, in particular, are often driven to write by a feeling of belonging to another place, or even another time. Their memoirs are often characterized by the dual forces of traumatic postmemory, and what I call ‘genealogical nostalgia’, two related forms of second-generation memory generated by the affective inheritance of diaspora.</p>
<p>Such second-generation memoirs, however, have raised serious ethical concerns about cultural appropriation, ‘authenticity’, and ethnic absolutism. As Stuart Hall warns, identity ‘is not a fixed origin to which we can make some final and absolute Return’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698011415249">1994</xref>: 395). These concerns seem even more pressing when the desire to uncover and record stories of diasporic family ancestry – their genealogical nostalgia – leads the authors on physical journeys to distant homelands where they have never themselves lived, or in some cases, that they have never even seen. Yet while such journeys suggest a naive privileging of an essentialized, idealized homeland, in this article I argue that these trips also have the power to problematize origins. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698011415249">Cynthia Sugars (2005)</xref> outlines how many Canadian memoirists, aware of the dangers of privileging idealized and exoticized origins in the context of a ‘postcolonial’ state, create what she calls ‘troubled genealogies’, works that question the exclusionary power of the ancestral lineage, that highlight the illusory and imagined qualities of memory and reconstructed genealogy, and that ultimately expose the impossibility of a perfect return to roots.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750698011415249">1</xref></sup> Here, I examine how this ‘troubling’ of genealogy is further complicated by encounters with real locales, where inherited memories of the ‘homeland’ meet existing places in the present, thereby exposing the gaps between place and narrative. These journeys, I argue, highlight the particularity of second-generation experience as a generation making connections between multiple forms of memory and multiple sites of belonging.</p>
<p>In this article I examine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">Caterina Edwards’s 2008</xref> memoir <italic>Finding Rosa</italic>, which weaves together an account of Edwards’s mother’s decline from Alzheimer’s with her journey to discover her mother’s family history. Edwards’s mother, Rosa, is an immigrant to Canada who was born in Lussino, in Istria, a region of what is now Croatia. Edwards recounts the history of a place that has always been home to a multicultural people of mixed Italian and Slavic descent, but was shuttled between different ruling powers and subjected to ethnic cleansing and mass exiles through much of the 20th century. During the First World War Rosa’s father disappeared and Rosa and her family were deported to internment camps in Sicily by the Austrian government. During the Second World War, it was the Fascists who attempted to denationalize Istrian Slavs, by exiling leaders and banning the Croatian and Slovenian languages in government offices and schools. When the political tides turned again, those with Italian surnames were associated with the memory of Fascism; under Tito’s Communism, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Italians in Istria would either flee or be rounded up and thrown into the <italic>foibe</italic>, the caves and ravines of the Istrian landscape. Edwards writes that the <italic>foiba</italic> became a symbol of all the violence and suffering of Istria in the 1950s; in her text, the <italic>foiba</italic> also comes to stand for other kinds of losses – the loss of history, the loss of memory.</p>
<p>As Rosa loses her memory in the <italic>foiba</italic> of Alzheimer’s, her daughter is determined to reconstruct both her personal and cultural history. ‘My mother’s story’, she writes, ‘was bound to her people’s history, which had been judged too insignificant, too inconvenient, to remember or record’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 213). She therefore returns to the homeland, writing as an attempt at resisting the narrative destruction caused both by mass trauma and exile, and, on a much smaller level, by her mother’s devastating personal illness. In the process, she reflects on her own ‘troubled genealogy’ and the role it has played in her identity as a second-generation Canadian.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750698011415249">2</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-1750698011415249">
<title>The homeland</title>
<p>Edwards begins her memoir in Canada, detailing her mother’s difficult personality and their often tumultuous relationship. Throughout Edwards’s childhood her mother was overbearing and strict, frequently calling her daughter <italic>Buona da niente</italic>, ‘good for nothing’, and telling her ‘You’ll never become a woman’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 149). As a teenager, Edwards wasn’t allowed to date or go out with friends, or even to wash her hair during her period. Rosa’s disapproving and domineering presence continued long after her daughter had married and had children of her own; Rosa would barge into Edwards’s closet and throw out clothes she deemed inappropriate, and inspect every corner of her daughter’s freshly scrubbed house complaining of its filthiness. More profoundly, Rosa always derided her daughter’s desire to write as a frivolous waste of time and belittled her accomplishments. Edwards confesses that as a child she told herself stories ‘to make a space for myself. To erect a wall against my mother’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 247). Her literary career seems to have its origins in this painful relationship.</p>
<p>Despite this friction, when her father died and the full picture of her mother’s mental health became apparent, Edwards took on the responsibility for her mother’s care. She built a room for Rosa onto her family home in Edmonton, and with the help of a few homecare workers faced the exhausting job of keeping her clean, fed and as comfortable as possible. <italic>Finding Rosa</italic> is, in part, a memoir of this physically and emotionally draining period in Edwards’s life. But the scope of the memoir extends much further. Edwards writes that she was ‘drawn back’ to her mother by ‘incipient loss’: ‘As I observed my mother’s mind, then her body, fail, I began to want to know her’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">Edwards 2008</xref>: 1). After her mother’s death, moreover, she felt that ‘my duty to care for her was done, but not my responsibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 324); researching and writing about her life became, for Edwards, part of her filial ‘duty’, equal to physical care. Interwoven with scenes of Rosa’s deterioration, then, are investigations, memories, historical facts and imaginings of Rosa’s childhood in Istria. Together these fragments form a candid yet commemorative picture of Rosa’s life and the person she was. Ironically, it is ultimately through her writing, which had been such a source of conflict between them in the past, that Edwards begins to construct a posthumous connection to her mother. Istria becomes key to this project; Edwards’s quest of ‘finding Rosa’ brings her back to Rosa’s birthplace, in search of ‘the history and the culture that shaped her’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>Even as she journeys to Istria, Edwards acknowledges the role of the imaginary in her encounter with place. Edwards has sometimes regarded Istria as the past itself. She writes,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>it wasn’t a country; it did not appear on any modern map or in any book that I had read. Throughout my youth, Istria was a fantasy, a mental construct, a sequence of images incubated by my dreams. It existed in my mother’s mind, in the reminiscences she exchanged with friends, as the beloved, lost homeland, the wellspring of nostalgia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 29–30)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Istria has not been for Edwards a place that existed in the present, but a ‘fantasy’ of the past. Istria is imaginary for Rosa, because of the distance of nostalgic memory. It is imaginary for Edwards, because of the disconnection between narrative and experience. This imagined quality, however, does not make the place any less important in Edwards’s own mind and identity. As a perpetual recipient – and architect – of the ‘fantasy’ of Istria, Edwards returns in an attempt to connect this fantasy to lived experience and thereby mitigate the often overwhelming legacies of diaspora. She is drawn to this place as her ‘homeland’, a word which, for Paul Basu, exemplifies the ‘notional-material duality’ attached to it by the second generation: the imagined and abstract concept of ‘home’ grounded in a physical place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698011415249">2007</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>In an autobiographical article and subsequent book on Holocaust survivors and their children, Marianne Hirsch and Leo Spitzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698011415249">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011415249">2010</xref>) argue that Holocaust survivors display a profound ambivalence towards the place of origin, which is <italic>both</italic> the site of trauma, and home, a place recalled with nostalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698011415249">2003</xref>: 81). The children of survivors internalize this ambivalence toward the homeland – a dual feeling of inherited nostalgia, and what Hirsch has elsewhere termed ‘postmemory’, an inherited, second-hand ‘memory’ of trauma. While Edwards has not been overwhelmed by stories of ancestral trauma to the same extent as the children of Holocaust victims, ‘whose own belated stories are evacuated by the stories of the previous generation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698011415249">Hirsch, 1997</xref>: 22), her own life and identity have been shaped by this dominating legacy of her mother’s diasporic past. For Hirsch, postmemory refers to ‘the secondary, belated quality of my relationship with times and places that I had never experienced or seen, but which are vivid enough that I feel as though I remember them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011415249">Hirsch and Spitzer, 2010</xref>: 9). She adds that ‘mediated by the stories, images, and behaviours among which I grew up, [postmemory] never added up to a complete picture or linear tale. Its power to overshadow my own memories derives precisely from the layers – both positive and negative – that have been passed down to me unintegrated, conflicting, fragmented, dispersed’. Central to this experience of conflicted and fragmentary postmemory is a peculiar yet strong relationship with the homeland, which figures sometimes more strongly in the second generation’s imagination than the places where they grew up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011415249">2010</xref>: 9). ‘Returning’ to the place, then, ‘seemed the first step in a process of reconnection and recovery, in both senses of the word’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011415249">Hirsch and Spitzer, 2010</xref>: 19).</p>
<p>Edwards dramatizes this ambivalent process of reconnection as she visits the house where her mother was born, accompanied by a relative. ‘Once’, the older lady tells her, ‘there was an orange tree in your grandparents’ garden, and that led to their name in Lussino, Ponaronzo, those of the orange tree’. As Edwards opens the gate and enters the yard, she finds the house ‘eclipsed by the magnificent tree that stretched taller than the roof. Nestled in the green shiny leaves were small, bright bitter oranges. Once there was an orange tree? Once? Still. This time the word was still. Even if the family had changed. Or could this be another tree? A replacement or an offspring?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 75–6). In the preceding chapters, the word ‘once’ has become a refrain, beginning multiple paragraphs on family and cultural history, playing on the ways that history repeats while continually emphasizing that these stories are singular and of the past, out of Edwards’s reach. Yet in this moment beneath the orange tree, in this momentary collapsing of ‘once’ and ‘still’, the generations come together, and the present briefly encounters the past. In Hirsch and Spitzer’s terms, such sites are transitional spaces ‘where the encounter between generations, between past and present, between nostalgic and traumatic memory, can momentarily, effervescently, be staged’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698011415249">2003</xref>: 93). Even though Rosa does not accompany Edwards to Istria, a connection between their generations is performed here; in this place the offspring and the original are connected, even indistinguishable, representing a family united by the nickname Ponaronzo, those of the orange tree. It is at this site, this homeland, that Edwards must negotiate between the longing of nostalgia and the ruptures of exile and postmemory, as she constructs fragile structures of identity.</p>

<title>‘The <italic>foiba</italic> of forgetfulness’: Trauma and postmemory</title>
<p>For Edwards, postmemory is characterized not by a surplus of dominant tales of trauma, but rather by trauma’s pronounced absence. Rosa seems to have repressed all memory of her past, even long before Alzheimer’s set in. Her whole childhood has been ‘an area of darkness, unrelieved by any flashes of recall’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 210). Edwards’s great aunt, who was older than Rosa, describes her memories of the family’s internment in Sicily during the First World War, of begging for food, of being squeezed into a cattle car without light, of the sister who died on the train. Rosa confirms the story for Edwards but does not actually remember the events, dismissing them.</p>
<p>As Edwards searches for answers she discovers that there are few books on Istria, and its dark history of mass murder and exile is taboo. Edwards finds no documentation to confirm the family story of internment in Sicily, no records explaining the disappearance of her grandfather. Documents such as birth certificates and marriage records were destroyed during the Tito era in attempts to cleanse the territory of its long ethnic Italian history. She cannot even confirm her mother’s age. In her search for information she finds ‘nothing, only an absence, a gap, a <italic>foiba</italic> they would call it in Istria, a sinkhole, a dark pit into which garbage, history, and people are cast and disappear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 178). It is only by talking to others with Istrian roots, and by visiting surviving relatives in Istria, that she has found similar stories to corroborate her mother’s and aunts’ experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 67), and is able to piece together a loose, fragmented narrative of her grandfather’s disappearance and her family’s exile. As she stands before the orange tree in Lussino, imagining her mother’s childhood, Edwards reflects, ‘This place is where my mother began. Memories and stories – mine and my mother’s and my aunts’, the memoirs I have read, the exiles’ newsletters, the Internet postings. Memories and stories – two glowing ropes that intertwine and separate, slip by each other and knot over the dark pit, the foiba of forgetfulness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 76). The reconstruction of memories and stories made possible by her research and her visits are seen as a means of resisting forgetfulness, a state that is linked, through the symbol of the foiba, to violence. To allow her family’s history to be lost, in other words, would not only be to lose the stories to her mother’s Alzheimer’s, but would be to perpetuate traumatic repression, and to become complicit with the wilful erasure of ethnic Italian people from the Istrian landscape.</p>
<p>Despite Rosa’s repression of much of her past, Edwards links her mother’s lifelong idiosyncracies and neuroses, as well as many of the manifestations of her Alzheimer’s, to her childhood of poverty and her traumatic wartime exile and internment. Rosa’s early uprooting from her home explains, for Edwards, some of her mother’s lifelong ‘hysteria’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 212), and once she falls victim to Alzheimer’s seems to be echoed in her anxieties about strangers entering her room and in her continual pleading to go ‘home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 318). Trauma is often defined by a lack of narrative, as a force that, in Susan Brison’s words, severs ‘the connections among remembered past, lived present, and anticipated future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698011415249">1999</xref>: 41). The effects of her trauma, for Rosa, are similar to the symptoms of her Alzheimer’s. Rosa is disoriented in space and in time, unable to distinguish between the past and the present: ‘The connections between her memories and emotions and understanding were tangled or severed’, Edwards writes. ‘But now and then … I caught a glimpse of the little girl still inside the aged body. Rosa Pia Pagan survived in fragments, in flashes of light’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 89). Edwards sees these ‘flashes of light’ not as evidence of a collapsing narrative but as glimpses of Rosa’s true self, which can be recovered and preserved. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698011415249">Brison (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698011415249">Dori Laub (1992)</xref>, and others have written, trauma needs to be narrated to an empathetic other or witnessed by a second person in order to restore the victim’s sense of narrative and prevent their ‘entrapment’ in the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698011415249">Laub, 1992</xref>: 70). Edwards writes herself into the role of secondary witness who helps make trauma – and life as a whole – narratable. The narrative she constructs attempts to repair, if only for herself, the fragmentation and disorientation that Rosa’s trauma and dementia have both caused.</p>
<p>By placing herself physically in Istria, Edwards uses her body’s material presence to momentarily counter the force of exile, on both a personal and cultural level. She recounts how, attempting to navigate Lussino, ‘several times, I lost my way. The paths didn’t seem to correspond to those on the map. There were more crossroads, more paths than those shown, and they twisted and turned and changed directions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 63). Initially, her physical disorientation mirrors her mother’s, and reflects her alienation from her homeland. When she tries to ask for directions in Italian, she is often ignored, and she recalls that in this contested territory Communist authorities had viewed speaking Italian or Istro-Veneto dialect ‘as a subversive act’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 63). Indeed many Croats mistrusted the <italic>Rimasti</italic>, the tiny group of ethnic Italians who avoided exile, and even denied their existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 42). Rather than become discouraged, she deploys the dialect as her ‘magic wand’: ‘when someone responded in kind, I had found one of the <italic>Rimasti</italic>. The wand exposed not just their true selves but mine; I was changed from a stranger to a daughter of the exile’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 63). Despite not knowing her way, she uses this transformation through language to assert a subversive claim to this space, to counteract her physical disorientation through a mutual recognition of belonging.</p>
<p>Yet this claim is tentative and fleeting. On this return to Lussino, now called Losinj, Edwards notices for the first time the abandoned, ruined houses that are everywhere. At these ruins ‘oblivion is not complete. Traces remain. Ruins speak’. The ruins carry her back to her grandmother, ‘standing at the door of her house, turning the key in the lock. Thinking she will return. Hurrying because her children are afraid and the soldiers impatient’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 280). In an article on traumatic memory and place, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750698011415249">Dylan Trigg (2009)</xref> contends that the ruin plays a unique role in our understanding of trauma. Its damaged materiality represents the interiority of the traumatized victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750698011415249">2009</xref>: 96). The ruin is dynamic, it exhibits the passage of time in its damage, but in its traces of what once was it simultaneously embodies the past’s ongoing presence. Yet this presence is spectral, fragmented, and cannot be reconstituted in narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750698011415249">2009</xref>: 97). What role, then, does the ruin play for the <italic>secondary</italic> witness? For Edwards, ‘ruins speak’, yet the story they tell is also fragmented, characterized by gaps in knowledge, by questions and doubts, and by conflicting accounts. Edwards’s memoir attempts to place the ruins within a broader narrative that she reconstructs from stories, research and her own imagination. Yet Edwards is aware that a perfect narrative can never be recovered and reconstructed. She writes, ‘I was searching for Lussino, not Losinj, for what and who remained, for shards, traces, echoes, glimmerings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 56). The distinction between Lussino and Losinj here is not, for Edwards, an ethnic one, but a distinction between the place of her mother’s past and the modern location that is foreign to her. Lussino is the source of the traces of memory she seeks. Hirsch and Spitzer describe how being at the site of Hirsch’s parents’ narrow escape from deportation to a concentration camp gave ‘a materiality’ to the history Hirsch has always known:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We could do more than visualize their journey: we could smell and touch that crisp October day in 1941, hear the commotion on the street, the rumors that were flying, participate in the split-second decision that they reenacted at the Springbrunnenplatz as they pointed and turned in the one direction over the other. Suddenly, as we talked and listened, the barricades and rows of soldiers became visible. And as we walked about this landscape of memory, the streets became animated with the presence of people from that past: long-lost relatives, friends, neighbors, Lotte and Carl, young, in their twenties – ghosts emerging from the shadows between the buildings, conjured up by recall and narration, by our being there, by our presence and witness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011415249">Hirsch and Spitzer, 2010</xref>: 138)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Hirsch and Spitzer, ‘the location authenticates the narrative, embodies it, makes it real, to the point where it threatens to reengulf those who come to tell and to listen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011415249">2010</xref>: 138). Yet even as the site connects postmemory to material, sensory experiences, other stimuli simultaneously interrupt, bringing them back to the current moment. The momentary reliving of the past is recognized as spectral, as the brief emergence of ‘ghosts’. This overlap of present and past materiality provides a ‘retrospective vantage point’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011415249">2010</xref>: 138). While this vantage point allows a broader historical perspective removed from the moment of trauma, it too can be unsettling, ultimately demonstrating the second generation’s inability to fully understand the past and emphasizing the irreversible passage of time. For Edwards, the fantasy that Istria has been is now obscured by a more complex historical and current reality.</p>
<p>Hirsch notes that postmemory’s ‘connection to its object or source is mediated not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and creation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698011415249">1997</xref>: 22). Lacking the power of recollection, Edwards turns to fiction in order to flesh out the family narrative and attempt to immerse herself in a place that only exists in the past. At several points in the narrative Edwards exhibits such imaginative creation by narrating scenes from Rosa’s childhood, a shift in voice that highlights its invention. In a passage dated June 1914, ‘little Rosa’ is accompanying her father to the piazza. Edwards uses free indirect discourse to tell the scene through the child’s perspective: ‘She is happy he chooses her and not her sister Conda – who is too little, a baby, so there. A crybaby, so there’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 77). As readers we are acutely aware that even if Rosa recounted this memory to her daughter, the interior voice is entirely imagined by Edwards. Edwards then interrupts the scene with her own first-person interjection: ‘I see her: Rosa Pia Pagan, Rosina they call her, a little girl in a photograph, but alive and in color’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 78). The assertion ‘I see her’ in fact emphasizes the imaginative work required to conjure this scene, shuttling us out of the past and into the present moment. While visiting Lussino gives her imaginings substance, the metafictional moment, and the story’s multigeneric frame, highlight the impossible distance between the second-generation speaker and her ancestral past.</p>
<p>Sugars suggests that the ‘allure of genealogy’ may be ‘that it is shrouded in mystery and is therefore haunting, while it also offers an illusion of reassurance and continuity. Absolute origins’, she adds, ‘are necessarily absent origins. This renders the entire genealogical enterprise an inherently unhomely one’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698011415249">2005</xref>: 193). Edwards highlights this unhomely aspect of her genealogical quest as she imagines Istria’s ruins from the ‘sequence of images and apprehensions that remain fixed in [her] mind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 276). She imagines</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>a city as silent and still as a graveyard … A city of white stone and long shadows. I imagine only one city, though there were many – one city, reduced to the sounds of sea, wind, and rain, reduced to a landscape of futility and ruin.</p>
<p>I don’t belong here, I tell myself – don’t look behind the broken doors, don’t peer into the cavernous entrances, do not mount those stairs. They lead nowhere; that floor is gone. Like the people who used to live here, gone – like an old woman’s past, gone. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 275–6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For the second generation, then, at these ruined sites the inevitability of change becomes more palpable, highlighting the distances between places and between generations that cannot be overcome, and the particular losses felt by the second generation in a place that is supposed to be ‘home’. The second generation can only experience the ruin, never the original. This haunting loss is at once ‘alluring’, and alienating.</p>

<title>Genealogical nostalgia</title>
<p>How might we conceptualize this ‘allure’ of a traumatic past? Does the longing of the second generation problematically fetishize or even idealize histories of violence and suffering? Hirsch and Spitzer convincingly explain that for Hirsch, ‘my parents’ own ambivalent nostalgia generated in me the need to repair the ruptured fabric of a painfully discontinuous, fragmentary history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011415249">2010</xref>: 19). Having received both traumatic postmemories of the war <italic>and</italic> a fond nostalgia for home, the children of Holocaust survivors are driven by a desire to resolve the contradictions and come to a fuller understanding of their parents’ history. While the concept of postmemory has been profoundly influential in memory studies and particularly Holocaust studies, the nostalgic side of second-generation inheritance – which does not depend on trauma to arise – has not been adequately theorized.</p>
<p>For Edwards, it is not the traumas of internment and ethnic violence that make Istria compelling, but the contradictions, the gaps in her knowledge, and the cultural losses that are felt, in Roberta Rubenstein’s terms, as ‘the presence of absence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698011415249">2001</xref>: 5). Edwards recalls her husband’s scepticism and irritation when she wants to interrupt a vacation in Venice in order to travel to the remote island of her mother’s birth. She has, after all, been there before. ‘You have to go to the actual place?’ he asks. ‘What do you expect to find there?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 38). ‘How can I know until I find it?’ she responds. When she went there before, she was too young to understand ‘the context, the history, the meaning. I had been too young to see, or to want to see, my mother in the place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 39). Yet there is more than just a desire for knowledge driving her, but a nostalgia, a deep affective longing for connection with a place that has been lost, for an absence that continues to animate her life in the present. Though her husband cannot see it, she continues to insist that Lussino is a special place. ‘How can you explain magic to someone who does not sense it?’ she wonders. ‘Besides, on this visit, the blue sea, the white houses with red roofs, the walk beneath the pine and oak trees conjured for me not so much magic as the memory of magic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 49). The word ‘magic’ evokes the fondness of nostalgia, yet also inherent in this ‘magic’ is a simultaneous sense of loss. This memory of magic, moreover, is not her own, but a ‘memory’ filtered to her through her family.</p>
<p>I have termed this inherited memory ‘genealogical nostalgia’, the second generation’s longing for the times and places of their ancestors’ stories, a nostalgia drawn not out of direct experience, but out of the very gaps between personal memory and genealogical legacies. Genealogical nostalgia, we might say, is the nostalgic counterpart to postmemory, the inherited memory of trauma. ‘Genealogical’ references the kinship ties that link us with other people and eras, and hints at the Foucauldian gaps and inventions that mark imagined histories. ‘Nostalgia’, here, is more than just sentimental idealization. It constitutes what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698011415249">Nadia Atia and Jeremy Davies (2010)</xref>, in the recent <italic>Memory Studies</italic> special issue on nostalgia, term ‘active nostalgia’, a nostalgia that bears a critical, analytic capacity in its very structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698011415249">2010</xref>: 183). Derived from the Greek <italic>nostos</italic>, ‘return home’, and <italic>algia</italic>, meaning ‘pain’ or ‘longing’, the term nostalgia signals profound loss in its very etymology. While it is oriented toward the past, then, nostalgia is in fact rooted in the present, where the distance between the time and place of longing and the current moment is registered as ‘the presence of absence’: ‘an absence that continues to occupy a palpable emotional space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698011415249">Rubenstein, 2001</xref>: 5). For the second generation, this absence evokes a particular kind of longing, one generated by dialogical, fragmented narratives and therefore more dependent upon imagination.</p>
<p>Edwards is responding to the affect that is transmitted to her by older generations, and reconstructing memory from the vantage point of the here and now. She recalls listening to the nostalgic stories of her aunts of Lussino before the first war, and as she walks along Losinj’s sea walk with her husband, she tells us, ‘I carried my memory of their memories. I carried this time and the visit before and the visit before that (my first time in this place), and my mother’s time and my aunt’s time, when they were young until they were old, and my grandmother’s time and her mother’s time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 50). Her ‘memories’ here are not direct, or even unified, yet she nevertheless ‘carries’ them with her, as if they have a material substance, a weight.</p>
<p>Hirsch and Spitzer explain that the second generation’s desire to visit the homeland is spawned out of the hope of connecting the dominant, inherited postmemories to a physical site, ‘of bringing the memories back to the place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011415249">2010</xref>: 11). As with the material presence of the ruin, physically being in the place brings more positive ‘memories of memories’ into Edwards’s own experience, attaching them to the senses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750698011415249">C. Nadia Seremetakis (1996)</xref>, in her book on memory and the senses, expands on the Greek etymology of nostalgia, arguing that memory and the senses are intertwined in such a way that memory is ‘a sense organ in-it-self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750698011415249">1996</xref>: 9). The memory of a taste, for example, becomes a re-experiencing of that taste; the opposite of <italic>nostos</italic>, she teaches us, is <italic>a-nostos</italic>, lack of taste. Nostalgia, in this sense, is similar to trauma in that it involves not a distanced, reflective memory of the past, but a momentary re-living of it. Edwards has no direct access to the sensory aspects of her ancestors’ memories; her nostalgia, then, like her postmemory, is particular, defined not by a re-experiencing of the past but by her very inability to do so. Her visit offers her new possibilities. In her mother’s hometown she catches ‘whiffs of sharp rosemary, sweet broom, the duskiness of laurel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 61). She feels the slippery grey stones beneath her feet, and regards the garden walls of the villas. This physical, sensory experience enables an entangling of others’ memories with her own. It also enables her to create an evocative setting for her readers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698011415249">Ruth Abbot (2010)</xref>, in an essay on Wordsworth, the quintessential nostalgic poet, posits:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>longing begets literature, and literature in return offers consolation for nostalgia’s grief. Backward-looking nostalgia for lost times gives birth to forward-looking writing seeking to give shape to time itself: Wordsworth may be unable himself to return to the past that he feels is his home, but he can write a poem that can, and however much he may revise, rewrite or re-title it over successive years, in the time of the Ode, past and present can be united in a single shape. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698011415249">2010</xref>: 208)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar to the narrative of trauma that must be told to an empathetic listener, the narrative of nostalgia, in all its fragments, is told here to an empathetic reader.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750698011415249">3</xref></sup> The heightened sensory descriptions of the memoir briefly unite the past and present, creating a tentative intimacy with the place.</p>
<p>Yet it is an intimacy that can never be fully realized. As Edwards hears a man on a boat call out to someone passing on the street, she writes, ‘nothing and everything had changed. The familiar scene felt disconnected, foreign to me. I knew the Lussino of dreams and memories, the backdrop to and focus of stories, the home that had been lost, stolen. I knew the Lussino built of the white gleaming stones of nostalgia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 48). If nostalgia is a longing for a past that can never be relived and for a home to which we can never really return, Edwards’s genealogical nostalgia is not resolved by this journey, but heightened. Her family’s losses and longings have become her own, and yet this loss is also intensified by a feeling of foreignness, of being disconnected from the very memories she carries.</p>
<p><italic>Finding Rosa</italic> is not, then, the naive quest to uncover a complete history and a perfect origin; instead Edwards’s book is a genealogy in the Foucauldian sense of disparity, multiplicity and error. In ‘Nietzsche, Genealogy, History’, Foucault rejects ‘traditional history’ in favour of a Nietzschean ‘historical sense’ that ‘confirms our existence among countless lost events, without a landmark or point of reference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698011415249">1977</xref>: 155). ‘The purpose of history, guided by genealogy’, Foucault writes, ‘is not to discover the roots of our identity but to commit itself to its dissipation. It does not seek to define our unique threshold of emergence, the homeland to which metaphysicians promise a return; it seeks to make visible all of those discontinuities that cross us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698011415249">1977</xref>: 162). This sense of ‘genealogy’ is key to genealogical nostalgia as a literary practice. While Edwards purports to seek identity and truth through knowledge of the past, the structure of her work undermines or complicates this goal. The gaps in her knowledge lead to a dialogic, postmodern quality of writing, where shifts in genre and metafictional reflections continually highlight the second generation’s lack of access to their history – the ‘dissipation’ and ‘discontinuity’ of identity. She describes, for example, the interior of her mother’s house, with its ‘Persian carpet in the parlor, English china in the dining room, Italian silver on the sideboard. A Murano glass chandelier. Mum could not remember these details, but I’ve based them on the other homes in Lussingrande – ones I have seen or heard about’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 81). Edwards does not allow her research to simply recreate the house, but must continually remind her readers that she does not have perfect access to this past: ‘My imagination, fed by research and interviews, erects the rooms of the house, as it once was. Were there servants to clean and scrub, to cook for the eight children? Why not?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 81). She at once highlights the gaps in knowledge that characterize second-generation experience, and demonstrates that the more intimate inheritances of family memories are inextricable from a larger ethnic history.</p>
<p>Rubenstein argues that when the presence of absence is felt in response to the loss of something ‘with collective or communal associations’, it generates a ‘cultural mourning’ that nostalgia attempts to repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698011415249">2001</xref>: 5). While nostalgia is often considered a regressive emotion, this reparative function is key to understanding not only personal losses, but larger cultural losses in diaspora and their ongoing implications across generations. Nostalgia, as Edwards herself points out, is etymologically and psychologically related to the uncanny, <italic>the unheimlich</italic>, the opposite ‘of being at home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 319). In this sense it is not simply a synonym for sentimental idealization but an affect that registers both personal and cultural loss. In her study of immigrant nostalgia, <italic>Yesterday’s Self</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698011415249">Andreea Deciu Ritivoi (2002)</xref> shows that nostalgia plays an important role in maintaining the immigrant’s sense of self after the dramatic rupture of diaspora. Ritivoi considers a person’s identity and sense of self as being constituted by a collection of stored memories that are integrated into a structure or narrative. She adds, however, that ‘I cannot go back into the past and find “myself” featured in a situation, just as I cannot find “myself” in the present. The constant gap between yesterday and today is what constitutes the self, by inviting recollection and reflection that can offer a structure to account for both “now” and “then”‘ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698011415249">2002</xref>: 54–5). Drawing on the work of philosopher David Lewis, Ritivoi uses the example of surgery to explain this process: ‘I confirm my survival by observing the continuity and mental connectedness between who I was prior to the event and the person resulting from the operation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698011415249">2002</xref>: 128). Similarly, Atia and Davies assert that nostalgia serves as a negotiation between the continuities and discontinuities that constitute personal identity: nostalgia ‘insists on the bond between our present selves and a certain fragment of the past, but also on the force of our separation from what we have lost’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698011415249">2010</xref>: 184). I argue that genealogical nostalgia plays the same role on a larger scale. In diasporic groups displacement remains a key cultural memory, even for those born after the moment of rupture. The second generation, having inherited the stories, postmemories and ethnic culture that ties them to another place, is compelled to mend the breach between their ethnic heritage or ‘homeland’ and their birthplace, building a collective narrative that includes their own experience. This narrative is not linear or teleological, but rather incorporates both the ‘continuities and discontinuities’ that Atia and Davies identify as key to identity formation. The second generation’s nostalgia, in other words, is not just a longing for an idealized past but a means of connecting their own sense of ethnic identity with that of a group at large that has survived the ruptures of displacement.</p>

<title>Diaspora and relational autobiography</title>
<p>This process of longing, searching and imagining is therefore a central part of what becomes Edwards’s own autobiography. While <italic>Finding Rosa</italic> is a memoir of her mother’s life and her slow demise, it is also a very personal account of Edwards’s own search for answers, of the difficulties of caring for her mother at the end of her life, and of Edwards’s complex emotional response to her relationship with her mother. In her book on memoirs of a parent’s death, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698011415249">Nancy Miller (2000)</xref> describes the complex process of ‘realization’ in memoirs of a dead parent – a negotiation between resentment and forgiveness through which the child re-imagines the parent ‘as a person with whom you can deal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698011415249">2000</xref>: 6). The writing process, she argues, thereby becomes an important part of the grieving process, a way of avoiding both melancholic loss or resentment and idealization. Edwards emphasizes this process of mourning through writing by finishing her memoir not with her mother’s death, but with a moment a few months prior to her death when, ‘uncharacteristically, she had matched my kiss on the cheek. “Thank you,” Mum said’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 333). This moment of unexpected gratitude and what Edwards takes to be ‘a blessing’ provides a sense of closure for the book, suggesting that she has come to terms with her mother’s life and death, and is finally able to forgive and to let go. Abbot helpfully points out that <italic>nostos</italic> is also a term in Greek poetics for the end of a poem. She evocatively asks, ‘by nostalgically recovering this poetic sense of <italic>nostos</italic>, might we not also be able to recover the critical energies that nostalgia seems to have lost?’ She proposes that the longings of nostalgia could be integral not just to critical writing, but to critical reading, ‘insofar as all reading is driven by a longing to understand the lines and words that lie in the poem’s past, by reaching a kind of critical homecoming that can only know the poem wholly, can only understand its beginnings, at its end’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698011415249">2010</xref>: 212). Extending this idea from poetry to memoir, this nostalgic memory of gratitude and forgiveness at the end of <italic>Finding Rosa</italic> offers a sense of ‘homecoming’ that brings the text as a whole into relief. This ‘homecoming’ does not involve the physical locale of Lussino, but rather a sense of resolution on both a psychological and a literary level.</p>
<p>According to Miller, the process of ‘realization’ involves the acknowledgment that the child and parent’s ‘related identities are forged in a process of complex negotiation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698011415249">2000</xref>: 6). In this sense, Edwards’s memoir is as much autobiography as biography; it is a memoir of how her own identity has been shaped by this relationship. It is an example of what life writing theorist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698011415249">Paul John Eakin (1999)</xref> terms ‘relational autobiography’, in which ‘the self’s story [is] viewed through the lens of its relation with some key other person’, or ‘proximate other’, such as a sibling, lover, or parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698011415249">1999</xref>: 86). The story of the author gathering the material for her text in such autobiographies constitutes what Eakin calls ‘the story of the story’. The story of the story ‘structures the narrative we read; the stress is on the performance of the collaboration and therefore on the relation between the two individuals involved’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698011415249">1999</xref>: 59). Edwards’s text is not just a memoir of her mother, but a memoir of her own troubled and shifting relationship to her mother and her mother’s history. As Eakin writes, ‘the narrative structure in these cases is telling us something fundamental about the relational structure of the autobiographer’s identity, about its roots and involvement in another’s life and story’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698011415249">1999</xref>: 60). This relational aspect of identity, I would add, can be applied not only to other people but to other places as well, whether experienced first hand or conjured by narrative and imagination. This relationality is taken to a metaphorical level in one of Edwards’s chapter epigraphs, from an Alzheimer’s Symptoms Web site: ‘Early Symptoms: <italic>The sufferer will hide an object to keep it safe from thieves and then forget that she has hidden the object. Also, she will search without knowing what she is searching for</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 110). This epigraph not only describes Rosa, but also seems applicable to Edwards herself, who is also searching without knowing what she is searching for. The epigraph does not simply compare second-generation subjectivity to Alzheimer’s, but rather invites parallels between the parent and child’s current experiences. As Edwards walks through the streets of Lussino, overtaken by her senses, she is ‘seized with apprehension, a sense of failure, of having forgotten something essential’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 61). As Rosa literally is forgetting her past, Edwards cannot shake the feeling that she too has ‘forgotten’ something essential to herself by virtue of being born in another place. Miller writes that ‘most children desire to uncover their parents’ truth. Wanting to know their story is central to the desire for self-knowledge that also drives the autobiographical project: How can I know who I am if I don’t know who they are?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698011415249">2000</xref>: 107). For the children of diaspora, I argue, the desire to ‘uncover’ this relational history becomes tied to the places and contexts from which the family story has been removed. For Edwards, this removal becomes a source of longing, of brief moments of recovery and connection, but ultimately a source of anxiety – of ‘having forgotten something essential’ to her very self.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, then, we are witness to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698011415249">Stuart Hall (1989)</xref> calls the ‘process of identification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698011415249">1989</xref>: 15). Reflecting on second-generation identities, Hall argues that ‘we tell ourselves the stories of the parts of our roots in order to come into contact, creatively, with [the past]. So this new kind of ethnicity – the emergent ethnicities – has a relationship to the past, but it is a relationship that is partly through memory, partly through narrative, one that has to be recovered. It is an act of cultural recovery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698011415249">1989</xref>: 19). Hall’s use of the contested term ‘ethnicity’ involves not just affiliation with a ‘minority’ group in the birthplace, but a second-generation identity construction that draws on diasporic memories as well as a relationship to that birthplace through difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698011415249">1989</xref>: 19). For Hall, this is the ‘new ethnicity. It is a new conception of our identities because it has not lost hold of the place and ground from which we can speak, yet it is no longer contained within that place as an essence. It wants to address a much wider variety of experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698011415249">1989</xref>: 20). As an ‘act of cultural recovery’ and a ‘process’, second-generation ethnicity or identity is never complete nor fixed, and second-generation memoir in turn reflects the complex and shifting negotiations that the children of immigrants encounter in constructing their sense of self.</p>
<p>Identity, for Edwards, is ultimately ‘a shell game’: ‘Round and round, this shell game, find-the-identity, was both dizzying and foolish. Round and round, faster than the eye could see or the heart could know. And yet, the wager had been a home, a country, a life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 327). In a shell game, the mark will never find the ball beneath the correct shell, because the ball has been palmed, and all the shells are empty. Edwards’ metaphor acknowledges the weight that is placed on this identity search – a home, a country, a life – but in the end admits that the search is futile. Rubenstein explains that ‘the original home is less an actual place than a site located in memory and fantasy, a psychic space invested with nostalgia for an idealized notion of wholeness. By the time it can be imagined, home is always already lost’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 127). For Edwards, ‘home’ can never be visited because it exists as a fantasy, as ‘the imagination’s <italic>place marker</italic> for a vision of personal (and cultural) re/union, encompassing both that which actually may have been experienced in the vanished past and that which never could have been’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698011415249">Rubenstein, 2001</xref>: 164–165). Similarly, Hirsch and Spitzer write that ‘for us, in the postmemorial generation, “returning to the place” could not serve as a means of <italic>reparation</italic> or <italic>recovery</italic>. Having inherited shards of memory, positive and negative, we could not hope to reunite the fragments. Instead, our journey remained a process of searching – a creative vehicle of contact and transmission enabling an encounter between nostalgic and negative memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698011415249">2003</xref>: 86). What I would add is that this ‘creative vehicle’, when enacted in life writing, reveals more than an encounter between generations and between nostalgic and negative memory – it demonstrates the relational aspects of identity itself.</p>
<p>For Edwards, then, there <italic>is</italic> a sense of resolution, not in the journeys to Istria, but in this very process of searching – in the symbolic journey, in other words, of writing the memoir. Several of the epigraphs that begin each chapter are taken from <italic>The Odyssey;</italic> a technique that frames the memoir as a journey in itself. The book ends with Edwards’s mother’s death: ‘she passed away, but I still hung on. For years. Until I arrived at Rosina Ponaronzo. Until I knew her. Until I wrote this book’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 334). ‘Until I <italic>arrived</italic> at Rosina Ponaronzo’, she writes, emphasizing the <italic>metaphorical</italic> travels that she has undertaken over the physical ones. Her mother, in this sense, is imagined as a place, as a kind of home. Rubenstein shows how literary texts frequently intertwine idealizations of lost homelands with absent mother figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698011415249">2001</xref>: 24–25). For Edwards, neither Istria nor her mother have been particularly nurturing, yet through her writing she stakes a claim to both her mother and the place as significant sources of her identity.</p>
<p>Yet even as she ‘arrives’, as she claims that she now ‘knows’ her mother, Edwards acknowledges that many gaps remain in her narrative. She reaches a conclusion about her grandfather’s disappearance, but still does not know for sure how, where, or when he died. The moment when he is rounded up with other men from the village before tiny Rosa’s terrified eyes is fictionalized, another moment emphasizing the imaginative work required to construct a narrative from the conflicting fragments of history. Rosa remains as distant and difficult to navigate as the streets of Losinj.</p>
<p>We are left, then, with a sense that the process of writing back to Istria brings Edwards closer to knowledge of the culture that has ‘shaped’ both her mother and herself, but the gaps in that knowledge also work to ‘shape’ identity, as they emphasize the particularity of second-generation experience. As it is for Odysseus, a perfect return to origins is ultimately impossible; one of Edwards’s last epigraphs, to the chapter called ‘Going Home’, reminds us that ‘After so long an absence, [Odysseus] failed to recognize [Ithaca]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415249">2008</xref>: 316). The old adage ‘you can never go home again’, has a particular meaning for the second-generation, because for these children of diaspora the very meaning of ‘home’ is ambiguous, shifting, unobtainable. Even as the text ‘arrives’ at Rosina Ponaronzo, family memoir, or relational autobiography, always reveals more about the teller than the subject.</p>
<p>For Edwards, the trip home, along with the research and writing that go around it, is not about generating cultural capital, or returning to the wellspring of ethnic identity. It is about finding identity in relationships with the significant others in our lives, and in the very distance that characterizes the second generation.</p>

<p>This genealogical drive seems particularly strong in Canada, where post-immigrant generations struggle to construct their identities against colonial legacies, and within a framework of official multiculturalism, which is not only entrenched in Canadian law but also a defining Canadian ideology. Sugars posits that ‘if the absence of clear origins can be said to be something that defines the contemporary Canadian state … it also contributes to a shared obsession with origins and ancestors. Where is here?, the archetypal words of the settler-invader, is transformed into How did I/we get here?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698011415249">2005</xref>: 179). Other prominent examples of Canadian life writing from post-immigrant perspectives include works by Fred Wah, Janice Kulyk Keefer, Myrna Kostash, Denise Chong and Wayson Choy.</p>

<p>Though Edwards was born in England, she has lived in Canada since the age of seven and therefore may be considered a member of the second generation as someone who has been socialized and fully educated in Canada. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698011415249">Jantzen (2008)</xref> for a discussion of some of the issues that arise from rigid statistical categorization of generations.</p>
