<abstract>
<p>Internal jugular vein cannulation is a common clinical procedure but not without risks including inadvertent artery puncture. The incidence of vertebral artery puncture during internal jugular vein cannulation is unclear but is thought to be much less than carotid artery involvement. Here, we describe an unsuspected case of vertebral artery cannulation with a Vas Cath dialysis catheter which was used for hemofiltration before the inadvertent artery cannulation was discovered later during open surgical retrieval.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 75-year-old man developed acute renal failure requiring hemofiltration immediately after coronary artery bypass surgery. A 12-F 2-lumen Vas Cath dialysis catheter was inserted into his left “internal jugular vein”. A routine postcannulation check chest plain film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412469282">Figure 1</xref>) was initially thought to be unremarkable, with the dialysis catheter appearing to be situated in the correct position. Hemofiltration was then commenced overnight with no complication. In the following morning, alarm was raised when blood sampled from the dialysis catheter demonstrated typical arterial rather than venous blood gas readings. An iatrogenic arterial cannulation was confirmed when arterial waveforms were detected using a pressure transducer. A second look at the earlier postcannulation check chest plain film found that the dialysis catheter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412469282">Figure 1</xref>; black arrows) did not enter the heart through the superior vena cava which was outlined by a central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412469282">Figure 1</xref>; white arrow) inserted preoperatively. The vascular surgeons were called and the neck was surgically explored under general anesthetics in the operating theater. Initially, the common, external, and internal carotid arteries were thought to be involved, hence they were exposed. However, the dialysis catheter was found not to be inserted to the common, external, or the internal carotid arteries. Following this, the dialysis catheter was followed through with careful dissection. The subclavian artery and its branches were suspected to be involved. Finally, the dialysis catheter was found to have been inserted into the origin of the left vertebral artery, a branch of the left subclavian artery. Both subclavian and vertebral arteries were clamped and the catheter was removed. The vertebral artery defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412469282">Figure 2</xref>; arrow) was repaired with 6/0 polypropylene suture.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most of the inadvertent arterial punctures during internal jugular vein cannulation, with a reported incidence of 0.5% to 11.4%, have been attributed to carotid artery puncture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412469282">1</xref>
</sup> The incidence of vertebral artery puncture during internal jugular vein cannulation is unclear but is thought to be much less than carotid artery puncture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412469282">1</xref>
</sup> Vertebral artery punctures often went unnoticed until patients presented with delayed symptoms or complications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412469282">1</xref>
</sup> Serious complications that have been described following vertebral artery injury include arterial dissection causing acute neurological injury,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412469282">2</xref>
</sup> arteriovenous fistula, hemothorax,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412469282">3</xref>
</sup> and pseudoaneurysm obstructing the airway.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412469282">4</xref>
</sup> Our case highlights that iatrogenic arterial catheterization during central venous cannulation may not appear obvious immediately. Thorough assessment of the check chest plain film, blood gas readings, and other symptoms and signs may be important in detecting it. However, central venous catheter placement should always be done under ultrasound guidance, whenever possible, to prevent or reduce the risk of arterial puncture.<sup>
