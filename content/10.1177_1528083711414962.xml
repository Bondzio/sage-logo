<p>The performance of ultraviolet (UV) protection, antimicrobial activity, and self-cleaning characteristics of nano titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) with acrylic binder were assessed on the cotton fabric using pad-dry-cure method. Titanium iso-propoxide was used as precursor with two different mediums of water and ethanol to synthesize nano-sol by sol-gel technique. The synthesized nano-sol-gel was then characterized by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, particle size analyzer (PSA), X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The nano TiO<sub>2</sub> finished cotton fabrics were tested for ultraviolet protection factor (UPF), antimicrobial activity, self-cleaning action, and physical properties. The wash fastness of TiO<sub>2</sub> nano finished cotton fabrics for 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th washes was assessed and also their ultra protection factor values and the percentage reduction in bacteria in each stage were reported. The self-cleaning activity was assessed for 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours duration by exposing coffee stain on the specimen fabrics to sunlight. The TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles had 12 nm when ethanol medium was used and 7 nm for water. The smaller nanoparticles had showed better results regards antimicrobial activity and self-cleaning. In case of UV-protection function it was found that the fabrics treated with 12 nm nanoparticles exhibit higher UPF values than the fabric treated with 7 nm nanoparticles. The durability of the imparted function was in the range of 32–36 washes for antimicrobial activity and UV-protection property.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1528083711414962" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nanotechnology is one of the key technologies of the 21st century. It is used in all fields including textile industries for medical, hygienic, and technical textiles. In the recent years, consumers have become increasingly aware of the need for sunrays protection. The ultraviolet (UV) radiation can lead to acute and chronic reactions and damage, such as acceleration of skin aging and sunburn. Approximately 10% of sun protection of the skin against the action of solar radiation is a relatively new objective of textile finishing, since the textile does not always guarantee adequate protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1528083711414962">1</xref>]. Thus, a special additional sun protection finish is applied in the form of UV stabilizers. Atmosphere absorbs most of the noxious radiations emitted by the sun, only 5% of the harmful radiations reach to the surface of the earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1528083711414962">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1528083711414962">4</xref>]. Sun emits three types of UV radiation UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1528083711414962">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1528083711414962">6</xref>]. The visible spectrum is approximately of the range from 400 to 700 nm in wavelength. UV-B rays range from 280 to 320 nm and they are the primary concern for protection. The UV-A rays range from 320 to 400 nm. The actual damage to human skin from UV radiation is a function of the wavelength of the incident radiation and the wavelengths of maximum danger to skin are 305–310 nm. Therefore to be useful in protecting the wearers from solar UV radiation, textiles must demonstrate effectiveness in the 300–320 nm range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1528083711414962">5</xref>]. The ozone layer blocks the sun output of UV-C and most UV-B radiations. The UV-B radiation that reaches the earth surface poses the greatest danger for sunburn and skin damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1528083711414962">7</xref>]. Personal risks can be largely averted by avoiding exposure to the sun during the middle of the day by covering up with appropriate clothing, headgear, and sunglasses, and by using sun protection factor (SPF) 30+ sunscreen. The UV absorbers are compatible with dyes and these finishes can be applied by normal pad-dry-cure method between 30 and 40 g/L depending on the type of fiber and its construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1528083711414962">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1528083711414962">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The awareness of UV radiation of health and hygiene has increased the demand for functional textiles or protective textiles. One of the approaches to improve the UV-blocking property, antimicrobial activity, and self-cleaning activity of fabrics is to coat the surface with nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1528083711414962">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1528083711414962">11</xref>]. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles embedded in polymer matrices like soluble starch are a good example of functional nanostructures with potential for applications such as UV protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1528083711414962">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1528083711414962">13</xref>]. Metal oxides like titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) and ZnO UV blockers are more stable compared to organic UV-blocking agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1528083711414962">14</xref>]. TiO<sub>2</sub> and other ceramic materials have an absorption capacity in the UV region of 280–400 nm and reflects visible and infrared (IR) rays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1528083711414962">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1528083711414962">16</xref>]. Hence, a common nanosize TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO will enhance the UV-blocking property due to their increased surface area and intense absorption in the UV region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1528083711414962">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1528083711414962">18</xref>]. Moreover, treating the fabric with nanosized silver particles found to improve antibacterial properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1528083711414962">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1528083711414962">20</xref>]. To certain degree, sterilizing effect are displayed by metallic ions and metallic compound. A part of the oxygen in the air or water is turned into active oxygen by means of catalysis with the metallic ion, thereby dissolving the organic substance to create a sterilizing effect. The use of nanosized particles would help to maximize antibacterial activity as the number of particles per unit area is higher. TiO<sub>2</sub> is a photocatalyst, when it is illuminated by light with energy higher than its band gaps, the electrons in titanium dioxide will jump from the valence bond to the conduction bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1528083711414962">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1528083711414962"> 22</xref>]. Several articles have discussed the use of the photocatalytic property of TiO<sub>2</sub> in the field of textiles. A fabric treated with TiO<sub>2</sub> could provide effective protection against bacteria and the discoloration of stains due to the photocatalytic activity of nano TiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>In the present work, Titanium iso-propoxide is synthesized into nano-sol by 	<?tjl?>sol-gel technique with water (T<sub>1</sub>) or ethanol (T<sub>2</sub>) as a medium. Two sets of nanoparticles were successfully synthesized. The synthesized nano-sol was then characterized using the typical methods of FTIR, PSA, XRD, and SEM. These nano-sols were then applied on to the sample fabrics using a pad-dry-cure method. Then, the treated fabric samples were tested for the functions of antimicrobial activity, ultraviolet protection factor (UPF), and self-cleaning activity as per American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) standard tests. The treated samples were also tested for the durability of the effect after repeated washes.</p></sec>

The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1528083711414962">Figure 1(a)</xref>, FTIR spectra from untreated sample, did not show any peak at 432 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which confirm the presence of TiO<sub>2</sub> at the treated samples. The peaks at 3,000 and 1,200 cm<sup>−1</sup> indicate the presence of –OH and C = O residues, probably due to atmospheric moisture and CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively.

<p><italic>X-ray diffraction (XRD).</italic> The spectra shows well-defined peaks typical of TiO<sub>2</sub> in the crystal structure of titania, according to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standard (JCPDS) card number 29-1360. The XRD spectra patterns of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles obtained using titanium iso-propoxide precursor sample with ethanol (T<sub>2</sub>) as medium is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1528083711414962">Figure 2</xref>. The XRD patterns of sample T<sub>1</sub> showed six distinctive TiO<sub>2</sub> peaks, the distinctive TiO<sub>2</sub> peaks were at 29.91, 47.87, 56.94, and 74.79. The mean crystallite size of a powder sample was estimated from the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak according to the Scherrer's equation. Both figures exhibit peaks similar to those reported for TiO<sub>2</sub>, which suggests the formation of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles in anatase form. The XRD pattern for TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles obtained with water (T<sub>1</sub>) medium shows much sharper peaks than the pattern (T<sub>2</sub>) with ethanol medium. This means that the crystallanity is more for T<sub>1</sub> than that of T<sub>2</sub>.

The TiO<sub>2</sub> (T<sub>1</sub>) nanoparticles show marginally better antibacterial activity when compared to TiO<sub>2</sub> (T<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles. A decrease in the size of particles fundamentally results in increase in the surface area. This in turn results is more antimicrobial activity for T<sub>1</sub> (7 nm) than T<sub>2</sub> (12 nm).

This fully confirms the concept that the nanoparticles get bound to the fibre (and thus the fabric) surface on their own because of their high surface energy. The large size nanoparticles possess less surface energy than the small size nanoparticles and hence, the large nanoparticles get released after less number of washes. T<sub>1</sub> (water) fabric sample exhibits a better value of antimicrobial activity compared to T<sub>2</sub> (ethanol) fabric sample.

<p>The 100% cotton fabrics treated with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles of T<sub>1</sub> shows lower UPF values than the same fabrics treated with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles of T<sub>2</sub>. According to Raleigh's scattering theory, the scattering of light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength. The optimum particle size for scattering the radiation is calculated as 15–40 nm. This clearly indicates that nanoparticles nearer to the range of 15–40 nm exhibit better scattering of UV rays. Out of T<sub>1</sub> (7 nm) and T<sub>2</sub> (12 nm), T<sub>2</sub> is closer to the above said range. And hence the UPF value for T<sub>2</sub> is more than T<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>The self-cleaning property of TiO<sub>2</sub>-coated cotton textile is based on the highly oxidative intermediates generated at the cotton surface. The mechanism of photocatalysis reaction in presence of these particles is well established and is reported by many researchers. The K/S values (absorption to scattering coefficient) of exposed and unexposed parts of the samples were measured after 0, 12, 24, and 48 hours. The comparison of K/S values of different test sample are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1528083711414962">Figure 9</xref>. The percentage decrease in K/S value for the exposed samples in comparison to unexposed sample is measured to quantify the self-cleaning activity. The rate of degradation of coffee stain is faster in first 12 hours of exposure. In the nanoparticles-coated samples, no visual deterioration in the properties of cotton fabric is observed up to 48 hours of exposure. The nanoparticles of smaller size have more surface area and exhibits superior self-cleaning action. The smaller nanoparticles of T<sub>1</sub> (7 nm) show better self-cleaning activity than T<sub>2</sub> (12 nm).The TiO<sub>2</sub>, which has a particle size below 10 nm, was found to have higher self-cleaning activity. The sample coated with nano-sol T<sub>1</sub> shows a better photocatalytic activity then T<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1528083711414962">Figure 9</xref>, after the first 12 hours of exposure of the sample, it was observed that the decrease in K/S value was nearly 68%.

<p>The nano TiO<sub>2</sub>-treated cotton fabrics were tested the important functional properties viz. antimicrobial activity, UV protection, and self-cleaning activity. The durability characteristics of the multifunctional treatments of the cotton treated fabrics were studied. The influences of the surface treatment of nanoparticles on the mechanical properties of the treated fabrics were examined.</p>
<p>The following conclusions have been drawn from the test results:<list id="list5-1528083711414962" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In the synthesis of TiO<sub>2</sub>, water medium at 30°C yields nanoparticles of size 7 nm, whereas ethanol medium at 75°C yields nanoparticles of size 12 nm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The FTIR analysis was carried out to analyze the presence of TiO<sub>2</sub> on the cotton fabric. The presence of an IR signature in the region 432 cm<sup>−1</sup> in the finished product indicate the presence of TiO<sub>2</sub> in the treated fabric. The PSA was used to analyze the nanoparticles, which conforms that water medium give nanoparticles of size 7 nm and ethanol medium of size 12 nm. The XRD spectra of the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle were analyzed and the presences of well-defined peaks indicate the crystalline structure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The particle size plays a primary role in determining their adhesion to the fibers. It was observed that the larger particle agglomerates and were easily removed from the fabric surface, while the smaller particle penetrate deeper and adhere strongly into the fabric matrix.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the case of antimicrobial activity, the fabrics treated with smaller sized TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (T<sub>1</sub>) 7 nm show better results than the fabrics treated with slightly large sized (12 nm) TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (T<sub>2</sub>). These results are due to the fact that a decrease in the size of particles increases the surface area.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the case of UV-protection function, it was interesting to find that the fabrics treated with slightly larger sized (12 nm) TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (T<sub>2</sub>) have higher UPF values than the fabrics that were treated with smaller sized (7 nm) TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (T<sub>1</sub>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the case of self-cleaning activity, the smaller nanoparticle size in situ coating of TiO<sub>2</sub> derived using sol-gel technique; nano-sol TiO<sub>2</sub> (T<sub>1</sub>) show better self-cleaning activity as compared to large nanoparticles of nano-sol TiO<sub>2</sub> (T<sub>2</sub>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The UPF and antimicrobial activity increases enormously after TiO<sub>2</sub> finishing on cotton, when compared to untreated fabric and is retained until 10 washes; beyond 15 washes there was deterioration in UPF values and antimicrobial value. The durability of the imparted functions was in the range of 32–36 washes for antimicrobial activity and UPF value.</p></list-item>
