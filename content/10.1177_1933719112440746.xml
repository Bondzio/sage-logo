<abstract>
<p>The aim of the present work was to quantitate the temporal and stage-specific effects of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone on the proliferation and differentiation capacities of the human seminiferous epithelium. Seminiferous tubule fragments were kept in culture for 28 days and 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine incorporation was used to determine cell proliferation. Data demonstrated a gradual loss of germ cells during the culture period, no decrease in Sertoli cell numbers, and maintenance of the general architecture of the seminiferous tubules. Both FSH and testosterone increased germ cell survival, spermatogonia proliferation, and germ cell differentiation, especially during the first week of culture. At the end of the first week, differentiation of spermatocytes was observed, especially when 50 IU/L FSH and 1 µmol/L testosterone were used. In conclusion, using this methodology, it was possible to quantify germ cell proliferation and differentiation, in a reproducible way, with results compatible with the timing of human spermatogenesis in vivo.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis is a hormone-dependent process. Hormones are critical for the regulation and development of germ cells, as well as the functioning of somatic cells. In the testicle, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is critical in the beginning of spermatogenesis, and both FSH and testosterone (T) are necessary for the differentiation of germ cells.<sup>

<p>The aim of the present work was to quantitatively study the proliferation and differentiation of human spermatogenic cells during the long-term culture of human seminiferous tubules (ST) from patients with complete spermatogenesis using 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma, Saint Louis, USA) for the detection of proliferative cells and evaluate the temporal and stage-specific effects of FSH and T on the proliferation and differentiation capacities of the human seminiferous epithelium.</p>

<title>Biological Material</title>
<p>According to the National Law on Medically Assisted Procreation (PMA, Law 32/2006) and the National Council on Medically Assisted Procreation (CNPMA, 2008) guidelines, human ST fragments were obtained, after patients’ informed and written consent. In our center, the only available cases with complete spermatogenesis (albeit not considered normal) are hypospermatogenesis. Four cases were selected, with a mean age of 31 years (28-35), that for intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment cycles at treatment open testicular biopsy had abundant germ cells and frequent in situ mobile spermatozoa. Patients had normal serum FSH levels, testicular volume, epididymis, vas deferens, and karyotypes but showed absence of Y chromosome microdeletions and cystic fibrosis mutations. Patients also presented homogeneity for the infertility causes, demographic data, and clinical evaluation.</p>

<sec id="section4-1933719112440746">
<title>Organotypic Culture of Human Testis Explants</title>
<p>Per patient, ten 2-mm<sup>3</sup> fragments of ST were collected from multiple sites of both testes and immediately transferred onto the culture medium sperm preparation medium with Hepes buffer (SPM-HEPES); Medicult, Copenhagen, Denmark) in tissue culture plates Falcon (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey). After cutting (20 fragments of 1 mm<sup>3</sup> each), using surgical blades, they were incubated in 1 mL of SPM at 32°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, in plastic conic graduated tubes (Nunc, Roskild, Denmark; tissue fragments were simply submerged in the media inside the tubes). Experiments were carried out in 3 different culture media: (1) SPM (control); (2) SPM supplemented with 50 IU/L rFSH (human recombinant FSH; Gonal-F, folitropin 2, Orgalutran; Organon, Oss, Netherlands) and 1 µmol/L T (water-soluble T, 50/1; Sigma, Barcelone, Spain); and (3) SPM with 500 IU/L rFSH and 10 µmol/L T (500/10). Cultures were evaluated at 4 different days (0, 7, 14, and 28) for controls and 3 days (7, 14, and 28) for experiments with hormones. The 50/1 concentration was shown to be sufficient to produce the maximal effect on in vitro maturation of germ cells in men with normal spermatogenesis, but pharmacological concentrations of 500/10 were needed to improve the results.<sup>

</sup> To avoid anoxic culture conditions, we used very small testicular fragments, with frequent mixing (15 minutes) and media changes (every 48 hours) and cultured at 32°C. Fragments also contained a small portion of interstitial tissue, which together with the presence of SC in the seminiferous epithelium was expected to help maintain cell interactions and support. The interstitial tissue was not analyzed in the present study.</p>

<sec id="section5-1933719112440746">
<title>Analysis of Cell Replication</title>
<p>Cellular proliferation was measured by means of a BrdU (Sigma) solution at 10 mmol/L in SPM. Three tubes with the BrdU solution were prepared. One tube without hormones, the second with 50 IU/L rFSH and 1 µmol/L T, and the third with 500 IU/L rFSH and 10 µmol/L T. One milliliter of the solution without hormones was added to each of the 4 control tubes (for days 0, 7, 14, and 28). One milliliter of the solution with hormones was then added to each of the 6 tubes (3 tubes for 50/1 and 3 tubes for 500/10) of hormonal experiments (for days 7, 14, and 18). The 10 tubes were then incubated at 32°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 30 minutes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112440746">2</xref>
</sup> During this period, the fragments of the testicular biopsy were prepared. Two fragments of 1 mm<sup>2</sup> each were then placed in each tube and incubated in culture medium with BrdU during 18 hours. In all cases, the tubes were properly labeled and coated with silver paper to avoid any light exposure. After that time, fragments were washed with SPM to totally eliminate BrdU. Tubes were periodically agitated during the day (every 15 minutes) and media changed every 2 days until the end of the experiment. On days 0, 7, 14, and 28, the corresponding fragments were removed and added to the fixative.</p>

<sec id="section6-1933719112440746">
<title>Light Microscopy</title>
<p>Fragments of ST were fixed overnight (4°C) in Bouin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), washed with 70% ethanol (Merck), dehydrated using an increasing sequence of ethanol, cleared with xylene (Merck), and impregnated and embedded in paraffin (Merck). Glass slides (Industrial Quality, Germany) were coated with Vectabond Reagent Solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California). Ten sequential sections (3 µm thick) were obtained from each block, and the first was stained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories) to verify the integrity and the amount of ST. For analysis, each section should contain at least 20 ST. The mean number of ST counted was 36.5 at day 0, 22.5 at day 7, 23 at day 14, and 22.5 at day 28. The total number of ST in each section was counted and the total number of cells in each seminiferous tubule was registered. That is, at different times different ST were counted, and the number of ST did not change at different times or places.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1933719112440746">
<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>Imunohistochemistry was performed with Streptavidin–Biotin and Vectastain universal quick kit detection system (Vector Laboratories). Sections were dewaxed and rehydrated, slides placed in a dark, moistened chamber, incubated (5 minutes, at room temperature [RT]) with 3% hydrogen peroxide (Merck) to block endogenous peroxidases, washed (5 minutes) in distilled water, incubated (10 minutes, RT) with 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid (Sigma) to denature DNA, washed (5 minutes), treated (5 minutes, RT) with 0.01% Trypsin–porcine pancreas trypsin (PBS: Sigma; phosphate buffered saline [PBS]: Biochrom AG Instamed, Berlin, Germany), washed (5 minutes) with distilled water and then PBS. Sections were then incubated (10 minutes, RT) with horse serum (Blocking Solution; Vector Laboratories) to block nonspecific reactive locals, drained, and incubated (15 minutes) with Avidin (Vector) followed (15 minutes) by Biotin (Vector). Thereafter, sections were washed (5 minutes, PBS), incubated (1 hour, 37°C) with a primary monoclonal antibody anti-BrdU (Clone BU33, Immunohistology Grade; Sigma), at 1:200, containing 1.5% Blocking Serum, washed (5 minutes, PBS), incubated (10 minutes, RT) with the universal biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories), washed (5 minutes, PBS), incubated (5 minutes, RT) with Streptavidin–Peroxidase (Vector Laboratories), washed (5 minutes, PBS), labeled with the chromogen 3,3’diaminobenzidine (DAB Substract kit; Vector Laboratories), washed (5 minutes), contrasted with hematoxylin and washed and embedded in Entellan (Merck). As a negative control, incubation with the primary antibody was omitted.</p>

<sec id="section8-1933719112440746">
<title>Quantification of Cell Number</title>
<p>Sections were observed under an optic microscope (Leica DMRBE; Schmidheiny, Switzerland) attached to Leica DFC 480 camera and a digital imaging system (Leica IM50; Schmidheiny) installed in a desktop computer (Intel Pentium 4, Microsoft Windows XP Professional). All cells present in a field were counted. The total number of ST in each section was counted and the total number of positive and negative cells in each ST was registered, according to the following cellular types: Sertoli cells (SC), spermatogonia A dark (Ad), spermatogonia A pale (Ap), spermatogonia B (SGB), primary spermatocytes at leptotene (Lep), primary spermatocytes at zygotene (Zyg), primary spermatocytes at pachytene (Pac), secondary spermatocytes (ST2), round spermatids (Sa), and elongated spermatids (Sd). For quantification purposes, it was difficult to differentiate SGB from Lep and Zyg from Pac, and thus these were aggregated (SGB-Lep; Zyg-Pac).</p>
<p>Cells of the human ST were identified as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112440746">Figure 1</xref>).<sup>

</sup> In the normal human seminiferous epithelium, each section usually does not show all germ cell types, with some sections show a predominance of a cell type. Cells were recognized by position, shape, and size as well as by nuclear morphology (size, nucleolus, and chromatin appearance). Cell recognition was performed by an experienced observer (M. S.). Cells were evaluated regardless of the stage of the cycle of the SE.</p>

Spermatogonia A-dark (Ad) are inserted on the BL and have an ovoid nucleus, with peripheral thick heterochromatin and a pale area in the middle. Spermatogonia A-pale (Ap) are inserted on the BL and have an ovoid nucleus, with fine fibrilar chromatin. Leptotene primary spermatocytes (L) have a spherical nucleus, with fine dense heterochromatin straight cords, forming a clew all over the nucleus. They are smaller than spermatogonia A and are generally above the spermatogonia line. They were counted together with spermatogonia B. Pachytene primary spermatocytes (P) have a large spherical nucleus, with short coarse chromatin cords and are generally above the spermatogonia line. They were counted together with Zyg. They are about 19 to 24 µm in diameter. Round spermatids (Sa) have a small round nucleus, with pale chromatin and a large pale acrosomal vesicle. In sections, the chromatin appears densely stained by hematoxylin. They are about 8 to 10 µm in diameter. Elongated spermatids (Sd) have an elongated dense nucleus and a short basal pale cytoplasm.

<p>Previous quantification of proliferation and differentiation in human testes explants with BrdU<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112440746">24</xref>
</sup> used a specified medium supplemented with 200 ng/mL FSH, 1 IU/mL human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Fragments were incubated for 16 days at 34°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, with change in media every 2 days. To avoid anoxic culture conditions, small testis fragments of 3 mm<sup>3</sup> (to avoid necrosis) were used. Two fragments were placed in each well of a 6-well plate with 2 mL of the medium. Because HCG could not have penetrated the tissue, 5 IU/mL HCG was added to culture in test tubes, but the results were the same. We performed the same method, using smaller fragments (2 mm<sup>3</sup>) in test tubes, with FSH and T, at 2 different concentrations, for 28 days, without FCS supplementation. Organ culture was used to conserve germ cell and SC interactions as well as to contain a small portion of the interstitial compartment. As discussed in the above-mentioned study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112440746">24</xref>
</sup> the germ cell types and SC were identified based on the morphological criteria (all cells in a field were counted but not using measurements of cell diameters with the Cast software from Olympus used by the authors) and also the number of germ cells were counted per 1000 SC.</p>
<p>For analyzing cell proliferation and differentiation using BrdU, authors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112440746">24</xref>
</sup> performed the following experiments: (a) explants were incubated for 1 hour to study the germ cells in S-phase at the beginning of the culture (day 0); (b) explants were incubated for 5 hours and then further cultured for 1 week to study germ cell survival and differentiation; and (c) after 1 week of culture, explants were incubated for 5 hours and again cultured for 1 week. Only spermatogonia and pre-Lep were BrdU positive at the beginning of the culture. After 1 week, pre-Lep were differentiated into pachytene spermatocytes. Germ cells kept replicating and differentiating between 1 and 2 weeks of culture, which is compatible with the timing of human spermatogenesis in vivo (7-14 days). We used an incubation period of 18 hours, followed by culture of explants for 28 days. The same results were obtained.</p>
<p>In the present study, the presence of BrdU-labeled germ cells demonstrated that germ cells replicated and differentiated along the entire culture period of 28 days. On day 0, after 18 hours of initial exposure to BrdU, the large majority of positive germ cells were spermatogonia Ap (about 183 Ap/1000 SC) and SGB /Lep (about 177 Lep/1000 SC). As expected, the proliferation rate of spermatogonia Ad was low, but it improved significantly under a high hormone supplementation of FSH and T (500/10). These results are comparable to the analysis in Rhesus monkeys, in which only &lt;1% of Ad cells were positive.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112440746">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112440746">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The observed proliferation rates of total spermatogonia A and SGB-Lep were maximal during the first week of culture in the presence of hormones (from 96 total BrdU-positive SGA cells in controls to 189 positive cells per 1000 SC). After the first week, the observed decrease in cell proliferation followed the decrease in total SGA cell numbers in culture. Compared with the control group, total SGA proliferation at day 28 was still substantially higher in the 50/1 hormone treated group and for both hormone concentrations regarding total SGA and SGB/Lep proliferation, suggesting that the presence of hormones enabled germ cells to sustain proliferation for long periods of time.</p>
<p>The observed differentiation of Zyg/Pac occurred at the end of the first week. This process was accelerated in cells treated with media supplemented with hormones. In untreated cells, the maximum differentiation of Zyg/Pac occurred at the end of the second week of culture (about 151 Zyg-Pac BrdU-positive cells/1000 SC), whereas in treated cells the maximum differentiation occurred at day 7 (about 352 Zyg-Pac BrdU-positive cells/1000 SC), indicating an acceleration of the differentiation due to hormonal supplementation, especially with the 50/1 hormone concentration. These results are similar with the timing of human spermatogenesis in vivo, during which pre-Lep differentiated into pachytene within 7 to 14 days.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112440746">16</xref>
</sup> In relation to the control group, Zyg/Pac differentiation at day 28 was still substantially higher in the 50/1 hormone treated group, suggesting that the presence of hormones enabled germ cells to sustain differentiation for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Media supplemented with 50 IU/L FSH and 1 µmol/L T was more powerful for Ap, total SGA, and Zyg-Pac, whereas media supplemented with 500 U/L FSH and 10 µmol/L T appeared to be more effective for Ad and SGB-Lep.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present culture system allowed maintaining human ST in culture for a month without any significant loss of SC, maintaining the integrity of the ST and the interstitial compartment in the presence of all germ cell types (although with a decease in cell number). All germ cells were able to maintain proliferative (Ap, SGB/Lep) and differentiation (Zyg/Pac) capacities until the end of the culture (28 days), except Ad. This culture system also enabled to quantitate human spermatogenesis using a reproducible method that detects cellular proliferation, with differentiation times compatible with the timing of human spermatogenesis in vivo.<sup>
