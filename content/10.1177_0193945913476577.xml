<abstract>
<p>Over a decade of research on the relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes has demonstrated the important role of nurses in the provision of high-quality, safe care, yet currently, no evidence-based nurse staffing guidelines exist. A systematic review of reviews was conducted to explore reasons why this is the case and recommend directions for future research to improve upon this gap. Authors of the 29 included reviews reported variability in methods and measurement approaches, lack of incorporation of nurse processes and system factors that potentially affect relationships among variables, and overall inconsistencies in results across primary studies. We propose use of an Integrated Framework for a Systems Approach to Nurse Staffing Research to inform the development of applicable conceptual models. Future studies that use a systems approach and focus on establishing causal relationships among variables will potentially strengthen the evidence and advance the science in this area.</p>

<body>
<p>The association between nurse staffing and patient outcomes has been studied extensively over the past decade. Seminal studies in this area emphasized the importance of the work of nurses for ensuring high-quality, safe care in hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913476577">Aiken, Clarke, Sloane, Sochalski, &amp; Silber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0193945913476577">Needleman, Buerhaus, Mattke, Stewart, &amp; Zelevinsky, 2002</xref>). These studies were groundbreaking in that they provided evidence to support an association between nurse staffing and patient outcomes. However, the recommended number and combination of nurse resources for promoting high-quality patient outcomes on specific nursing units remains unclear.</p>
<p>One reason this is the case is due to methodological challenges of conducting research in this area. Findings across some of the seminal studies differ based on how nurse staffing is defined and measured. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0193945913476577">Needleman et al. (2002)</xref> found statistically significant associations between higher proportions of registered nurse (RN) hours and lower rates of six outcomes in medical patients and one outcome in surgical patients. However, when nurse staffing was measured as the number of RN hours per patient day (HPPD), findings were significant for only three of the outcomes in medical patients, and one outcome in surgical patients. In-hospital death was nonsignificant in both medical and surgical patients for both measures of nurse staffing.</p>
<p>The authors found similar inconsistencies in findings in a larger study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0193945913476577">Needleman, Buerhaus, Mattke, Stewart, &amp; Zelevinsky, 2001</xref>). The authors summarized that 14 outcomes were potentially sensitive to nurse staffing, which was measured in quartiles of RN HPPD and all nursing staff HPPD (RN, licensed practical nurse [LPN], nursing assistant [NA]). Five outcomes were supported by strong and/or consistent evidence that increasing RN staffing from the first to third quartiles resulted in 1% to 12% reductions in these outcomes in medical patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0193945913476577">Needleman et al., 2001</xref>). For surgical patients, only 1 outcome was supported by strong, consistent evidence that increasing RN staffing was associated with a 4% to 6% decrease in the outcome. Remaining outcomes for both medical and surgical patients had inconsistent, weak, or no evidence that increasing nurse staffing resulted in lower rates of these outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913476577">Aiken, Clarke, Sloane, Sochalski, et al. (2002)</xref> used nurse-to-patient ratios to measure nurse staffing and found that the odds of mortality and failure to rescue (FTR) increased significantly by 7% for every increase in the number of patients assigned to nurses.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0193945913476577">Mark, Harless, McCue, and Xu (2004)</xref> found that increased nurse staffing resulted in lower mortality but that the magnitude of the effect depended on current levels of staffing, indicating that there were diminishing returns on the outcome for each additional nurse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945913476577">Donaldson et al. (2005)</xref> found that the implementation of minimum nurse-to-patient ratio legislation in California resulted in increased nursing HPPD on the unit level of analysis, but did not significantly reduce incidence rates of falls and pressure ulcers, in part because adjustments for patient and organizational factors were not taken into consideration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0193945913476577">Spetz, Donaldson, Aydin, and Brown (2008)</xref> found differences in staffing levels and modes of measurement across four databases, especially when comparing unit-level data to hospital-level data. Other challenges Spetz et al. identified were low correlations between actual and estimated HPPD and between HPPD and ratios, the fact that data derived from payroll systems did not distinguish between direct and nondirect care or when nurses worked in a unit other than their “home” unit, and the fact that HPPD did not account for patient turnover and unit-level activity or work flow.</p>
<p>Thus, inconsistencies in findings exist across primary studies, in part because of variability in data sources and approaches to measuring nurse staffing and patient outcome variables. In an effort to standardize definitions and establish accessible databases for quality improvement and research purposes, a number of organizations have set forth recommendations for tracking quality indicators that have been deemed potentially sensitive to nurse staffing. These include the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945913476577">AHRQ, 2011</xref>), National Quality Forum (NQF) measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193945913476577">NQF, 2012</xref>), and the American Nurses’ Association National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193945913476577">NDNQI, 2003-2012</xref>). Although these are important initiatives, inconsistencies still exist, as only two indicators, hospital-acquired pressure ulcers and central line–associated blood stream infections, overlap all three organizations’ lists of indicators.</p>
<p>This overview of some of the primary studies conducted in this area highlights the inconsistencies of research findings and the resulting lack of consensus with regard to the best practices for defining, measuring, and accessing data that capture nurse staffing and patient outcome variables. Thus, translation of research findings into practice and the development of evidence-based policy recommendations for nurse staffing decisions on inpatient units have been challenging, despite having over a decade of research completed in this area.</p>
<p>A number of review articles have been written on the subject of nurse staffing and patient outcomes. Authors generally have focused on examining associations between nursing hours or ratios and rates of various patient outcomes, summarizing the strength of the evidence for these relationships, and proposing recommendations for future research. Rather than resummarize specific data on the associations between nurse staffing and patient outcomes, the purpose of this state of the science article is to summarize review authors’ findings and recommendations for future research, focusing particular attention on reasons for inconsistencies across primary studies and how these inconsistencies have contributed to the lack of establishment of evidence-based nurse staffing guidelines to date. The end goal is to identify specific directions for future research that will advance the science in this area and lead to the development of nurse staffing guidelines that promote high-quality, safe care.</p>
<sec id="section1-0193945913476577">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>Holzemer’s Model for Health Care Research, which is based on Donabedian’s structure, process, outcome theory, served as the guiding framework for this article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945913476577">Donabedian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945913476577">Holzemer &amp; Reilly, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945913476577">Holzemer and Reilly (1995)</xref> categorized structures, processes, and outcomes of care as being patient-, provider-, or system related. Theoretically, provider-related structures (e.g., number of nurses available) and processes (e.g., nurse surveillance) interact with patient- and system-related structures and processes, which in turn affect patient outcomes. Seminal work in this area measured nurse staffing as a structure of care (HPPD or ratios) and linked it directly to outcomes of care, generally without taking into consideration processes of care, in part because of challenges defining and measuring processes of care. We used Holzemer’s Model to guide the data extraction and synthesis processes for this article.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Methods were based on a recently published review of reviews and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945913476577">2008</xref>) report on undertaking systematic reviews (SRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0193945913476577">van Dulmen et al., 2007</xref>). Review articles tend to describe inconsistencies and recommendations for future research more comprehensively than primary studies because they compare and contrast findings across primary studies. By focusing on review articles as the unit of analysis for our review, we aim to summarize these comparisons, with the goal of making a new contribution with regard to future directions for nurse staffing research. A sequential series of steps were undertaken, including development of inclusion and exclusion criteria, a literature search, and data extraction procedures.</p>
<sec id="section3-0193945913476577">
<title>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>The authors adapted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0193945913476577">van Dulmen et al.’s (2007)</xref> inclusion/exclusion checklist to incorporate the following inclusion criteria: The setting was acute care hospitals, the subject of the review was nurse staffing, the research question addressed the effect of nurse staffing on patient outcomes, and the review method was either a SR or a review of the literature (ROL). SR articles needed to fulfill the following additional inclusion criteria: the literature search included the electronic databases and search terms used, as well as the search strategy and inclusion and exclusion criteria. No additional criteria were used for ROL articles, as long as they met the initial inclusion criteria of setting, subject matter, and research questions. Exclusion criteria were primary research articles, settings such as long-term care facilities or nursing homes, nurse variables that addressed only nurse education or expertise, and outcome variables that assessed only nurse-level or system-level outcomes, such as turnover, burnout, or cost.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0193945913476577">
<title>Literature Search</title>
<p>A literature search was conducted in the CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PubMed/MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Cochrane databases for the search term <italic>nurse staffing AND patient outcomes</italic>. The search was limited to review articles published in English within the past 20 years, to identify up-to-date reviews that most accurately reflect the modern health care environment. Although many differences exist with regard to nursing education, the work of nurses, and the cost of health care internationally, reviews conducted in countries outside the United States included many primary studies from the United States. Thus, reviews were not excluded solely for being conducted by authors outside the United States if they met other inclusion criteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0193945913476577">
<title>Data Extraction</title>
<p>The first author reviewed each article using the inclusion/exclusion checklist and categorized articles as being a SR or ROL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945913476577">CRD, 2008</xref>). The second author reviewed 10% of the articles’ abstracts and 100% interrater agreement was achieved. Data extraction processes included reverification of review eligibility, creation of tables of the characteristics of included reviews, whether a conceptual framework was used and a quality assessment was conducted, and summaries of the findings and recommendations for future research from each review.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-0193945913476577" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The search yielded 112 reviews. Eight SR and 21 ROL articles met inclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913476577">Table 1</xref>). Eighty-three articles were excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945913476577">Figure 1</xref>). Reasons for exclusion were that the article was not a SR or ROL, did not focus on nurse staffing or patient outcomes, or the setting was not acute care.</p>

<p>An important activity related to research design of review articles is the process of conducting quality assessments. Quality assessments of primary studies included in SRs and ROLs provide important information about the strength of the evidence reported and the level of confidence readers can have in drawing broad conclusions about the relationships among variables. Eight of the included review articles (seven SRs and one ROLs) included quality assessments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913476577">Table 1</xref>). Results are organized into a synthesis of review authors’ reasons for inconsistencies across primary studies and a summary of review authors’ recommendations for future research.</p>

<title>Synthesis of Review Authors’ Reasons for Inconsistencies Across Primary Studies</title>
<p>An overarching theme that emerged from the 29 reviews was the conclusion that statistically significant associations exist between nurse staffing and some patient outcomes, which indicates a trend toward improved patient outcomes with increased nurse staffing. An overview of findings presented in each review article is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945913476577">Table 2</xref>. However, because of inconsistencies of results across primary studies, review authors deemed the evidence on the topic inconclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913476577">Ayre, Gerdtz, Parker, &amp; Nelson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913476577">Blegen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913476577">Bray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945913476577">Flynn &amp; McKeown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945913476577">Garrett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945913476577">Heinz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945913476577">Hugonnet, Harbarth, Sax, Duncan, &amp; Pittet, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913476577">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193945913476577">Lankshear, Sheldon, &amp; Maynard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0193945913476577">Needleman, Kurtzman, &amp; Kizer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0193945913476577">Stone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0193945913476577">Thungjaroenkul, Cummings, &amp; Embleton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945913476577">Unruh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193945913476577">West, Mays, Rafferty, Rowan, &amp; Sanderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0193945913476577">Wilson, Bremner, Hauck, &amp; Finn, 2011</xref>).</p>

Several primary studies included across the 14 reviews found that higher nurse staffing was associated with lower rates of pressure ulcers. However, several studies found no association. In two primary studies, increases in nurse staffing were associated with an increase in pressure ulcer rates. Specifically, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913476577">Ayre et al.’s (2007)</xref> review, the authors reported that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945913476577">Blegen, Goode, and Reed (1998)</xref> found a curvilinear relationship between nurse staffing and outcomes, with the proportion of hours of care provided by RNs being inversely related to pressure ulcer rates to a threshold of 87.5% RNs. After the threshold, adverse events (such as pressure ulcers) increased with increased RN hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913476577">Ayre et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945913476577">Unruh’s (2008)</xref> review, the authors reported that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945913476577">Cho, Ketefian, Barkauskas, and Smith (2003)</xref> found an association between an increase in staffing and an increase in ulcers, which was attributed to increased detection or inadequate risk adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945913476577">Cho et al., 2003</xref>, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945913476577">Unruh, 2008</xref>). Finally, review authors reported several primary studies in which the findings were mixed depending on how nurse staffing was measured.</p>
<p>Review authors posited uncertainty with regard to whether inconsistencies in findings were due to methodological variability, insufficient data, questionable reliability of the data, or a true lack of statistically significant associations between nurse staffing and patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913476577">Blegen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913476577">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945913476577">Unruh, 2008</xref>). Review authors were also unable to deem the relationships among variables as causal, due to the dominant use of observational research designs in primary studies, which has also contributed to an inability to formulate specific nurse staffing guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945913476577">Hyun, Bakken, Douglas, &amp; Stone, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913476577">Kane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945913476577">Lang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193945913476577">Lankshear et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0193945913476577">Stone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945913476577">Unruh, 2008</xref>).

<p>Establishing the theoretical basis for relationships among variables at the outset of a study is essential for providing clarity regarding the study’s purpose, findings, and policy recommendations at the study’s end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0193945913476577">Polit &amp; Beck, 2004</xref>, Chapter 3). With regard to the 29 included review articles, only 4 presented a theoretical framework or discussed use of one for assessing the relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913476577">Kane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913476577">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0193945913476577">Needleman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945913476577">Unruh, 2008</xref>). Authors of 4 additional included reviews discussed the theoretical link between nurse staffing and patient outcomes in the text but did not present a framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945913476577">Dimick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945913476577">Hugonnet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0193945913476577">Thungjaroenkul et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0193945913476577">Twigg et al., 2010</xref>). The remaining 21 reviews did not use a theoretical framework or discuss the theoretical link between nurse staffing and patient outcomes. Although use of a theoretical framework for a review article may be limiting for some areas of inquiry, the use of one for studying the relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes is invaluable for understanding the theoretical link among variables and subsequent selection of articles to include, based on the variables of interest.</p>
<p>With regard to primary studies, review authors described a lack of explicit discussion of the theoretical basis for the relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes in primary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913476577">Bray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913476577">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193945913476577">West et al., 2007</xref>). This omission may have contributed to differences in variable selection and methods chosen across primary studies and subsequent inconsistency of and difficulty in interpretation of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913476577">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>). In addition, review authors identified a lack of recognition of and inclusion of other factors in primary studies, especially system factors, that potentially affected the relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913476577">Ayre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913476577">Blegen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913476577">Bray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945913476577">Carayon &amp; Gurses, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945913476577">Cheung, Aiken, Clarke, &amp; Sloane, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945913476577">Curtin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945913476577">Dimick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945913476577">Flynn &amp; McKeown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945913476577">Garrett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945913476577">Heinz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945913476577">Hugonnet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945913476577">Hyun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913476577">Kane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913476577">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945913476577">Lang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0193945913476577">Mamaril, Sullivan, Clifford, Newhouse, &amp; Windle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0193945913476577">Needleman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0193945913476577">Penoyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0193945913476577">Stone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0193945913476577">Twigg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945913476577">Unruh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0193945913476577">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>The genesis of the IFSANSR came from the use of Holzemer’s Model for Health Care Research for the data extraction process for this article. The IFSANSR is an expansion of Holzemer’s Model and includes specific variables to consider (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0193945913476577">Table 3</xref>), which Holzemer’s Model does not provide. The IFSANSR aims to make explicit the various factors that are thought to mediate and moderate the relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes. Because one study cannot assess all of these variables, the intended use of the framework is to inform the creation of study models to answer specific research questions that aim to uncover the effects of nurse staffing on patient outcomes, while also taking into consideration unit- and hospital-level structures and processes.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Synthesis of findings across the 29 reviews resulted in three main methods-related factors that contributed to inconsistencies and/or inconclusiveness of results: (a) research design and measurement of study variables, (b) statistical challenges, and (c) the importance of distinguishing between statistical and clinical significance.</p>
<sec id="section10-0193945913476577">
<title>Research design and measurement</title>
<p>With regard to research design and measurement, main themes included use of observational study designs and administrative databases, level of analysis for measurement, and other measurement challenges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0193945913476577">
<title>Use of observational study designs and administrative databases</title>
<p>Among the research designs available to investigators, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and SRs of RCTs are considered to be the highest level of rigor in the hierarchy of evidence to support causal relationships among variables studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945913476577">Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine [CEBM], 2009</xref>). The effect of nurse staffing on patient outcomes is a topic area that has not historically lent itself to RCT methods because nurses and patients cannot be randomly assigned to units or hospitals. Although quasi-experimental, longitudinal, and prospective cohort designs rank as the next highest levels of evidence after RCTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945913476577">CEBM, 2009</xref>), a lack of their use is a limitation of primary studies conducted in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945913476577">Donaldson &amp; Shapiro, 2010</xref>). Observational and cross-sectional designs were much more commonly used in primary studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913476577">Table 1</xref>). Observational and cross-sectional designs dominated the literature in this area mainly as a function of the trade-offs among availability and reliability of data, internal and external validity, and costs, in relation to both time and money. Primary studies in this area had a tendency to favor the trade-off toward using large, administrative databases, likely because these data were readily available, with potentially high external validity due to large sample sizes, and were low cost in both time and money to obtain.</p>
<p>Findings from reviews demonstrated the consequences and disadvantages of using large databases, such as potentially lower reliability of data and measurement challenges. Administrative databases were error-prone secondary to inconsistent use of diagnosis codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913476577">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>) and minimal adjustment for confounding variables and were subject to underreporting of adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945913476577">Hugonnet et al., 2004</xref>), thus reducing the reliability of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0193945913476577">Penoyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0193945913476577">Thungjaroenkul et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945913476577">Unruh, 2008</xref>). One main measurement challenge pertaining to the use of large databases was that researchers generally did not have flexibility to choose how variables were measured, which led to inconsistencies in how variables were defined and measured across primary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913476577">Ayre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945913476577">Hyun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0193945913476577">Penoyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0193945913476577">Stone et al., 2003</xref>). For example, although nurse staffing was typically measured in one of three ways—as a nurse-to-patient ratio, the number of hours of nursing care provided during a defined time period, or a proportion of staff that consisted of RNs (skill mix)—our data extraction procedures yielded 82 different measurements of nurse staffing within these broad categories. Examples of variations within these categories included ratios by shift (day, evening, night; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193945913476577">West et al., 2007</xref>), total nursing staff HPPD (RN, LPN, and NA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945913476577">Clarke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945913476577">Hyun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913476577">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193945913476577">Lankshear et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945913476577">Unruh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0193945913476577">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>), and the proportion of licensed staff to total nursing staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913476577">Blegen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945913476577">Garrett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945913476577">Hugonnet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913476577">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193945913476577">Lankshear et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0193945913476577">Needleman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945913476577">Unruh, 2008</xref>). Similarly, the 29 reviews assessed 74 different patient outcomes, with variation in how the same outcome was defined and measured. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0193945913476577">Thungjaroenkul et al. (2007)</xref> cited five different ways in which length of stay was measured in the 11 primary studies that were included in their review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0193945913476577">
<title>Level of analysis for measurement</title>
<p>A second measurement challenge was related to level of analysis. Some administrative databases only provided data aggregated to the hospital level of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913476577">Ayre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945913476577">Donaldson &amp; Shapiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0193945913476577">Twigg et al., 2010</xref>). Hospital-level data omitted unit-level context, such as variation in patient severity of illness, nursing education and expertise, the type of care provided on the unit (e.g., oncology, cardiac, orthopedic), and scheduling patterns, which limited researchers’ abilities to identify the amount of nursing care that could be attributed to specific patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913476577">Blegen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913476577">Kane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945913476577">Lang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193945913476577">Lankshear et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193945913476577">West et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, although administrative databases theoretically provided large sample sizes and high levels of external validity, results from hospital-level data were difficult to translate to specific units, thereby resulting in low external validity at the unit level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913476577">Blegen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913476577">Bray et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Review authors reported that similar trade-offs and weaknesses existed for primary studies conducted on the unit level of analysis. Although unit-level primary studies more readily demonstrated the effect of nurse staffing on patient outcomes compared with those on the hospital level, generalizability was limited because these studies were conducted on a small number of units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913476577">Blegen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0193945913476577">Twigg et al., 2010</xref>). These primary studies tended to have smaller sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945913476577">Hugonnet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0193945913476577">Twigg et al., 2010</xref>) and weaker external validity because setting-specific differences made the results less generalizable, especially if data came from a single unit or hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945913476577">Heinz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0193945913476577">Twigg et al., 2010</xref>). Other weaknesses were violation of independence, design flaws such as lack of adjustment for clustering of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945913476577">Hugonnet et al., 2004</xref>), and dependence on less sophisticated statistical techniques such as correlations versus the ability to use more robust statistical analyses such as regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193945913476577">West et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the fact that there was more choice for researchers with regard to how to measure and collect data, some authors of unit-level studies used uniquely defined variables in lieu of standardized definitions, which led to inconsistencies in results across primary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945913476577">Hyun et al., 2008</xref>). Review authors reported that unit-level data were also expensive and labor-intensive to collect, especially when patients were moved from unit to unit during their hospital stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913476577">Ayre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0193945913476577">Needleman et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193945913476577">West et al.’s (2007)</xref> review, the authors reported that of 10 primary studies, the 3 that found statistically significant relationships between nurse staffing and mortality were smaller, unit-based studies that collected data prospectively, whereas the primary studies that found nonsignificant results were large, multisite studies. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913476577">Lake and Cheung’s (2006)</xref> review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193945913476577">Krauss et al.’s (2005)</xref> case-control study of nurse and patient dyads is highlighted as an excellent example of the clarity that unit-based studies can provide. The authors demonstrated that the likelihood of a patient falling was 3 times higher for patients whose nurse was caring for 4 to 6 patients and was 7 times higher for patients whose nurse was caring for 7 or more patients, compared with patients whose nurse was caring for 3 or fewer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193945913476577">Krauss et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Other measurement challenges</title>
<p>Other measurement challenges, for both the hospital and unit levels of analysis, included timing of data collection and adjustment of variables. Some primary studies collected data on patient outcomes at different time points than nurse staffing information, which made it difficult to interpret the impact of staffing changes on patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913476577">Blegen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193945913476577">West et al., 2007</xref>). Adjustments for nurse staffing varied from obtaining all nursing hours or full-time equivalents and adjusting between inpatient and outpatient settings, to adjusting for inpatient days only, to adjusting for patient acuity or need for care, with some primary studies separating direct and nondirect care hours and worked versus paid hours and some not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913476577">Ayre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913476577">Blegen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913476577">Kane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193945913476577">Lankshear et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193945913476577">West et al. (2007)</xref> also noted that some primary studies lacked adjustment for potential confounding variables, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0193945913476577">Stone et al. (2003)</xref> noted differences in approaches to risk adjustment as a contributor to inconsistencies across primary study results.</p>
<p>Review authors reported that researchers have found conflicting results for the same patient outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913476577">Blegen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913476577">Bray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0193945913476577">Penoyer, 2010</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0193945913476577">Needleman et al.’s (2007)</xref> review, the authors concluded that measuring nurse staffing using RN hours as a proportion of all nursing staff hours resulted in stronger associations with more outcomes than using RN HPPD. Wide variation in research designs and definitions and measurements of variables has reduced the ability to assure consistency in measurement and work toward the establishment of standardized measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913476577">Kane et al., 2007</xref>) and has created concern about the effect of data source variation on measurement precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945913476577">Donaldson &amp; Shapiro, 2010</xref>). In summary, review authors found that decisions about research design and measurement approach have contributed to differences in results in some cases and have made comparing results across primary studies and drawing conclusions about the relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes challenging.</p>

<sec id="section14-0193945913476577">
<title>Statistical challenges and significance</title>
<p>One of the statistical assumptions that must be met prior to use of regression analysis is that the variables vary in a linear fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945913476577">Field, 2005</xref>). Some primary studies provided detailed explanations for adjustments for nonlinear data, such as in Needleman’s primary study in which the authors described the use of interaction terms that allowed for assessment of nonlinear relationships between patient outcome events and various categories of nurse staffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0193945913476577">Needleman et al., 2001</xref>). In their review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913476577">Kane et al. (2007)</xref> tested a number of hypotheses that included assumptions of nonlinear relationships among variables. They found that mortality decreased with improved nurse staffing, but in a nonlinear fashion. They also described that the observed reduction in mortality was much lower than the expected reduction in mortality, depending on the goodness of fit of the model for various distributions of nurse ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913476577">Kane et al., 2007</xref>). The authors also found nonlinear associations between nurse staffing and unplanned extubation and medical complications in intensive care units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913476577">Kane et al., 2007</xref>). However, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945913476577">Lang et al.’s (2004)</xref> review, the authors noted that many primary studies used linear regression without assurance that relationships were linear or without commenting on adjustments that had been made for nonlinearity. Other noted weaknesses included lack of descriptions of adjustments made for statistical comparisons; lack of adjustments for severity of outcomes, such as discriminating among stage of pressure ulcer or degree of injury after a fall; and lack of reporting of baseline rates of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945913476577">Lang et al., 2004</xref>). For example, if adverse event rates are already low, increases in nurse staffing may not demonstrate an effect, whereas high rates of specific events may be largely affected by improvements in nurse staffing levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945913476577">Lang et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Another theme discussed across reviews was distinguishing between statistical and clinical significance. Results of primary studies often did not report clinical significance or effect size, the amount of change in patient outcomes that occurred as a result of changes in nurse staffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945913476577">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945913476577">Lang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945913476577">Unruh, 2008</xref>). In addition, discussions of effect size were vague at times. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945913476577">Lang et al.’s (2004)</xref> review, the authors noted that a 10% difference in staffing level paired with a “substantial change” in a patient outcome was deemed clinically significant, but the authors did not define what “substantial change” meant (p. 327).</p>

<title>Review Authors’ Recommendations for Future Research</title>
<p>Review authors had a number of recommendations for future research in this area, which are summarized according to the following categories: research design, data collection, variable selection, standardization, statistical and clinical significance, and theory/inclusion of system factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0193945913476577">Table 4</xref>). For example, use of research designs that provide researchers with more confidence that relationships among variables are causal would be useful in this area. Focusing data collection on linking study data to those which are already collected for operations purposes and establishing standardized databases may be of benefit. Questioning the value of current nurse staffing measures in terms of their ability to capture the work of nurses and having an open dialogue about how to define, measure, and validate instruments that capture nursing work in future studies would be of value. Focusing on the clinical significance of this work and how findings can be applied directly to clinical practice would be beneficial. Last, using a systems approach to conceptualization and operationalization of study variables and selection of research designs may allow for higher likelihood of direct application of findings to clinical settings in future work.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The body of work in this area largely consists of outcomes research that established associations among variables primarily through observational and cross-sectional designs, using administrative databases that generally measured nurse staffing in hospital-level hours of care or ratios and patient outcomes in the form of hospital-level event rates. Favoring the use of already-existing databases with strong external validity and lower costs over data reliability and internal validity, in conjunction with a lack of theoretical foundation for the relationships among variables, led to significant variation in how variables were defined and measured in this body of work. This has ultimately led to inconsistencies in results across primary studies and has limited the ability to make comparisons across primary studies and draw conclusions about the number and mix of nurses that maximize patient outcomes. Research designs that study only hospital-level data lose the richness of unit-level context. In particular, this body of work contains a paucity of variables that specifically describe the role of the nurse and the processes of care that influence improvements in patient outcomes, thereby contributing to inconclusive results. Inconsistencies across primary studies and inconclusive results inhibit translation of findings into clinically meaningful recommendations, which has caused efforts to establish evidence-based staffing guidelines to stall in recent years. Results based on associative relationships are difficult to extrapolate into specific nurse staffing policy recommendations because it is unclear whether adding more nurses, not to mention the ideal number and type of nurses to add, rather than improving staffing along with a combination of other variables, will result in better patient outcomes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913476577">Kane et al.’s (2007)</xref> SR, which includes a meta-analysis, is the strongest review methodologically not only because of the meta-analysis procedures but also because it is the most comprehensive, including more primary studies and dissertations than any other review article. Although Kane’s findings demonstrate an association between nurse staffing and some patient outcomes, the authors make the case that staffing levels cannot be recommended from these data, in part because of inconsistencies in findings and because the observational research designs used in primary studies limit the ability of researchers to interpret relationships among variables as causal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945913476577">Table 2</xref>). Conducting meta-analyses in the future, after new work has been conducted using nonobservational research designs, will likely be of benefit. However, conducting additional meta-analyses using data from currently published observational studies will likely contribute very little new information and thus may be less beneficial than focusing efforts on other ways to strengthen the state of the science in this area.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of reviews, directions for future research should focus on using a systems approach to the problem and research designs that provide a higher likelihood of establishing causal relationships among variables, rather than continuing to use observational and cross-sectional research designs. Study design examples include testing interventions focused on redesigning nursing work flow or testing the effect of patient acuity-based nurse assignment decisions on outcomes. Other examples, for situations in which testing interventions is not possible, include well-designed longitudinal or retrospective case-control studies that adjust for patient-, nurse-, and organization-level factors. In addition, use of more advanced statistical techniques such as hierarchical linear modeling and structural equation modeling may assist with investigating complex relationships at patient, nurse, unit, and hospital levels of analysis.</p>
<p>A systems approach takes into consideration that relationships among variables are complex and often nonlinear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945913476577">Anderson, Issel, &amp; McDaniel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945913476577">Clancy, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945913476577">2009b</xref>). Future work should be based on a strong theoretical foundation that includes system factors and pays particular attention to identifying organizational characteristics, processes of care, and unit-level contextual factors that elucidate the contribution nurses make in promoting patient recovery, as well as new ways of conceptualizing and measuring nursing processes of care (coordination, surveillance, critical thinking, and decision making) and nurse staffing models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913476577">Aiken, Clarke, Sloane, Lake, &amp; Cheney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945913476577">Ball &amp; McElligot, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945913476577">Bolton, Donaldson, Rutledge, Bennett, &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0193945913476577">Sidani, Doran, &amp; Mitchell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0193945913476577">Tschannen &amp; Kalisch, 2009</xref>). In addition, nursing care needs tend to vary among patients in the same unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0193945913476577">Upenieks, Kotlerman, Akhavan, Esser, &amp; Ngo, 2007</xref>). There is a need to develop a measure of patient acuity that captures variation in nursing care needs, to match nurse staffing with acuity and strengthen the science in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193945913476577">Mark &amp; Harless, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0193945913476577">Needleman et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945913476577">Carayon and Gurses (2005)</xref> have described the merits of conceptualizing workload on the “situation” level, which incorporates information such as the level of workload related to admissions, discharges, and transfers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0193945913476577">Table 3</xref>). Although challenging to define and measure, development of nurse staffing variables that capture more of “what nurses do” will assist researchers in determining how nurses contribute to the enhancement of patient safety and improvement of patient outcomes. A major theme in review articles was that authors of primary studies were inconsistent in their inclusion of theoretical models, organizational factors, and process measures in studies in this area. Use of the IFSANSR may be helpful for identifying theoretical underpinnings, developing conceptual models, and selecting research designs and approaches to measurement of study variables in future research in this area. The goal of the IFSANSR is to assist researchers with moving the science forward by clearly acknowledging and including nurse-level processes of care, as well as unit- and system-level structures and processes of care, in future research in this area.</p>
<p>A limitation of this state of the science article is not conducting formal quality assessments of included reviews. Because included reviews varied widely in their level of specificity of research designs and other characteristics of primary studies, identifying consistent, clear criteria for assessing the quality of reviews was challenging. Because our article aimed to synthesize the reasons for inconsistencies across studies and summarize recommendations for future research, rather than to conduct a meta-analysis, we do not think that the lack of quality assessments strongly affects the overall findings and contributions of our article. In addition, a potential limitation of this work is the use of review articles, rather than primary studies, as the basis for review. However, reviewing all the primary research in this area would focus mainly on reporting associations between nurse staffing and patient outcomes, which has been done in numerous review articles. By focusing on synthesizing review authors’ findings related to reasons for inconsistencies in results across primary studies and recommendations for future research, we hope to make a new contribution to the literature.</p>
<p>To advance the science in this area, we recommend that researchers focus on conducting theoretically sound studies that favor strong internal validity and the ability to establish causal relationships among a variety of unit- and hospital-level structures and processes of care and patient outcomes. Over time, expansion to multisite studies will allow for a stronger focus on external validity. The end goal is to identify the variables and conditions that result in clinically and statistically significant improvements in patient outcomes and the ability to translate findings into realistic, practical, clear policy recommendations for nurse staffing decisions in a variety of inpatient settings.</p>
