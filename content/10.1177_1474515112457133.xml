<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the last few decades, the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has become an established form of treatment for ventricular arrhythmia. It has resulted in a significant reduction in mortality compared to anti-arrhythmic drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112457133">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112457133">2</xref></sup> Since the first implantation, 600 ICDs per million population are implanted annually in the USA. In Europe, 189 ICDs per million population are implanted, indicating 150,000 new ICD recipients every year worldwide. The indication for receiving an ICD has been expanded from secondary indication due to cardiac arrest, to include prophylactic ICD implantation for patients who have not had, but are at risk for, ventricular arrhythmias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112457133">1</xref></sup> However, the structure and organisation of the medical services are still affected by handling patients with secondary prevention indications. Organisational changes are needed in order to fully implement guideline recommendations and meet the demands of this heterogeneous patient group. Those are the results of the expanded indication. It has been suggested that there is a need for structured collaboration between device specialists and specialists in heart failure and ischemic heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112457133">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112457133">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previously, follow-up mainly focused on the technology of the ICD device. Physicians had to be competent in implantation technique, ICD programming and in dealing with complications. However, guidelines for a structured follow-up programme were lacking. Today, technical knowledge and skills remain important as the ICD is even more technically advanced than previously, but the need for more holistic patient care has also been highlighted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112457133">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112457133"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112457133">5</xref></sup> Having a device implanted in your body can be experienced as a major life event that may lead to anxiety, depression and impaired quality of life. Individual support in combination with a high level of technological knowledge helps the patients to adjust to their new life situation. It is important that patients are given objective, individualised and correct counselling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112457133">4</xref></sup> National and international guidelines recommend that public health authorities allocate resources and initiate a structured national support and follow-up programme in order to ensure that patients receive equal care. In addition, treatment should be provided in accordance with a framework that takes into account economic factors and priorities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112457133">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112457133">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112457133">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>As patients are only hospitalised for a few days in connection with the implantation, healthcare professionals play an important role in assisting them before, during and after the surgery. This includes education, counselling and technical follow-up of the device. Counselling has mostly focused on ICD technology, with little attention given to the patient’s life situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112457133">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112457133">7</xref></sup> The ICD team can help patients understand their feelings and reactions, motivate them and provide them with tools to handle changes in their lifesituation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112457133">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112457133"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112457133">10</xref></sup> Little is known about the perspective of the healthcare professionals involved in the care of these patients. This is an important area to explore and add to existing patient perspective studies in order to improve the management and organisation of future ICD patients.</p>
<p>The aim was to describe the experiences of Swedish healthcare professionals in delivering care to patients with an ICD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1474515112457133" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A qualitative, descriptive design based on a phenomenographic approach was used. Phenomenography aims to identify the essential variation in understanding or experiencing a given phenomenon, the variety of conceptions and how they are presented in a well-defined sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112457133">11</xref></sup> It differentiates between the first-order perspective, i.e. what something is, and the second-order perspective, i.e. how the informants experience it.</p>
<sec id="section8-1474515112457133">
<title>Ethical considerations and procedure</title>
<p>Permission for the study was granted by the Heads of the Cardiology Departments at each hospital. Participants were recruited among ICD physicians and nurses at each of the 16 implanting hospitals in Sweden. Prior to the interview, they received written and verbal information about the aim of the study. They were also assured that their answers would be treated confidentially and that they could withdraw from the study at any time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1474515112457133">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The study was carried out between October and December 2007 at all 16 Swedish university and county hospitals with an established ICD clinic. Twenty-four participants (12 specialist ICD nurses and 12 physicians), aged 38–57 years, were strategically recruited among the ICD teams at each hospital. The inclusion criterion was having experience of clinical care of ICD patients. The participants had worked with ICD patients for 2 to 20 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474515112457133">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The first author contacted the healthcare professionals by telephone, asking if they wished to take part in the study. If they accepted, an appointment was arranged for a semi-structured and open-ended interview, conducted by the first author. An interview guide was designed, comprising preliminary questions aimed at identifying variations in clinical aspects of delivering care. Each participant was asked the following introductory question: “Can you please tell me about your experiences of providing clinical care to patients with an ICD?” The interviewer asked probing questions in order to deepen, develop, clarify and explore their responses. There was an informal conversation before the start of the audio-taped interview, which lasted 25–60 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1474515112457133">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The interviews were transcribed verbatim and resulted in a total of 273 double-spaced pages of data. The analysis was performed by the first author in collaboration with the other authors. The analysis process was carried out in seven steps, according to Dahlgren and Fallsberg’s recommendations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112457133">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112457133">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The experiences of healthcare professionals in follow-up of patients were divided into two qualitatively different descriptive categories: ‘Striving to provide competent care’ and ‘Striving to infuse confirmation’, comprising seven subcategories.</p>
<sec id="section13-1474515112457133">
<title>Striving to provide competent care</title>
<p>The healthcare professionals described how they attempted to provide quality care, by giving the patients access to clinical care based on their specific needs and life situation. The professionals preferred individualised care and wished to increase their competence through enhanced technical and psychosocial knowledge and skills.</p>
<sec id="section14-1474515112457133">
<title>Providing access to care</title>
<p>The healthcare professionals provided access to care and described the importance of being available for each patient. The conceptions ranged from the importance of prioritising time to having the courage and strategy to discuss problems and giving patients access to the healthcare professional. Thus, they would be able to reflect and ask questions about the device, find time to cope with unexpected situations related to the ICD, as well as devote extra time to extensive medical and psychosocial needs by additional visits or telephone follow-up. They also had to ensure access to standard care as laid down by the hospitals and recommended in guidelines, which was considered adequate for most patients. As one nurse stated: “…most of all accessibility, I’ve seen it in those patients who have really bonded with us due to having a difficult situation, we can be their ambassadors providing care guidance, sometimes, we tell them, come immediately and in other situations they don’t need to come at all because we know them and have regular telephone contact with them.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1474515112457133">
<title>Improving one’s qualifications</title>
<p>The healthcare professionals wished to improve their qualifications and competence in caring for ICD patients. The conceptions varied, including the importance of increased knowledge and skills in the technical as well as the psychosocial area. This wouldbe required in order to improve care, routines, outpatientfollow-up and telephone consultations. It would also be needed in order to implement evidence-based care in, for example, guidelines and interactive educational material, such as CD-based programmes or websites. As one physician described, “improved routines in order not to omit things related to technical aspects, the importance of continuing with medication in addition to a clear care program, an available care team and a whole range of resources that can easily be accessed when the patient finds him/herself in difficult situations”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1474515112457133">
<title>Individualising care</title>
<p>The healthcare professionals described how they provided individualised care tailored to each patient. They emphasised that individualisation should be based on communication with the patient, allowing them to state their preferences, but also on assessment of cognitive functions and self-care abilities. Modern technology with remote device follow-up has provided new options for checking the ICD when patients experience arrhythmia symptoms or feel unwell. This was mentioned as being suitable for some patients. As one nurse stated, “We see the patients regularly, so we usually note any changes, now he is not feeling well, now he perhaps needs more information about something and then you usually respond to it…Today I feel that we are more like consultants. They search the Internet a great deal, are well informed and inquisitive.”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1474515112457133">
<title>Striving to infuse confirmation</title>
<p>The healthcare professionals described how they tried to infuse the patients with confirmation. They promoted independence by giving the patients tools to handle their lifesituation. They also provided existential support through sensitive communication and by giving them the opportunity to meet other ICD team members, such as a psychologist or a social worker. They mediated security by being there for the patient and responded to the needs of next of kin.</p>
<sec id="section18-1474515112457133">
<title>Promoting independence</title>
<p>The healthcare professionals described how they promoted independence. Their statements included conceptions about information, support and education in order to promote necessary adaptations in the patient’s life situation. They also mentioned creating new opportunities while at the same time taking into account the patient’s level of functioning. As one physician described: “It’s when the patients come home, how should I behave or do I dare to go out, use the microwave, can I go swimming, do I dare to go abroad and what about X-rays and metal detectors?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1474515112457133">
<title>Providing existential support</title>
<p>The ICD team described the importance of enhancing their own skills and experience of providing existential support in order to be able to identify and meet the patient’s existential needs. As one nurse stated, “…; being able to ‘read’ the patients. A majority of them naturally experience anxiety and have a lot of questions, but many put up a wall and distance themselves and it’s a matter of finding and being able to ask the right questions”. Regular support meetings allowed patients to meet other ICD recipients in the same situation and come into contact with specialists, such as psychologists and social workers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1474515112457133">
<title>Mediating security</title>
<p>The healthcare professionals described the importance of mediating security, including technical skills and structured counselling in accordance with guidelines. Being there for the patients, providing support and confidence and answering all their questions was also regarded as important. As one nurse described: “They need to be seen as human beings and it’s important, especially for these kinds of patients, who can be quite severely traumatised, that they have some place to turn to. I think that the fact that we answer the telephone is much more important than what we say on the phone.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1474515112457133">
<title>Comprising needs of next of kin</title>
<p>The healthcare professionals described how they tried to respond to the needs of next of kin. This included giving them the same counselling as the patients and dissuading them from being overprotective. Instead, they were encouraged to allow their family member to take responsibility and not take advantage of being an ICD recipient As one physician described: “I think it’s a great advantage to meet with them both at the same time … then it becomes obvious to them what the instructions are, that the patient has to take responsibility for his/her disease and say when he has had enough or is too tired to go on, or when he has more strength and things like that, that it’s not somebody else who tells them, and it is also useful from a an educational point of view to talk to them both because then I can at the same time encourage the patient to make an extra effort and really take responsibility for his condition.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section23-1474515112457133">
<title>Discussion of findings</title>
<p>Little attention has been paid to how the delivery of ICD care is experienced by the healthcare professionals themselves. This is an important aspect because it reveals the foundation on which ICD care is organised and the rationale for different care components.</p>
<p>It was found that the healthcare professionals wished to develop the care further and that, although variations were described, both nurses and physicians were consistent in their conceptions. This coherence in experiences is probably a result of the close ICD team collaboration that exists in almost all Swedish hospitals today.</p>
<p>Professionals wanted to individualise care, based on the patient’s individual need for support, participation in rehabilitation programmes and follow-up after a myocardial infarction and heart failure. This has become increasingly important as the indications for ICD implantation have expanded and the ICD population has become more diverse. Consequently, there may be a wide range of needs and preferences. The age and gender of patients vary so it is important to provide support according to their life situation, co-morbidity and capacity. This need for individualised care has previously been highlighted by Serber et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112457133">13</xref></sup> who found that women preferred receiving support from other ICD patients, specialised ICD nurses and professional counsellors to a significantly higher extent than did men. Furthermore, a greater proportion of younger ICD patients reported a preference for web-based education compared to older patients. Patients wished to participate in a support group with people of similar age and medical background.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112457133">4</xref></sup> It was found that ICD patients received limited psychosocial support before implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112457133">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>One method of increasing access to care is remote follow-up. The ICD can be checked from a distance if the patient experiences symptoms or if the system automatically detects a malfunction in the device. It is thereby possible to give recommendations and further follow-up instructions over the telephone after the ICD has been checked, instead of the patient having to go to the clinic. An organisational strategy based on strict interaction between a specialised ICD nurse and a responsible physician has been found to require little time and be cost-effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112457133">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The healthcare professionals expressed a wish to improve their knowledge and skills, both within the technical and the psychosocial area. They wanted to use these skills as a supportive resource for each patient. Information about ICD technology and safety is available both in writing and verbally. However, it has been found that patient education material is usually not individualised and does not cover lifestyle adjustments at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112457133">16</xref></sup> Healthcareprofessionals are generally most comfortable providing education about the device and its function and the least comfortable dealing with patients’ emotional well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112457133">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112457133">18</xref></sup> However, this was not found in the present study. Instead, the healthcare professionals described how they tried to support the patients in dealing with their new life situation by, for example, providing education, security and existential support as well as encouraging them to be independent. The nurses and the physicians also emphasised how they strove to read both declared and non-declared messages. They tried to be responsive and ask the right probing questions to help the patients with their entire life situation. Today, there is a great deal of knowledge, not only about the technical aspects of the ICD and the patients’ physical reactions to it,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112457133">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112457133">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112457133">20</xref></sup> but also on how having a device implanted in the body can be experienced as a major life event that may lead to anxiety, depression and impaired quality of life.</p>
<p>A patient’s life situation can be affected, for instance work, family life and social activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112457133">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112457133"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112457133">23</xref></sup> The unpredictability of life-threatening arrhythmias and a feeling of being dependent on the device can lead to poor psychosocial adjustment to the changed life situation after cardiac arrest, resulting in worries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112457133">24</xref></sup> and anxiety about receiving shocks from the device.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112457133">19</xref></sup> All this existing knowledge needs to be individualised, transferred and incorporated in the clinical care at each ICD clinic. Several studies have shown that patients ask for more information about the device and explanations as to why they need an ICD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112457133">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112457133">20</xref></sup> This was also considered important from the healthcare professionals’ point of view in the present study. Individual support in combination with a high level of technological knowledge makes it easier for patients to deal with their new life situation. Studies have revealed that patients need management skills and social support in order to cope with the ICD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112457133">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112457133"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112457133">27</xref></sup> The nurses and physicians promote independence and help the patients adjust to their life situation through information, support and education. There are several studies on various intervention programmes. One intervention study described patients who were divided into two groups. Both received normal care, but one of the groups also received care according to an ICD plan prior to and during a 12-week intervention. Results showed that the intervention group, who had access to a specialist nurse and a psychologist, experienced better physical health, fewer limitations in physical activity and less anxiety and depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112457133">27</xref></sup> A self-management programme for ICD patients led by a specialised ICD nurse and a patient with cardiovascular disease has been found to decrease anxiety. It also improves general self-efficacy expectancies as well as physical and social functioning and role limitations caused by physical problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112457133">28</xref></sup> Although Dougherty et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474515112457133">29</xref></sup> found that a hospital-based education programme initiated the recovery process, it must be supplemented by other follow-up interventions in order to provide full physical and psychological adjustment. In addition, Dougherty et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474515112457133">30</xref></sup> have published findings focusing on patients’ understanding of the disease, the ICD implantation, the functioning and effectof the device, necessary changes and restrictions in their life situation, all of which can be used in intervention programmes.</p>
<p>Being a relative of an ICD patient can lead to much concern about the future. In the present study, the healthcare professionals gave the same information to next of kin as the patient. Next of kin were asked not to be overprotective, whereas the patients were requested not take advantage of being an ICD patient. The need to include the family in follow-up programmes was also emphasised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474515112457133">31</xref></sup> The healthcare professionals experienced that ‘being there’ for the patient was important. They also pointed out the urgent need for organisational guidelines in order to ensure equal and high-quality clinical care. Nurses working in general wards have been found to be less informed regarding the ICD population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474515112457133">31</xref></sup> Therefore, it is important to spread the knowledge about the needs of this patient population to all staff who might come into contact with them, for instance paramedics and municipality staff, so that the patient is received in a good and adequate manner. Hopefully, the ICD team can contribute to spreading knowledge on the handling of the device, for instance before surgery and at the end of life.</p>
<p>Despite the considerable amount of money spent on ICD implantation, relatively little attention has been paid to evaluating how the guidelines are implemented and followed up in routine clinical practice. It is particularly difficult to evaluate organisational issues, location, structure, personnel, treatment, etc., as they all play a part. However, it is difficult to discern the impact of each one. Therefore, in order to guide both healthcare professionals and policy makers, carefully designed randomised trials are needed to identify the specific organisational aspects that are the most beneficial to ICD patients.</p>

<title>Rigour of the study</title>
<p>Fridlund and Hildingh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1474515112457133">32</xref></sup> have described the necessity of ensuring applicability, security, concordance and accuracy of the concept. To ensure applicability, phenomenography was deemed to be the most appropriate method, as the aim of the study was to identify variations in human conceptions. Healthcare professionals from all the Swedish university and county hospitals providing ICD care were involved in this study, which increases the applicability of the findings. Security was achieved by asking all the participants the same introductory question. In the interviews, the healthcare professionals gave rich descriptions of their experiences in delivering care to ICD patients. Security was also achieved as the interviewer did not know the healthcare professionals and was not involved in the ICD care at any of the hospitals. The findings consisted of analyses by all the researchers and concordance was reached after comprehensive discussions. The fact that all researchers have extensive experience of the methodology authenticates accuracy. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed immediately after each interview, thus increasing accuracy. After 20 interviews no new categories emerged.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Healthcare professionals strove to provide competent and confirming individualised care based on a holistic perspective and high accessibility to the ICD team. Encouraging independence was achieved by giving the patients tools to handle their life situation, giving them existential support and mediating security. The nurses and physicians felt that there should be more structured education and counselling during follow-up, as suggested in clinical guidelines. They also described that increasing their own competence by improving their skills and continuous education was crucial to improving ICD care.</p>
