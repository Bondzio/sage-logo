<abstract>
<p>This study uses recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and Registered Nurses (RNs) licensing exam to examine the recession’s effect on the RN labor market. It then reports results of a survey of 518 hospital nursing officers conducted in 2008 and 2010 matched with institutional data from the American Hospital Association (AHA). These unique data show how the recession led hospitals to slow hiring despite accelerating attrition of retirement-age nurses; shift away from H1-B, agency, and, overtime work; and reduce training, and other benefits for new hires. More broadly, results show how nurse-staffing practices adapt to market conditions. Results also suggest reduced hospital support for nursing education may strain the supply of managerial and specialty nurses as baby-boom nurses retire.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the mid-1990s, researchers, policy-makers, and administrators have portended a public health crisis due to a shortage of registered nurses (RNs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527154413481810">Buerhaus, Auerbach, &amp; Staiger, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154413481810">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154413481810">Blendon et al., 2002</xref>). In 2006, an average of 8.5% of budgeted positions for hospital nurses were unfilled while only 1.2% of nurses were unemployed,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527154413481810">1</xref></sup> prompting hospitals to experiment with a wide variety of recruitment and retention practices. These included expanding the pipeline of new nurses (e.g., through partnerships with educational institutions and recruiting foreign workers), targeting compensation toward new hires (e.g., by frontloading pay, signing bonuses, and relocation bonuses), or providing opportunities for training and advancement (e.g., tuition reimbursement and clinical rotations). Increasing reliance on mandatory overtime or contracted “travelling” agency nurses prompted concerns that such practices contribute to medical errors and nurse burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527154413481810">Garrett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527154413481810">Hall, Propper, &amp; Reenen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, since the recession, the familiar refrain of a nursing shortage has abated. Administrators report experienced nurses are reentering the labor market and requesting longer hours while hospitals are facing reduced demand for nurses and greater budgetary pressures. These reports imply a simultaneous increase in supply and decrease in demand for nurses, prompting a relaxation of the nursing labor market.</p>
<p>This study brings public, proprietary, and survey data to bear on two questions regarding new trends in the market for nurses. First, how has the recession affected the demographics and key labor market indicators for registered nurses (RNs)? Second, how have hospitals’ staffing practices adapted to the new economic climate?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1527154413481810">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The study compiles data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the National Council of Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN), and surveys of hospital nursing officers conducted in summer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527154413481810">2008</xref> and summer 2010 matched with data from the AHA. Throughout this article, reported differences are statistically different with <italic>p</italic>-values of less than 10%.</p>
<sec id="section3-1527154413481810">
<title>Current Population Survey</title>
<p>The section, “The State of the RN Labor Market” analyzes trends in the market for RNs using the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups (CPS MORGs). The CPS is a nationally representative monthly survey of households conducted by the Census Bureau for the BLS. It is a principal source for monthly official employment and demographic data, including the official unemployment rate. A mean of 3,700 RNs, 14,400 healthcare workers, and 208,200 workers in all occupations were sampled by the CPS in each year from 1995 to 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1527154413481810">
<title>NCLEX Exam</title>
<p>The section, “The State of the RN Labor Market” uses data on the NCLEX exam published by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing to track entry into nursing. The NCLEX tests for entry-level competence, and all domestic and foreign-educated RN candidates are required by all U.S. state and territorial nursing boards to pass the exam as a requirement for licensure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1527154413481810">
<title>AHA Survey of Hospitals</title>
<p>The section, “The State of Hospital RN Staffing Practices” analyzes how hospital staffing practices vary by their size and governance. To do so, data from the staffing practice survey is matched to proprietary data from the 2008 and 2010 AHA Survey of Hospitals. The AHA Survey provides a nearly complete annual census of U.S. hospitals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1527154413481810">
<title>2008 and 2010 Hospital Nurse Staffing Surveys</title>
<p>Mail surveys of hospital nursing officers were conducted in 2008 and 2010 to assess how hospital-staffing strategies adapted to changing labor market conditions over the recession. These surveys were then matched with institutional data from the AHA Survey and local labor market data from the CPS MORGs. The resulting dataset includes institutional, metropolitan, and local labor market characteristics of U.S. hospitals and their staffing practices.</p>
<p>Each survey was developed through an iterative process of referring to nursing management literature and consultation with nursing officers, labor representatives, and deans at geographically and institutionally diverse hospitals and nursing schools. Each survey identified itself as “a survey of hospital RN recruitment strategies,” and asked nursing officers to report whether their hospitals used a broad variety of nurse staffing practices. A cover letter offered summary statistics to respondents who left contact information.</p>
<p>Surveys were sent to a random sample of metropolitan hospitals listed in the AHA Survey. For the 2008 survey, 1,286 first-round surveys were delivered to Chief Nursing Officers (CNOs) at hospitals with at least 25 beds, 140 were returned. A follow-up survey was sent to nonrespondents, of which 133 were returned, for a cumulative response rate of 21.2%. For the 2010 survey, of 1,402 deliverable surveys, 315 were returned, for a cumulative response rate of 22.5%.</p>
<p>The low response rate merits further analysis to examine magnitude and extent of response bias. Fortunately, the survey data may be compared to data linked to the AHA Survey, allowing the observable characteristics of respondents to be compared with those of the sampling frame. A χ<sup>2</sup>test concludes that response status is dependent on governance, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude (at a 10% significance level for either survey) that other hospital characteristics predict response. Although limited in scope, this result suggests there is not a great deal of selective response, at least with regard to observable characteristics.</p>
<p>To produce national-level descriptive statistics, responses are weighted according to each hospital’s estimated probability of response using hospital characteristics from the AHA Survey. Specifically, a logistic regression estimates the likelihood a hospital responds to the survey as a function of governance (government, for-profit, or nonprofit), the logarithm of the bed size, and dummy variables indicating membership in a hospital system, a hospital network, or status as a general medical, and surgical hospital. Responses are then weighted by the inverse probability of response, with a minimum of 3.27 (associated with an estimated 31% probability of response) and a maximum of 8.73 (associated with an estimated 11.5% probability of response). Reweighting provides unbiased national estimates under the condition that response is random within groups included in the logistic regression.</p>

<title>The State of the RN Labor Market</title>
<p>Prior to the recession, low unemployment rates and high vacancy rates for nurses prompted healthcare analysts to project a widespread shortage of nurses. Economic theory predicts that rising nursing wages should raise workers’ willingness to pay for nurse training, prompting attracting nurses into the profession, and schools to raise enrollments. These efforts were spurred by public support for nursing education.</p>
<p>Results from the CPS and the NCLEX show that entry into nursing has indeed risen rapidly since 2002. Coupled with a decline in the demand for nurses, unemployment rates for nurses have risen while vacancy rates have fallen, even as hospitals reduced their reliance on nurses on temporary work visas. Detailed results follow.</p>
<sec id="section8-1527154413481810">
<title>Unemployment and Underemployment</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1527154413481810">Figure 1</xref>, from 1995 to 2008, the unemployment rate among RNs was between 1% and 1.5% before increasing to over 2% in 2009 and 2010. Unemployment among RNs remained about one fourth the national average, while unemployment among all health care occupations<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527154413481810">2</xref></sup> has remained about one half of the national average. From 2009 to 2011, the unemployment rate for RNs hovered slightly above 2%, in contrast to slightly above 1% in 2007 and 2008.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the CPS does not have a large enough sample of RNs in any given year to make specific claims regarding the labor market experiences of new graduates. Hospitals may prefer giving longer hours to incumbent staff or hiring reentrants to nursing. In addition, the recession may have caused RNs to desire longer hours to compensate for laid-off spouses; comparing the period 2000-2007 to 2008-2009, married RNs worked an average of half an hour more per week, while never-married RNs worked an average of half an hour less.</p>
<p>While more RNs surveyed by the CPS are reporting being laid off, the share of RNs on layoff remains lower than the national average before and during the recession. From 2008 to 2011, about three RNs per thousand were unemployed and on layoff, up from two RNs per thousand from 2000 to 2007. In the labor force as a whole, nine workers per thousand in 2011 were on layoff, up from seven from 2000 to 2007.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1527154413481810">
<title>RN Job Growth</title>
<p>The health policy community expressed concern that the domestic production of RNs is insufficient to counter the acceleration of RN retirees and increases in the demand for nurses prompted by the aging population and a general expansion of demand for health care.</p>
<p>In 2005, an estimated 2.45 million RNs worked a total of 4.30 billion hrs. Total RN hours grew by 3.4% in 2006, 4.9% in 2007, and 5.4% in 2008, when an estimated 2.65 million RNs worked a total of 4.94 billion hr. Much of the growth since 2000 came from foreign nationals. From 2000 to 2007, hours provided by foreign nationals increased from 4.3% to 6.0% of the total, or about 140,000 Full-time Equivalent (FTE) jobs.</p>
<p>In 2008, the BLS estimated that registered nursing will grow by 22% and create 581,500 new jobs from 2008 to 2018, the largest absolute projected increase of any occupation. The BLS estimated particularly strong growth outside of hospitals, which currently employ 60% of RNs. However, the recession sharply stalled the growth of the RN workforce. While RN employment grew by 4.6% annually from 2000 to 2008, growth slowed to 1.4% in 2009, 2.5% in 2010. In 2011, RN employment contracted by 3.6%, due in large part to attrition of retirement-age workers. Hospital administrators reported that budgetary constraints following the recession have led to a reduction of hours and new hiring.</p>
<p>Annual hours may also be decomposed by demographic and labor market characteristics of interest. In 2007, full-time work provided 4.0 billion hrs, while part-time work provided 0.7 billion hrs. From 2007 to 2008, aggregate full-time hours increased 6.7% (a gain of 280 million hrs) while aggregate part-time hours decreased 3.0% (a loss of 20 million hrs). In contrast, from 2008 to 2009, aggregate full-time hours increased 0.7% (a gain of 30 million hrs) while aggregate part-time hours increased 5.9% (a gain of 40 million hrs). The shift from full-time to part-time hours is largely attributable to substitution of overtime work with part-time work. Potential explanations for this trend may include avoidance of overtime premia, regulations restricting overtime, avoidance of full-time benefits, flexible scheduling, or attempt to create a buffer of experienced nurses in advance of the economic recovery or anticipated retirements. After the stark shift to part-time work between 2008 and 2009, working hours for individual nurses remained roughly constant from 2009 to 2011.</p>
<p>Work performed by foreign nationals contracted 18% between 2007 and 2009, accounting for about 1% of the decline in total hours and 30 of the total deceleration of RN job growth experienced in 2009. Since 2009, the share of work performed by foreign nationals has leveled off.</p>

<sec id="section10-1527154413481810">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>As a large proportion of the RN workforce approaches retirement-age, health policy analysts, and nursing administrators have increasingly examined what demographic groups will take their place. In an often-cited series of articles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527154413481810">Buerhaus, Auerbach, and Staiger (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527154413481810">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154413481810">2007</xref>) predict that the retirement of the baby-boomers would simultaneously reduce the supply of RNs while increasing demand for health care, thereby exacerbating the shortage. Consistent with their analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1527154413481810">Figure 2</xref> shows that in 2010, 37% of the RN workforce was at least 50 years old, up from 25% in 2000. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1527154413481810">Figure 2</xref> also illustrates a “flattening” of the RN age profile, as mid-career baby-boom RNs began to retire, and younger workers entered nursing. These trends resulted in a sharp decline in middle-aged RNs since 2000. Also citing the CPS, Buerhaus, Auerbach, and Staiger (2009) found that entry by younger workers, foreign-born workers, and men resulted in “strong employment growth,” although “the current nurse shortage has not been eliminated.”</p>

<p>Following the CPS through 2010, trends among younger workers and men are less encouraging; absolute increases in each share are largely attributable to steady overall growth in nursing rather than disproportionate entry by young nurses or men. Workers under the age of 35 constituted about 23% of the nursing workforce throughout the decade before rising to 27% in 2011, a statistically significant increase from 2000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1527154413481810">Figure 3</xref>). Non-White and foreign-born workers increased in share until the recession, and have experienced recent declines. Results are consistent with reports that hospitals are scaling back reliance on nurses on skilled-worker visas.</p>

<p>In 2010, 8.4% of RNs were men, a slight increase from 7.2% in 2000. Earlier Decennial Censuses find that men accounted for 5.9% of RNs in 1990, and 4.6% in 1980. In contrast, noncitizens’ share of nurses has declined since 2006.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1527154413481810">
<title>Labor Force Entry</title>
<p>Prior to the recession, health policy analysts often cited nursing schools’ capacity constraints as a cause and as an exacerbating factor of the nursing shortage (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527154413481810">AACN, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527154413481810">Buerhaus, Auerbach, and Staiger, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527154413481810">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154413481810">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527154413481810">Hinshaw, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527154413481810">Raymond, 2005</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527154413481810">Yordy, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The number of US-educated RN candidates who passed the NCLEX licensure examination nearly doubled from a trough in 2002 to 2011, to about 172,000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1527154413481810">Figure 4</xref>). While the number of foreign-educated passers increased more than five-fold from a trough in 2000 to 2007, by 2010 the number of foreign-educated passers declined to 55% of its prerecession level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527154413481810">3</xref></sup> The recession’s increase in domestically educated NCLEX passers has not been enough to offset the decline in passers educated abroad; in 2011, 195,307 RN candidates passed the exam, a 6.9% decline from the peak of 209,758 in 2008.</p>

<p>To analyze nursing demographics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527154413481810">Buerhaus, Auerbach, and Staiger (2012)</xref> forecast a shortage in nursing, as their model predicts that much of the expansion in nursing supply came from greater transitory labor force participation among trained nurses. However, results from the NCLEX suggest instead that new entry into nursing has indeed been rapidly rising in the past half-decade. Moreover, hospitals have moved away from supplementary practices, foreign recruitment, and H1-B nurses. These practices also may provide hospitals greater ability to expand nursing hours than models of domestic labor force participation suggest.</p>

<title>Turnover, Vacancies, and Perception of Shortage</title>
<p>Perennially high vacancy rates are often cited by nursing manpower analysts as a defining feature of the nursing shortage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527154413481810">American Hospital Association, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527154413481810">American Health Care Association, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527154413481810">Buerhaus, Auerbach, &amp; Staiger, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154413481810">2007</xref>, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527154413481810">Irvine &amp; Evans, 1995</xref>). Several studies have linked understaffing to a wide range of adverse quality indicators (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527154413481810">Lin et al., 2006</xref>, for review).</p>
<p>Surveyed hospital administrators report large and statistically significant declines in turnover, budgeted but unfilled vacancies, and perceptions of a nursing shortage. Turnover declined most sharply in large and government-controlled hospitals.</p>
<p>Overall, respondents’ mean vacancy rates in 2008 were 7.4% with a sampling error of 0.9%, slightly lower than the AHA’s estimate of 8.5% in 2007. Vacancy numbers greatly exceed the nursing unemployment rate for this period, estimated to be 1.2% by the CPS. By 2010, this gap narrowed, with the mean hospital reporting 4.4% of budgeted RN positions are vacant, while unemployment rose above 2%. While RNs continue to enjoy a large vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, respondents suggested that vacancies were predominantly in managerial and specialty positions, rather than entry-level positions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1527154413481810">
<title>Recruitment, Retention, and Supplementation</title>
<p>The historically tight market for RNs prompted nursing officers to experiment with a wide range of RN recruitment, retention, and supplementation strategies. Detailed case studies are available through the Community Tracking Study (CTS) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527154413481810">May, Bazzoli, &amp; Gerland, 2006</xref>) and the Future of Nursing report of the Institute of Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527154413481810">IOM; 2012</xref>). These studies provide a useful complement to the nationally representative survey conducted here.</p>
<p>In 2008, a majority of hospital administrators reported using signing or relocation bonuses to recruit nurses. Forty-one percent of hospitals (particularly for-profit hospitals) offered signing bonuses, with 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile amounts of US$1,000, US$5,000, and US$10,000 respectively. Twenty-five percent of hospitals provided signing bonuses instantly or distributed over the first 6 months, another quarter distributed bonuses over 1 year, and the remaining half-distributed bonuses over more than 1 year. Half of hospitals offering relocation bonuses offered US$3,000 or more, and 10% of hospitals offered relocation bonuses of US$10,000 or more. Signing bonuses are particularly common among hospitals that are privately owned, with greater beds, and employing greater share of local RNs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1527154413481810">4</xref></sup> By 2010, the share of hospitals offering signing bonuses dropped from about 43% to 21%, and the share offering relocation bonuses dropped from about 39% to 15%.</p>
<p>Supplementary practices were typically viewed as more costly and less desirable than recruiting a new full-time nurse, as overtime and agency nurses use has been linked to errors, poor morale, and burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527154413481810">Bpharm et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527154413481810">Hall, Propper, &amp; Reenen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527154413481810">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527154413481810">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>). Interviewed nursing officers reported agency nurses were typically less experienced and less familiar with hospital protocols and procedures, and whose greater pay (even after adjusting for benefits) could harm staff morale. Nursing officers surveyed in 2008 reported that agency nurses were most commonly used to fill budgeted-but-vacant positions (72%), followed by filling-in for leaves of absence and sick days (60%), unusual or season work (52%), and to fill critical or specialty care positions (40%). Interviewees reported staff nurses receive preferential scheduling and positions. Interestingly, 46% of hospitals report using agency nurses in 2010, within the sampling error of the share in 2008. One interpretation of this finding is that temporary nurses are more easily let-go, and so are being used to weather economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>As shown in the previous section, recruitment of foreign-born and internationally educated nurses grew rapidly in the past decade, owing partly to a special exemption (Schedule A) in the H1-B visa program. This exemption allows hospitals to forego demonstrating an inability to recruit nurses at existing wage rates and allows RNs to bypass visa caps. Since 2007, the decade-long increase in internationally educated NCLEX passers reversed, consistent with declining filings for H1-B nurses.</p>
<p>The tendency for overtime and workers’ hours to decline in economic recessions is well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527154413481810">Cho, &amp; Cooley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527154413481810">Okun, 1962</xref>), and appears to also be the case in nursing. The proportion of hospitals reporting that more than 10% of staffing is composed of overtime work dropped from 34% to 15%, with large and nonprofit hospitals experiencing the greatest declines. Both intensive overtime and agency nurse use is also strongly and statistically significantly correlated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) with a perceived shortage in both 2008 and 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1527154413481810">
<title>Training and Educational Partnerships</title>
<p>Larger hospitals typically offer career tracks beginning with assistance with basic college skills training to tuition reimbursement for graduate training, and may be intimately involved with local nursing education by providing schools and students with experiential resources. Prior to the recession, this support often included direct financial support, particularly by large regional hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527154413481810">Benson, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Hospitals reported a wide range of practices for promoting local nursing education. Common practices include serving as a clinical rotations site for nursing students (88%), serving as an externship site (58%), and providing free lecture space for nursing classes (36%). About one third of hospitals in both 2008 and 2010 reported providing financial support to nursing schools or nursing faculty directly. The range of these programs defies statistical overview, but includes gifts to nursing schools to establish new programs, fellowships, and salary supplementation for nursing faculty, and, paid leave for staff nurses to teach in the “off” season.</p>
<p>Tuition reimbursement for current employees who pursue higher degrees are more common. In 2008, 86% of hospitals offered tuition support for nurses pursuing Licensed Practical Nurse- Registered Nurse (LPN-to- RN), Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), or advanced degrees. These programs typically permit eligibility instantly or upon 1 year at the hospital (often accruing at the rate of 1 year of tuition support per year of work) and require student nurses to work at least half-time. Quartile tuition awards are US$2,000, US$3,000, and US$5,000.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the share of hospitals sponsoring nonemployee students (including for work commitment) declined from 31% to 20%. For-profit and small hospitals are less likely to provide financial support for nursing schools and faculty. The share of hospitals providing tuition reimbursement for LPNs pursuing training to become a RN dropped from 85% to 75%. Each decline is statistically significant with <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section16-1527154413481810" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By tracking trends from the CPS, the NCLEX exam data, and two national surveys of nursing officers matched to AHA data, this study holistically characterizes the state of the market for RNs and how hospitals are adapting their staffing practices. Nursing’s growth has slowed from a rate of about 5% in the previous 3 years to 2% from 2009 to 2010, and then contracted to 2009 levels in 2011. This decline is attributable largely to reductions in foreign recruitment and overtime and attrition of older workers, with staffing shifting to part-time workers and domestically educated new entrants and reentrants. On the whole, results show that much of the adjustments to staffing practices occurred in 2009 and have since leveled off, with fewer resources devoted to training incentives and other benefits primarily affecting new workers.</p>
<p>Over the previous 2 years, the share of CNOs perceiving a nursing shortage dropped sharply. This belief is reflected in the contraction in the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, which dropped from about 8-to-1 in 2007 to about 2-to-1 in 2010. Interviews and survey data suggest hospitals are better able to fill entry-level positions, and are instead focusing resources to fill managerial or specialty care positions through training or recruitment. Given that highly educated specialty and managerial nurses are also generally closer to retirement and less mobile than entry-level nurses, job opportunities may be best among the young and geographically flexible nurses with specialized or managerial skills. However, the recession has also adversely impacted training, potentially constraining long-term succession planning into managerial and specialty positions.</p>
<p>For nurses, the economic downturn has likely benefited certain experienced nurses while generally making less-experienced nurses and new entrants worse-off. While reductions in mandatory overtime and other supplementary staffing practices generally bodes well for older nurses who are believed to be most at risk of burnout, reduced recruitment and training is likely to disadvantage young and entry-level nurses, and potentially discourages others from pursuing careers in nursing.</p>
<p>For nursing departments, the economic downturn presents great challenges and opportunities. On one hand, hospitals experiencing declining demand face pressure to reduce staffing, improve efficiency, and control costs. On the other hand, reduced demand, accelerating domestic production, and reentry among experienced nurses has relaxed competition (particularly for entry-level positions) and allowed hospital administrators to become less reliant upon aggressive recruitment practices, foreign recruitment, and overtime. The simultaneous increase in supply and reduction in demand allows nursing administrators to focus scarce recruitment and training resources on the hospital’s specific needs.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, these results imply that the nursing shortage has abated due to a simultaneous boost in supply caused by the rapid growth of domestically educated nurses, along with the slowing demand for new nurses. These results have raised the nurse unemployment rate and reduced unfilled vacancies, even as hospitals shifted away from foreign recruitment and reduced overtime. This shift also suggests that the current stock of domestically trained nurses understate the available nursing supply, as hospitals could also return to the prerecessionary practice of recruiting foreign workers. These results suggest policymakers may exert moderation in public support for basic nurse training.</p>
<p>Indeed, the previous 4 years has seen the nursing labor market and hospitals’ staffing and training practices shift dramatically. As demand for nursing services rebounds and baby-boomers retire, the previous 2 years’ experience shows how market forces could prompt nursing practices to return to the recruitment and supplementation practices exhibited during the prerecession shortage, or how effective manpower planning might stabilize and equilibrate nursing employment.</p>

<p>The decline in the number of new NCLEX-RN passers from 2007 to 2010 is in part due to fewer examiners and part due to a lower pass rate after a difficulty-adjustment in 2009. Examiners declined from 54,219 to 30,178, and the pass rate declined from 42.1% to 29.4%.</p></fn>
