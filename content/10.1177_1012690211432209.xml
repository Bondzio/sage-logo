<abstract>
<p>This article examines how the lay press and the expert literature have contributed to spreading the bad image of human Growth Hormone as a doping drug despite the lack of a solid scientific grounds proving its alleged deleterious side-effects. The analysis of the press coverage shows that the drug has been associated with a number of negative concepts and mainly with several health hazards and even (indirectly) with death, through the insistence on the fact that it used to be extracted from cadavers prior to 1985. The expert literature review unveils that a vast majority of the claims about the negative side-effects of the drug contained in the reviewed articles and book chapters are actually suppositions or deductions, not based in actual empirical research. The story about the use of cadaveric hGH is also lavishly quoted by the expert literature. The true available scientific evidence points only to mild side-effects of hGH supplementation in healthy adults. It is therefore concluded that this discourse can be labelled as ideological rather than factual or scientific. These claims have become common sense or naturalized knowledge, and have ultimately become instrumental in the anti-doping campaign succeeding in imposing its perspective on doping and its radical recipes to eradicate it.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In a would-be hit parade of modern doping drugs, ranking the more mentioned, vituperated and feared in public debate, anabolic steroids would arguably feature at number one, with second place being probably disputed between EPO and human Growth Hormone (hGH). It is nowadays a common sense assumption that these are very dangerous doping substances, ‘heavy drugs’, responsible for serious health problems and even premature death among their <italic>abusers</italic>. As this article shows for the case of hGH, both the media and the expert discourses resonate almost unanimously with warnings about their deleterious effects.</p>
<p>This near unanimity has contributed to lay the basis for the public opinion consensus around the idea that doping with these drugs must be banned, and their <italic>abuse</italic> must be severely persecuted and punished. In other words, the common sense assumptions about the health dangers of these doping substances are one of the most solid pillars of the current anti-doping policies and institutions, based in a detect-and-punish, law-and-order paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1012690211432209">Waddington, 2000</xref>), which leaves no room for a more nuanced and rational approach to the doping issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1012690211432209">Møller, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>More widely, anti-doping concepts, ideas and recipes for ‘what needs to be done’ have reached the point where they have become part of ‘what everybody knows’, assumptions which need no further justification nor explanation. Everybody ‘knows’ that dopers are cheats, that they act recklessly by risking their health, that they put the legitimacy and good image of sport in serious jeopardy, and that they are teaching children to become drug addicts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1012690211432209">1</xref></sup> Everybody ‘knows’ that steroids and other doping drugs are fearful threats to individual and even public health. Beyond some minority academic circles, there is very little, if any, public questioning of these ideas. They have become <italic>transparent</italic> to the immense majority of the population, the sports administrators, the experts and the politicians and officials. They have been <italic>naturalized</italic>, a term proposed by the theorist of Critical Language Study Norman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432209">Fairclough (2001)</xref>.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to uncover the ideological nature of some of these common sense assumptions and its instrumentality for the anti-doping campaign, and ultimately, for the power strategy to control elite sports the latter serves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211432209">Dimeo, 2007</xref>). This article focuses on the discourses about the health dangers of hGH intake for performance-enhancing purposes circulated by the mainstream media and the expert literature. The empirical evidence accompanying these pervasive claims is thoroughly examined, and the result of this assessment is that the evidence for this position is extremely weak, which points to the conclusion that such claims are based on speculation rather than science, and that therefore these claims are to be seen as propaganda serving the anti-doping agenda. The article pursues the same thesis as a previous contribution of the same author, focused on the alleged deadly dangers of EPO doping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1012690211432209">López, 2011</xref>), where the mythical nature of the claims about the 18 Dutch and Belgian cyclists who allegedly died of EPO abuse in the late 1980s and early 1990s is uncovered. Both articles have been inspired by the critical analysis of accounts of ‘doping deaths’ undertaken by Paul Dimeo (in the case of the British cyclist Arthur Linton: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211432209">Dimeo, 2007</xref>) and Verner Møller (concerning the death of the Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1012690211432209">Møller, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>2. Theoretical and methodological framework</title>
<p>This article is based on an approach to anti-doping in the light of the ideas of the British scholar Norman Fairclough concerning the relationships between power, ideology, discourse and common sense. According to Fairclough, ‘“Common sense” is substantially, though not entirely, <italic>ideological</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432209">2001</xref>, 69; original italics), meaning that it is ‘<italic>in the service of sustaining unequal relations of power</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432209">2001</xref>, 70; original italics). Ideology is understood in this context as ‘the prime means of manufacturing consent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432209">2001</xref>: 3), or, in a cognate definition, ‘the particular set of shared ideas that obscure how powerful groups dominate others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211432209">Barnhurst, 2005</xref>: 241). This manufacture of consent is exercised mainly (but not only) through the mass media in the most effective way, as power-holders exercise a hidden, implicit power over media structures and the discourses the media convey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432209">Fairclough, 2001</xref>: 43): ‘The stake is more than “mere words”: it is controlling the contours of the political world, it is legitimizing policy, and it is sustaining power relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432209">2001</xref>: 75).</p>
<p>Anti-doping is therefore understood and analysed here as an ideology sustained by and sustaining a particular power elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211432209">Dimeo, 2007</xref>), which expresses itself through its discourses on doping and dopers that have ultimately become naturalized, giving birth to a wide array of common sense assumptions among the public opinion which have pushed and legitimized political action on the issue. These assumptions constitute a ‘meaning system’ which is ‘is sustained by power: by the power of the relevant “experts”, medical scientists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432209">Fairclough, 2001</xref>: 79), and in turn sustains this same power. Although Fairclough is not referring to the case of anti-doping, his words seem to fit very well with this area of power struggle and hegemony.</p>
<p>Fairclough’s ideas are combined with those proposed by the American media sociologist David L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211432209">Altheide (2002)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1012690211432209">2</xref></sup> concerning the role of mass-mediated messages as disseminators and amplifiers of a discourse of fear actually promoted by ‘formal agents of social control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211432209">2002</xref>: 60) and instrumental to surveillance and social control strategies. According to Altheide, the ‘media logic’, which derives from the entertainment imperative of the mass media and the formal and content constraints imposed by its formats, ensures that the alarmist messages of ‘claims makers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211432209">Altheide, 2002</xref>) with specific power agendas find an easy and broad route to audiences educated in the grammar of these formats and keen to hear about ‘yet another’ horror story:<disp-quote>
<p>the entertainment formats of mass media and popular culture (. . .) have contributed to (. . .) the major paradox of our time: the ‘objective’ reality of most citizens is that they are safer, healthier, living longer, and more secure (. . .) yet there is widespread public perception that risk and danger are everywhere, that we are not safe, and that the future is bleak. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211432209">Altheide, 2002</xref>: 42)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is our contention that these words would hold full validity if the word ‘citizens’ were substituted with ‘athletes’ and the whole sentence be placed in the framework of the doping debate.</p>
<p>This is the theoretical background for the case study presented here: a research on how the expert literature and the lay press have constructed hGH as a dreadful doping drug despite an extremely weak evidential basis. The study has two main pillars. The first one is a broad review of the expert literature, covering 41 texts (33 journal articles and eight book chapters). This sample was retrieved following an initial search in academic databases for articles dealing with (or mentioning at some length) the usage of hGH for doping purposes, a first selection that was enlarged using the snowballing technique of tracking the quotation chains started in these papers. Every text was searched for specific mentions to negative side-effects of hGH intake in healthy adults, and every such assertion was assessed in terms of the evidence in which it is based. Four categories were established for this evidence analysis: i) the assertion derives from own epidemiological or experimental research; ii) the assertion is referenced to another scholarly source (journal article or book chapter) based on own epidemiological or experimental research; iii) the assertion is referenced to another scholarly source that is not based in such research; and iv) the assertion is not based in any evidence and/or quotation, at least explicitly.</p>
<p>The second pillar of my research is a content analysis of newspaper articles mentioning hGH as a doping drug, published prior to 2010 in the main English-speaking newspapers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1012690211432209">3</xref></sup>. The press content analysis started with a purely quantitative phase, consisting of a search for articles containing both terms ‘growth hormone’ and ‘doping’, published between 1970 and 2009: 4297 articles were retrieved. It followed with a closer look at a sub-sample consisting of the articles published between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1999, when the first boom of media references to doping with hGH happened. This sub-sample (<italic>n</italic> = 752 articles) was analysed using the ‘tracking discourse’ technique as proposed by Altheide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690211432209">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211432209">2002</xref>), which consists in deducing semantic relationships between pairs of terms or concepts according to the physical proximity between these terms in the text.</p>
<p>The last phase of the press analysis consisted of an ethnographic or qualitative content analysis, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690211432209">Altheide (1996)</xref>. Without relinquishing quantification, this modality of content analysis focuses more in the semantic associations between concepts that take place in the analysed texts, rather than in the iteration of given words or terms, or the physical proximity between pairs of terms. Given the more in-depth nature of ethnographic content analysis, a sub-sample of 110 texts was selected out of the whole body of 1009 articles retrieved prior to the year 2000 using the Boolean search ‘Growth Hormone’ and ‘doping’ in the ‘Major world publications’ category of the Lexis-Nexis database. The reason for setting the limit in December 1999 is that by that date Growth Hormone had already become a ‘star’ doping drug in the media, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1012690211432209">Figure 1</xref>, therefore a substantial amount of articles had already been published, but not an excess of them taking into account the resources available to conduct this research; moving beyond that date would have produced a much bigger sample that would have hindered this phase of the content analysis. The sub-sample selected only those articles not just mentioning the drug, but also expanding on it to any extent: it included articles from 28 different newspapers in English, 26 dailies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1012690211432209">4</xref></sup> (among them the most relevant British, American and Australian ones) and two magazines (<italic>Newsweek</italic> and <italic>The Economist</italic>).

<title>3. Results and discussion</title>
<sec id="section4-1012690211432209">
<title>3.1. The discourse on doping with hGH in the lay press</title>
<p>An impressionistic overview of press reports on doping with hGH yields quite a gloomy picture of the alleged health dangers of this drug. One can for instance read in the influential <italic>Time</italic> magazine that ‘the side effects of hGH are (. . .) grotesque: excessive growth of bones in the face, hands and feet (. . .) former Los Angeles Raiders lineman Lyle Alzado, who admitted in 1991 to taking hGH and steroids, believed the brain cancer that ultimately killed him in 1992 was caused by overuse of the drugs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690211432209">Blair, 1998</xref>). A news report in the Glasgow’s <italic>Herald</italic> was consistent in its depiction of the drug’s alleged side-effects: ‘using hGH to increase size and strength in adults, however, can produce a number of side-effects such as particularly [<italic>sic</italic>] acromegaly, a disorder of the pituitary associated with enlarged hands and feet, thickened lips and tongue, and facial distortions including a jutting lower jaw’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211432209">Laura, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <italic>The New York Times</italic> quoted Dave Keaggy, an American power lifter, as saying that ‘the real horrors are human growth hormones (. . .) This stuff can make your heart grow twice its size’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690211432209">Amdur, 1983</xref>). According to Melbourne’s <italic>The Age</italic>, ‘scientists have found that people with excessive natural growth hormone suffer serious side effects including heart problems, diabetes and high blood pressure. It is considered a very dangerous drug’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211432209">Gerrans, 1992</xref>). <italic>USA Today</italic> reported that the drug ‘has devastating side effects, including enlargement of hands, jaw and forehead. [It] Can also enhance the growth of tendons and ligaments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211432209">Anonymous, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Toronto’s <italic>Globe and Mail</italic>, reporting on the hearings of the Dubin inquiry which followed the Ben Johnson scandal, quoted the Canadian sprinter Molly Killingbeck as stating that she ‘drew the line at human growth hormone (. . .) ‘‘They were talking about extracting it from dead people’’, Killingbeck said with a grimace, referring to the fact that human growth hormone was taken from the pituitary glands of cadavers before it was available in synthetic form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1012690211432209">Hynes and McLeod, 1989</xref>). An article in Sydney’s <italic>Sun Herald</italic> stated that ‘even more worrying -and sick- has been the use of the human growth hormone. HGH, or somatotrophine [<italic>sic</italic>], is commonly extracted from pituitary glands at post mortems and then frozen for later use’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690211432209">Hickie, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to ascertain whether, how and to what extent the lay press has contributed to spreading the alarm concerning the health dangers of doping with hGH, as the previous excerpts seem to indicate, I engaged in a press content analysis. Its quantitative phase, as described in the previous section, yielded some interesting results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1012690211432209">Figure 1</xref>). The first time the association between the terms ‘doping’ and ‘growth hormone’ emerged was in 1983, with three occurrences (two articles in the Toronto’s <italic>Globe and Mail</italic> and one in <italic>The New York Times</italic>), but until 1988 its recurrence was very low, with a maximum of six yearly registered occurrences in 1987. The following year the figure jumped to 25, the same as in 1989. This sudden increase of press interest in hGH is closely linked to the Ben Johnson scandal in the Seoul Olympics and its aftermaths, including the ensuing Dubin inquiry opened in Canada.</p>
<p>Between 1990 and 1995 the figure diminished (with just eight occurrences in 1990), until it jumped again in 1996 (60), in the context of the Atlanta Olympics, but especially in 1998 (524 articles), when it soared to ten times the previous year’s record. The following peaks coincide with the Sydney (2000: 503 articles), Athens (2004: 886 articles) and Beijing (2008) Olympics. Examining a sample of 1998’s articles reveals that they are linked to the <italic>Festina affaire</italic> in the Tour de France, but above all to the seizure by customs officials in Sydney of some vials of hGH in possession of a Chinese swimmer heading to the Perth Swimming World Championships. The magnitude of this scandal is revealed by the enormous amount of articles (up to 585) yielded by a search in the ‘Major world publications’ category of the Lexis-Nexis database with the words and connectors Yuan OR Chinese AND human AND growth AND hormone (Yuan was the name of the swimmer) for the year 1998. It can be safely stated, therefore, that 1998 was the year when hGH reached its status as ‘celebrity drug’, thanks to the massive attention it was awarded in the English-speaking media.</p>
<p>In the ‘tracking discourse’ phase of the content analysis, I searched a sub-sample of articles published between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1999 (<italic>n</italic> = 752), for the proximity in the articles’ body of ‘growth hormone’ to several negative terms usually associated with doping, on the basis that the closer the physical proximity between ‘growth hormone’ and these concepts, the closer the semantic relationship or association between them (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1012690211432209">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>According to Lexis-Nexis itself,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1012690211432209">5</xref></sup> the occurrence of the searched terms within 50 words before or after ‘growth hormone’ indicate that they coincide more or less in the same paragraph, which suggests a reasonable degree of semantic relationship between them. Taking this as a reference, the search shows a high degree of association of ‘growth hormone’ with terms and concepts of the semantic family of ‘prohibition’ or ‘illegality’: 368 of the 752 retrieved articles featured these terms within 50 words of ‘growth hormone’, 48.9 percent of the sample. Other relevant meaning associations (w/n = 50) hinted at by this search include the term ‘cheating’ and its derivates and synonyms (148 articles or 19.7% of the sample), the term ‘problem’ and other of the same semantic family (120 articles, or 15.9% of the sample), and the term ‘risk’ and cognates (84 articles, or 11.2% of the sample). In order to fully assess the significance of these figures one need to take into account that a vast majority of the 752 retrieved articles (up to 96%) limit themselves to a sheer mention of growth hormone, without any further explanation of the drug and its effects. In fact, only 31 of these 752 articles were selected for the qualitative phase of the study (discussed below) on the basis that they did not just mention the drug but expanded to some extent on it.</p>
<p>This qualitative phase, as described in the previous section, is aimed at a higher degree of precision concerning the meaning associations performed in the searched newspapers. One of the analysed aspects was the direct semantic association (not just physical proximity between words in the text) of hGH with negative concepts or values in the 110 reviewed articles. The most common one is its undetectability in tests: 50 percent of the articles allude to it. In the context of the anti-doping value system, undetectability is a clearly negative feature. Up to 45 articles (41%) associate growth hormone with the idea of disease or health problems, while 36 articles (32.7%) link it to death, of which 26 (almost one quarter) explicitly mention the fact that hGH used to be extracted from cadavers. Other less frequent associations include prohibition (19 articles), high cost and therefore exclusivity (16 articles), black market and pushers (11 articles) and cheating (10 articles). It is worthwhile pointing out that 96 articles mention hGH in association with steroids (87.3%), and 45 mention it together with EPO (40.9%).</p>
<p>Another way of assessing the meanings associated with growth hormone is to look at the frequent semantic links explicitly made around hGH. A search for words of particular semantic families linked to hGH in the sub-sample yielded 40 mentions (not single articles) of the concept of disease and 26 of the concept of death, while 21 mentions of the idea of prohibition were detected, among other less frequent concepts associated to hGH, like undetectability, danger, physical abnormality and high cost. The explicit references to adverse side-effects of hGH intake for doping purposes were analysed in the 45 articles associating it with health troubles. I recorded up to 102 mentions of 22 different side-effects, the most common ones (with 60 mentions) being those associated with acromegaly, a disease generated by excess hGH secretion in adults.</p>
<p>A final noteworthy aspect of the ethnographic content analysis is the study of the sources quoted in relation to the information on hGH provided in the articles. Of the 37 different individual sources quoted or cited, 28 are doctors in the field of sports medicine, of which 16 (43.2%) were involved in anti-doping activities as officials of sports organizations or anti-doping researchers at the time of speaking. The remaining sources are one sport organization’s official, one anti-doping organization official, one politician and six athletes. Doctors account therefore for 75 percent of the individual sources, which constitutes a clear example of a particular group, in this case a specific subset of the medical profession, ‘possessing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211432209">Altheide, 2002</xref>) a particular subject (doping with hGH and its dangers, for the occurrence).</p>
<p>Thus the qualitative content analysis shows a higher degree of insistence in the health hazards of hGH than the quantitative one submitted to the ‘tracking discourse’ technique. Forty percent of the reviewed articles explicitly link hGH intake for doping purposes with health hazards, acromegaly and its associated side-effects being the most often quoted. One third of the reviewed articles link hGH with death, either as a health hazard for <italic>abusers</italic> but more often in reference to the fact that the drug used to be extracted from cadavers. The persistence of this macabre anecdote is noteworthy given the fact that cadaveric hGH was discontinued and substituted with synthetic, virus-free hormone in 1985. Finally, the credibility of this association between doping with hGH and health hazards is much reinforced by the pervasive referencing of medical experts as its main and authoritative source. If there were solid scientific evidence about this association, it would be reckless to label the lay press’ insistence on it as ‘ideological’ or ‘ideology-driven’, it would indeed be a case of the media fulfilling its social responsibility duties by reporting on demonstrated facts conveying potential dangers for the individual athletes and the athletic community as a whole.</p>
<p>However let us, for a moment, not give the scientific community the benefit of doubt concerning the solidity of their claims about the dangers of doping with hGH, instead take an in-depth look at what the medical community has said about doping with hGH in the expert literature. The results of this literature review are well worth a lengthy analysis.</p>

<title>3.2. Literature review: In search of empirical evidence</title>
<p>As will be seen below, the expert literature published in academic journals and books seems to overwhelmingly confirm and reinforce the pervasive messages of the lay press about the dangers of using hGH for performance enhancement purposes. The popular handbook <italic>Clinical Sports Medicine</italic>, for instance, enumerates the following impressive list of ‘adverse reactions’ of hGH intake: ‘gigantism in the younger athlete, acromegaly in the adult athlete, hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, ischemic heart disease, congestive cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, myopathies [muscular disease], arthritis, diabetes mellitus, impotence, osteoporosis, menstrual irregularities and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211432209">Clisby, 2001</xref>: 887). No less frightening is the following long list of ‘severe side effects’ of hGH intake, ‘both in GH treated patients or athletes: intracranial hypertension, visual changes, headache, nausea, vomiting, peripheral edema, carpal tunnel syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1012690211432209">6</xref></sup>, arthralgia [joint pain], myalgia, acromegalic features such as nose and jaw enlargement, hypertension, cardiomegaly, increased cardiovascular risk, [. . .] insulin resistance and diabetes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1012690211432209">Tentori and Graziani, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Having learnt about these dangers of the drug, one cannot but be astounded when reading the following in a full-page advertisement inserted in p. 92 of the January 2010 issue of <italic>High Life</italic>, the corporate magazine people travelling with British Airways can find in a pocket in front of their seats:<disp-quote>
<p>[hGH is available for] everyone else from age 30 to 90 who doesn’t want to age rapidly but would rather stay young, beautiful and healthy all of the time (. . .) hGH is particularly helpful to the elderly who, given a choice, would rather stay independent in their own home, strong, healthy and alert enough (. . .) Frank, age 85, walks two miles a day, plays golf, belongs to a dance club for seniors, had a girlfriend again and doesn’t need Viagra, passed his drivers tests and is hardly ever home when we call (. . .) hGH is known to relieve symptoms of Asthma, Angina, Chronic Fatigue, Constipation, Lower back pain and Sciatica, Cataracts and Macular Degeneration, Menopause, Fibromyalgia, Regular and Diabetic Neuropathy, Hepatitis, helps Kidney Dialysis and Heart and Stroke recovery.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This kind of advertisement is an expression of the ‘semantic turn’ which has lately affected hormone therapy, a move thoroughly analysed by John Hoberman in his celebrated book <italic>Testosterone Dreams</italic>. According to Hoberman, hGH, alongside testosterone and other hormones, has come to be seen as ‘a procedure for the healthy, not for the sick (. . .) more of a lifestyle drug than a therapeutic one’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211432209">Hoberman, 2005</xref>: 121).</p>
<p>In the face of these messages praising the almost miraculous virtues of hGH, the obvious question arises: what are the real effects of hGH supplementation in healthy adults? Are they the beneficial, mild, anti-ageing, aphrodisiac and innocuous ones boasted by the advert? Or are they the catastrophic and life-threatening ones that some scientists warn us off? One would be tempted to dismiss the advertisement as pure distortion or outright invention with irresponsive commercial purposes, in the light of the huge amount of coinciding claims in the opposite direction made by the scientific community, mainly those published in prestigious academic journals. Although in this case one might equally wonder how British Airways and the authorities supervising medical advertising could have allowed such an allegedly misleading and dangerous advert to be published in a magazine leafed through by tens of thousands of passengers and BA staff in aircrafts and airports. According to Hoberman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211432209">2005</xref>: 129), academic or ‘peer-reviewed’ medicine stands opposite to ‘an expanding “alternative” medical culture that is built on anecdotal evidence and the kind of pseudoscience about hormones that is constantly appearing in bodybuilding magazines’. Hoberman has labelled this kind of medical culture as ‘tabloid medicine’. The kind of science about the virtues of hGH populating bodybuilding and airline company’s magazines might indeed not be very evidence-based. But our analysis shows that a very similar thing happens with a lot of peer-reviewed, ‘serious’ academic literature, when dealing with the alleged side-effects of the drug. This is but a new invitation to reflect on the mobile and blurred boundaries between tabloid and academic medicine.</p>
<p>The occurrence of these adverse effects seem to be so taken for granted by science and sports authorities alike that the World Anti-Doping Organization, in its 2007 Anti-Doping Quiz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1012690211432209">WADA, 2007</xref>), aimed at educating athletes and their entourage about all the relevant issues concerning doping and testing, wrote the following:<disp-quote>

<p>Answer: d. All of the above. Explanation: A drug test currently exists to test for Human Growth Hormone (hGH).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Let us leave aside the fact that the ‘explanation’ provided by WADA in this document is not an explanation, neither for the alleged side-effects nor for the fact that ‘hGH is prohibited at all times’ and ‘using hGH is cheating’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1012690211432209">7</xref></sup> and let us focus in the scientific evidence which sustains the occurrence of these and other alleged adverse effects of the drug presented in the expert literature.</p>
<p>Of the 40 texts dealing with the use of hGH for performance-enhancing purposes I analysed, 25 mention severe (even lethal) side-effects resulting from this intake, while six others report only on more or less mild side-effects. It is noteworthy that only one of them downplays these risks, stating that ‘in “cycled” low supraphysiological doses, it is no where near as harmful as WADA claim it to be’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690211432209">Graham et al., 2009</xref>: 300) and that ‘RhGH [synthetic hGH] is (. . .) relatively safe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690211432209">2009</xref>: 306). The scales of science seem thus overwhelmingly tilted towards the idea that hGH is a (very) dangerous drug.</p>
<p>In addition to the two papers mentioned in the previous section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211432209">Clisby, 2001</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1012690211432209">Tentori and Graziani, 2007</xref>), several other authors are conclusive about the health hazards of hGH intake for doping purposes. George (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690211432209">2005</xref>: 197–198), for instance, seems to be in little doubt concerning the side-effects of ‘hGH abuse’, which include, according to him, ‘skeletal changes, enlargement of the fingers and toes, growth of the orbit and lengthening of the jaw (. . .) [enlargement of] the internal organs (. . .) and (. . .) cardiomegaly (. . .) muscle weakness (. . .) impaired glucose regulation (usually hyperglycaemia), hyperlipidaemia and insulin resistance (. . .) arthritis and impotence (. . .) activation of naevocytes and an increase in dermal viscosity’. Ehrnborg et al. quote a similar list of deleterious side-effects of ‘longstanding GH doping’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211432209">2000</xref>: 75).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that none of these papers refer the majority of these side-effects to empirical research demonstrating their claimed causal relation with hGH intake in healthy adults. No citations are provided. These effects seem to be taken for granted, undisputed common knowledge amongst these authors. An exception to this is another paper listing the health dangers of ‘long-term use of supraphysiological doses of hGH’, which does cite other academic sources to sustain its statements that it ‘produces symptoms comparable to those known from acromegalic patients’ and that ‘an impairment of the glucose tolerance or the development of diabetes are amongst the possible side effects of uncontrolled use of hGH’. They also state that ‘a cohort study investigating 1848 patients treated with pituitary hGH suggested an increased risk of colorectal cancer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211432209">Bidlingmaier et al., 2003</xref>: 926).</p>
<p>However these contentions become problematic when checking the sources quoted by these authors. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1012690211432209">Melmed (1996)</xref> deals with symptoms of acromegalic patients, not of healthy adults using hGH, and states that ‘extrapolation of these findings [related to acromegalic patients] to adults receiving replacement or pharmacologic doses of GH requires longer term controlled studies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1012690211432209">1996</xref>: 369). The Growth Hormone Research Society explains that ‘most of the available surveillance data do not demonstrate an increased incidence of diabetes, either type 1 or type 2, associated with GH treatment’ in children, while the prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increased ‘in hypopituitary [not in healthy] adults’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690211432209">Growth Hormone Research Society, 2001</xref>: 1869). Concerning the risks of cancer among patients treated with hGH, the source quoted by Bidlingmaier et al. actually states that the data they uncovered in their research (a cohort study of 1848 patients in the UK treated during childhood and early adulthood with human pituitary growth hormone between 1959 and 1985) ‘do not show conclusively whether cancer incidence is increased by growth hormone treatment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1012690211432209">Swerdlow et al., 2002</xref>: 276).</p>
<p>The article by Bidlingmaier and colleagues seems to be pointing in the right direction concerning the origin of the attribution of such health dangers to hGH intake by healthy adults: they have actually been deduced from the symptoms of acromegaly, a disease resulting from the pituitary gland producing excess hGH after puberty, usually due to a benign tumour in these glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211432209"><italic>Concise Medial Dictionary</italic>, 2010a</xref>). This is clear from the wide array of articles and book chapters explicitly referring this deduction, and ultimately from the lack of published scientific evidence (at least to my knowledge) of healthy adults having actually developed acromegalic symptoms after hGH intake for performance-enhancing purposes.</p>
<p>Holt and Sönksen, two of the main worldwide authorities in the field of hGH research, explain that ‘the effects of excess GH are exemplified by acromegaly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211432209">2008</xref>: 542). The list of authors mentioning acromegaly as the model to look for the possible side-effects of hGH intake in healthy adults include, among many others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690211432209">Barroso et al. (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690211432209">Birzniece et al. (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211432209">Deligiannis et al.

(2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1012690211432209">Tokish et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1012690211432209">Wadler (1994)</xref>. In fact, according to Saugy et al., ‘the long term risks of hGH use are not well known since epidemiological data regarding this type of treatment in healthy sportsmen are unavailable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690211432209">2006</xref>: i37). In the same vein, Yesalis and Bahrke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1012690211432209">2002</xref>: 11) are in doubt as to whether ‘an athlete using rhGH in an episodic fashion – 2 eight-week cycles in a year – [will] develop acromegaly? What about two years of use? We do not know the answer.’ Other authors (for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690211432209">Barroso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211432209">Holt and Sönksen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690211432209">Saugy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1012690211432209">Tentori and Graziani, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1012690211432209">Tokish et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1012690211432209">Wadler, 1994</xref>) have mentioned this lack of scientific evidence, which makes rather surprising some of the apparently conclusive statements quoted above.</p>
<p>My literature review, however, has revealed a certain amount of original empirical research on the effects of hGH in healthy adults. Liu and colleagues did the job of thoroughly reviewing the evidence it yielded. In a paper published in 2008 they confirmed ‘the lack of published evidence about the physiologic effects of growth hormone among athletic young adults’ and stated that ‘there is no evidence with which to evaluate the long-term use of growth hormone for athletic enhancement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1012690211432209">2008</xref>: 756). They reviewed nonetheless ‘44 articles describing 27 (. . .) randomized, controlled [short term] trials that compared growth hormone treatment with no growth hormone treatment in community-dwelling healthy participants between 13 and 45 years of age (. . .) 303 participants received growth hormone, representing 13.3 person-years of treatment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1012690211432209">2008</xref>: 747). Twenty-seven studies is not a minor figure, and it is noteworthy that they have escaped scrutiny by most of the quoted authors mentioning the side-effects of hGH intake by healthy adults.</p>
<p>Concerning the safety of growth hormone in healthy adults Liu and colleagues conclude from their literature review that ‘growth hormone-treated participants (. . .) reported more soft tissue edema and fatigue than the latter group [those not treated with growth hormone] (44% vs. 1% and 35% vs. 0%, respectively). Growth hormone-treated participants also experienced arthralgias [joint pain] and carpal tunnel syndrome [see note number 8] more often than did those not treated with growth hormone.’ That is, the available evidence provided by the original empirical research reviewed by Liu and colleagues does not support the occurrence of any of the most repeated serious side-effects of hGH intake by healthy adults mentioned in a vast majority of the articles and book chapters I reviewed.</p>
<p>My literature review included three articles reporting on original research conducted with healthy adults being administered hGH. The adverse side-effects mentioned in these articles belong to the same category of relatively minor symptoms listed by Liu and colleagues. Lange et al. studied the effect of ‘a single, relevant GH dose’ in healthy adults and concluded that it ‘causes exaggerated increases in plasma lactate and glycerol as well as serum NEFA [nonesterified fatty acids] during 90 min of subsequent bicycling at moderate to high intensity. The exaggerated increase in plasma lactate may be associated with substantially decreased exercise performance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1012690211432209">2002</xref>: 4966). Ehrnborg et al. report on an experimental study involving 30 healthy adults with a mean age of 25.9 (age range: 18–35) who were administered supraphysiological doses of growth hormone. Of these, 70 percent ‘complained of muscle pain and/or swollen hands and feet (. . .) Five subjects complained of increased sweating, most likely secondary to the GH-treatment (. . .) Fluid retention symptoms occurred in a majority of individuals on active GH treatment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211432209">2005</xref>: 456). Pierard-Franchimot et al. studied ‘mechanical properties of skin in 8 adult bodybuilders who were recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) abusers’ and concluded that ‘although skin deformability and biological elasticity remained within the normal range, an increase in dermal viscosity was noted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1012690211432209">1996</xref>: 389).</p>
<p>To sum up, the literature review apparently shows that the (so far) demonstrated adverse effects of hGH intake by healthy adults amount to decrease in exercise performance (a rather surprising finding for an allegedly performance-enhancing drug), soft tissue edema, fatigue, joint pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, muscle pain, swollen hands and feet, increased sweating, fluid retention symptoms and increased dermal viscosity. Further, it seems that some of these effects only happen in particular circumstances or do not occur in highly significant statistical frequencies.</p>
<p>After reviewing the existing evidence concerning cancer-related risks of hGH intake by athletes, Tentori and Graziani concluded that ‘given the total absence of controlled scientific reports dealing with athletes treated with AS [Anabolic Steroids], GH/IGF [Growth Hormone/Insuline Growth Factor] or rEpo, the potential risk of developing cancer in doped athletes should not be underestimated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1012690211432209">2007</xref>: 366). One may agree with the argument that in the absence of empirical evidence the risks should not be underestimated, but, one might add, neither overestimated. Which is arguably what a significant part of the academic community has done concerning hGH doping, as demonstrated above.</p>

<sec id="section6-1012690211432209">
<title>3.3. Cadavers and mad cows</title>
<p>There is a curious coincidence amongst a majority of the reviewed articles and book chapters that points in the direction of a (conscious or unconscious) tendency to exaggerating the dangers of hGH supplementation. The coincidence is still more noteworthy because we have encountered it already in the analysis of the press coverage. Twenty-four of the 40 reviewed academic papers mention in one way or another the fact that ‘initially, the only source of GH came from extracts of human pituitary glands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211432209">Holt and Sönksen, 2008</xref>: 548), which entailed a risk of contamination with the Creutzfeld-Jakob prion producing spongiform encephalopathy, the human version of the infamous ‘mad cow disease’. Despite the fact that, due to this risk, cadaveric hGH was withdrawn from the market in 1985 and replaced in 1987 with safe, synthetic hGH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211432209">Holt and Sönksen, 2008</xref>: 548), authors have continued to mention in high numbers the morbid story about these origins and risks, even in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690211432209">Barroso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211432209">Holt and Sönksen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690211432209">Mehlman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1012690211432209">Rogol, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690211432209">Saugy et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, all the mentions to cadaveric hGH and the dangers of contracting Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD) found in my literature review are subsequent to the withdrawal of the human-derived version of the drug.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that cadaveric hGH has not been produced since 1985, some authors have continued to warn about the dangers of hGH <italic>abusers</italic> contracting CJD: ‘as supplies of bioengineered rhGH become more controlled, athletes are tempted to use the hormone obtained illegally from cadavers risking the inevitably fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1012690211432209">Rennie, 2003</xref>: 103). This contention is supported by other authors, namely Holt and Sönksen, who claim that ‘cadaveric GH (. . .) is in plentiful supply on the Internet’ (2008: 543);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1012690211432209">8</xref></sup> also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211432209">Clisby (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211432209">Deyssig and Frisch (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211432209">Ehrnborg et al.

(2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1012690211432209">Sönksen (2001)</xref>. None of these authors cite any empirical evidence to sustain their claims about the availability and use of black-market cadaveric hGH. In fact, most of them actually quote, as the source of this claim, the 1993 article by Deyssig and Frisch, who explain:<disp-quote>
<p>The cadaveric growth hormone is available on the black market and is about half the price of recombinant growth hormone. The source of the cadaveric growth hormone is the former Soviet Union where pituitary-derived growth hormone is still produced (. . .) We had the opportunity to analyse a growth hormone ampoule from the former Soviet Union (. . .) It appears unlikely that suitable precautions were taken to eliminate slow virus contamination. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211432209">1993</xref>: 769)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It doesn’t seem that this claim is well documented, beyond anecdotal evidence. This doesn’t mean, of course, that it is necessarily untrue, but simply that it lacks the kind of evidence requirable to sustain any scientific claim. The only first-hand empirical datum they quote is their analysis of a single growth hormone ampoule ‘from the former Soviet Union’, and their stated conclusion is rather disappointing as to its proving potential concerning their previous alarming claims.</p>
<p>One might be tempted to think that this insistence in the dangers of cadaveric hGH is based on a traumatic experience concerning the occurrence of CJD infections prior to 1985. But the available evidence doesn’t seem to give much ground for such alarmist attitude. In an epidemiological research published in 1991, Fradkin et al. reported on the incidence of CJD among 6284 British patients having received replacement cadaveric hGH in their childhood: ‘Seven neuropathologically confirmed cases of CJD have occurred in this population to date’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211432209">Fradkin et al., 1991</xref>: 880). According to these authors, ‘this case total in a population of approximately 7000 treated patients represents a minimum present risk of one in 1000 of contracting CJD’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211432209">1991</xref>: 883). Although they contend that ‘the occurrence rate is dramatically higher than the risk of CJD in the general population of one case per 1 million people per year’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211432209">1991</xref>: 883), it is debatable whether these figures would justify the insistence of the anti-doping academic literature on this past (and for many, still present) risk.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Human Growth Hormone features nowadays among the top three of the most stigmatized and persecuted doping drugs, together with EPO and anabolic steroids.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1012690211432209">9</xref></sup> One of the main reasons for this is arguably the negative image associated with it as a ‘heavy drug’, mainly concerning its alleged deleterious side-effects. This article examines how the lay press has contributed to spreading this bad image throughout the 1990s, by associating it with negative concepts and meanings but mainly with several health hazards and even (indirectly) with death, through the insistence on the fact that it used to be extracted from cadavers prior to 1985. In order to assess the empirical basis of these claims, a thorough examination of the credibility-laden academic literature on doping with hGH has been conducted.</p>
<p>This literature review, including 39 articles and book chapters, unveils an unexpected panorama: a vast majority of these claims are actually suppositions or deductions, not based in actual empirical (experimental or epidemiological) research. Most of the ominous side-effects attributed to hGH intake for performance-enhancing purposes have been extrapolated from the symptoms of ill persons: patients overproducing growth hormone as a consequence of a tumour of the pituitary gland, resulting in a condition known as acromegaly, or patients receiving hGH as a replacement therapy due to a dysfunction of their pituitary gland. The story about the use of cadaveric hGH is also lavishly quoted by the expert literature. The truth, so far, is that little original research has been done on the side-effects of hGH supplementation in healthy adults,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1012690211432209">10</xref></sup> and that the one actually conducted has only revealed <italic>mild</italic> side-effects like fatigue, joint and muscle pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, swollen hand and feet, fluid retention symptoms and increased dermal viscosity.</p>
<p>It is concluded, therefore, that both the expert and the lay literature have massively associated doping with hGH to deleterious and even fatal side-effects, despite the lack of empirical evidence substantiating the claims about these effects, in addition to linking hGH intake to a wide array of negative concepts and values familiar to the anti-doping ideology (cheating, abuse, illegality, stealth, trouble, etc.). Particularly noteworthy is the insistence of both the expert and the media literature in indirectly linking the drug with death, through their continuous mentions to the old method of obtaining the drug from the pituitary glands of cadavers, despite it having been abandoned in 1985 for safety reasons and substituted by synthetic, safe hGH.</p>
<p>It can be assumed that this discourse has contributed to creating the state of opinion needed to sustain drastic policy decisions concerning the prohibition of the drug and the punishment of its use or the cooperation/complicity with it, a pattern that has arguably been applied to other most well-known doping drugs, like EPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1012690211432209">López, 2011</xref>). The alarming claims about the health dangers of doping with hGH made by authoritative claims makers (mainly medical doctors involved in anti-doping activities) found an easy way to public opinion through the media, due to the entertaining imperative and the spectacular logic steering its <italic>modus operandi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211432209">Altheide, 2002</xref>). These claims have become common sense, naturalized knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432209">Fairclough, 2001</xref>), through repetition and lack of confrontation with critical sources, and have ultimately become instrumental in the anti-doping ideology succeeding in imposing its discourse on doping and its radical recipes to eradicate it.</p>
