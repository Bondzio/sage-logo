<p>Both Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Dynamic Deconstructive Psychotherapy (DDP) are listed in the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices based on independent reviews of their performance in randomized controlled trials for borderline personality disorder. However, little is known about their effectiveness in real-world settings.</p>
<p>DDP is a newer treatment, with demonstrated efficacy, but has been less extensively applied than DBT. In a twelve-month controlled trial, thirty subjects with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and co-occurring active alcohol use disorders were randomized to either DDP or optimized community care. Almost half the subjects also met criteria for antisocial personality disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113490637">Gregory et al. 2008</xref>). Following twelve months of active treatment with DDP, they were then evaluated after an additional eighteen months of naturalistic care in the community. As applied in treating this low-functioning and highly comorbid BPD population, DDP demonstrated relatively good retention rates and large between-group treatment effects for core symptoms of BPD, depression, parasuicide behavior, alcohol misuse, recreational drug use, inpatient care, and perceived social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065113490637">Gregory, Delucia-Deranja, and Mogle 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequent research on the process mechanisms of this study indicated that adherence to DDP technique strongly correlated with positive outcome and that specific outcomes were associated with the application of specific techniques. These findings from psychotherapy process research strongly support the effectiveness of DDP techniques. After an independent review by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, DDP was included on its National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov">www.nrepp.samhsa.gov</ext-link>).</p>
<p>DDP combines elements of translational neuroscience, object relations theory, and deconstructionist philosophy in a twelve-month treatment. Therapists provide weekly one-hour individual sessions helping patients activate those areas of the brain responsible for adaptive and integrative processing of emotionally charged experience. Sessions involve elaborating the sequence of recent episodes of interpersonal encounters and maladaptive behavior (evoking autobiographical memory), identifying and differentiating specific emotions associated with these episodes, and integrating different ways of making meaning of them. In addition, therapists provide novel experiences in the patient-therapist relationship that support individuation and challenge patients’ basic assumptions about themselves and others. The treatment manual is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.upstate.edu/ddp">www.upstate.edu/ddp</ext-link>.</p>
<p>DBT therapists attempt to teach skills such as mindfulness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance in a skills group and then problem-solve with patients in individual sessions to apply emotion regulation or distress tolerance skills during episodes of emotionally charged interpersonal encounters or maladaptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065113490637">Linehan 1993</xref>). Although both DDP and DBT activate autobiographical memory by reviewing specific emotionally charged incidents and behaviors, the therapist stance differs substantially. Whereas the DDP therapist tries to be nondirective and exploratory, thereby supporting individuation, the DBT therapist tries to be validating, directive, educative, and pragmatic.</p>
<p>The present study attempts to fill a gap in the literature by using a quasi-randomized design comparing naturalistic twelve-month outcomes of two manual-based treatments for BPD—DBT and DDP—in the real-world setting of a university clinic. A third group of patients, treated with unstructured eclectic individual psychotherapy, served as a control.</p>
<sec id="section1-0003065113490637" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The participants in this study included 68 patients with BPD treated by expert therapists at the Center for Emotion and Behavior Integration (CEBI) at SUNY Upstate Medical University. In a quasi-randomized naturalistic design, the participants were treated with either comprehensive DBT (<italic>n</italic> = 25) or DDP (<italic>n</italic> = 27) based on patient preference or therapist availability. An additional 16 patients treated with unstructured psychotherapy, ranging from cognitive-behavioral to psychodynamic to eclectic, served as a treatment-as-usual (TAU) control. Clients diagnosed with schizophrenia, mental retardation, or dementia were not eligible for this program. Most of the patients (82%) had been referred from other therapists or institutions because of poor response to previous trials of psychotherapy and medication. The sample had high comorbidity with Axis I disorders, including alcohol and drug use disorders. Ages ranged from 18 to 58 years.</p>
<p>Patients seeking treatment completed an intake packet containing a number of administrative forms and self-rated instruments—Borderline Evaluation of Severity over Time (BEST), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ)—to assess severity and suitability for treatment at CEBI.</p>
<p>Once clients were assigned a therapist, they met with a supervised graduate student in clinical psychology for a prescreening evaluation, which included reviewing the self-rated instruments for completeness and administering the BPD section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) and the Individual Assessment Profile (IAP), a structured interview that quantifies alcohol and recreational drug use over lifetime, last six months, and previous thirty days. The clinical coordinator then reviewed the evaluations with the director of CEBI. At six months and twelve months, patients again completed the packet of self-rated outcome measures.</p>
<p>The five therapists (3 DDP, 2 DBT) had advanced training and at least four years’ experience applying their modality; weekly group supervision maintained treatment fidelity. The primary outcome was the Borderline Evaluation of Severity over Time (BEST) obtained at baseline, six months, and twelve months.</p>
<p>For outcome measures, which met the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality, treatment effectiveness was analyzed by conducting univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for pretreatment scores on all outcome measures by treatment condition at twelve months. For outcome variables with skewed distributions, we used the Mann-Whitney U test of between-group differences in change scores (baseline to twelve months) and paired <italic>t</italic> tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for pre/post differences. Missing data points were accounted for conservatively by carrying forward the most recent observation to the subsequent data collection intervals. Also, comparative treatment effect sizes (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) were calculated from ANCOVA <italic>F</italic> statistics.</p>

<p>No significant differences were found among the three treatment groups with regard to diagnoses or demographics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003065113490637">Table 1</xref>), except age, which was not a significant predictor of change in BEST scores in our sample (<italic>F</italic> = .610, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .438). Overall, 32 clients in the sample (47%) completed one year of treatment.</p>

Clients treated with either DDP or DBT improved significantly on the BEST over twelve months, but clients receiving TAU did not. The pretreatment mean for DDP was 47.1 ± 9.4 and at twelve months decreased to 33.0 ± 12.1, whereas for DBT the pretreatment mean was 49.2 ± 13.1 and at twelve months was 41.8 ± 16.5. DDP achieved significantly greater improvement than TAU, with a large treatment effect.

<p>Although DDP and DBT were both effective, DDP achieved significantly greater improvement in BEST scores. Treatment effects of DDP were medium relative to DBT in the ITT cohort and small for completers (<italic>d</italic> = .27). Whereas the response to DDP was well-defined and consistent among patients receiving that treatment, the response to DBT was much more varied and erratic.</p>
<p>For the secondary outcomes, clients receiving the manual-based treatments achieved highly significant improvement over time in depression and disability, whereas TAU clients did not. Between-group comparisons show significant differences between the manual-based treatments and TAU (although only marginally so in the case of DBT on the SDS). Completer analyses of effect sizes yielded similar findings for depression (DDP vs. TAU <italic>d</italic> = 1.65; DBT vs. TAU <italic>d</italic> = 1.10) and disability (DDP vs. TAU <italic>d</italic> = 1.51; DBT vs. TAU <italic>d</italic> = .57). Even though both manual-based treatments were effective for depression and disability, DDP demonstrated significantly greater improvement than DBT (<italic>F</italic> = 7.47, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .009, and <italic>F</italic> = 4.07, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .049, respectively), with medium effect sizes in the ITT and completer samples.</p>
<p>Clients receiving DDP displayed statistically significant reduction in the number of episodes of self-harm over twelve months, but the other two treatment groups did not. Reduction in self-harm was significantly greater for DDP than for DBT (<italic>U</italic> = 253, <italic>z</italic> = 2.35, <italic>p</italic> = .02).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first to compare two manual-based treatments for BPD in a real-world setting. Clients receiving DDP or comprehensive DBT demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms of BPD over time in the intent-to-treat sample, but those receiving TAU did not. Moreover, both of the manual-based treatments achieved significantly greater improvement in symptoms of depression and disability than was found in those receiving TAU. Symptoms of BPD, as assessed by the BEST, improved to a significantly greater degree for clients treated with DDP as compared to DBT, with a medium effect size. On secondary measures, DDP demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms, disability, and nonsuicidal self-injury than DBT.</p>
<p>A possible explanation for the differences in outcome between DDP and DBT is that CEBI is a specialized tertiary care program that attracts a particularly refractory and comorbid subgroup of BPD clients who have not been preselected for willingness to participate in a research study. In the treatment of severely impaired BPD clients with active co-occurring alcohol use disorders, DDP has demonstrated strongly positive outcomes and relatively good retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113490637">Gregory et al. 2008</xref>). DBT also performed well, with pre/post effect sizes for BPD (<italic>d</italic> = 0.75) and for depression (<italic>d</italic> = 1.07) that are consistent with its performance in other real-world settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065113490637">Harley et al. 2007</xref>) and that lend external validity to our findings.</p>
<p>Both DBT and DDP can be effective for borderline personality disorder in the real-world setting of a tertiary care clinic. However, DDP may lead to greater improvement in symptoms and functioning than DBT in this setting.</p>
