<p>I really wanted Philip Auerswald’s book, with its sunny title and beaming jacket, to convince me that a prosperity juggernaut is about to come charging over the horizon. In <italic>The Coming Prosperity</italic>, Auerswald argues that the world’s population is on the cusp of an extraordinary burst of economic growth and accompanying improvement in quality of life. There is one very important thing to keep in mind when evaluating this assertion: most of the world, as it so happens, is not the United States. It’s not even the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. If you reside on one of these land masses and open this book in hopes of finding evidence that the presiding economic chill is about to become a hothouse of growth in the very near future, you will be disappointed. That, though, is not the argument intended by Auerswald, who is a professor of public policy with a background in economics. Rather, he argues that much of the world is about to experience incredible growth, fueled by growth in the developing world.</p>
<p>The main reason for his optimism is the promise of people—both in numbers and in individuals. As a mass, the several billion people newly and ever-more connected to the rest of the world through advances in communication represent a lot of productive potential. He notes that “the creativity of individual people powers human productivity” (p. 28) and cites a number of cases in which a single person, with the right idea, in the right place, and in concert with others, has been able to bring about positive and significant change. Auerswald, in short, believes in the power of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The book’s fifteen chapters provide primarily two things: reasons that the world should in the next quarter-century or so experience a prosperity boom, and an outline of the capacities that are necessary in order to take advantage of those ripe conditions. The reason he forecasts a prosperity boom is that there are several patterns emerging, the interaction of which should lead to an increase in human productivity. First, there is ongoing broad societal transformation. Whole nations of people are emerging from civil wars and shaking off stifling governments. At the same time, technology is bringing more and more people into contact with each other. This gives them access to new markets and better information, making every person more capable of being a force for change. The prospect of prosperity is, in a sense, a game of odds. As he says throughout the book, “it’s all about recipes” (p. 89). You will not find in these pages a chapter explaining in detail how the intersecting patterns of technology and emergent populations are going to bring about prosperity. There are plenty of examples of how this has worked in the past and in specific cases (such as in the case of a cellular provider in Afghanistan) but there is no step-by-step explanation as to what will bring about the great wave of change forecasted by the title. Auerswald places his faith in the proper alignment of things, in recipes, and the ability of the right mix to bring about a delicious result.</p>
<p>This is not to say that he offers no suggestion. There is discussion of the capacities necessary to take advantage of circumstances, namely the abilities to connect, create, contribute, and collaborate—the stuff of entrepreneurship, in alliterative form. Communication technologies make these four “Cs” easier, which is partly why Auerswald sees the world on a cusp. He emphasizes that entrepreneurship has to be placed on the front burner and argues that the question, going forward, is not a matter of the role of government versus the role of private industry, but is rather one of the amount of resources devoted to known versus new opportunities.</p>
<p>Despite his argument for the necessity of entrepreneurship, I was troubled by the seeming inevitability inherent in the broader argument. Auerswald acknowledges quite plainly that he does not have the magic recipe for global prosperity, and it is hard to fault him for that, but the acknowledgment fails to satisfy. The narrative is just too sunny. It fails to engage with potential obstacles. Consider an example close to home for many <italic>CS</italic> readers: Auerswald notes that the employment opportunities available to recent college graduates do not match their degrees, and that it is unfortunate that they are pushed down old paths rather than encouraged to “map out new pathways that correspond to current realities” (p. 186). No specific suggestion is offered as to what those new pathways might be, and there is no acknowledgment of the barriers to pursuing them, such as student loans and access to health insurance after marriage or age 26. Thinking more broadly, consider that jumps in economic growth tend to come with the creation of new platforms for growth: the spinning jenny, the internet. Facebook and iPhone apps are one thing, but they are not platforms for whole new industries. The kind of research needed to make the next big jumps is expensive, and few people in the world currently have access to those means.</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m being too skeptical. Perhaps lots of things, like improvements in disease prevention and more widely-available education, will roll into the kind of critical mass supposed by Auerswald. Standing in the way, though, are assumptions glossed over in this volume: that the status quo can be toppled by the democratization of productive capability, and that productive entrepreneurship will outweigh the benefits of destructive entrepreneurship. Auerswald needs the world to think about the long-term. Maybe we can do that. Hopefully Auerswald is right, and the kind of prosperity than can lift all boats, not just a few, but a lot, is just around the corner. In the meantime, if you are interested in entrepreneurship, technology, or economic development, read this book. It will drive you nuts, for better or worse.</p>
