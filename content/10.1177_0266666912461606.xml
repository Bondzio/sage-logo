<title>Advancing freedom of information in the Middle East and North Africa</title>
<p>From 13 to 15 June 2012, government officials, civil society practitioners and journalists from Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia met in Marseille, France, for the workshop on Access to Information in the Middle East and North Africa: The Road Ahead. They discussed ways to further access to information, also commonly referred to as freedom of information (FOI). The event received the patronage of UNESCO.</p>
<p>The lively sessions allowed for the presentation of an overview of the status of freedom of information in each country, and for the provision of feedback on the proposed actions - both within and across country teams. International experts shared their knowledge of strategies and concrete steps implemented to promote freedom of information around the world, including coalition-building and development of advocacy campaigns. Participants also examined and discussed case studies that illustrated some of the complexities involved in translating freedom information legislation into practice.</p>
<p>Jordan enacted a freedom of information law in 2007, and has faced the difficult challenge of effective implementation. Tunisia adopted a Decree-Law on freedom of information in 2011, and published the circular regulating its implementation on 3 May 2012, on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day. Draft laws exist in Lebanon and Morocco, where advocacy for the enactment of FOI legislation inclusively and in accordance to international standards is underway. Further, the new Constitution adopted in Morocco in July 2011 includes a provision guaranteeing access to public information (Article 27).</p>

<title>Use of ICT to support the reform of higher education in West Africa</title>
<p>As part of the project to support the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for capacity building and implementation of reforms in Licence-Master-Doctorate (LMD) in institutions of higher education of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) countries, UNESCO organized the 1st planning meeting of key stakeholders at the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris, France, from 4 to 6 July 2012.</p>
<p>Focused on the ICT capacity building component of the project, this event was aimed at building consensus amongst the project stakeholders on modalities and approaches for the project implementation and adopted country and institution-specific workplans. The meeting provided an opportunity for each of the participating universities to share the latest information on ongoing efforts in their countries toward LMD reform and express their specific needs.</p>

<title>A bridge between farmers and the web</title>
<p>by Bob Koigi</p>
<p>Kenyan farmer, Zack Matere, searches the web for useful agricultural information, then posts it on notice boards around his community helping other producers to improve their crops. Zack invested in a 3G-enabled phone that he could use to look for information online from the comfort of his home. Zack is lucky, he is internet literate, but thousands of farmers in his area do not even know how to use cell phones. Zack has therefore become the bridge between these farmers and the internet. Zack pays 50 Kenyan shillings (0.50 euro) everyday to access the internet from his phone, an amount that is beyond the reach of his fellow farmers.</p>
<p>Zack has tried to bring these farmers the information that they so desperately need. The initial challenge was to identify the most effective and inexpensive platform to reach and interact with a community of 10,000 people within a radius of 50 km. He came up with the idea for the network of notice boards, an initiative he calls Leo Pamoja, Swahili for ‘together today’.</p>
<p>ICTs could revolutionize agriculture in Kenya if technological literacy is encouraged. Currently, around 4 million Kenyans know how to use the Internet. This number could increase rapidly since the government recently introduced the ambitious ‘digital villages’ plan to bring more Internet cafes to rural areas. Embracing ICTs promises good returns for farmers, especially through increased market opportunities and more efficient business operations.</p>

<title>A simple exchange system</title>
<p>By Brian Puckett</p>
<p>Next2’s SMS service in Kenya and Nigeria lets farmers share local knowledge, expertise and experiences with each other, and with agricultural researchers.</p>
<p>Next2 was co-founded by internet and mobile entrepreneurs, Emeka Okoye and Brian Puckett. The two developers built their solution to accomplish two goals. First, to facilitate the exchange of local agricultural knowledge and expertise between farmers based on common locations and interests. Second, Next2 promotes the rapid dissemination of agricultural research and best practices to farmers by giving them direct access to information from a wide range of sources using only their cell phones and SMS messaging technology. The aim, therefore, was to provide small-scale farmers with the information they would need to improve crop yield, product marketing and income.</p>
<p>The farmers do not pay for the messages sent to them, only for the messages they send to the system, which cost the same as sending a regular SMS. Businesses and organizations can promote their service by listing their account name with the local Next2 phone number.</p>
<p>The developers hope that their service will create locally concentrated farmer support networks that are in turn connected to the research and support organizations, businesses and the government agencies that farmers rely on for vital agricultural information and assistance.</p>

<title>Protection of cultural heritage: Principles of Engagement</title>
<p>At its meeting in April 2012, the IFLA Governing Board endorsed Principles of Engagement in library-related activities in times of crisis, conflict or disaster. The Principles are part of IFLA's Key Initiatives 2011–2012 programme: Cultural Heritage Disaster Reconstruction Programme – Culture is a basic need, a community thrives through its cultural heritage, it dies without it.</p>
<p>The Principles advise IFLA and its members on how to monitor areas at risk, advocate for and raise awareness about prevention. In the event of a conflict or disaster, the Principles of Engagement will guide activities in recovery situations and advise IFLA and its members if and how to engage in a particular recovery situation within IFLA's strategic directions. They establish criteria to guide decisions on whether IFLA and its members would become engaged in post-conflict/disaster recovery and the terms under which it would do so.</p>

<p>
<bold>The hidden history of South Africa's book and reading cultures. </bold>Archie L. Dick. University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division © 2012. 208 p. ISBN 9781442642898. US$55.00.</p>
<p>
<italic>The Hidden History of South Africa's Book and Reading Cultures </italic>shows how the common practice of reading can illuminate the social and political history of a culture. This ground-breaking study reveals resistance strategies in the reading and writing practices of South Africans; strategies that have been hidden until now for political reasons relating to the country's liberation struggles.</p>
<p>By looking to records from a slave lodge, women's associations, army education units, universities, courts, libraries, prison departments, and political groups, Archie Dick exposes the key works of fiction and non-fiction, magazines, and newspapers that were read and discussed by political activists and prisoners.</p>
<p>Uncovering the book and library schemes that elites used to regulate reading, Dick exposes incidences of intellectual fraud, book theft, censorship, and book burning. Through this innovative methodology, Dick aptly shows how South African readers used reading and books to resist unjust regimes and build community across South Africa's class and racial barriers.</p>
