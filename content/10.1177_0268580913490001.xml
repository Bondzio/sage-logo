<p>The significance of collective identities has been widely questioned in this age of individualism. However, the difficulty in sustaining collective identities does not mean that a sense of collective belonging has stopped being important. One of the bases on which collective identity may be sustained is in the belonging to a certain territory, expressed locally or regionally, that may contribute to a feeling of sameness. This article reports on a European research project which studied the impact of restructuring on collective identities in six European (former or actual) industrial regions in Spain, France, Germany, Poland, Turkey and the UK, and analysed more than a hundred biographical interviews in the search for narratives of contemporary identity. The findings suggest collective identities take shape and strength through a complex social process to create a sense of belonging and the articulation of the community <italic>us</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The contemporary significance of collective identities has been widely questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580913490001">Beck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580913490001">Clark and Lipset, 1991</xref>). For some, individualism is now dominant in the face of huge changes in industrial structures and communities, while others suggest collective identities remain powerful, but are now largely derived from consumerism and lifestyle or from ethnic origins. The social ‘us’ or ‘we’ and whether and how they emerge are thus both theoretical and empirical problems. Working within a theoretical framework developed from Raymond Williams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580913490001">Kirk, 2007</xref>), and building on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580913490001">Kirk and Wall, 2011</xref>), the late John Kirk initiated an ambitious collaborative study, SPHERE, examining the impact of restructuring on collective identities in six European regions. The cities/regions involved were: South Nuremberg (Germany), Corbeil-Essonnes and Evry (France), Alcoy and Elda (Alicante, Spain), Silesia Voivodship (Poland), South Yorkshire (UK) and Zonguldak (Turkey). Its examination of changing identities in three primarily manufacturing (textiles and leather, engineering, paper and printing) and three primarily current or former coal-producing regions focused directly on the relationships of societies undergoing restructuring to the contemporary articulation and conceptualization of identity. All six regions used to have a strong sense of working-class identity which expressed itself in cultural practices and collective action. SPHERE’s comparative scope enabled both an international theoretical exchange and a full interrogation of the processes of identity formation lived out in significantly different contexts. Our objectives were to better understand what is experienced in common as industrial restructuring takes place, without overlooking the considerable differences that exist, and to contribute more generally to a better understanding of contemporary collective identity.</p>
<p>The individualization thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580913490001">Giddens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580913490001">Habermas, 1988</xref>) considers that in the current post-traditional order our identities have somehow broken free from traditional ties and collective identities are more difficult to sustain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580913490001">Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2001</xref>). This concept of individualization can be criticized as contrasting a notion of highly determined collective identities with freely chosen identities. Even though the individualization theorists did not intend this, it merges into a conception of the self as a self-contained subject (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580913490001">Gergen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580913490001">Hollinger, 1994</xref>), seeking a true identity with total freedom of action and the capacity to transform reality. This notion of ‘the subject’ as an entity with essential characteristics accessible to scientific research (and especially beloved by positivist psychology) has been properly and widely criticized (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580913490001">Sampson, 1989</xref>). The different critiques all coincide in emphasizing the inherently social character of human identity. Yet what are certainly changing are the social bases through and from which people construct their social identities.</p>
<p>The individualization thesis suggests collective identities become more difficult to sustain in the age of individualism. Thus, the study of communities and collective identity and action makes little sense, as only individual affiliations account for social behaviour. However, a common social identity based on sharing several social bases and a collective logic enables the possibility of collective action and the construction of the <italic>us</italic>, as a non-essential but emerging reality of a specific moment in social relationships. Such collective identities are commonly expressed in stories or narratives. Discourses about <italic>us</italic> can highlight these identities through acknowledging the existence of a we-ness whose boundaries are known both to its members and those outside, and the bases on which these collective identities are constructed.</p>
<p>The we-ness of working-class identities has been widely questioned, not only do fewer workers self-identify with a working-class social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580913490001">Emmison and Western, 1990</xref>), but where a defensive collective identity exists it only rarely generates collective actions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580913490001">Beck (2007)</xref> developed the thesis of the weakening of class subjective identity – of a working class <italic>for itself</italic> – effectively reflecting the ‘objective’ disappearance of social classes. Some go further and question the existence of social classes, positing the existence of a ‘classless unequal society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580913490001">Clark and Lipset, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580913490001">Pakulski and Waters, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>While several have countered these arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580913490001">Goldthorpe and Marshall, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580913490001">Heath et al., 2009</xref>), the socioeconomic restructuring of recent decades give such analysis some credibility. Current social inequalities tend not to demarcate highly homogeneous groups in situations of common social difficulty as sharply as in the past. Workers’ class identity is today more diverse, fragmented and permeable. There are now many more occupationally ‘intermediate’ workers working part-time, and/or on low salaries, or in unemployment, as well as growing numbers of migrants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580913490001">Pakulski and Walters (1996)</xref> emphasize how class cultures have fragmented enormously, thus also helping erode cultural homogeneity that enables strong class identities. This suggests that unlike the 19th- and 20th-century global emergence of working classes, of groups who were aware of themselves, and created their own identities and cultures, current social inequalities might not result in the formation of a largely homogeneous and generationally transmitted collective <italic>we</italic> by those experiencing the same types of social difficulty.</p>
<p>However, the difficulty in sustaining a homogeneous working-class identity does not mean that a sense of collective belonging has stopped being important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580913490001">Heath et al. (2009)</xref> have shown that while a long-term decline in the percentage of British workers who identify themselves as working class has indeed set in, this is both not as pronounced as some believe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580913490001">Skeggs, 2004</xref>), and largely compensated for by a stronger sense of class identity developing among non-manual workers. One key set of questions, therefore, is whether the persistence of class feeling is rooted in work, and/or in persistent, and in some countries, increasing structural inequalities; and/or whether, and if so how, workers relate to other social bases to sustain a class identity.</p>
<p>Other bases for collective identity have, of course, always been relevant to people, but perhaps they were not as central as work-based identities in the communities under study. The analysis of working-class communities has often underplayed the aspect of belonging to a certain territory, expressed locally or regionally, that may contribute to a feeling of sameness. Place and the relative open or closed character of the local community in relation to migration and/or neighbouring spaces can interact to potentially strengthen or weaken class identity. As the mobility of people increases, globalization clearly tests these local or regional identities. Nevertheless, territorial identities remain significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580913490001">Braber, 2009</xref>). Partly this is because the historical construction of territorial identities based on cultural elements of different kinds is often actualized through a wide range of different manifestations and rituals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580913490001">Badone, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580913490001">Tovar et al., 2011</xref>). But partly too, this is related to local governance mechanisms, to the political organization of citizenship along geographic lines that coincide with these cultural formations. Places of residence become spaces of citizenship that structure their inhabitants’ actions and may reinforce feelings of belonging.</p>
<p>Of course territorial identity does not preclude the existence of inner divisions within the local community, or that it is contested by some groups of citizens. The presence in the local space of groups with different origins may weaken the possibility of a stronger territorial identity. Yet migrant communities, whose identification with their new ‘nation’ is often problematic, may also find it easier to have a feeling of belonging to a smaller locality or area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580913490001">Wills, 2009</xref>). Ethnic background differences have also been missing in the analysis of traditional communities where the emphasis was normally placed on the sameness produced by working experiences.</p>
<p>To help understand the new interactions of a range of social bases of contemporary identity construction we will therefore now discuss some of the nearly 150 narrative biographical interviews carried out during the SPHERE project between 2009 and 2010. The men and women interviewed lived in six different European regions but had the shared experience of having seen the decline or disappearance of dominant industries that were once the principal social base configuring collective identities. Between 20 and 30 in-depth individual interviews were held in each of the six regions, as well as three to four focus groups and several expert interviews. All age groups were represented among interviewees, and equal numbers of men and women. While the interviewees had different links with the former principal industrial activity (some were workers, ex-workers, workers from other economic sectors, civil servants, retired people and students), they were all local residents. Interviewees were selected in different ways in every region. Contact information was provided by key informers, or with the help of local institutions, organizations or associations. Snowball sampling was then used to get to more potential respondents. A broad interview guideline was thoroughly discussed and agreed by all researchers, including topics like personal history, work, place, identities, culture and change. The aim was to conduct non-directed interviews allowing respondents to discuss freely the interview topics.</p>
<p>Interviews were held in the mother-tongue language, transcribed and first analysed by researchers in each country under a common template that was discussed and agreed at international team meetings. This template permitted the identification of respondents’ discourses on the main sources of identity in each region, whether work-based, civic or political, place-based, ethnic, religious or family, on the understanding that some important sources of identity in one region need not be so in another. This first analysis produced country reports and a large number of English-translated verbatim quotations; the national reports then became the basis for an international comparative report, which was discussed collectively, and ultimately to this article.</p>
<p>In the first section, we describe the old worker communities, as they are perceived in the present. Next, we consider the fragmentation of the old communities and the emergence of new (fragmented) identities. Lastly, we analyse the territorial bases of the new collective identities appearing in the six regions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0268580913490001">
<title>The way we were: The good old days of strong community identities</title>
<p>Many of our interviewees formulate a general but complex feeling of nostalgia for former times. This is often a feeling of longing for a return to relative economic prosperity. Salaries had been comparatively high and had often attracted workers from other regions or countries. The identity expressed on this register is not of a more or less marginalized underclass, but instead refers to a collective of workers who feel different from both the middle class and the poor:<disp-quote>
<p>… they have all come to work, to try to have a family, a car, a home … well here they could live well, you could have your luxuries and your treats. (Elda, man, focus group)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A second important narrative stresses the feeling of solidarity among the members of a local community that sees itself as homogeneous with reference to living and working conditions and as very different to other communities or social groups. This was particularly acute in coal-mining areas:<disp-quote>
<p>I work in the coal mine, my neighbour works in the coal mine, so we both know what kind of work it is and we may not be talking about it … but I know he has to work really hard to earn a living as much as I do. (Silesia Voivodship, man, 32)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This feeling of solidarity is at its height when physical dependence on colleagues at work is extended to social life outside:<disp-quote>
<p>We did help each other out – it’s what we all did. Sort of unwritten. You knew who your neighbours were more then. And if something goes wrong you’d be helping each other out all the time. I suppose to a certain extent, because we were all living so close together. (South Yorkshire, man, 68)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Much of former worker community solidarity became rooted through the experience of living in the same residential areas. Indeed, in nearly all the regions researched, large publicly and privately owned organizations implemented housing construction programmes for their workers. This was especially true of South Yorkshire, the Silesia Voivodship, South Nuremberg and Corbeil-Essonnes. In others there was more worker involvement, especially in the Spanish towns of Elda and Alcoy (where the trade unions were involved until their participation was taken over by the state under the Franco dictatorship) and in Nuremberg (where employee cooperatives existed).</p>
<p>But industrial paternalism extended beyond housing. Companies organized or helped shape workers’ leisure time with financial resources (holidays, day trips, cultural events, sports facilities), provided food at low prices via supermarkets or warehouses and education through training for employees and schools for their children:<disp-quote>
<p>We did nearly all our shopping at the Darblay Cooperative. There, workers didn’t pay anything. They had a slate, and their purchases were taken out of their salary. Having said that, we didn’t buy very much there, because Darblay had given allotments to each family so each had a garden. (Corbeil-Essonnes, man, 71)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the inherent authoritarianism of paternalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580913490001">Padavic and Earnest, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580913490001">Reid, 1985</xref>), all these practices helped create the right conditions for a stable collective identity, facilitating the existence of a community of experiences, not only in working hours, but also in other spaces of social relationships. The companies’ intentions were to encourage workers to identify more with their work. Paradoxically, therefore, we can partly understand collective worker identity as an unintended consequence of industrial paternalism which provided some ideal conditions for a strong sense of community.</p>
<p>However, the perceived homogeneity of the old communities is also based on the metonymic process by which certain male industrial workers came to represent the entire community. In mining communities, for instance, this is underground workers, whose ethos is significantly different to pithead workers. But the main collective whose contributions to community identities are invisible is made up of women. In many of our regions, while women were undertaking paid work it was always seen as subordinate to the jobs the men did. The women in Alcoy, South Yorkshire and Zonguldak worked in textile factories, the women in Elda performed parts of the shoemaking process, the wives of the miners in Zonguldak also worked the land, while women in South Nuremberg and Corbeil-Essonnes and Evry also worked in industry or the services sector. Within the memories of our older interviewees women working was looked upon favourably before marriage, but once married they were expected to dedicate their time to domestic chores. A married woman working was almost synonymous with the man’s inability to provide the necessary means for his family to subsist:<disp-quote>
<p>My mother didn’t have to go to work. He [Father] said: A woman doesn’t work. She has to be at home to raise the children, to do the housekeeping and that’s it. (South Nuremberg, woman, 44)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This invisibilization process also occurred to all those in the region who did not work in the dominant industrial sector or to all workers that did not belong to the dominant ethnic identity, which is most evident in Silesia (Poles vs Silesians) and South Yorkshire (English vs migrants), but somehow too in Elda and Corbeil-Essonnes (locals vs national migrants). As a result elite male workers in the dominant industry and from the dominant ethnic group came to metonymically represent the entire community, producing a feeling of homogeneity which is largely imagined, in both Anderson’s sense of imagined communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580913490001">1991</xref>), and Castoriadis’s imaginary concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580913490001">1975</xref>).</p>
<p>This feeling of homogeneity, even if partially imaginary, was nonetheless sustained by the presence of a large number of workers employed under similar working conditions, by their quite close residential coexistence, as well as by a wider society that itself was less socially and geographically heterogeneous than today’s. And while this feeling was once, to use Raymond Williams’s framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580913490001">2005</xref>: 37–38), a locally ‘dominant’ ideological structure of consciousness, even today the echoes of homogeneity and collective identity remain present as ‘residual’ feelings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0268580913490001">
<title>The fragmentation of working-class communities</title>
<p>However, this collective identity is experienced as something past; it no longer exists as it was. The current situation described by our interviewees is of gradual disintegration of worker communities, and of the gradual individualization of social relationships:<disp-quote>
<p>… now everybody is on their own. … In former times, the older workers looked after the young ones. They passed on their knowledge. They looked after those that needed help and support. … It was like a family. But it is getting lost. It is lost. The employees are always changing. … Save yourself if you can. (South Nuremberg, man, 62)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Differences within the former homogeneous worker community are expressed in terms of consumption capacity, in the income each family unit obtains and its purchasing power. However, the transformations go far beyond that in the direction of weakening existing community solidarity, and, as a result, undermining collective identities. The resulting fragmentation covers feelings about work, the local community, political affiliations and family ties.</p>
<sec id="section4-0268580913490001">
<title>Fragmentation of work experiences</title>
<p>Fragmentation follows transformations in the production framework and in labour markets. While there has always been differentiation within the working class, this becomes more pronounced with the expansion of more highly qualified positions in newer industries that employ fewer workers in smaller workplaces. This trend appears in South Nuremberg and Corbeil-Essonnes and Evry. At the same time, the crisis of the heavy and metal-working industries has led to rising unemployment and a decline in life opportunities especially for the many migrants who had initially moved to work in these industries.</p>
<p>Mono-industry cultures have also given way to multiple sectors of activity, introducing a greater variety of work experiences, trade cultures, employment contract situations and working conditions. Management styles become more impersonal while company mergers and acquisitions further distance senior management from the local territory where the work takes place. The volume and pace of work both increase.</p>
<p>Women, too, are massively integrated in these new labour markets. At the same time as the number of jobs decreased in traditional industries, others appeared for which women are the preferred choice. In both Silesia Voivodship and South Yorkshire, the men especially resent this situation and the household economy seems to increasingly depend on women’s contributions, partly because of men’s objective difficulties in finding work, and partly their finding it difficult to adapt to tasks that lack the traditional industrial culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0268580913490001">
<title>Fragmentation of local communities</title>
<p>Worker districts have changed. They now include other social groups than the original industrial workers. In some cases, flats constructed by the paternalist large company have been converted into social housing where the public authorities have placed the most disadvantaged and migrants – often to the dismay of the older residents:<disp-quote>
<p>Everybody knows Kaufhaus has always had a bad reputation … because they sent this riff raff from all over Ruda Sląska. (Silesia Voivodship, woman, 65)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But even where companies sell their houses to their employees, when the former employees eventually sell these homes they are then often acquired by different collectives, workers from other companies or sectors, or by non-national migrants:<disp-quote>
<p>There was an office and they sold the apartments to everybody who gave them money, regardless of who gave the money. … It is now like a Turkish village. … And they have different habits and everybody has been afraid of this. … Those who were able took an apartment somewhere else. (South Nuremberg, woman, 58)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The experiences of integrating migrants who arrive in times of prosperity (when internal migration is more common) are much less conflictual than when migrants come from other countries and arrive in more difficult times. Our interviewees reported a sense of social distance between the native populations and migrants in the Silesia Voivodship and in Elda and Alcoy:<disp-quote>
<p>But Frater [district] is full of South Americans, Moors and everything. And it’s filling up with that kind of people more and more. … They were full of us people from here, and now they are full of Moors, Colombians … people like that. (Elda, man, focus group discussion)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There was an even stronger sense of segmentation and difference in Corbeil-Essonnes and Evry, South Yorkshire and Zonguldak, but in South Nuremberg, where the extreme right had politically made ground, several interviewees expressed feelings of still greater hostility and even of racism.</p>
<p>The weaker structuring role of the local community in confirming social identity also reflects the disembedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580913490001">Giddens, 1991</xref>) of social relations from the places of residence. The availability of public and private transport facilitates possibilities of establishing friendly relations with people who do not live locally, and of enjoying leisure moments in other localities:<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I work in the call centre at Ventura – I’ve got a lot of friends there. We see each other outside work but not a lot because of the cost of going anywhere. Yea, I’m from the Dearne, we drink local but go to the clubs in Sheffield when we can. (South Yorkshire, man, 26)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0268580913490001">
<title>Fragmentation of affiliations</title>
<p>Trade union and political affiliations have also evolved. In all our regions workers mobilized collectively around leftist parties and their trade unions, sometimes seeing this as a part of a working-class identity. The trade unions represented the workers against management, and the leftist party against the country’s wealthy elites:<disp-quote>
<p>We grew up with ‘us and them’ didn’t we? It were Tories and Labour, it was ‘us and them’. It was the unions and the management. It were never ‘all together’, so that community it was ‘us and them’. (South Yorkshire, man 53)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Across the six regions the commitment and support for trade unions vary, but their importance becomes clear when ‘normal’ periods are interrupted by massive strikes:<disp-quote>
<p>Sorry, I get a little bit emotional when I think of that period. The mayor set up a campaign for assistance. … We were walking on the pavements, wrapped in blankets. People gave us food … when I remember that period … (<italic>cries</italic>). (Zonguldak, man, 52)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the contemporary image of trade unions is more complex. In some regions they predominantly provide services – to legitimize their actions and their role in face of increasing disengagement:<disp-quote>
<p>If there is something, the union helps you always. You have the security that you can ask them. They have great service benefits. Every year I let them fill in the forms for my tax return. (South Nuremberg, man, 56)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet the unions’ difficulties in dealing with the specifics of local industrial restructuring and work intensification is often criticized:<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, they [trade unions] promise a lot, but then they leave you on your own. You’re all alone and … At least in this area people are very unhappy with the trade unions, but really unhappy. (Elda, young man, focus group)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The trade unions remain important as political actors in national politics, in processes of general collective bargaining or shaping social policies or as instigators of demonstrations and general strikes against public expenditure cuts. Yet this role is somehow further removed from people’s experiences than when local strikes and an active local union presence contributed more to the social imagining in these regions.</p>
<p>The previously mainly left-wing political identity of worker areas has also started to fracture. In Poland opposition to the Communist dictatorship was expressed through a Catholic conservative tradition embodied in the Solidarity trade union, and this and the negative experience of Communism has made identification with the left very rare among younger workers. But in Silesia Voivodship the privileges given to some of the workers under the Communist regime are still remembered by many older voters and in Zagłębie as a result:<disp-quote>
<p>Actually here the Democratic Left Alliance … always wins … always the left-wing. Others had no chance of winning … it’s because of the fact that these old people owe so much to Communist rule. (Silesia Voivodship, woman, 42)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In South Yorkshire residual loyalties to the traditional left-wing parties also remain. A majority of workers in the area continue to vote Labour, which is an important sign of the continuity of a strong worker identity:<disp-quote>
<p>But then I look at the good things that the Labour Party have done. I look at some of the initiatives and some of the schemes, and I just remember Thatcher. And I just now see Cameron and now if I want to ever question why I belong in the Labour Party, I just think of Cameron. (South Yorkshire, man, 46)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But some workers in South Yorkshire (like some in South Nuremberg) have expressed support for parties of the extreme right:<disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s changed a lot in that they used to call this area ‘the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire’ when the union were in its heyday. … Then these people go out to the pubs and clubs and they sit there all day and they read The Daily Star and whatever. … I find it abhorrent that the BNP are actually making inroads in my town, just makes me want to throw up in all honesty. (South Yorkshire, man, 55)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the Alcoy local elections of 22 May 2011, unlike in Elda and elsewhere in Spain where the outgoing Socialist government was punished by voters, a left-wing local coalition administration was elected for the first time in eight years. This left-wing tradition also exists in Zonguldak, where it not only represents the thinking of the traditional industrial workers, but also intellectuals and professionals who identify with the legacy of Atatürk as the representative of a secular and modernizing state of Turkish society. But in Turkey this worker tradition has lost ground to political Islam, represented by the party currently in government (Justice and Development Party).</p>

<title>Fragmentation of family</title>
<p>Extended family units have also experienced fragmentation. Former resilient family identities, embedded in living in the same or close neighbourhoods and in a community of gender-segregated work, have weakened. Feelings of home and locality were frequently brought up by our interviewees:<disp-quote>
<p>People would live together in one place, including grandmother or grandfather, aunt or uncle, with all relatives actually. (Silesia Voivodship, man, 54)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sons and daughters also used to reproduce their parents’ working activities. In this way family–work boundaries were configured to mutually shape the wider working-class ethos:<disp-quote>
<p>He were a miner and all me uncles were miners, me older brother were a miner. It were just inbred in the family. All me mum’s side of the family, most of them were in the mining industry too. … There were a massive family influence if you like at that pit. (South Yorkshire, man, 64)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ‘automatic’ reproduction was sometimes challenged, either by the parents, who might prefer their children not to go into industrial work, or by the children, who resisted, or at least resented, their being ascribed to a certain profession and thus to a family and class identity:<disp-quote>
<p>We were always brought up in the way that we’re working class, as soon as we finish school we should work. … and it’s only now that I’ve realized that we don’t have to stop being working class, do we, we can better ourselves you know. (South Yorkshire, woman, 45)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The old traditional family order could be rather oppressive to those who would not adjust to it, not only in terms of vocational choice, but also in terms of gender segregation:<disp-quote>
<p>I was raised in the ‘Italian way’, but really as an Italian girl, let’s say in a gilded cage. … And they expected the same from me. My brother, they suggested he should study, and made things easy for him, while I had to struggle to get there. … And they tried to keep me in a mould and I couldn’t get out. (Corbeil-Essonnes, woman, 46)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the notion of family and kinship remains strong. Even if the family is today often more divided in terms of space, due to regional or local dispersion or due to migration, it is still important for many to have a close relationship to other members of the core family, although family relationships are now often presented on a time base, by the amount of regular contacts per week or in the month or per year:<disp-quote>
<p>I came by three or four times per week to my mother in her apartment. I asked her ‘do you need something?’ Our contact has never broken up. It is still important for me that this is the same with my family today, the contact to my son. (South Nuremberg, woman, 58)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The importance of the family is also seen in the way people build vivid family narratives, seeing their history as part of a family tradition, their relationships with the other members of the family, and the differences among them:<disp-quote>
<p>My biological history is that my family roots on my mum’s side were from a coal-mining family in Seaham Harbour and I’ve been able to be in touch with members of that family and meet cousins and find out about the history of that place which of course was entirely a mining history. … I went to find out about my birth family, just was so amazing for me in terms of finally being able to feel that I could belong to the Dearne Valley. (South Yorkshire, woman, 42)</p>

<title>Shared identities</title>
<p>There is considerably greater heterogeneity than before in terms of work experiences, community involvement, ethnic identities, household structures, lifestyles and consumption possibilities. Yet while communities have clearly experienced a form of fragmentation that limits both their capacity to reproduce the earlier collective identities and to create new ones, it does not make this impossible.</p>
<p>What, then, are any common possible grounds for establishing collective identities in the regions under study? Among our interviewees there were many narratives about belonging. In some regions the discourse was negative – people didn’t ‘belong’ to <italic>this</italic> space; in others, it was positive – people did ‘belong’, but in different ways. The local or regional <italic>us</italic> cropped up easily and as meaning something shared.</p>
<p>This continuing collective identity can emerge from a shared belonging to an institutionalized political and territorial space in the neighbourhood, town or region. It confers a potential common identity on all the citizens, particularly when people participate civically and equally in the social space. It separates them from inhabitants in other places. Shared participation in common organizations and activities within a defined, bounded space has an even greater relevance for identity processes than does political engagement.</p>
<p>In Alcoy and Elda territorial identity benefited from the two cities being spaces of political representation. The two local governments act and account for their management to citizens. Most of the time people are highly critical of local politicians, as is to be expected in the context of an employment crisis; but even their shared criticisms confirm the role the local political arena plays in reinforcing a local identity:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think the city council was interested, as far as I can see, because … in the 1960s or sixty-something, the factories couldn’t expand any more because they were between rivers and no one bothered to build an industrial estate and many factories left Alcoy. (Alcoy, man, 63)</p>
<p>There are good plans for the city, but they have to be implemented. The same government was in charge for a long time, and I think that isn’t very good for a city, naturally with the same party. (Elda, woman, 35)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However the field of politics is a scenario for party confrontation, which stresses the formation of groups with differentiated interests or ideologies. For a local community to express a local <italic>us</italic> identity requires more unified demonstrations of closeness, where there is a feeling of common belonging to a collective. This role can be played by local festivals, especially when they are as important as the <italic>Moors and Christians</italic> festivals of Alcoy and Elda.</p>
<p>In both towns many people participate in the preparations and celebrations of these festivals, thus creating a close network of social relations. Participation in this social network provides an opportunity to transform this sense of belonging into structured everyday practices, which reinforce these collective bonds and are an impressive example of collective identity. During a recession, these celebrations and the social bonds involved may strengthen intentions to stay in the city when economic prospects are not good. Consequently, festivals can act as an identity anchor, or an element of cohesion and collective identification. Involvement in the festivities becomes, then, a symbol of the sense of belonging for the city. Inversely, not participating becomes a symbol of a distance between the self and the city, that can be expressed in a range between a simple relativization, an ironic stance towards city traditions, and a major rejection and estrangement, usually related to a negative assessment of the chances the city offers:<disp-quote>
<p>I have a great friend, who I’ve known since I arrived in Elda who took part, and I was struck by the photos I saw in her home. She taught me the music, she taught me how to dance, she showed me her boots with bells, full skirts with petticoats … and then every year I[’d say] … Dad, let’s stay here to see the festivals! And my father said to me: I have five days to rest, come on, let’s get out of here! (Elda, woman, 35)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The local identity in the region of Corbeil-Essonnes and Evry is just as strong, as it is undoubtedly in many parts of France, connected with a political organization where the mayor and the municipal government are important for the welfare of their citizens. The position Corbeil-Essonnes and Evry have between Paris and the rest of France seems to be one of the main factors giving stability to the people living there. The closeness of the capital offers an access to a particularly diversified and open labour market, with significant career possibilities. Paris’s cultural dynamism is also really appreciated. On the other hand, the region has a large labour market of its own to work or even to build a career there. In addition, housing is much more affordable than in Paris and in the towns of the inner suburbs. Finally, the proximity of large forests and rural areas offers a wider range of leisure possibilities than in the capital. The issue of transport was a recurrent one in the interviews, showing a community marked by the problems created by daily commuting:<disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps if there was a really great publisher at Corbeil-Essonnes I would have a much better quality of life. It is tough, all the same. Me I spend nearly four hours a day on the train. … I’m not going to leave Corbeil. We love Corbeil. It’s got a village side to it that we really like, and we love the town centre. You feel good here. It’s nicely close enough to Paris, and at the same time on the other side, there’s the country. (Corbeil-Essonnes, woman, 36)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The importance of local identity is sufficiently intense to lead to discursive clashes, rather ritualistic in nature, between the most important municipalities in the region. People often expressed an attachment to or, the opposite, a repulsion for certain parts of the area. It is still possible to see examples of historical rivalries between the communes of Corbeil and Essonnes (which were merged in 1951). While Corbeil was the main centre of attraction for people in the region, this was challenged from the 1960s with the creation of the new town of Evry, and its being made the principal administrative centre of the new Essonne Department. At that moment, Evry represented the town of the future and a space of social experimentation. An important rivalry then emerged between the local governments of the two towns, which was not necessarily reflected among the inhabitants.</p>
<p>This local identity is challenged by the fact that, as a suburban area, this region is continually receiving migrants from other French regions, from other European countries and from many non-European countries. There is a perception that the integration of immigrants was easier before than it is now, so the social discourse travels between appreciation of the diversity of the population as a value in itself, and the rejection of certain groups of immigrants who live in districts that have lost their social prestige and have become socially isolated from the rest of the city:<disp-quote>
<p>So you can see we’ve got such a mixed-up group of people and things, and, like, I find that that is a real source of wealth for the town of Evry, yes. (Evry, woman, 44)</p>
<p>Well, but what we saw, we witnessed the arrival of life in a ‘suburban ghetto’ area. In fact, when I was small, we didn’t live in a ‘suburban ghetto’. Today it’s nothing but a rough housing scheme. The Tarterets at the time wasn’t, now it is. (Corbeil-Essonnes, woman, 58)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Upper Silesia, the region provides a significant unit to reinforce respondents’ identities. Sometimes it is even more important because the <italic>voivodship</italic> is totally interwoven with the biographies of the respondents, who did not go abroad in search of a better life after all. It particularly concerns the inhabitants who might have easily migrated to Germany due to their family ties. Thus, region becomes especially close and important:<disp-quote>
<p>It may seem an ordinary place, but it certainly has something that attracts you. … But one identifies, at least I do, with this place. And you identify the place with people because one is usually surrounded by other people, people you respect, like. If you don’t like somebody you automatically cut off from them. But there are some disadvantages of the whole place. Ruda or Silesia, yes there are … (Silesia Voivodship, man, 32)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Obviously, for the respondents who identify themselves as Silesians, the region has a double significance: as a geographical and a cultural space, in which even the distinct dialect (Silesian dialect) emphasizes the uniqueness of the inhabitants. In the Zagłębie part of the region, it looks a bit different because there is not this cultural difference from the rest of the country. It does not mean that the identification with the place is less. In this case the most important thing is the nearest surroundings: the flat, block or own house, own estate, road to work, etc. When asked to draw a mental map, they often start drawing places connected with work or residence. Then in the background the respondents indicate the whole region. For this reason both groups of respondents show an important, albeit different, identification with the territory.</p>
<p>Local identity in South Yorkshire is perhaps the closest of all to a class identity, which is expressed in the population’s widespread feeling of class, as well as in their voting behaviour, still mainly for the Labour Party in South Yorkshire in the 2010 elections. The class identity is based on the prejudice they believe they suffer when looking for employment, and in the power relationships they are exposed to. This is reflected in local social and political life, for example in new social movements arising in the region, and which, although they are not directly connected with this class identity, include ideas that are usually associated with the political left, such as the defence of asylum and of immigrants’ rights, defence of public employment and even of the environment.</p>
<p>The experience of locality is closely connected with the various districts, which are mainly worker districts, where the majority of the population lives, and which are a source of micro-identities with a major significance for the population:<disp-quote>
<p>There are three big estates here in the village. Oldham runs into Wilsden, runs into Copeland Road, that’s it.</p>
<p>I’m from Roebuck Street estate, so they’re all close together but they are different. They’re like zones. Maybe different games yes, but once you go to secondary school you all became the same. But when I were younger, it used to be all different. … And you came from this one or that one – and we’d have football and all sorts. (South Yorkshire, focus group)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Zonguldak a local identity is more typical of the middle class who live in the city permanently, unlike the majority of the miners, who come from the country, and whose original locality is their identity reference. Middle-class residents and professionals express positive sentiments about Zonguldak and are more interested in the fate of the city. On the other hand, those workers who still have ties with their villages, or those who are recent immigrants, do not have a particularly strong attachment to the city, and mention work as the only thing that ties them to Zonguldak. The majority of the underground workers have come from rural areas; they are working in Zonguldak without becoming part of the City of Zonguldak. Their loyalty lies in their villages and point of origin. They define their community around their villages and fellow villagers. The company knows the villages well and hire underground workers through determining quotas for each village, a practice that works to strengthen the village community in workplace-related issues. Indeed, the absence of a strong local identity is one of the problems mentioned most frequently by middle-class interviewees. They complain that people cannot come together because there is no consciousness about being from Zonguldak in the city and the province, and people still consider the places that their parents or grandparents came from as their home town.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In all six regions apparently homogeneous industrial communities have given way to more heterogeneous ones. Yet at the same time, our findings point to a common search for a collective identity through a belonging to a place and space. The individualization thesis is thus misleading. In part this is because it exaggerates the independence of individuals nowadays. While 21st-century society offers more possibilities of choice to individuals, and identities are more elective than before, it does not mean that social restrictions and social structure no longer exist. Nor does it mean that these elective identities do not configure shared identities, susceptible to become the basis for collective action.</p>
<p>In part, the interpretation of changes in terms of progressive individualization also neglects the fact that even in earlier times of stronger community identities, they were not as homogeneous as is usually portrayed. Significant social cleavages were often concealed by a strong, male industrial identity. What was only a component of the whole, a particular type of skilled male industrial worker, was taken to represent the entire community, with women, agricultural, service and other industrial workers simply excluded. Without this metonymic process, the appearance and <italic>we</italic> discourse of a strong collective community would have been much less vibrant.</p>
<p>Of course, today’s local communities are differently fragmented. But analysis of our six regions shows that social cleavages are not only different, but also deeper. Thus the numbers of workers working for the same company and workplace size have generally fallen. Yet as this has happened, the ‘hour-glass’ labour market, the differentiation between the skilled and professional workers higher up and the very low qualified service workers lower down, has actually widened. Local living is also generally different than before. Workers used to live nearer each other in work-related housing, whose neighbourhoods were often the centre of social life. Company housing also used to provide an opportunity for the integration of newcomers via close contact with native workers at home and at work. But the private car, social housing shortages and the disarticulation of workers’ districts through employers disengaging from paternalist housing schemes have created new dynamics. Local-origin workers have migrated away from dependent housing; while new migrant communities have tended to replace them. Whereas migrants in the 1960s and 1970s tended to come from neighbouring regions or countries or from former colonies, in the 21st century migration has become fully global and extremely internally diverse. This evolution has increased tensions between local and migrant workers.</p>
<p>In this situation, metonymy is no longer possible, as the dominant group is much less representative of the whole. At the same time this kind of hegemony (white and male) has been contested all over the world, with a growing trend towards acknowledging minority groups. This development too involves the collective definition of minority groups and a change in beliefs about the representation of the community as a whole.</p>
<p>This article has thus confirmed that collective identities require a complex social process to take shape and strength, and in this sense they are unstable by nature. The fact of belonging to a place, however, remains strong, even while the meanings of this belonging evolve, and the people and groups who can be considered part of the community are also continuously changing. Our study shows this sense of belonging can be the source for a collective identity, for the articulation of a community <italic>us</italic> that can include collective action, the main ingredient of a collective identity. There are, clearly, potentially negative aspects of the emergence of these place-based collective identities from the ruins of a restructured industrial past. The main risk is parochialism, the excessive identification with one’s own <italic>place</italic> at the expense of the appreciation of people from other streets/neighbourhoods/cities. This is most likely when the collective identity is too narrowly defined, by micro community and/or by age and ethnicity, creating a high level of homogeneity. This context of sometimes intense local homogeneity coexisting with the fragmentation of work identities poses significant but not insurmountable challenges to the creation of stronger shared identities between the different groups of citizens, a necessary condition for the appearance of an emergent culture that can effectively challenge the dominant.</p>
