<abstract>
<p>Tensions have been rising between physicians and patients in China recently. More and more Chinese medical professionals are being hurt or even killed by patients. There are many complicated reasons for the frequent violence in Chinese hospitals; this guideline is not intended to solve the problem but attempts to provide a practical way to prevent and handle violence in the workplace. This guideline consists of 3 parts: violence prevention, violence handling, and postviolence management.</p>

<p>According to incomplete statistics, 11 medical professionals have been killed by patients or their relatives over the past 10 years in China, and more than 5000 were wounded in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612453194">1</xref></sup> Tensions have been rising between physicians and patients in China, which has resulted in the annualized doubling of vicious violence at hospitals in China every year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612453194">2</xref></sup> The authors created this guideline for preventing violence at hospitals in China to serve as a reference for Chinese health care providers, to maintain order in the medical environment, to ensure the physical and mental well-being of health care providers, as well as to facilitate the smooth development of China’s health care reform.</p>
<p>This guideline consists of 3 parts that address issues found at different stages of violent encounters: violence prevention, violence handling, and postviolence management.</p>
<sec id="section1-1062860612453194">
<title>Violence Prevention</title>
<p>Violence prevention is a series of preventive measures and plans that aim to detect and reduce risk factors. Violence prevention can stop potential workplace violence and is deemed to be the most effective way to prevent workplace violence.</p>
<p>Violence prevention strategies include improving physician–patient communication skills and having preventive measures and plans.</p>
<sec id="section2-1062860612453194">
<title>Improve Physician–Patient Communication Skills</title>
<list id="list1-1062860612453194" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Provide training for all medical staff to improve their communication skills with patients. Establish a standardized service language. When conditions allow, acknowledge the best service employees as workplace models to encourage the overall improvement of physician–patient communication.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Through physician–patient communication, patients should be able to have a timely and accurate understanding of their conditions, and thus remain positive participants in their treatment. Communicate the conditions and diagnosis to the patient’s family as soon as possible. It is important to start communicating with the patient’s family early and to maintain that communication. It is of special importance to inform families of possible outcomes and risks repeatedly so that they may prepare themselves, especially when the patient’s condition could deteriorate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Deliver and reinforce patient education. The authors suggest conducting an information session before surgery, during which patients and their families can be educated thoroughly about the possible prognosis and the potential for any ensuing complications. The current practice of providing an oversimplified explanation before having the patient sign the consent form must be changed. The authors suggest that hospitals create an independent department that specializes in patient education. Patients and their families must be informed of the current state of medical science and realize that a cure may not be possible for a patient’s particular disease. Our medical science is progressing; however, medical miracles should be deemphasized.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pay attention to improving your language skills, tone, and civility. Understand the impact of your language on the patient; adjust your words and tone as needed. Whether you are quite confident that the patient can be successfully treated or you expect a very poor therapeutic outcome, avoid using definitive expressions when communicating with patients and their families. Apply the same rules to patients introduced by your acquaintances, friends, relatives, or colleagues. Be aware of how you communicate and adjust your communication as needed to suit each patient. Developing a good “bedside manner” is key to your success. Empathy can be a significant help to a patient as he/she proceeds down the pathway to recovery or finality.</p></list-item>

<title>Preventive Measures and Plans</title>
<list id="list2-1062860612453194" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Be sensitive to crisis. Once a dispute or argument occurs, realize that it can progress to a medical disturbance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>During working hours, personnel not involved in ongoing care must not be admitted to clinics and wards. To limit the disturbance of patients as they convalesce, only 2 health care workers should care for a patient at a given time. All other personnel must obtain permission from a physician on duty to enter wards and clinics.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An emergency alarm button should be installed under the desks in every clinic and office room. In an emergency, pushing the alarm button will notify hospital security or the local police. These emergency devices should be as available and as common as fire alarms and should be inspected regularly to ensure that they will function properly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Avoid being alone in a room when on duty. Avoid leaning your back against the door.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Exercise regularly. Wear lightweight sports shoes when on duty.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>New employees should be familiar with the working environment and exits. All medical staff should be familiar with evacuation routes and instructions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Have the telephone numbers for hospital security and the police in speed dial on your mobile phone. SOS-SMS also can be drafted in advance and set for mass sending during an emergency.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If possible, carry a personal identification card that contains vital information (eg, your blood type) or add that information to the hospital information system for medical staff.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The logistic department of the hospital should inspect security cameras and storage devices regularly. If possible, use wide-angle high-definition cameras.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pay special attention to stairs, corridors, and underground parking lots where security is not generally present.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Set up safety rooms in concentrated regions of clinics and wards. The safety room can be used as a utility room or a resting room and can be turned into a safety shelter during an emergency. The door and lock of the safety room should provide a higher level of protection.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Medical facilities can require an in-hospital police station or establish an in-house security force.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The authors suggest that hospitals purchase high-value personal accident insurance for every frontline medical and security staff member.</p></list-item>

<title>Violence Handling</title>
<p>When handling a violent situation in the workplace, medical staff must make reasonable, lawful, safe, and effective decisions to protect themselves as well as their property. The most important thing to do in a violent situation is to retreat from the scene as soon as possible and avoid any injury.</p>
<p>Violence handling strategies include the following:</p>
<list id="list3-1062860612453194" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Stay calm and rational when a dispute occurs. When dealing with a misunderstanding regarding a patient, explain patiently; show sympathy and empathy toward the patient as well as his/her family. Try to reach a mutual understanding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When facing unreasonable, unruly, or irrational patients, explain slowly, clearly, and patiently in order to communicate with him/her effectively. Establish physical space between the 2 sides in conflict in order to calm the heated situation, and report the situation to the management level in a timely fashion. Ask the people involved to leave the scene or invite them into an office to discuss the situation calmly. Listen patiently and attentively to the patient’s complaints and try to calm him/her. Be careful to communicate considerately with the patient so as to not inflame or intensify the conflict. Calm voices and manners prevail.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the conflict intensifies and becomes out of control, report this immediately to the police and the security department within the hospital. Encourage eyewitnesses or those involved in the situation to make a report to the police and/or security department as well.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Protect yourself. Physicians in a conflict can use nearby objects for self-defense. For example, the steel medical record clip can be used to ward off stabbing and cutting; the traditional white coat can be wound around the hand or forearm to ward off blunt or sharp injuries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If you are able to or if there is time to do so, remove your white coat, join any crowd that has gathered, and leave the scene quickly to avoid being hurt. It is important to notify authorities immediately if the perpetrator is still within the medical facility.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When conditions allow, help each other and retreat from the scene as soon as possible or retreat to the safety room.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When you are safe, report to a supervisor immediately and make arrangements with the hospital to prepare operating rooms for those injured during the conflict as well as to ready the blood supply for incoming victims of the violence.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If you are surrounded and do not see any possible conflict resolution or way out and you feel your life is in danger, defend yourself in any way at your disposal.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When trying to exit an attack or disturbance, pay attention to secondary injuries that can be caused by accessories (eg, eyeglasses, necklaces, rings). Many Chinese medical staff wear eyeglasses. Thus, it is very important to keep a safe distance from the disturbance to avoid secondary injuries caused by debris from extraneous objects.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section5-1062860612453194">
<title>Postviolence Management</title>
<p>Various measures should be taken after violence has occurred in a medical facility. Examples of postviolence management are protecting the scene, securing evidence, reducing further losses, accumulating experience, and learning lessons from these grave events.</p>
<p>Postviolence management strategies include the following:</p>
<list id="list4-1062860612453194" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Send injured medical staff, security staff, patients, and their families for treatment immediately.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Legal professionals who are familiar with crisis management and/or criminal law should be recruited to work in the hospital’s medical service department. These persons will obtain evidence in a timely fashion, following legal guidelines, as well as protect the rights of the physicians. When conditions allow, the hospital can establish an independent department of legal affairs and recruit professional attorneys.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cooperate actively with the police to secure the evidence, save photos of the scene and injuries, save security videos, and inform law enforcement of any possible witnesses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Psychological treatment should be provided for involved medical staff and security staff. A support system should be made available for individuals who are traumatized.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>So as not to influence legal procedures, the hospital should urge the police department to choose an appropriate time to disclose information about the incident to the public through various media channels. The spokesperson of the hospital or the person responsible for publicity should be able to manage any crisis in terms of maintaining active communication with the media and ensuring that messages released to the public are timely and accurately.</p></list-item>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>There is no doubt that there are other reasons for the frequent violence at medical facilities. Although there are no quick solutions to improving the greater environment, we hope this guideline will be a valuable resource to medical professionals and will be used to prevent or handle violence in the workplace and assist in postviolence management, thus preventing unnecessary loss of lives and property.</p>
