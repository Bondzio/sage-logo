<body>
<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>A few months ago I wrote “the authors will go to the website by typing <bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jen">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jen</ext-link></bold>”.</p>
<p><bold>Jen</bold> is the internal name of this journal because we had the building enclosure in the previous title. Yet, this journal is about enclosure, energy and environment, so the name <bold>Jen</bold> is very appropriate. We now upload paper to the collection site. But the site is not free from quirks. I, for one, could not operate this software, until I learned that one must allow pop-ups on this system.</p>
<p>If, however, you still have a problem with the uploading to the site, you may use the simple, traditional way of sending the manuscript directly to me (no hard copy). Yet, you must send it on two addresses: <email>mark.bomberg@gmail.com</email> and <email>mark.bomberg@ymail.com</email> (G in the e-mail stays for Google, and since foreigners are not allowed to use Google in China, when I teach in China I must use “ymail” for Yahoo).</p>
<p><italic>Journal of Building Physics</italic> welcomes a new member of the editorial board, Dr. Andreas Nicolai.</p>

<p>Since 2008 he is a Head of Software Development and Education Center and postdoctoral researcher at Institute of Building Climatology, Dresden University of Technology. He graduated in 2007 with honors after 4 years of PhD study at KU Leuven, Belgium and Syracuse University, NY. Before this, he was research assistant at the Institute of Building Physics, TU Dresden, Germany and student at the Institute of Engineering Mechanics, TU Dresden, Germany.</p>
<p>During his 6 years of study at civil engineering of TU Dresden, and University of Nottingham, UK (Erasmus exchange program) in addition to the structural engineering, engineering design and building physics he also learned about object-oriented data structures (BIM) in integrated structural design software and received awards from Syracuse University and ASHRAE.</p>
<p><italic>Journal of Building Physics</italic> will also co-sponsor the BEST Four Conference: <bold><italic>“PERFORMANCE DRIVEN ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN”</italic></bold></p>

<p>April 12–15, 2015 in Kansas City</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Abstracts of papers to be considered for the Building Enclosure Science and Technology Conference (BEST 4) hosted by the Kansas City Building Enclosure Council (BEC-Kansas City) are now being accepted. Papers addressing issues that you consider important for new or existing buildings are requested. Abstracts should be uploaded to <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ProposalSpace.com">ProposalSpace.com</ext-link></italic> using MS Word 2003–2007 and sent to the technical committee via <email>mark.bomberg@gmail.com</email>.</p>
<p>Abstract of 300–500 words along with author contact information and affiliation may be submitted at any time before August 1, 2013. Conference papers, after a successful peer review, will be considered for publication in the <italic>Journal of Building Physics</italic> or the <italic>Journal of Building Enclosure Design</italic>. A Conference Proceedings containing abstracts of papers presented will be available to registered participants.</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text2-1744259113492733">

<p>The BEST Four Conference will address critical issues related to the performance of the building enclosure in conjunction with full-building performance. This conference will enhance your understanding of critical design changes and provide a forum for discussion of unresolved issues. Please submit a paper and share your experience with others. The following topics are indicative of topics encouraged for submission.</p>
