<abstract>
<p>Engaging key issues in a growing sociological literature on the emergence of ordinary cosmopolitanisms in consumer culture, this paper traces a link between brands and cosmopolitanism. Focusing on the case of specialty coffee brands Starbucks and Second Cup, the paper draws on recent theoretical approaches to the brand, and substantial qualitative data from research conducted in Toronto, to outline how the brands frame and invoke a narrow form of cosmopolitanism as part of the brand experience. However, it is not assumed that such cosmopolitanism is straightforwardly taken up or reproduced by consumers. Rather, considering the interactive ways in which consumers engage with the brands, it is argued that a stylized ‘cosmopolitan cool’ is co-generated in the dynamic interplay. While elaborating the connection between cosmopolitanism and the brands, the paper will also consider the paradoxes, limits and tensions of such branded cosmopolitanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent academic debate about cosmopolitanism, a strand of inquiry focuses on the formation of ‘ordinary cosmopolitanisms’ in mundane practices, spaces and situations in everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1749975512453544">Lamont and Aksartova, 2002</xref>). Analyses of these dimensions of cosmopolitanism range from the making and marketing of cosmopolitan city centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1749975512453544">Young et al., 2006</xref>) to the embodied cosmopolitanism of round-the-world-travellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1749975512453544">Germann Molz, 2006</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453544">Binnie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1749975512453544">Regev, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1749975512453544">Savage et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1749975512453544">Skrbis and Woodward, 2007</xref>). The emergence of cosmopolitanism in consumer culture is a particularly important theme in this scholarship, with studies concentrating on the production, circulation and consumption of ‘global’ cultural outputs and the cultivation of cosmopolitanness (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453544">Binnie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1749975512453544">Nava, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1749975512453544">Szerszynski and Urry, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1749975512453544">1</xref></sup> Little attention yet has been paid to the brand, despite it being an increasingly important market cultural form in contemporary consumptionscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512453544">Lury, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>My project here will be to contribute a new analysis of the brand by considering the relationship between ‘global’ brands and configurations of cosmopolitanism in everyday life. How do brands facilitate cosmopolitan expressions and shape specific kinds of consumerist cosmopolitanisms? Drawing on recent branding theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1749975512453544">Arvidsson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512453544">Lury, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1749975512453544">Moor, 2007</xref>), and empirical research material from a study of Starbucks and Second Cup coffee brands and their customers in the city of Toronto, Canada, I argue that the contours of an ordinary cosmopolitanism are co-constructed in the dynamic interplay between consumers and brands. Thus, while the brands frame certain cosmopolitan possibilities, I explore how the consumers of these brands – middle-class urbanites – negotiate such frames and co-create a situated, urban ‘cosmopolitan cool’. Comprised of three main components, this version of cosmopolitanism encompasses local and global cultural openness, global awareness and recognition of responsibility, as well as a modern style of urbanity. It is a privileged form, however, bound up with the performance of cultural capital and processes of distinction. While elaborating the link between cosmopolitanism and the brands, I also highlight the paradoxes and limits of brand-based cosmopolitanism. Before moving on to the research material, however, it will be useful to discuss the way cosmopolitanism is conceptualized and how scholars have linked it with consumer culture.</p>

<sec id="section2-1749975512453544">
<title>Cosmopolitanism and Consumer Culture</title>
<p>Reinvigorated in the context of globalization, transnational mobilities and multiculturalism, contemporary discussions of cosmopolitanism are characterized by numerous perspectives and debates (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1749975512453544">Vertovec and Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1749975512453544">Bhabha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1749975512453544">Robbins, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512453544">Derrida, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453544">Binnie et al. (2006)</xref> summarize two key conceptualizations, which are particularly useful for exploring brand-based cosmopolitanism. First, rooted in Kant’s political theory, cosmopolitanism refers to a philosophy of world citizenship and a political project – whether of global governance and civil society or the legitimation of plural identities. Alternatively, cosmopolitanism is understood as an intellectual or aesthetic disposition, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1749975512453544">Hannerz (1996</xref>: 103) defines as a ‘stance of openness towards divergent cultural experiences, a search for contrasts rather than uniformity’. The notion ‘disposition’ is closely related to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1749975512453544">Bourdieu’s (1984)</xref> concept of ‘habitus’: a learned ‘system of dispositions’ – classificatory schemes, preferences and inclinations that are manifest in the body and practices such as taste, and shaped through various types of capital. A cultural disposition, cosmopolitanism involves an ability to engage with and navigate cultural difference, and is characterized by a certain mobility, competence and flexibility. Moreover, it entails a sense of global awareness that is integrated into everyday routines and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512453544">Beck, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1749975512453544">Urry, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In an attempt to ground these abstract political and cultural conceptualizations, recent accounts of ‘actually existing cosmopolitanism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1749975512453544">Robbins, 1998</xref>) have focused on the ways in which cosmopolitanism is practised and performed in everyday life. In this context, scholars have focused attention on consumer culture, recognizing that consumption is a key arena for the construction of identities in contemporary society. Writers in this vein have considered the way cosmopolitan sentiments are facilitated through reflexive engagement with global media texts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1749975512453544">Hebdige, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1749975512453544">Meijer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1749975512453544">Morley, 2000</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1749975512453544">Szerszynski and Urry (2002</xref>: 478) argue that a ‘banal globalism’ evident in televisual flows is linked to the emergence of ‘cosmopolitan cultures’ based on evidence of global awareness, openness to diversity, and a proximated ‘ethics of care’ among viewers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1749975512453544">2</xref></sup> Alternatively, analysts have shown how the ‘non-rational, affective dimension of ourselves’ establishes a culture of cosmopolitanism through material practices and engagement with non-local cultural goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1749975512453544">Nava, 2002</xref>: 89). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1749975512453544">Nava (2002</xref>: 86) traces how women, through the consumption of global fashion and décor, expressed a popular cosmopolitan consciousness or ‘structure of feeling’ in 20th-century England, in which ‘cultural difference and the foreign constituted a source of interest, pleasure and counter-identification’ with conservative outlooks. More recently, scholars have looked at the production and consumption of cosmopolitan spaces. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453544">Latham (2006</xref>: 92) examines how the presence of a ‘whole new universe of cosmopolitan, global stuff’ in Auckland’s inner city creates a pluralistic public culture and contributes to an implicit process of cosmopolitanization. Critics, however, argue that these spaces produce a narrow cosmopolitanism based on superficial encounters with consumable differences marketed toward middle classes whose cultural competence constitutes a form of social distinction (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975512453544">Binnie and Skeggs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1749975512453544">Young et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>What these studies illustrate is the emergence of ‘consumerist cosmopolitanisms’ through everyday engagement with global images, non-local cultural goods and cosmopolitan ‘stuff’ in commercial spaces. They also demonstrate how such cosmopolitanisms, while centred on characteristics of openness, global awareness and care for others, are locally manifest in particular ways; they are ‘rooted cosmopolitanisms’ shaped through specific histories and geographies, as well as gender and class-based social relations and particular contexts of consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512453544">Beck, 2002</xref>). Of particular concern is the class location of cosmopolitanism. Some scholars argue that cosmopolitanism is a privileged disposition, since it involves capacities and knowledges that are only secured through access to the requisite cultural capital (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975512453544">Binnie and Skeggs, 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453544">Binnie et al. (2006</xref>: 8) put it: ‘being worldly … requires confidence, skill and money’. Alternatively, other writers highlight how routine engagement with non-local goods or mediated exposure to geographical and cultural diversity cultivates cosmopolitan sentiments among a broad populace (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1749975512453544">Hebdidge, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512453544">Beck, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This is not to say that cosmopolitan-oriented consumption has previously gone unnoticed. A considerable precursor literature on omnivorousness (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1749975512453544">Peterson and Kern, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1749975512453544">Warde et al., 1999</xref>) has documented a shift in taste from snobbishness toward an interest in a variety of cultural repertoires, particularly among high-status groups. Recent work has argued that wider cultural engagement is increasingly a middle-class norm, pointing to the need to delineate between various types of omnivore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1749975512453544">Warde et al., 2007</xref>). While cosmopolitanism, in this sense, may be considered a specific kind of cultural omnivorousness, on the whole this literature does not explicitly address cosmopolitan values or concerns of global awareness and engagement. Cosmopolitan consumption is also recognized in an emerging literature in business and marketing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1749975512453544">Cleveland et al., 2009</xref>), however, and with notable exceptions such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1749975512453544">Thompson and Tambyah’s (1999)</xref> study of expatriate identities, many of these studies are interested in quantifying cosmopolitan characteristics for the purposes of international market segmentation rather than providing a sociological understanding.</p>
<p>Beyond mentioning brands as examples of global media icons or symbols that mark cosmopolitan space, little attention is paid to brands in these accounts. In one sense, this neglect reflects the persistence of divisions in current discussions of cosmopolitanism between what is referred to as ‘strong’ cosmopolitanism, focusing on the political project of cosmopolitan democracy, and ‘soft’ cosmopolitanism, which situates cosmopolitan consumption, and particularly branded cosmopolitanism, as a distraction rather than as a subject of serious academic inquiry (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1749975512453544">Calhoun, 2002</xref>). Moreover, within perceptions of positive or detrimental forms of cosmopolitanism, brands tend to fall on the side of neoliberal capitalism and corporate-driven cosmopolitanism, bound up with the production of economic and social inequalities through the promotion of a flexible free global market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1749975512453544">Calhoun, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1749975512453544">Vertovec and Cohen, 2002</xref>). Subject to negative assessments and the perception that they are ‘too crass … to deserve serious inquiry’, brands do not receive much sustained academic attention outside of business disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1749975512453544">Holt, 2006</xref>: 300).</p>
<p>While brands certainly stand to profit from cosmopolitan projects and consumer attitudes, it is important not to limit analyses to these economic effects. In this article, I attempt to contribute to the growing work on cosmopolitanism and consumer culture by exploring the way cosmopolitanism is constituted on the platforms of ‘global’ brands. How are brands bound up with the articulation of cosmopolitan identities or lifestyles? How are such cosmopolitanisms characterized by certain tensions or limitations? Focusing attention on the brand, I address these themes by referring to an extensive study of specialty coffee brands Starbucks and Second Cup.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1749975512453544">
<title>Data</title>
<p>Introduced in the 1970s in Seattle and Scarborough, respectively, Starbucks and Second Cup each started out in the form of a retail store selling high-quality coffee beans to a small target market of discerning middle-class consumers for home consumption. Following similar trajectories, in the 1980s both brands evolved into the format of a streetfront café premised on the provision of customized, gourmet coffee in a stylized, social café environment. Expanding throughout the 1990s and 2000s, both brands have proliferated across Canadian cityscapes, structuring specialty markets and shaping urban café cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1749975512453544">3</xref></sup> My own interest in researching coffee brands and culture stems from participation as a café flaneuse in these urban coffeehouses. While Second Cup remains a predominantly Canadian brand with some branches abroad, Starbucks has become a global phenomenon, with locations worldwide. What makes these brands ‘global’, however, is not simply a matter of their international presence, but the way they assemble global coffees, causes and transnational practices as part of the brand interface.</p>
<p>Cosmopolitanism was an emergent theme in my study of the production and consumption of these brands. Consumers themselves raised the notion when they were discussing the presence of coffees from around the world and the global café ambiance. Early on in my research it became apparent that cosmopolitanism was important to how consumers related to and experienced the brands. I subsequently pursued this theme in the rest of data collection, which was a benefit of reflexive methodology.</p>
<p>The data set consists of material gathered through strategies that included participant observation, visual/textual analysis and interviews conducted in Toronto over a period of three years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1749975512453544">4</xref></sup> A dense and diverse metropolis, Toronto has a population of over 5 million people and one of the highest foreign-born populations (45.7%) among cities worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512453544">Hiller, 2010</xref>: 34). The observational component of my research took place in neighbourhoods across the city, from the Entertainment District to the lively Annex area near the University of Toronto. Most were middle-class or gentrified areas, where the specialty brands – targeting affluent consumers – are predominantly positioned. In all, 80 hour-long sessions were conducted in twenty-two Starbucks and Second Cup cafés. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1749975512453544">Emmison and Smith (2000)</xref>, my findings detail the way images, people, objects and sensorial aspects were formatted and flowed within the café space, intersecting to perform an experience of the brand. A visual analysis of promotional materials and information helped me to understand the content of brand communications. It concentrated on Starbucks’ Commitment to Origins™ and Second Cup’s Solid Grounds™ campaigns, which were featured in the cafés at the time of research.</p>
<p>I also conducted semi-structured interviews both with consumers and producers of the brands. The latter group included over 20 people involved in the design, marketing and management of the brands. The aim of these interviews was to gain insight into branding processes and performance. The former group included more than forty Starbucks and Second Cup consumers, whose interview data are featured in this article. Participants were recruited through the use of flyers and posters. Interviewees ranged in age from their early 20s to late 60s, and included slightly more women than men. With a few notable exceptions, they were overwhelmingly young, middle-class professionals or university students, with high levels of economic and cultural capital, especially in the form of post-secondary education. Interviews were conducted in the cafés consumers frequented and covered themes related to their everyday use and interactions with the brands. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1749975512453544">Kirby and McKenna’s (1989)</xref> guidelines, data analysis involved a thorough, systematic process of ‘reading’, categorizing and coding to gain an understanding of key themes, issues and trends. The following analysis focuses on one aspect of this research: the co-constitution of cosmopolitanism in the brand-consumer dynamic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1749975512453544">
<title>Brands, Consumers and the Co-creation of ‘Cosmopolitan Cool’</title>
<p>Drawing on recent branding theory, brands are understood as powerful market cultural forms that mediate and articulate production and consumption in contemporary processes of exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1749975512453544">Arvidsson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512453544">Lury, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1749975512453544">Moor, 2007</xref>). Not simply a name or logo, the brand is a complex media object that coordinates these and other elements including products, people and promotions to communicate certain values or qualities with the aim of establishing a particular image: ‘<italic>the associations that a brand holds for consumers</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512453544">Lury, 2004</xref>: 80). Consumer activity is central to this process. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1749975512453544">Holt (2004</xref>: 3) argues, the brand only emerges through the accumulation of consumer experiences, which ‘fill the brand markers with meaning’. As such, brands are managed to provide consumers with carefully curated contexts, suggesting ways in which they can experience or relate to various products and services, offering cultural frameworks for their use: ‘With a particular brand I can act, feel and be in a particular way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1749975512453544">Arvidsson, 2006</xref>: 8). Consumers are encouraged to use brands to produce identities, shared meanings and common social worlds in ways that contribute (rather than detract from) brand image. In this process, they co-perform the brand, helping to realize its identity and value-in-use, as it is spun into their everyday lives. This is central to what a marketing director called ‘living the brand’, and a key aspect of the way it ‘comes to life’ for consumers.</p>
<p>For Starbucks and Second Cup, the streetfront café is the main context for shaping consumer experiences. A type of ‘servicescape’, the café is ‘designed to facilitate certain kinds of hedonic/aesthetic experiences and social interactions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1749975512453544">Thompson and Arsel, 2004</xref>: 632). It is patterned, through the coordination of a themed environment, product and promotion design, as well as the organization of a system of service provision, to frame particular experiences around coffee consumption, shaping its meaning, use and place in consumers’ lives. Here, I am interested in how the brands construct an experience of cosmopolitan connoisseurship in the space of the café. Against a backdrop of a world of coffee, Starbucks and Second Cup frame certain opportunities to cultivate and express cosmopolitan sensibilities as connoisseurs and global citizens. Not assuming that consumers straightforwardly take up such frames, I emphasize how they negotiate and co-create a situated ‘cosmopolitan cool’ comprised of three components: cultural openness, global awareness, and an urban style. In this process, consumers co-shape the elemental aspects of a cosmopolitanism that serves to distinguish both consumers and brands.</p>
<sec id="section5-1749975512453544">
<title>Coffee Connoisseurship and Cultural Openness</title>
<p>Cosmopolitan openness is evoked in the context of coffee connoisseurship, and is particularly linked to the way both brands ‘romance’ the coffee experience. Presenting themselves as coffee experts, Starbucks and Second Cup introduce specialty coffees like fine wines, with an emphasis on origins as a distinguishing factor in discriminating coffee quality and taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1749975512453544">Roseberry, 1996</xref>). Differences in origin are conveyed through a range of materials designed to ‘educate’ consumers, develop their palette, and encourage experiential involvement. Take, for example, Second Cup’s illustrated Huehuetenango coffee label, which depicts a sun-basked coffee field framed by ‘exotic’ vegetation and animals. Sara,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1749975512453544">5</xref></sup> who works with an advertising, design and interactive agency involved in the branding of Second Cup, explained what the label is supposed to convey:<disp-quote>
<p>I think it gives them a sense of place … I think, you know, we certainly want to make illustrations representative of a location, as much as, as accurate as possible. But certainly…it’s more of a sense of flavour and taste appeal in a way, and exotic location and colours, and um, you know, it is a bit of an education, but it’s not over-the-head kind of education.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The label is not intended to provide accurate, literal information about coffee sources, but rather offers a visual story and ‘taste of the place’. As Second Cup’s marketing director suggested, it provides a ‘sense of adventure’ and adds to the ‘mystique’ of coffee, which ‘gets people more involved in the overall experience’. The brands’ ‘caffeinated cartography’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512453544">Elliot, 2006</xref>: 67) thus places emphasis on taste geographies and experience, without the risk of education about the world.</p>
<p>Inscribed in wall murals, coffee brochures, and even table-top poetry, consumers engage with stories about coffee origins as they stand in line waiting for espressos or linger in the café environment. When asked to comment on this aspect of the brands, consumers suggested that it invoked a sense of global diversity. For example, Nancy, a student in her mid-20s, observed: ‘With the marketing of different images from different places, and I guess also the colours – they’re kind of rich and almost, you know, from Central and South America. So it is kind of a collage of different places’. Comparing Second Cup with other establishments featuring ‘ethnic’ foods, Sean, a graduate student with three young children mentioned that they all ‘invoke similar kinds of thing, that you’ll have sort of world music or stuff that is meant to imply lots of cultures mixed together’. He spontaneously added that they are aimed at attracting ‘a crowd that thinks of itself as multicultural and interested in the world and is cosmopolitan’.</p>
<p>Invited to explore the ‘world of coffee’ and literally taste the differences in origin, consumers are afforded the possibility of expressing cosmopolitan openness by engaging with cultural diversity as constituted via the medium of coffee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1749975512453544">6</xref></sup> Taking up such opportunities, some consumers discussed how they felt connected with various cultures and places around the world through virtual travel and taste. This was the case for Starbucks consumer and business owner Jeff, who spoke about his ‘global experience’:<disp-quote>
<p>And sometimes they [Starbucks] give you maps or flags, and they show you Guatemalan or Honduran coffee with the little placards. I guess I would call it a global experience, but not a European one. It’s more like the earthy-hippy-third-world type, which, actually I’ve travelled that route. It’s more like I’m connected to the real planet that grows the, Central America, I guess that’s the regions … it sort of feels like I don’t need to go to Ethiopia, I can go to Starbucks.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Others shared Jeff’s experience of virtual mobility; they also felt transported elsewhere via the brand. Commenting on Starbucks’ Caffè Verona packaging, Nancy remarked: ‘It’s like going to Verona without going to Verona. It works on such a subconscious level, the semiotics of it, you know’. While Verona stood out to Nancy, who previously travelled to Italy, Second Cup consumer Todd and his partner Mike, students at the University of Toronto, relayed their aspirations to see the world. As Todd indicated: ‘I like the idea of getting something from Arabia or wherever, I do. I like travel, so that does appeal’. While Mike injected: ‘Like my little passport thing, if I keep collecting stamps of all the coffees that I’ve had …’, suggesting he could travel the world through taste, with a Starbucks passport in hand. Coffee bags serve as souvenirs in this context. Purchasing five Ethiopian Yirgacheffe packages for friends, Paul, who works as a stockbroker, explained: ‘I love the aesthetics of it, it’s so much fun to give presents that look nice aesthetically. … It makes you feel like, it give you a sense of East Africa I think with this design’.</p>
<p>Narrating experiences of virtual mobility, purchasing coffee bags to share travel experiences, and collecting global coffee stamps, these consumers reflexively engage in ‘post-tourist’ experiences, reflecting qualities of play and irony in their travels with the brand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1749975512453544">Urry, 1990</xref>). In this process, they perform a certain ‘worldliness’, expressing cosmopolitan sentiments of delight in encounters with difference and openness toward other cultures. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1749975512453544">Hebdige (1990)</xref> has articulated, expanded, virtual mobilities and mediated exposure to cultural variety cultivate a ‘mundane cosmopolitanism’. However, in the comments above, a sense of virtual travel was often discussed in conjunction with notions of actual (or aspirational) physical travel and an aesthetic appreciation of place, expressing a privileged rather than popular form of mobility. Being ‘worldly’ in this sense is bound up with the deployment of cultural capital in the form of global geographical experiences, cultural knowledges and aesthetic frames of reference, as well as the economic capacity to journey around the world.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all consumers necessarily subscribed to the cultural diversity stipulated by the brands. For example, Sean criticised the way coffee-growing regions were portrayed: ‘I think there’s still in North American society, even though all the places are going to be different from each other, right, Africa, Latin America, Indonesia, the coding is if it’s highly colourful and highly patterned then it’s that place far away’. Disparaging the way diversity is corporately controlled, graduate student and Starbucks consumer Jennifer observed, ‘they have an Italian CD, they have a Brazilian CD, so in that way, they sort of, it’s diversity but it’s rigidly conformed diversity in terms of music and in terms of atmosphere’. These comments reflect cultural criticism of the way differences are ordered, packaged and commodified for consumption. Analysts of cosmopolitan space in particular have pointed out how commercially framed ‘boutique multiculture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1749975512453544">Keith, 2005</xref>) creates a distinction between ‘acceptable’ and ‘unacceptable’ differences, reproducing rather than breaking down certain hierarchies of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453544">Binnie et al., 2006</xref>: 25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1749975512453544">Young et al., 2006</xref>). As Sean notes, this involves a homogenization of non-Western cultures and coffee origins, invoking postcolonial criticism of the Orientalist framing and the ‘fixing’ of ‘third world’ differences for the enjoyment of predominantly Western consumers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512453544">Ahmed, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512453544">Elliot, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512453544">2008</xref>). Such postcolonial analyses remain at the textual and discursive level, however, often neglecting to consider how differences are actually consumed through embodied practice.</p>
<p>In contrast with those who playfully embrace brand-based diversity to express cultural mobility, these consumers articulate a cosmopolitan openness through critique – by drawing attention to its limits. At the same time, bound up with knowledges of cultural coding and geographical difference, they express an equally privileged sensibility on the platform of the brand.</p>

<title>Corporate Citizenship and Globally Responsible Awareness</title>
<p>The second component of this branded cosmopolitanism – global awareness – is framed through the introduction of corporate responsibility. Connected to connoisseurship, it communicates a passion for coffee through care for the communities and environments in which it is cultivated. To this end, both brands coordinate extensive programs, partnering with organizations such as Fairtrade Foundation to provide support for sustainable production and coffee communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1749975512453544">Second Cup Ltd., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1749975512453544">Starbucks Coffee Company, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1749975512453544">2002b</xref>). During my research, for example, Starbucks launched its Commitment to Origins™ philosophy and line of coffees. These sustainable coffees were prominently displayed in burlap sacks and promoted in brochures featuring fair-trade testimonials, designed to convey care for others and engage consumers in an ethical experience. Demonstrating ‘a recognition of the need for respect for human conditions at the product’s source and a perspective of global diversity’, the brand performs a politics, or rather, myth of cosmopolitan citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1749975512453544">Gobé, 2001</xref>: 300). Constituting an ethical ‘frame of action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1749975512453544">Arvidsson, 2006</xref>), consumers are called on to actively recognize their responsibility as global citizens in an interconnected world of coffee through consumption choices, volunteerism and beyond. A paragraph from Starbucks’ Commitment to Origins™ brochure entitled ‘You can help make a difference too’ states:<disp-quote>
<p>We try to make a difference to the people and places that produce coffee, to the countries we visit and the families we touch. Every time you purchase Starbucks coffees, you’re also making a difference, helping to improve people’s lives, and encouraging conservation where our coffee is grown. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1749975512453544">Starbucks Coffee Company, 2002a</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Only a few of the consumers I interviewed responded positively to this call. This was the case for Paul, who identified himself as ‘a socially responsible type of person’:<disp-quote>
<p>For me it wouldn’t be Starbucks without their social responsibility. Young people are much more socially aware than older people; our generation are much more concerned … I think that Starbucks is part of a process of social and economic development in the world, and I think it’s a role model.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In this quote, Paul conveys his geo-political awareness and ethical values, demonstrating these through his support of the brand. He also makes an interesting observation regarding the young professionals that frequent specialty cafés, suggesting that they express high levels of global awareness and concern. While this was certainly the case for many of the participants I interviewed, such awareness was mainly exhibited through critique rather than acceptance of brand-based responsibility.</p>
<p>For the most part, consumers expressed a great deal of skepticism toward branded socially-responsible initiatives, particularly questioning corporate motives for caring. For example, Starbucks consumer John, who once owned an independent café, stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>I see this just as another way of appealing to people who are more conscientious about global issues, but I mean from what I hear they’re big enough to set coffee prices, so um, there’s a lot they could be doing, but if they’re a publicly traded company … ultimately their concern is the bottom line.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In addition to the limitations posed by the profit imperative, some consumers questioned the extent to which brands are responsible, as John mentioned, ‘there’s a lot they could be doing’. In many instances, consumers thought that ethical initiatives such as carrying fair trade coffee or sponsoring children in coffee-growing regions were token gestures, designed to deflect potential criticism. This was expressed by Jennifer, who asserted: ‘Well actually again it’s just like having your one rack of organic cotton t-shirts. It’s like they do it to silence the people who would come in and [be critical], you know what I mean’. Furthermore, consumers suggested that the brands were simply co-opting responsible practices to curb competition. As Nancy conveyed:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m very cynical. I would hope that they would be sincere in that, but I also think that it won’t ever come to much. And to represent themselves as fair-trade. I don’t think it’s true. I wonder if it’s not in reaction to consumer disgust and consumer desire for fair trade, so to kind of nip it at the bud and say ‘no, you don’t need to look into alternative brands because we can do that’. But then they probably don’t really do that, so I should stop coming here.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In these comments, consumers articulate cosmopolitan values of ethical engagement with others and the environment, demonstrating global awareness and a sense of responsibility through their skepticism of the brands’ ability to achieve such ideals. Some consumers, such as Jennifer, indicated that an ethics of responsibility should be already integrated into business practices, not simply an added bonus or extra cost in which ‘you’re taxed on your moral responsibilities’.</p>
<p>At the same time, these highly knowledgeable skeptics were not about to give up their habits and taste for Starbucks or Second Cup coffee. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1749975512453544">Skrbis and Woodward (2007</xref>: 735), in their work on the ambivalence of cosmopolitanism, suggest that the gap between globally-aware sentiments and practices reflects how cosmopolitan ideals conflict with personal imperatives and therefore it ‘does not always find full flowering’. Indeed, to resolve this contradiction, many consumers conveyed a conflicted appreciation of the brands’ efforts to be responsible, conceding that at least it is a move in the right direction. This was the case for Monica, a university-educated young mother, who shared her views on Second Cup’s sponsorship program:<disp-quote>
<p>I think every individual store each fosters a different child, right, from what I understand, which I always thought was kinda cool. Um, if I think a bit deeper about it, I am aware that really that probably doesn’t make up for the damage that’s done – the whole production of coffee – so I don’t know. At least they’re doing something, nobody can do everything, and at least it’s something. Even the fact that they’re raising a bit of awareness … it might make people more aware of the rest of the world, which I think is very important.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>To an extent, the brands address some of the anxieties these consumers face as coffee connoisseurs with cosmopolitan ideals and awareness, through education and media attention to issues of global poverty, the environment and labour, of inequalities associated with the trade in commodities such as coffee. By doing ‘something’ to alleviate consumers’ ethical concerns, the brands allow consumers to justify their consumption and still maintain their cosmopolitan outlook. This is precisely what good identity brands do, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1749975512453544">Holt (2004)</xref>; they target contemporary cultural anxieties and offer consumers a way of smoothing them over; they put consumers at ease. As Joanne, a Starbucks fan in the field of nursing, remarked: ‘I don’t think anybody buys it [referring to Starbucks’ fair-trade initiatives], but they appreciate the protection of the company saying they do that to try and make us not feel guilty about spending all this money on their coffee’.</p>
<p>Although Starbucks and Second Cup do not fulfil the cosmopolitan ideals articulated by skeptical consumers, they serve as a marker of ethical aspirations, holding out the possibility of globally-aware ethical engagement with others. In this sense, they allow consumers to at least appear or imagine themselves responsible, so that they can feel better about drinking their café latte, even while dubious of the company’s efforts in this regard.</p>

<title>Urban Cafés and ‘Cosmopolitan Cool’</title>
<p>Located in affluent shopping areas and gentrified Toronto neighbourhoods, Starbucks and Second Cup connect with consumers as they go about their shopping, work or leisure. Opening onto and implicating these broader urban environments and patterns, the brands are entwined with consumers’ experiences of everyday life in the city. In this dynamic, cosmopolitanism takes the shape of an urban style; a third component of the consumerist cosmopolitanism co-constructed in the brand-consumer interplay. Indeed, many consumers referred to cosmopolitanism in urban terms, defining it as metropolitan or downtown, reflecting the ‘hustling and bustling’ of city life, and as part of an urban lifestyle. For example, when describing the cosmopolitan experience she associated with Starbucks, Cherie, a professional in the field of communications, suggested: ‘Starbucks has that metropolitan, urban kind of thing’. As a style, it resembles a populist version of cosmopolitanism, characterized by cultural liveliness and a certain sophistication, which might be captured in the concept of urban ‘cosmopolitan cool’.</p>
<p>The cosmopolitan urbanism described here involves an awareness of and delight in the variety of city life marked by an array of cultural flows and ‘in situ’ cultural difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453544">Latham, 2006</xref>: 95). Sharon, a professional working in the financial district of Toronto, relates the aesthetic globalism of the café space to the urban variety she experiences downtown:<disp-quote>
<p>Now Starbucks is new, and it’s very lively. The colours are very bright and bold and it’s part of my downtown; it’s part of my everyday, and if I, you know, if I’m going on vacation I will likely go to another city, that’s what appeals to me is sensory overload … there’s a little bit of stimulation at Starbucks which I associate with life around me, cosmopolitan, it’s downtown.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For Sharon, the overall ‘culture of Starbucks or feeling of Starbucks is cosmopolitan’, in that it reflects the vibrancy of city life. She mentioned how it makes her ‘feel very cosmopolitan’, highlighting the affective dimension of the cosmopolitan experience generated by the café ambiance.</p>
<p>An instance of the ‘global grounded. The local’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453544">Binnie et al., 2006</xref>: 15), cosmopolitanism in this sense is both worldly and manifest through an interest in the metropolitan mix. It is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512453544">Beck (2002)</xref> indicates, both rooted and has wings. At the same time, consumers were aware of the limits to such brand-mediated cosmopolitanism, suggesting that it affords an experience of urban diversity without the risk of actually engaging with others. As Sean observed: ‘That’s one of the things that’s attractive about them [Starbucks], is that you can be in a strip mall in an utterly homogenous area and you can think of yourself … as a big city person who knows about the world’. A cosmopolitan difference is thus constituted at a distance, from within the safety of the branded café. However, this was not Sean’s experience, who was interviewed in the Annex – an area known for its ethnically diverse outdoor markets and community. As he noted, ‘here on this street corner it is relatively multicultural’, implying that his own cosmopolitan urbanism, evident in neighbourhood choice, extends beyond the parameters of the brand.</p>
<p>Cosmopolitanism as an urban style is also characterized by a certain sophistication. For example, Kamala, a publishing professional in her late 20s who frequents a Second Cup downtown, relayed that:<disp-quote>
<p>It makes it feel cosmopolitan in that the [rural] groups aren’t doing this. They’re not coming in to get their coffee. Like my brother is very small town, and he thinks it’s a kind of snobbery or extravagant for those that spend $4 on a latte. He doesn’t get it. They go to a donut shop then they’re on their way to the construction site, you know what I mean? So I think he thinks it’s ‘upcity’ or fashionable to sit in the café.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When asked if she felt that way, Kamala responded that ‘it kind of becomes second nature’. For Kamala, being ‘upcity’ as she conveys through her brother’s perspective, is ‘natural’ to her; it is part of her urban style and identity. Expressed through practices of café flaneurship and connoisseurship, Kamala’s sophisticated urbanness is contrasted with her brother’s small-town style and taste for mass-marketed coffee. While he is drawn to the familiar, she expresses an interest in experiencing cultural complexity.</p>
<p>It is precisely the complexity of specialty coffee, characterized by a dizzying array of customizable options and styles, and accompanied by a whole pseudo-Italian/French language on the menu, that marks a boundary between ‘discriminating’ coffee connoisseurs on the one hand, and ‘ordinary’ coffee drinkers on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512453544">Elliot, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1749975512453544">Cormack, 2008</xref>). This is observed by Jeff, while commenting on Starbucks’ coffee lingo:<disp-quote>
<p>… they’re branding themselves as this more sophisticated, cosmopolitan, exotic experience. Why not throw some Italian in there, you know, any schmuck can say small, medium, large, but it actually takes quite a lot of sophistication and more intelligence than I have to distinguish between Grande and Venti … although this doesn’t keep me awake at night.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While Jeff does not necessarily take cosmopolitan connoisseurship seriously, he points to the way in which it allows a surface display of coffee competence (regardless of actual knowledgeability), and comprises a form of cultural capital that distinguishes between ‘any schmuck’ and ‘aficionados’ who are more sophisticated in style. Such distinctions are class-based since the ability to acquire coffee fluency and knowledge is more available to some, especially middle-class consumers, who can afford to spend time cultivating this skill (or appearance) with the brands. At the same time, these divisions reflect an urban–rural divide. For example, when Todd defined cosmopolitanism as ‘a sense of gourmet’, his partner Mike added, ‘I couldn’t imagine a Second Cup in the country’. The cafés and their sophisticated coffee culture are associated with an urban lifestyle and the heterogeneity of the city, in contrast with an imagined small town simplicity and rural homogeneity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975512453544">Binnie and Skeggs (2004</xref>: 41) articulate, cosmopolitanism is ‘an oppositional term evoked against all that is fixed, parochial and especially national’. Here, cosmopolitans are distinguished from rural and working classes, distinction that is particularly at work in the contrast between Kamala and her seemingly unsophisticated brother.</p>
<p>A further characteristic of cosmopolitan urbanity consists of its ‘coolness’. Jeff identified this in his association of Starbucks with what he termed ‘North American cosmopolitan cool’:<disp-quote>
<p>I think of it as New York … um, okay, North American cosmopolitan cool is jazz, Miles Davis, American Indie movies, more like modern. I tend to associate North Americans who adhere or latch onto European things as, I guess there’s people that seem to consume things that have greater legitimacy as a result of their classical old status, or, ballet, opera, Shakespeare … So in contrast to that, North American urban cool would be much more avant-garde in the sense that it’s looking at things that are very recent.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Described as urban, modern and ‘avant-garde’, ‘North American cosmopolitan cool’ encompasses certain practices of cultural consumption that convey openness to innovation and new cultural forms. It is particularly expressed by Starbucks and Second Cup through aesthetic design, music selection and the sponsorship of chic festivals and events.</p>
<p>Cool is an attribute associated with uniqueness, or an ‘innovative style’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1749975512453544">Sturken and Cartwright, 2009</xref>: 294). It has been used as an expression of counter-culture, a mode of differentiation from the mainstream that allows people to think of themselves as current or cutting edge through the display of taste, underpinning the rise of ‘hip consumerism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1749975512453544">Frank, 1997</xref>). Jeff suggests that the difference of ‘cosmopolitan cool’ consists in its culturally omnivorous but contemporary style of consumption. A specific kind of omnivorousness, it involves a discerning approach to cultural engagement that is not only distinguished from mainstream mass consumption but other versions of cosmopolitan consumption such as ‘European cool’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1749975512453544">Bourdieu (1984)</xref> indicates, aesthetic judgement is always bound up with social status. In drawing distinctions between North American and European cool, and deploying his knowledge of cultural trends, Jeff is positioned as an arbiter of taste. In this process, he engages in the performance of urban ‘cool’, distinguishing himself as a hip cosmopolitan with the frames afforded by the brand.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>By focusing on brands, and using contemporary branding theory, this empirically detailed account shows how a notion of being cosmopolitan and experiencing a type of cosmopolitan difference is materialized, marked and given expression by the brands Starbucks and Second Cup. It demonstrates how a ‘cosmopolitan cool’ is constituted within spaces where global narratives and visual elements, spatial ambiance and location, as well as middle-class consumer desire are fused. It emphasizes how this cosmopolitan form emerges in the <italic>interplay</italic> between brands and their patrons, who co-create a cosmopolitan experience. Such cosmopolitanism is complex; it consists of both a global orientation of openness and awareness as well as an urban style – a way of being in the city that embraces cultural liveliness, innovation and complexity. Both global and grounded, it reflects an interworking of the ‘aesthetic and cultural globalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453544">Binnie et al., 2006</xref>: 15) of the brands, which structure a global space of travel and sphere of responsibility, and the localism of cafés situated in the particularity of Toronto neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Far from being implicitly cosmopolitanized, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512453544">Latham’s (2006)</xref> study of cosmopolitan consumption suggests, or bearing a form of unreflexive ‘mundane’ cosmopolitanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1749975512453544">Skrbis et al., 2004</xref>), the middle-class coffee consumers I interviewed reflexively articulate cosmopolitan outlooks in ways that both reproduce and especially exceed the narrow frames afforded by the brands, expressing cosmopolitan sentiments and values through critique as well as (playful) embrace of brand-based diversity, responsibility and connoisseurship. Drawing on experiences of travel, broader ethical ideals and urban everyday life, consumers co-shape a situated cosmopolitanism that combines an awareness of current, global issues and interest in contemporary urban cultures. At the same time, the ambivalence of such cosmopolitanism is revealed in the contradictions some consumers experience between their ideals, which often exceed the brand’s parameters, and patterns of consumption in relation to the brand.</p>
<p>This account reveals a privileged form of cosmopolitanism, bound up with displays of cultural capital and the performance of distinction. The café consumers have access to a rich store of cultural and economic capital that allows them to be culturally flexible, mobile and knowledgeable. Expressed as a style and displayed through taste, consumers are distinguished by their hip, metropolitan worldliness, especially in contrast to an imagined rural and working-class parochialism. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453544">Binnie et al. (2006)</xref> indicate, being cosmopolitan has become a desirable point of distinction for new middle and gentrifying classes. This is not to suggest, however, that cosmopolitanism is the reserve of middle-class consumers. Rather, attending to this stylized form, I address <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1749975512453544">Germann Molz’s (2006</xref>: 18) contention that ‘even privileged or elite versions of cosmopolitanism must also be specified, situated and differentiated within a particular matrix of materiality, culture and politics’ so as not to remain abstract, invisible norms.</p>
<p>Taking brands seriously, this article maintains that these cultural market forms provide a platform on which ‘actually existing’ cosmopolitanisms emerge. The empirical account offered here demonstrates that these are not simply superficial, commodified expressions, but are bound up with consumers’ identities, aspirations and practices. Integrated into their everyday lives, branded cosmopolitanism is an important part of consumers’ lived experience of cosmopolitanism. At the same time there are limits to such brand-based cosmopolitanism, many of which are recognized by consumers themselves. Overall, this study suggests that cultural sociologists should pay more attention to the way brands are co-shaping cosmopolitan cultures in contemporary society. In particular, they play a role in the formation of what analysts have identified as new urban ‘cosmopolitan lifestyles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453544">Binnie et al., 2006</xref>). Tapping into this trend, brands are enabling and co-constituting particular cosmopolitan expressions as part of the exchange.</p>
