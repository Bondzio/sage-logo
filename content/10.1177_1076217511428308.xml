<p>“People seemed to become gifted in a flash, to the point of absurdity.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A “flash mob” is defined by Wikipedia as “a large group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, perform an unusual and pointless act for a brief time, then disperse.” Fueled by social media and Smartphones, flash mobs have been used, primarily, as entertaining diversions by addicted techies with (apparently) tons of time on their hands. More recently, flash mobs have taken on darker, more sinister forms, as large-scale riots and small-time robberies have both been instigated by the flash mob phenomenon.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the field of gifted child education has been experiencing its own flash mob mentality for quite some time, for whenever a group of gifted gurus gets together—say, at a national gifted conference—a mob forms as to who can define the concept of giftedness so broadly that it becomes a term that <italic>in</italic>cludes more children than it <italic>ex</italic>cludes. When I started working in this field in 1978—a full generation before Al Gore invented the Internet—it was unusual for a school district to identify more than 5% of its population as gifted. Generally speaking, the kids selected as gifted and talented had superior cognitive abilities as expressed through a time-tested measure of intelligence. However, it didn’t take long for various flash mobs to gather for the purpose of offering more generous interpretations of giftedness. Thus, you could be a gifted mathematician, reader, social scientist, or artist, or you might even be graced with some of those multiple intelligences that sprouted like dandelions in May whenever Howard Gardner lifted his pen. People seemed to become gifted in a flash, to the point of absurdity. No longer were we a field of the few, but of the many. And in becoming so, the field of gifted child education got lost in the madness of its own inclusivity.</p>
<p>Case in point: Though now retired, I spent the bulk of my professional years as a teacher and professor of gifted children (and those who wanted to teach them) in Ohio. Because of the broadly based definition of giftedness adapted by the Buckeye State from the 1971 federal definition of giftedness, school districts were required to identify gifted children, Grades K-12, in the many areas of giftedness mentioned in that federal definition, including not only superior cognitive abilities but also distinct areas of academic accomplishment—reading, math, science, social studies—as well as creativity and visual and performing arts endeavors. Over time, this identification juggernaut grew to becoming unwieldy, as school districts continued to <italic>identify</italic> countless thousands of children as gifted in one or many ways while, ironically, providing appropriately challenging educational services for relatively few of them. Indeed, the flash mob of giftedness became so frenzied that in some wealthy Ohio school districts, upward to 70% to 80% of the K-12 population was identified as gifted in some way.</p>
<p>This 1971 federal definition of giftedness, which has been updated several times, is still the one that most states adapt or adopt in defining their own gifted populations; thus, Ohio is not alone in both <italic>over</italic>identifying and <italic>under</italic>serving its truly gifted children—you know that 3% to 5% of the K-12 population who have abilities that are so pronounced and extraordinary that they <italic>require</italic> direct attention to their intellectual, social, and emotional needs.</p>
<p>In trying to think of another specialized area of education or extracurricular activity where anywhere from 25% to 80% of the student population fall under its aegis, I come up short. Certainly, we do not relegate such numbers to children in the domains of autism, cognitive disabilities, emotional disorders, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. And when we select talented musicians for prime spots in the orchestra, agile athletes for a coveted place on a traveling team, or charismatic actors for lead roles in the high school production of <italic>Our Town</italic>, we do so with the realistic view that such superstars are few in number. Why, then, is giftedness seen by so many as a concept that is shared by a plurality of the school age population? In a field such as ours, which is filled with smart people, we make ourselves look mighty dumb when we identify giftedness so profusely.</p>
<p>These are tough economic times for schools in virtually every region of our nation. In past eras, such fiscal austerity has hampered the very existence of specialized services for gifted students, as the timeworn myth that “smart kids can make it on their own—let’s spend our few dollars on kids who <italic>really</italic> need it” saw gifted programs and personnel reduced or eliminated. I have no reason to believe that such a sad history will not repeat itself over the next few years.</p>
<p>And whom do we have to blame, should <italic>bad</italic> become <italic>worse?</italic> The answer, it seems to me, is as close as the nearest mirror. Educators, parents, psychologists, and gifted gurus who have put forth views of giftedness that are so vastly inclusive need to consider one thing: their notions of giftedness as being a domain of the many is harming the very population of gifted kids for whom they purport to be advocates, namely, those gifted few who have been clumped with the masses in an ill-conceived plan to broaden our field beyond any semblance of logic and reason.</p>
<p>In considering the definition of a flash mob that opened this essay, I am struck especially by the phrase “performing an unusual and pointless act,” for it seems to apply so well to the current emphasis among gifted child educators (and others) who seem to believe that our field will get more vibrant the bigger it gets. Call me naïve, berate me for harboring “old school” ideas, or dismiss me as a cranky retiree who has not kept pace with the times, but it seems to me that we will gain more respect and attention from politicians and educators outside our field if we limit the number of children we are talking about. Gifted in a flash (mob)? Not such a great idea.</p>
