<p>Across all the different dynamics that occur within the family (e.g., interaction, roles, rules, patterns), the most common area investigated by scholars is family functioning or adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175612449173">Goldenberg &amp; Goldenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175612449173">Tutty, 1995</xref>). Family functioning, for the purposes of this study, is defined as the health or competence of the family members in relation with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612449173">Beavers, Hampson, &amp; Hulgus, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175612449173">Epstein, Baldwin, &amp; Bishop, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175612449173">Goldenberg &amp; Goldenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175612449173">Miller, Epstein, Bishop, &amp; Keitner, 1985</xref>). Although this concept is fundamentally important for the well-being of a family and is often used to evaluate family interactions for clinical decision making and interventions, the literature lacks recent analysis and empirical validation of various family functioning assessment tools (e.g., Self-Report Family Inventory [SFI]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612449173">Beavers et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175612449173">Goldenberg &amp; Goldenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175612449173">Hood &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175612449173">Hood and Johnson (2007)</xref> asserted that many of the interpersonal relationship inventories, such as the SFI, should be considered experimental and are primarily used in research studies.</p>

<title>Extant Research on Family Functioning</title>
<p>Multiple measures were created that examine family functioning (e.g., Family Assessment Device, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175612449173">Epstein et al., 1983</xref>; Family Assessment Measure III [FAM-III], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748175612449173">Skinner, Steinhauer, &amp; Santa-Barbara, n.d</xref>.), and a considerable amount of research was conducted examining the commonalities and differences between each of these assessment tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748175612449173">Hampson, Hulgus, &amp; Beavers, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175612449173">Tutty, 1995</xref>). Typically, self-reports and observational methods are used as a means of collecting data regarding how families function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748175612449173">Hampson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175612449173">Hood &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>). Self-reports are more common; however, some researchers have questioned the validity of such reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175612449173">Goldenberg &amp; Goldenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175612449173">Tutty, 1995</xref>). One self-report commonly used in family therapy is the SFI, based on the Beavers System Model.</p>
<p>The Beavers Systems Model offers a cross-sectional perspective on family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 2000</xref>). The two main variables that this scale measures are family competence and family style; family competence is conceptualized as falling along one dimension, and family style is viewed as falling along a second orthogonal dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 2000</xref>). The horizontal axis represents family competence and relates to available information, adaptive flexibility, and the structure of the system, whereas the vertical axis represents family style and relates to a stylistic quality of family interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 2000</xref>). When these two dimensions are combined, nine groupings representing different types of family functioning are defined (three that are functional and six that are problematic and may require clinical intervention).</p>
<p>Within the Beavers System Model, the nine types of family functioning are based on a family’s scores on the dimensions of competence and style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 2000</xref>). Group 1 represents <italic>optimal families</italic> or the model of family functioning within the Beavers System Model. There is little conflict in these families, and when it does occur, it is resolved quickly. Family members show one another mutual respect, and negotiation and problem solving take place. Boundaries are clear, and each member is allowed to individuate.</p>
<p>Group 2 reflects <italic>adequate families</italic> or those where the parenting is effective, but less rewarding because of the control-oriented nature of the families (e.g., conflict resolution through direct force or intimidation). Members typically display conventional/traditional gender roles, and there is less intimacy and trust in these families. Groups 3, 4, and 5 are families described in the <italic>mid-range</italic>, which are considered by Beavers to be functional, but vulnerable; this is especially true of the children within these families. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers and Hampson (2000)</xref> stated that family members in these groups are susceptible to psychological problems. Power and control issues persist in these families, and projections about other family members frequently occur. These types of families allow favorite children to emerge, as well as scapegoats. Groups 6 and 7 are classified as <italic>borderline families</italic>, and they demonstrate “chaotic power struggles” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 2000</xref>), with different family members rotating in attempts to establish dominance. Very often, family members are unable to meet their own, or one another’s, emotional needs. Beavers and Hampson noted the difference between these families and other groups is that they did not demonstrate the stability of the system that more control-oriented families have, but are not as dysfunctional as families in Groups 8 and 9. Finally, Beavers and Hampson classified Groups 8 and 9 as <italic>severely dysfunctional families</italic> that typically lack in communication, thus lacking shared focus and demonstrating emotional distance between family members. Families in Groups 8 and 9 typically appear chaotic, as power/control is typically covert as opposed to the more overt use of power/control in healthier families.</p>

<title>The Self-Report Family Inventory</title>
<p>The SFI assesses competency in families by measuring the following five domains: <italic>Health</italic>/<italic>Competence, Conflict, Cohesion, Leadership</italic>, and <italic>Emotional Expressiveness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 2000</xref>). The 36-item self-report instrument should be completed by family members of 11 years of age or older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612449173">Beavers et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175612449173">Tutty, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612449173">Beavers et al. (1985)</xref> developed the SFI to address the need for a self-report component that would complement the Beavers observational rating scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612449173">Beavers et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175612449173">Tutty, 1995</xref>). The Beavers observational rating scales were the original method used to measure the constructs associated with the Beavers Systems Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Health/Competence subscale</italic> includes 19 items involving family affect, parental coalitions, problem-solving abilities, autonomy and individuality, optimistic versus pessimistic views, and acceptance of family members. The <italic>Conflict subscale</italic> includes 12 items involving overt versus covert conflict (e.g., arguing, blaming, fighting openly). The <italic>Cohesion subscale</italic> includes five items that focus on aspects associated with family togetherness (e.g., spending time together) and satisfaction received from inside the family versus outside the family. The <italic>Leadership subscale</italic> includes three items involving parental leadership (e.g., directiveness, degree of control). Last, the <italic>Emotional Expressiveness subscale</italic> includes six items dealing with expressions (verbal and nonverbal) of warmth, caring, and closeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 2000</xref>). A Likert-type scale is used to answer all items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175612449173">Tutty, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Heterosexual Parents of Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual Children</title>
<p>One population understudied in the family systems research is heterosexual parents with lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sons or daughters. Although disclosure often occurs within family systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175612449173">Boxer, Cook, &amp; Herdt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748175612449173">Cramer &amp; Roach, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748175612449173">Goodrich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748175612449173">Merighi &amp; Grimes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748175612449173">Savin-Williams, 2001</xref>) and coming out to one’s family is a marker of many identity development models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175612449173">Cass, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748175612449173">D’Augelli, 1994</xref>), little attention has been paid to the family’s experience. The extant studies that were completed were predominately qualitative, with only a few quantitative examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748175612449173">Savin-Williams &amp; Dube, 1998</xref>). Little is known about the dynamics of households with LGB members, such as if they are similar to or different from households with heterosexual sons or daughters. Even though parents’ experiences were not fully explored within the existing research, this does not reflect the lack of importance of this milestone. Instead, authors argued both conceptually and empirically for the significance of this event within the life of an LGB son or daughter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175612449173">Elizur &amp; Ziv, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175612449173">Floyd &amp; Stein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748175612449173">Phillips, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748175612449173">Savin-Williams, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>For this study, due to the absence of this population within the family systems literature, we chose to explore the experiences of heterosexual parents with LGB sons or daughters. Identity theorists showed that there are differences between bisexual identity and lesbian and gay identities, and scholars recognized a similar identity development process for these individuals. Theorists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748175612449173">D’Augelli (1994)</xref> combined the three identities when describing the coming out process for these individuals, and his theory was widely adapted in the counseling and education literatures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748175612449173">Evans, Forney, Guido, Patton, &amp; Renn, 2009</xref>). This idea of a similar identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons was based on the assumption that each of the LGB identities falls within the sexual orientation/identity continuum versus gender and other identities. Several studies exploring the experiences of parents and families after disclosure also combined these three identities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175612449173">Coolhart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748175612449173">Goldfried &amp; Goldfried, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748175612449173">Goodrich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748175612449173">Goodrich &amp; Gilbride, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748175612449173">Matthews &amp; Lease, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748175612449173">Park, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748175612449173">Reynolds &amp; Hanjogiris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0748175612449173">Stone Fish &amp; Harvey, 2005</xref>), further bolstering the rationale for the current study. An assumption of this study is that more successful transitions in families following the disclosure experiences lead to greater family functioning; a relationship has been demonstrated in emerging literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748175612449173">Goodrich &amp; Gilbride, 2010</xref>). Without established measures to evaluate these relationships with LGB families, researchers would not be able to adequately understand and evaluate family systems similarities or differences of families that have an LGB member. As such, we wished to examine the value of this instrument with families that include LGB members for better understanding and evaluating the family dynamics in this unique situation.</p>

<title>Purpose Statement</title>
<p>In this study, we explored the factor structure of the SFI with a population not previously normed: heterosexual parents with an LGB son or daughter. As few empirical studies have explored the factor structure of the SFI since norming by its creators, we were interested whether a similar factor structure would be found with a different population. The research question is as follows.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants in this study were recruited as part of a different project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748175612449173">Goodrich &amp; Gilbride, 2010</xref>) to understand family functioning after a child’s disclosure as LGB. As such, all study participants identified as heterosexual parents with LGB-identified sons or daughters. For the purposes of this research, parents were defined as individuals who viewed themselves as a father or a mother of an LGB son or daughter, either based on biology, legal adoption, foster or guardianship, or step relationship. The criterion for selection of parents in this study specified that parents must have had an awareness that their son or daughter identified as LGB, as opposed to “assuming” or “wondering” about their child’s sexual/affectional orientation. Parents of transgender or intersex children were not surveyed as part of the project, as the primary researcher was unsure if parents of transgender or intersex persons underwent a similar process to those parents of LGB sons or daughters, as these identities reflect gender identity and not sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Of the 440 parents in the final sample, 330 parents (75%) identified as female and 84 parents (19%) identified as male; 26 participants (6%) chose not to disclose their gender. Participants ranged in age from 35 to 88 years of age, with a mean of 60 years and standard deviation of 9.47. A large majority of participants identified as Caucasian/White (428, 97%), with three participants (0.7%) identifying as Latino/Hispanic, one (0.2%) as Asian American, one (0.2%) as Biracial, four (1%) as Multiethnic, and three (0.7%) as Other.

<title>Participant screening</title>
<p>A total of 687 respondents received and clicked to the first page of the web survey. Two of those respondents were removed as it was apparent by their answers (i.e., participant’s age, answers about “parenting relationship”) that they were not heterosexual parents of LGB children, but instead the identified LGB child. Of the remaining 685 respondents, 450 parents completed the full survey for a completion rate of 65.7%. After screening the data for normality and outliers, 10 responses were discarded. The analyses and interpretation that follows reflects the responses of the 440 subjects retained in the final data set.</p>

<sec id="section8-0748175612449173">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>For this study we used purposive sampling, recruiting participants from a variety of sources. The first set of parents recruited were members of support organizations aimed at parents and friends of LGB persons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748175612449173">Parents, Family, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays [PFLAG], 2011</xref>) and LGBT community and youth centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175612449173">Consortium of Higher Education LGBT Resource Professionals, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748175612449173">Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues, 2011</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://theGLBT.com">theGLBT.com</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748175612449173">2011</xref>). As previous scholarship had shown an underidentification of parents of color within LGB research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748175612449173">Hom, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748175612449173">Merighi &amp; Grimes, 2000</xref>), the primary researcher also contacted organizations that had a specific focus on multicultural LGBT issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748175612449173">Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues, 2011</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://theGLBT.com">theGLBT.com</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748175612449173">2011</xref>). These support groups and organizations were asked to share the study information widely, including on listservs and during programs, and LGB individuals seeing the call for participants were asked to send the survey to their parents.</p>
<p>The next sample was from the nonaffiliated/disidentified population. This population is defined as those individuals who do not identify or believe in homosexuality and actively work to change sexual orientation in cases where people may have those “leanings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748175612449173">Exodus International, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748175612449173">Focus on the Family, 2011</xref>). These groups were contacted to increase the variability of scores on the study’s instruments, as the researchers were concerned the study could be restricted due to its self-report nature. Finally, members of religious/spiritual organizations were sampled to again move beyond the support groups that are the usual basis of LGB parent research and to potentially increase variability in the sample and generalizability beyond groups such as PFLAG. Religious groups were identified from their national websites, and religious organizations with LGBT-specific groups were found from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175612449173">Sister Friends Together (2011)</xref> webpage. Finally, snowball sampling was employed, where participants were asked to forward the survey to other parents who might meet the criteria for participation, including the other parent(s) of the identified child.</p>

<p>The SFI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612449173">Beavers &amp; Hampson, 2000</xref>) is a 36-item instrument based on the Beavers–Timberlawn Model of Family Competence. As previously noted, the purpose behind this instrument is to distinguish competent from less competent families. The authors of the SFI identified five subscales: <italic>Health</italic>/<italic>Competence, Conflict, Cohesion, Leadership</italic>, and <italic>Emotional Expressiveness</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section11-0748175612449173">
<title>Factor structure</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748175612449173">Hampson, Beavers, and Hulgus (1989)</xref> state that “the factor structure of the SFI has been achieved through serial factor analyses across previous standardization groups of clinic and nonclinical families” (p. 126). This analysis was based on the current 36 items of the SFI plus an additional 7 items not retained in the present version. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612449173">Beavers et al. (1985)</xref>, after retaining only those items with factor loadings of .35 or above, report a four-factor solution with factors of <italic>Health</italic> (33 items), <italic>Expressiveness</italic> (5 items), <italic>Leadership</italic> (2 items), and <italic>Style</italic> (3 items). However, based on the 36 items of the SFI used in the present analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748175612449173">Hampson, Beavers, and Hulgus (1989)</xref> state that there are six factors: <italic>Family Health</italic> (19 items), <italic>Conflict Resolution</italic> (12 items), <italic>Communication</italic> (4 items), <italic>Cohesion</italic> (5 items), <italic>Leadership</italic> (3 items), and <italic>Emotional Expression</italic> (5 items), but do not report the factor analysis used to make this determination. Based on the items per factor, it is clear that individual items can be used to calculate more than one factor score. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748175612449173">Shek (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748175612449173">2001</xref>), in validation studies of a Chinese version of the SFI, noted that there is lack of clarity regarding the factor structure of the original SFI. First, the number of factors reported for the measure is inconsistent, ranging from four to six depending on the report. Second, the factor structure is complex because some items are used to compute more than one subscale and other items do not load on any subscale. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748175612449173">Shek (1998)</xref> wrote that apart from the analyses reported in the manual, the published results from the factor analyses of the SFI do not include sufficient detail for the reader to know how the factor analysis was carried out. In contrast to results of the English version of the SFI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748175612449173">Shek (2001</xref>; using a principal components analysis with a Varimax rotation and inspecting a scree plot to choose the number of factors) identified only two meaningful factors: <italic>Positive Family Behavior</italic> and <italic>Negative Family Behavior</italic>.</p>

<title>Reliability and validity</title>
<p>The SFI reported internal consistency with Cronbach’s α of .86 for a large sample of college students and .78 in a smaller study using a similar population of college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612449173">Beavers et al., 1985</xref>). Support for criterion validity evidence is based on reports that the subscales of the SFI correlated with subscales of other similar measures, including FACES-II and FACES-III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748175612449173">Hampson et al., 1991</xref>), the Bloom Family Functioning Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612449173">Beavers et al., 1985</xref>), and McMaster Model Family Assessment Device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175612449173">Miller et al., 1985</xref>), as well as the ratings of 71 clinical family samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748175612449173">Beavers, Hampson, &amp; Hulgus, 1990</xref>). Results from these studies showed statistically significant relationships between the Cohesion and Adaptability factors of the FACES-II and FACES-III and the SFI factors of <italic>Health/Competence, Conflict, Cohesion, Leadership</italic>, and <italic>Emotional Expressiveness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612449173">Beavers et al., 1985</xref>). Additionally, differences in the average SFI scores are statistically significant across the healthiest, middle, and least healthy families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748175612449173">Hampson, Hulgus, &amp; Beavers, 1991</xref>). Scores on all the subscales of the SFI significantly correlated with observer ratings of family style and competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748175612449173">Hampson, Beavers, &amp; Hulgus, 1989</xref>). Additionally, the subscale of <italic>Cohesion</italic> is positively correlated and the subscale of <italic>Conflict</italic> is negatively correlated with the FACES-II subscales of cohesion and adaptability in clinical families. The SFI subscales of <italic>Cohesion</italic> and <italic>Leadership</italic> are also positively correlated and <italic>Conflict</italic> is negatively correlated with the same FACES-II subscales in nonclinical families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748175612449173">Hampson et al., 1989</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>To examine the factor structure of the items from the SFI, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using principal axis factoring followed by an oblique rotation (Promax with Kaiser Normalization) that allowed family functioning factors to correlate. Following the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748175612449173">Preacher and MacCallum (2003)</xref>, multiple criteria were used to determine the number of factors to retain. We used two methods: visual inspection of the scree plot and results from a parallel analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748175612449173">Horn, 1965</xref>). For all tested solutions, visual inspection of the item content for each factor was used to ensure extracted factors were meaningful. SPSS Version 19 was used for all analyses, with SPSS macros provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748175612449173">O’Connor (2000)</xref> used for the parallel analysis.</p>
<p>To interpret factors derived from the EFAs, we identified items with factor loadings greater than .3 as loading on a factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748175612449173">Floyd &amp; Widaman, 1995</xref>). To simplify interpretations and reduce ambiguity in the correspondence between items and factors, only those items that clearly loaded on one of the derived factors were retained. We operationalized these criteria by only retaining items on a factor if the loading was greater than or equal to .3 and the loading for the factor was at least .15 units greater than the next highest loading.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The black line with triangle markers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748175612449173">Figure 1</xref> shows the scree plot from the EFA of the 36 items of the SFI. The plot shows steep declines until after the third factor offering support for either three or four factors. The grey line with square markers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748175612449173">Figure 1</xref> shows the results of the parallel analysis. The logic of the parallel analysis is to simulate random data with the same number of cases and variables as the observed data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748175612449173">Horn, 1965</xref>). The eigenvalues for the random data provide a benchmark showing what values may result when no factors are present. The number of eigenvalues in the observed data that exceed the corresponding eigenvalues in the simulated data is taken as the number of factors to retain. In this instance, three of the eigenvalues from the observed data exceeded those from the simulated data.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748175612449173">Table 1</xref> shows the three-factor solution. In this solution, the first factor accounted for 31.64% of the variance, the second for 6.54%, and the third for 3.18%. Bolded factor loadings indicate the item loaded on the factor in that column at .3 or greater and did not load on another factor with a similar weight. Items depicting negative aspects of family functioning represent the first factor. Example items include SFI 25, “When things go wrong, we blame each other,” and SFI 31, “We argue a lot.” Items indicating positive aspects of family functioning represent the second factor. Sample items for the second factor include SFI 2, “Our family would rather do things together than with other people,” and SFI 15, “Our happiest times are at home.” Finally, only two items met our criteria for loading on the third factor. These items are SFI 11, “We speak our minds, no matter what,” and SFI 26, “We say what we think and feel.” Factors 1 and 2 are correlated at <italic>r</italic> = −.68; Factors 1 and 3 at <italic>r</italic> = −.52, and Factors 2 and 3 at <italic>r</italic> = .70.</p>

<p>The three-factor solution is better based on evidence from the parallel analysis and scree plot; however, we believe the third factor has too few items and is too specific in content. For this reason, we prefer the two-factor solution. The content of these two factors is broad in scope and less specific than the content in the factor solution proposed by the authors of the scale, but the two factors are clear in meaning and evidence for more than three factors was not found.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the factor structure of the SFI with a sample of heterosexual parents with an LGB son or daughter. Our findings did not support the instrument authors’ five-factor solution for the inventory. Despite the fact that we used factor analysis rather than principal components analysis and allowed factors to correlate (Promax rotation) rather than forcing them to be orthogonal (Varimax rotation), our results contribute to the evidence in favor of a two-factor solution for this inventory across diverse samples of families, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748175612449173">Shek’s (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748175612449173">2001</xref>) findings. As such, we recommend the use of a two-factor model consisting of positive and negative aspects of family functioning. Future clinicians and researchers wishing to use this inventory should consider this when working with families.</p>
<sec id="section16-0748175612449173">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The first limitation of this study is the mixed results from data that suggested different factor solutions for this inventory. The results of the scree plot and parallel analysis suggested three factors. After considering the factor loadings found in the three- and two-factor solutions, we determined that the factors from the two-factor model were more meaningful and the third factor from the three-factor solution was not sufficiently represented with only two items. This two-factor solution is consistent with some analyses of the SFI (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748175612449173">Shek, 1998</xref>); however, the possibility of a third factor should be considered by future researchers interested in the factor structure of this inventory.</p>
<p>A second potential limitation is the study’s sample: the respondents were predominately White, well-educated, middle-aged, middle- to upper-middle class, suburban, biological mothers, who identified as liberal (for more information about the sample, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748175612449173">Goodrich &amp; Gilbride, 2010</xref>). As such, the results of this study might not generalize to the broader population of parents or parents of LGB persons. The fact that our results are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748175612449173">Shek’s (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748175612449173">2001</xref>) findings using a Chinese version of the SFI with a sample of parents and adolescents provides evidence that these results may apply to diverse families beyond those in the current sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0748175612449173">
<title>Implications for the Counseling Profession</title>
<p>The results of the current study suggest that professional counselors could use the SFI when working with families with LGB sons or daughters to assist in setting therapeutic goals for the family system (e.g., family functioning post disclosure). Counselors working with parents or families with LGB sons or daughters could use this inventory at the start of the therapeutic relationship (i.e., during the intake process) to assess the family’s baseline functioning. During the follow-up session, the counselor might interview the family to understand how this baseline functioning looks within the particular family system. Counselors can then identify the positive and negative aspects of the family’s functioning based on their clients’ responses to the inventory and how this might be understood through family stories related to the disclosure and other family interactions. This could assist the clinician in determining how to build on current family strengths, as well as identify areas for growth.</p>
<p>The inventory could be repeated at points in the therapeutic process to “check-in” on progress within the family system. A counselor may offer clients the SFI for use at home so that the family might monitor their own behaviors and responses to understand how well they are improving as a system. Finally, this inventory could be used as a quantitative measure, in conjunction with family’s qualitative self-report, to assess therapeutic outcomes at the end of the counseling relationship and to construct recommendations for the family’s future work together. In doing so, the focus should be on areas identified for growth within the family system, the creation of “homework” to target future behavior as a family system, and community-based resources that the family could use outside of therapy.</p>

<title>Research Implications</title>
<p>As few studies have empirically explored the SFI, future studies on this instrument are warranted. At this time, only two sets of authors beyond the instrument’s creators have explored the psychometric behavior of this inventory. These most recent authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748175612449173">Shek, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748175612449173">2001</xref>; the current study) have challenged the proposed factor structure of the SFI with historically and culturally nondominant families. As such, researchers interested in using the SFI should explore the two-factor solution with other populations (e.g., different racial/ethnic groups, family makeup, socioeconomic statuses, geographic locations) to understand if the two-factor solution is consistent with other groups.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is important for researchers to further validate this inventory with a confirmatory factor analysis and/or a convergent validity study to ensure that the instrument measures what it purports to measure. Convergent validity could be completed with other family assessment devices such as the General Family Functioning subscale of the Family Assessment Device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175612449173">Epstein et al., 1983</xref>) or the Family Assessment Measure III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748175612449173">Skinner et al., n.d</xref>.), among others. Finally, each of the extant studies of the SFI explored family behavior at one single time in the family’s life. Evidence of the psychometric behavior of the SFI over time is required to support its use as a strong measure of change in family functioning. As such, we propose that future researchers also engage in longitudinal studies using the SFI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0748175612449173">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Overall, the results support a two-factor solution representing positive and negative aspects of family functioning as the preferred solution for the SFI. The SFI provides a host of information relating to both positive and negative functioning within families. As families become increasingly diverse (e.g., families headed by same-sex parents with a son or daughter who identifies as heterosexual) and new therapeutic issues emerge within families (e.g., disclosure of sexual orientation), counselors can use self-report instruments such as the SFI to aid in assisting families to increased levels of functioning.</p>
