<p>How many of us read edited volumes cover to cover, particularly when they are multidisciplinary? In all honesty, it is only because I was asked to review Karen Cook, Margaret Levi, and Russell Hardin’s recent edited volume, <italic>Whom Can We Trust?</italic>, that I read it in its entirety. If I had picked it up as background for my own research or to peruse current research in my area, I probably would have chosen a few of the chapters, likely by fellow sociologists, to read. While my assessment of the volume would still have been positive based on more limited exposure, I would have missed out on the volume’s primary strength: its tremendous diversity.</p>
<p>The Russell Sage Foundation’s series on trust was created with the express intent of generating an interdisciplinary dialogue on trust and trustworthiness. This collection delivers on this objective. That said, to truly appreciate the breadth that the volume offers, readers will need to step outside of their disciplinary boundaries, methodological preferences, and cultural and contextual comfort zones and read widely among the contributions. Despite the best of intentions, the interdisciplinary nature of the collection is largely represented between, and not within, chapters.</p>
<p>The editors do a wonderful job setting the stage for the cross-disciplinary exploration of trust and trustworthiness in the introduction. They highlight the rich history of trust and its multidisciplinary roots and set forth the current collection’s thesis: social scientists and policy-makers must step back from touting the virtues of trust and try to better understand the sources and corollaries of such trust and trust’s implications across social contexts. Cook, Levi, and Hardin are pushing social scientists, who “have become obsessed with trust” (Matthew Cleary and Susan Stokes, p. 308), to strive for a more nuanced understanding of their obsession. To facilitate this, and to bridge disciplinary divides, they organize the volume into three parts, progressing from micro- to macro-level concerns.</p>
<p>Part I, “Social Relations, Groups, and Trust,” draws on data from both laboratory and field experiments to explore not only who we might trust more (e.g., members of our in-group, actors situated in central network positions), but why we think of them as worthy of our trust. While this entire section is strong, I found the chapter by Margaret Foddy and Toshio Yamagishi the most remarkable. Using a series of laboratory experiments, the authors demonstrate that assumptions of in-group members’ trustworthiness compared to out-group members’ are not simply based on group stereotyping (a widely held belief) but instead stem from expectations of within-group exchange patterns. The next two chapters use data from field-experiments conducted in Africa to suggest other norm-based mechanisms for increased trust and cooperation among coethnics (James Habyarimana et al.) and network brokers (Abigail Barr et al.). A review of experimental research on trust and cooperation concludes Part I, with James Walker and Elinor Ostrom calling for future research and policy to consider the importance of knowledge of intentions, like those the earlier chapters demonstrated are derived from social groups or network positions, to “increase trust and reciprocity and achieve greater cooperation” (p. 118).</p>
<p>Part II is the most novel of the three. It moves beyond individuals as it explores “Networks, Organizations, and Trust,” capturing context in a way that is appealing to those interested in trust at any level of analysis. This is the shortest of the three sections and perhaps fittingly, Henry Farrell’s theoretical chapter that leads it off laments the dearth (and highlights the importance) of mid-level theories on trust. The two empirical chapters in this section take different approaches to the mid-level analysis of trust, but both focus on the embedded nature of trust. Irena Stepanikova and her colleagues draw on qualitative interviews with physicians to gauge the effect of managed care on both levels of trust and efforts at fostering trust in their relationships with patients. Robert Sampson and Corina Graif note the enduring influence of neighborhoods on trust and collective efficacy among residents and the potential of strong networks of community leaders to counteract these lasting effects.</p>
<p>The final section, Part III, is on “Institutions and Trust.” The first two articles therein explore credit markets; Bruce Carruthers lays out ten factors that influence trust among creditors and debtors (from individual character to networks to overall monetary environment) and Philip Hoffman and his collaborators use historical data to track the relationship between social capital and trust in French financial markets. Gabriella Montinola’s research on trust in courts in a developing democracy (the Philippines) stood out as the book’s contribution with the most clear policy implications <italic>and</italic> suggestions, but Cleary and Stokes’ final chapter ultimately stole the show, pushing social scientists on causal assumptions (i.e., considering whether trust is a cause or a consequence of experience, and current research’s focus on trust as a cause rather than a symptom), methods and measures, and the overwhelming belief that trust is good, if not necessary, and should be sought. An argument for a healthy skepticism toward institutions, and toward research on trust itself, is an invigorating way to close a volume titled “Whom Can We Trust?”</p>
<p>With contributions from sociologists, economists, political scientists, psychologists, and others, this collection illustrates the expansive hold that trust has taken across social science disciplines. It accomplishes the main goal the authors set forth, to add nuance to our understanding of trust and to consider the contextual nature of both trust and trustworthiness. It also highlights the need for more interdisciplinarity in research. While there is a bit of cross-disciplinary dialogue in this volume, there could be more, and there certainly should be in future research. Cook, Levi, and Hardin paved the way for such endeavors. The organization, careful introduction, and insightful contributions of this book demonstrate how conscientiously the editors crafted the volume. However, the editors make it clear that the volume is not meant to answer all our questions about trust, but to push us to ask new ones. The best way to do that and to move research on trust forward and in fruitful directions is to step outside of boundaries. Where can we start? Consider reading more multidisciplinary edited volumes, and read them in their entirety.</p>
